15-12-2020||News||India is right to bet on a post-Brexit UK||India recently invited the United Kingdom (UK)’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson as chief guest for Republic Day 2021. Johnson, on Tuesday, officially accepted the invitation, and UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab’s ongoing visit to New Delhi is meant to set the agenda. The visit will take place less than a month after the UK leaves the European Union — with or without a deal. The timing and occasion of the visit signals intent on both sides to develop a genuine partnership.For decades, India-UK relations remained suboptimal. This was because neither side was invested in truly understanding what the other valued. In India, London’s motivations were — incorrectly — viewed as a former colonial power’s desire to weigh in on regional issues such as Kashmir and the Afghan war by tilting towards Pakistan. This sense of grievance turned into disconnect when London scrapped the post-study work permit for international students. The move led to a sharp drop in Indian student numbers between 2013-17, even as Chinese student numbers swelled based on special visa arrangements. This trend is now reversing as the post-study work permit has been reintroduced.The disconnect was apparent when the UK was pilloried in the Indian media for not countering China’s move to make Kashmir a formal agenda item at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) after the effective nullification of Article 370. That London had shot down the proposal along with France, Russia, and the United States (US), was lost in translation.In London, New Delhi’s lack of appreciation for the UK’s security concerns about troops in Afghanistan and radicalisation at home — both of which necessitate a security partnership with Pakistan — remained an irritant. India’s 2012 decision to purchase the French Dassault Rafale over the UK’s Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet increased the estrangement.In this context, Brexit became both a reason and an excuse to remain distant as high-level exchanges plummeted. London became busy in its domestic political turmoil and bureaucratic transitions. But whenever it did express interest to augment the relationship, New Delhi refused citing Brexit-related uncertainties.Johnson’s visit offers an opportunity for a reset.Though difficult to achieve in the short-term, both countries have an incentive to explore the viability of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). For long, India has shied away given London’s emphasis on easy capital flows to and from India, which would hit Indian producers and retailers hard, without entertaining India’s reciprocal demand for liberal labour flows. In the face of a strong anti-immigrant public undercurrent (even if centered on migration from the EU), London has been cagey on the issue of labour flows. But, with their economies under stress due to the pandemic and bad policymaking, both sides are likely to revisit such conditions.New Delhi’s decision to stay out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and the ongoing farmers’ protest, will concentrate minds on how to better capitalise on British, and European, economic overtures. The economic contraction this year has raised strategic alarm in New Delhi, ie. India risks reduction in its global geopolitical weight due to reduced economic capabilities. Undoubtedly, FTAs with strategically aligned powers are not panacea for India’s ailing economy. But they offer an alternative as India seeks to reduce economic linkages with China.In addition to economic incentives, London’s sharp downturn in relations with Beijing since the introduction of the draconian national security law in Hong Kong imparts strategic synergy to India-UK relations. The UK’s Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development, and Foreign Policy 2021 has indicated that London must tilt towards the Indo-Pacific. The aim is to augment the UK’s presence in the Indian Ocean Region and work with powers such as India, Japan, and Australia, along with the EU and the US, to counter China.To this effect, the India-UK Defence Logistics Pact will work as a lubricant in advancing dialogue on other issues. True, India has such pacts with other countries including France and the US, and it remains unclear under what conditions and to what extent India can militarily capitalise on British bases. But, given where these two countries stood just a few years ago, this is a step forward.Collaboration in sectors such as digital technology, the climate crisis, and vaccine development will also see a fillip. India remains a top global exporter of raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry and will play an important role in the mass production of the Covid-19 vaccine. Under intense pressure to avoid another lockdown, having approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and in agreement with India to develop the Oxford vaccine that is yet to be approved, Johnson has a critical interest in ensuring India’s partnership.Finally, there has been a shift away from making this relationship hostage to the “Pakistan question”. In a show of political force — and perhaps interference — the Bharatiya Janata Party’s affiliates in the UK canvassed for Johnson in 2019 elections. By targeting the Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour Party as pro-Pakistan (given Corbyn’s criticism of India on Kashmir), these affiliates succeeded in swaying certain sections of the Indian diaspora away from Labour. It is no surprise that Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader, distanced himself from Corbyn’s position, and is working hard to reclaim Labour’s standing among the Indian diaspora.There are miles to go before this partnership realises its true potential, but it is set to become “poll-proof” as India bets on a post-Brexit UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-is-right-to-bet-on-a-post-brexit-uk/story-UVjFx8pwqSMQw812gBPwLP.html
15-12-2020||News||Pollution: Why every one per cent counts, writes Sunita Narain||Now that the stubble-burning period is over, but air is still polluted and toxic over vast parts of the country, we need to talk about what needs to be done.Three kinds of actions are essential — steps against episodic pollution events like stubble-burning; steps against local sources of pollution, which aggravate the problem; and more transformational action that will bring long-term benefits. All three levels of pollution management are critical. And all sources of pollution need to be addressed.I say this because all contributors to pollution say that they are only one per cent of the problem. So if steps are taken to control diesel from vehicles, car owners will say they are one per cent; when power plants are asked to clean up or shut down, they say they are one per cent. Or when industry is told that the coal that they burn is contributing to the toxic air in the region, they will cry foul and say, what about action against garbage-burning? So, the net result is to point fingers at some other source, away from the action that needs to be taken. This is also the favourite ploy of governments — Centre to state, agency to agency. Pass the buck and make the problem go away.But it won’t. Every winter, we will continue to choke and hurt. Every winter, when the weather turns adverse and pollutants settle close to the ground, even the steps taken in the past few years to reduce pollution will get negated. This is because the sources of pollution will continue to grow — the vehicles on the road will increase; they will get older with each passing year and so more polluting; the numbers of industries will increase.Let us deal with each source. The first is episodic stubble-burning, which starts around October 15, when winter is settling in and the wind turns to bring pollutants from fires to cities of the region, including Delhi. Steps are needed from now till next October to ensure that machines for stubble management are available in every village; that small and marginal farmers get free access to these and that farmers have evidence of the benefits to turn the crop residue back into the land and not to burn it. In addition, there are exciting efforts underway to use the stubble to make compressed natural gas or for power generation. These need to be tracked, prodded, pushed and implemented. What is needed is deliberate steps and careful monitoring — month after month. What is also clear is that post this stubble-fire period, the quality of air in Delhi and the surrounding region remains foul. It ranges between very poor and severe, depending on what meteorologists call the ventilation index — which determines dispersion of pollutants — and wind speed. According to the National air quality index (AQI), exposure to “poor” levels of air is unhealthy and gets more severe as exposure is prolonged and air quality deteriorates into very unhealthy and hazardous.To fix this, in the short-term, each pollution hotspot needs to be managed. Currently, there are some 13 hotspots in the region — identified as those with the highest air pollution levels. The sources of pollution here include construction and road dust, garbage-burning in vacant areas, and industries that spew pollutants from their stacks or congestion points for traffic. The source of pollution here is local. Action has to be taken through local agencies. And it has to be systemic. The reason is that garbage removed one day; or a road paved one day, is then filled again with waste or dug up again. This is where we need maximum governance for maximum gain.But all this will not be enough — it will be like putting out small fires in a blazing forest. We need action at speed and scale. The key is to tackle the problem of coal-burning in the region — in power plants and in literally thousands of industrial units scattered across the legal and illegal parts of Delhi and the region. Delhi’s ban on the use of coal is good. But industries have then moved either to illegal and unauthorised areas in the city or to surrounding states. Here they continue to use coal, for it is the cheapest fuel, as against natural gas, which is doubly and triply taxed so it is unaffordable.We need a second gas revolution in the region — compressed natural gas (CNG) for vehicles brought us the first-generation change. We now need a fuel-switch in all sources for clean air. This includes using clean electricity for powering industry and vehicles. But remember, if the power plant is dirty, then electric vehicles will only mean that we shift the problem from us to them. The airshed is one, so the pollutants will come back to our lungs.This is why air pollution is a great equaliser, and we are all in it together. Every one per cent counts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/pollution-why-every-one-per-cent-counts-writes-sunita-narain/story-kPYxgWkBuT89SpLz1sTU3I.html
15-12-2020||News||Away from the noise, voters continue to repose faith in the BJP, writes Prakash Javadekar||We live in interesting times. The political Opposition in India, which has faced repeated electoral setbacks over the last six years, is sensing an opportunity in the wake of the ongoing farmers’ protests in parts of North India. The leaders of the protest are seeking a withdrawal of the agriculture bills that were discussed and passed in Parliament. Over the last few days, the protests have taken an ugly personal turn, with some people demanding the head of the Prime Minister (PM).In the midst of these protests, what is India’s political barometer saying? Four results, each in a different part of India, give a glimpse of the mood on the ground.First, let us go to Hyderabad, India’s high-tech city. Sometime in mid-November, the Telangana government, in a bid to stun the Opposition, declared December 1 as the date of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections. The ploy was clear; catch the Opposition — the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — unprepared and win the polls. The campaign was brief but high-pitched. But the results stunned commentators and promises to change the direction of Telangana politics. The BJP, which had four seats in the 2015-2016 round of polls, climbed up to a record 48. Unlike last time, when BJP and Telugu Desam Party fought the polls together, the BJP went alone this time. Telangana Rashtra Samithi’s tally crashed from 99 to 56. The BJP’s vote share also shot up, winning the support of the poor, middle class and all those affected by the apathy of the state government in the wake of the floods.This win is noteworthy because the BJP was never a force in Telangana. As late as 2018, the principal opposition was Congress. This, combined with the Dubbaka win, puts the BJP firmly in the race to win the assembly polls in 2023. The GHMC polls were held using paper ballots, thus not even offering the EVM excuse to cynics.If the urban expanse of Hyderabad tells a story, so does the rural landscape of Rajasthan. The Congress is firmly in the saddle here and assembly elections are still three years away. Thus, when zila parishad and panchayat samiti polls were held, the view on the ground was that the Congress would sweep. The results, again were stunning. The BJP is in control of 13 districts now and Congress has only five. Be it the regions of the state Congress chief, top ministers and even Sachin Pilot, the Congress performance is underwhelming. In the urban elections that followed too, the BJP’s fight was spirited. Those who voted in Rajasthan were broadly farmers, rural folk, and labourers. Parts of Rajasthan border the sites of the farmer protests too. Yet, the results are there for all to see.The people of Assam were waiting to share their story. The Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) voted recently and in these polls, the BJP and its ally, the United People’s Party Liberal, have won a majority, winning nine and 12 seats respectively. This election saw on-ground coordination between the Congress and All India United Democratic Front, but the voters did not bless them. The voters in the BTC polls included a significant number of tribal voters. Their faith remains unbroken in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the BJP, and Narendra Modi.Besides expanding in newer areas, in Goa, where the BJP has been in power since 2012, the party has done exceedingly well in the zila panchayat elections. The Congress is not even close to a strong showing. Goa, as we know, has a significant Christian population.From rural area to tribal areas, urban parts to cosmopolitan coastal landscapes, India is giving a message. Diverse electorates, diverse elections are giving the same message — that India’s prime issue in 2020 is development and only a Modi-led NDA can provide it. The PM’s handling of the pandemic, emphasis on economic reform, the support given to the poor have struck a chord with the voters. The Opposition, which wanted to make each of these elections a verdict on PM Modi or the farm bills have had to eat repeated helpings of humble pie. India is moving to an era where the politics of good governance and stability are scoring over manufactured agendas and vested interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/away-from-the-noise-voters-continue-to-repose-faith-in-the-bjp-writes-prakash-javadekar/story-4PRAwCwFAhwXfO4KUhFtBM.html
15-12-2020||News||The menace of social media monopolies||The United States (US) federal government and over 40 state governments in the US are seeking to break up social media giant, Facebook and its subsidiaries, WhatsApp and Instagram. The governments allege that Facebook abused its monopoly powers in stifling competition and distorting the social media industry. Of all the 187 countries that Facebook and its subsidiaries do business in, arguably, India has the most at stake resting on the outcome of this case. However, India’s problems with Facebook and its monopoly subsidiaries are not as much about the economics of free market capitalism but about a more profound issue of social order and harmony.There is an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to lynchings and deaths in India caused by rumours spread on the WhatsApp communication platform. It lists 12 cases of lynchings since 2017 in which 36 Indians have been injured or killed in social violence incited by fake messages spread through WhatsApp. It is an astonishingly dubious distinction for a seemingly innocuous technology platform to be hailed as the perpetrator of violent deaths in a society. Widely-circulated rumours and false news on WhatsApp have caused severe upheavals in Indian society over the past few years. Just as gun violence is an acknowledged abomination in the US, WhatsApp violence in India is now an acknowledged disgrace. Despite all its acclaimed benefits, WhatsApp has turned into an enormous social menace in India.In a meeting with Facebook’s global leadership team in the US in July 2018, I raised my concerns over the misuse of Facebook’s technology platforms in India and urged them to take this issue up seriously. They showed no signs of recognition of the gravity of the situation. Subsequently, in another meeting in October 2018 with the then global CEO of WhatsApp and their India leadership team, I once again raised alarm over WhatsApp’s unwitting complicity in perpetrating social unrest in India and asked them how the company proposes to address it. Facebook’s India team dismissed this concern nonchalantly and waxed eloquent about the immense benefits to Indian society from WhatsApp. The notion that no civilised society should tolerate a single death, even if it means denying benefits to thousands seemed lost on them. The enormous market power and clout that Facebook and its subsidiaries enjoy has lured the company into a false sense of self-righteousness and made them callous about the unintended deep social harm inflicted by their products.WhatsApp is a big social menace primarily because of its ubiquity. Nearly one out of every two adult Indians uses WhatsApp. WhatsApp has become hugely popular in India largely because it was free for the Indian consumer. Indians send as many free WhatsApp messages in one day as the number of text messages they send in a whole month. If WhatsApp charged a fee for every message or revealed the identity of the original sender of a widely circulated message, then perhaps WhatsApp would not be the menace that it is now. But, as the Netflix documentary Social Dilemma reminded us — “if the product is free, then you become the product”.WhatsApp is able to provide its encrypted services to billions of users for free because all its costs are borne entirely by its parent, Facebook. Facebook can pay for the enormous costs of keeping WhatsApp free because it generates a profit of the equivalent of ₹20 crore ($2.7mn) every hour from its sheer dominance and monopoly of the social media industry. So, the fountainhead of “deaths by WhatsApp” in India is Facebook’s monopolistic profits.Monopoly power of big businesses is not always only reflected in economic terms of prices and competition but also in their boorish behaviour as a dominant stakeholder in the larger society. Economists have previously justified big business monopolies if it benefits consumers through better prices and products. Twenty-two years ago, as a product manager at Microsoft, I recall receiving an email from an enraged Bill Gates to all employees about a similar proposal by the then US government to break up Microsoft as a penalty for alleged monopoly behaviour. More than 200 economists wrote a letter to then President Bill Clinton arguing how the average consumer has benefitted through better products at cheaper prices from Microsoft and hence it does not qualify as an abuse of monopoly power. By this argument, a free WhatsApp should be deified as a blessing for consumers. But we know that a free WhatsApp causes deaths in India. The economic method of measuring consumer benefit or harm through the exclusive prism of prices is shallow. It is irrefutable that WhatsApp has caused tremendous social harm to Indian consumers.Facebook’s enduring stream of global monopoly profits helped propel WhatsApp’s domination of the Indian market. If WhatsApp is split from Facebook, it will either be forced to charge for its product or look for alternative revenue streams or raise billions of dollars from new investors. None of these are easy solutions and can disrupt WhatsApp’s status quo. This could potentially break WhatsApp’s dominance in the Indian market, spurring competition for safer platforms and ending its monopoly. Which, in turn, could bode well to reduce social unrest through widely-circulated rumours on one dominant monopolistic platform.India is WhatsApp’s largest market with four times more users than its second-largest market. There is a lot riding for Indian society on the case to break up Facebook and WhatsApp. While the US is seeking to save its cherished free market capitalism, India will be looking to save lives and preserving social harmony. Breaking up Facebook could help prevent the breaking of some Indians’ faces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-menace-of-social-media-monopolies/story-2pn88bQZ6BnjXHbzqKlokO.html
15-12-2020||News||The world is changing. India needs to get its priorities right||With Covid-19, the most common phrase in every webinar on geopolitics is the “new world order”. This phrase is used to describe periods of history with dramatic change in balance of power between nation-states. In its most recent avatar, the new world order has been on the anvil since 2007. China’s hostile and rapid rise, the economic aftermath of the global financial crisis, networked politics over the internet, and most recently the pandemic, together are transforming international politics.What will this new world order look like over the next quarter century? More importantly, how can India shape this emerging order to attain peace and prosperity for all Indians? At the outset, it is important to bring conceptual clarity to the term “world order”. Instead of trying to predict the future, it is useful to conceptualise many possible orders the world might end up in. One way to do this is to visualise these orders at the intersection of major changes in geopolitics and geo-economics. Some foreseeable geopolitical trends include a unipolar United States (US)-dominated world, a co-operative US-China G2, a full-on US-China confrontation, or a multipolar world. Similarly, key geo-economic trends can be thought of along the lines of a global recession, a secular stagnation, a new economic boom, or a technological disruption. The confluence of the geopolitical and geoeconomic trends results in multiple world order scenarios. In each scenario, strategies to maximise India’s national interest can then be worked out.Geopolitically, the pandemic has accelerated the confrontation between the US and China. Geo-economics-wise, it has plunged the world into a recession phase. Taken together, this could create a “race to the bottom” world order with stable geopolitical dynamics — characterised by US-China rivalry — and dynamic geoeconomics — characterised by the emergence of many new economic webs. In this order, the US will likely see countering China as an overriding national priority. Reorienting supply chains to reduce dependence on China will be taken more seriously. Like the global economy, technological governance may splinter into multiple interacting webs with more State oversight. Global bodies such as the UN could become far less important, and regional institutions organised around powerful nation-states could gain prominence.In this world, where distrust with regard to China increases, India can be a part of multiple economic webs and gain from them. At the same time, its ability to shape the world order gets intricately linked with the economics and politics at home. With newer restrictions in global labour flows and thinned out capital flows, India will need to find a new engine of growth such as large-scale manufacturing. Returning to a higher economic growth trajectory then becomes a precondition for India’s emergence as a swing power between the US and China. Without this, India’s global role will decline, forcing it to bandwagon with other powers on less favourable terms.Some other reforms that would serve India in multiple scenarios are implementing labour and factor market reforms, becoming an attractive foreign investment destination, championing the cause of globalisation, and executing three critical military shifts — from land to sea, from the physical to the technological, and from more manpower to more firepower.What also comes up across all reform themes is the urgent need to improve the capacity of the India’s State, which is small where it really matters and overbearing in other ways that are counterproductive. Prioritising the State’s role has never been more important.Finally, we realised that there are many ways to construct world orders. More Indian perspectives about the changing world will enrich the global discourse. India’s current problems can’t be an excuse for insularity. The Arthashastra says, “Policy precedes all action.” We humbly add that policy, in turn, is preceded by an imagination of a desirable future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-world-is-changing-india-needs-to-get-its-priorities-right/story-efnmKpYckKUMegDkrUzf7M.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||Former CM Devendra Fadnavis slams Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government over opposing farm laws||Devendra Fadnavis, leader of opposition in the Assembly, on Tuesday slammed the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over opposing the Centre’s contentious farm laws. He said most provisions in the three legislations are already implemented in Maharashtra, but the ruling parties — Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress — are opposing the laws of the Centre for “politics”. Fadnavis said during the United Progress Alliance (UPA) rule at the Centre, the then Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar had approved a committee’s report that recommended encouraging participation of private players in the farm sector “The MVA government is doing politics on farm legislations brought by the Centre, as Maharashtra was the first state to implement the reforms in the agriculture marketing sector; allowed contractual farming and private APMCs. The same provisions are part of the farm laws, but the state government is opposing them,” Fadnavis said. Referring to Pawar, who has demanded the withdrawal of the laws, Fadnavis said in the former union minister in his autobiography has insisted that farmers should be allowed to sell their produce wherever they want to. “As a farmer from Baramati when you force me to sell my produce to Mumbai-based APMC then you are forcing me to spend an additional 17% to commission agents. This compulsion needs to be removed and I should be allowed to sell the produce anywhere in the state,” Fadnavis said, quoting the autobiography.The former chief minister said Singh and Pawar had formed a committee headed by the then state minister Harshwardhan Patil on March 2, 2010, to bring in the reforms. The committee, comprising ministers from other states, then submitted its report, which was also approved by the Centre.“Under the present system, the marketable surplus of one area moves out to the consumption centres through the network of middlemen and traders and institutional agencies… The regulatory provision needs to undergo change by providing a free hand to the private sector to its own operator, managing the market’s alternate marketing system with backward and forward linkages. The government may at best formulate rules of the game for the market. The role of government should be of a facilitator only,” Fadnavis said, quoting the committee’s report.The BJP leader also hit out at the MVA government over their decision to shift the Metro car shed from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg, saying it will delay the project by more than four years and will cost the state an additional expenditure of ₹5,000 crore. Objecting to the state’s decision of tweaking the original plan, Fadnavis said the decision was made even after an expenditure of ₹100 crore. He said Durga Shanker Mishra, Union secretary for ministry of housing and urban affairs, too, has written a letter to the state government expressing his concern over the decision. The opposition leader also said the Maratha community is dismayed over the stay on their quota. “The community is reeling under uncertainty and protesting across the state. Police are detaining their leaders, resisting them from protesting and this is happening for the first time. On the other hand, there is confusion among OBCs as they fear that their reservation will be affected. Government needs to clarify its stand on this,” he said.Fadnavis further said the government has been boasting about effective handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, but 35%-40% of the deaths in the country have been reported in the state. The procurement of medicines and equipment and building of Covid centres is “rattled in corruption”. “Orders were issued without tendering, a few select have benefited out of them,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/former-cm-devendra-fadnavis-slams-maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-government-over-opposing-farm-laws/story-odSNVWVpYp5X1iwUCPm4KP.html

15-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi man shot dead in Raghubir Nagar, one held||A 30-year-old man was shot dead in west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar late Monday night by four unidentified men. On Tuesday, police arrested one of the accused who was caught on CCTV camera footage allegedly dragging the body of the man before fleeing the spot after the murder. Efforts to arrest the rest and to ascertain the reason behind the murder are in progress, police said.The arrested man was identified as Deepak Shukla, a resident of Shivaji Enclave in Raghubir Nagar who worked as a local area financer. Police said they got a call late Monday night from the Guru Gobind Singh Hospital reporting that a man had been admitted with gunshot injury and pronounced dead.At the hospital, police found that the deceased, Gaurav Mahto, 30, was also a resident of the same area. During enquiry, police found an eyewitness who told them that around 8.30pm on Monday, he, Gaurav and two of their friends were partying at one of their houses in Raghubir Nagar.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said the witness told police that about half-an-hour later, four men arrived and started an argument with one of their friends. “During the argument the men also fired 2-3 gunshots in the air to scare them. Seeing this, Mahto intervened and one of them then opened fire at him. As he collapsed, the men fled the spot. One of them, later identified as Deepak Shukla, however, stopped for a while and dragged Mahto’s body out, abandoning it on the roadside,” the DCP said.During investigation, police teams checked CCTV camera footage from the area and the man who had dragged the body was identified. “He was identified and raids were conducted at his possible hideouts. We managed to zero in on him within 12 hours of the murder and he was arrested,” Purohit said.Shukla is being questioned and efforts to arrest the other men involved in the murder and to ascertain the reason behind the murder are underway, the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-man-shot-dead-in-raghubir-nagar-one-held/story-KUnCtBbTdK7R5P6EAbqsdP.html

15-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: 26 women farm labourers join stir at UP Gate||A group of 26 women from Uttar Pradesh’s Shahjahanpur, who work in the agricultural fields, have joined the farmers’ protest against the three new farm laws at Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border, where the land owning farmers who provided them employment themselves are camping for the past 20 days. The eldest among the new protesters is 80-year-old Ramkali, who, the women said, inspired them all to join the protest. “We work in the fields of the farmers who are part of this protest. The battle that our employers are fighting is our fight as well, since farming is our main occupation and we also consider ourselves farmers or children of farmers. There was no point sitting at home and waiting for farmers to protest and resolve our issues. We have come here to strengthen their agitation,” said Ramkali, sitting on mattresses spread on the road at UP Gate. Most of these women said they were debt-ridden and their only source of income -- the wages they got for working in the fields either as sharecroppers or labourers -- has been affected because their employers are protesting at Delhi’ borders. Many said they earlier owned land but had to sell it under financial duress.The 26 women were accompanied by four children, all aged between five and 12 years, and eight men. They all arrived on Sunday at the border in a tractor trolley covered with tarpaulin sheets to turn it into a makeshift home. Apart from mattresses, the women have also brought along hay to keep warm. Sitting inside the tractor with other women and eating halwa served in the langar, 58-year-old Madhuri Kushwaha, said, “My family owned a small piece of agricultural land. We sold it four years ago for my husband’s treatment. I also took ₹1 lakh loan on interest. My husband did not survive and my family now has a debt of ₹2.5 lakh. All my family members work in the fields. But no work is happening now because the landowners are protesting here. So, we came here in solidarity.” Asked how they are braving the chilling cold at the protest site, one of the women, Morkali Devi, said, “We sit around the bonfire at night. While women and children sleep inside the trolley, the men occupy the space on the road beneath the trolley. They use mattresses or plastic sheets to shield themselves from the cold.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-protest-26-women-farm-labourers-join-stir-at-up-gate/story-QV6yGowLRrMW8tmjhMsMqO.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Winter in the shadow of pandemic will be tough to weather for the homeless||Around an hour past sunset, Sonu Sharma wrapped up his paint brushes in a torn bedsheet and zipped up his thin jacket as he hurried towards a makeshift cabin in the Yamuna embankment area, connecting Nigambodh and Kudesia Ghats in north Delhi’s Kashmere Gate.The cabin – which he shares with 13 other men – has been his home for the past eight days. By the time he reached, a few men had lit a small fire in the open and were huddling around it. Among them was Sharma’s new cabin mate Dilip Dhar.These men have been forced by the biting cold to leave the pavements they usually lived on to take shelter in the cabin.Winter, this year, in the shadow of the pandemic, is going to be a tough one for the home to weather.With the mercury falling to a minimum of 4 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, hundreds of homeless have started searching for night shelters. While a few shelters have electric heaters, inhabitants mostly have to settle for a blanket and a plywood bed with a thin mattress.“We have seen people around us on the pavement frozen to death by morning. A shelter at least ensures us a chance to survive. Outside, we would probably be protected from the disease (Covid-19) but the cold will kill us,” said Mohammad Saqib, a cart puller who now lives at a shelter in south-east Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan.The “disease” fear looms large in the minds of the inhabitants who are forced to share the tiny closed space with numerous others, thereby heightening the risk of transmission. Revenue department officials said they send medical teams periodically to shelters and that no new inhabitant is assigned a space without a Covid-19 test. Those diagnosed as positive are sent to government-run care centres, the officials said.The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) has 213 shelters across the city, with a total capacity of accommodating around 18,000 people. But because of social distancing protocols, this year, the capacity has reduced to around 7,000, said a senior revenue official.The capacity is woefully inadequate, considering that unofficial estimates -- the delhi government does not have an official figure -- put the number of homeless in the capital at 150,000.Delhi government officials did not respond to requests for comment.In the winter, shelters across the city see an occupancy of around 11,000. The government plans to bridge this gap with a winter-action plan. The plan includes 250 additional tents – against 75 in 2019 and 60 in 2018. Of the 250 additional tents, 100 have already been set up in the past 10 days, spread across 22 locations, said the senior DUSIB official.“Currently the shelters and additional tents are catering to around 7,000 people at night. Also, this year, there may be lesser occupancy because a lot of people who went to their villages during the lockdown have not returned. But, in case more people come, we can increase the capacity,” the official said.However, the rate at which the homeless are seeking shelter has long surpassed the rate at which the additional tents are being set up, said Sunil Aledia, executive director of the Centre for Holistic Development, which is also one of the several NGOs entrusted with the management of shelters in the city.“Schools in the city will not open, at least till the winter ends. Then, what is stopping the government from using school buildings as shelters? Also, day-to-day delivery of several basic amenities – from electric heaters to medicines – have been affected by the fund crunch wrought by the pandemic. This winter would be a difficult one to pass,” Aledia said.Indu Prakash Singh, member of a Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee for night shelters in Delhi, said: “A review meeting of the committee is scheduled later this week on which all matters regarding shelters will be discussed. The DUSIB has ensured that the capacity issue will not be a problem. But there is a need to strengthen systems to ensure that people in need of shelters are able to get them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/winter-in-the-shadow-of-pandemic-will-be-tough-to-weather-for-the-homeless/story-obbuFtk2Qsz0FV0mxSI0AL.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Highest number of tests, second lowest positivity rate in over 200 days||The Capital conducted a record 85,105 tests for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday, as authorities continued to ramp up testing, even as the number of cases continued to decline and the positivity rate plummetted. Almost half – 42,056 – of all tests on Tuesday were conducted using the more accurate RT-PCR method, also the highest number Delhi has seen so far. Before Tuesday, the most reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests conducted in a single day in Delhi were 40,191 on December 4. Even with the record number of tests, the city saw just 1,617 new cases of Covid-19, bringing down the positivity rate to 1.90% — the second-lowest since the Delhi government started providing testing data consistently. Experts have warned that if the RT-PCR tests slacken, it could catch the Capital off guard if the outbreak begins resurging.Delhi has now added an average of 1,950 new cases of the infection over the past seven days, down from 3,247 in the week ending December 7.The positivity rate — the percentage of positive cases out of all tests conducted — is regarded by experts as a crucial metric to assess an outbreak in a community.According to recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before an outbreak is considered under control.The lowest daily positivity rate so far was recorded 254 days ago on April 6 when 1.16% of the samples were found to be positive. The average positivity rate over the past seven days has been 2.66%, down sharply from 13.58% in the second week of November when the Capital was in the throes of the third wave of infections, and daily infections consistently crossed the 7,000 mark.The city recorded 41 deaths due to the viral infection as per the daily health bulletin released by the government. This takes the seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – to 2.48%. “Delhi has the least case fatality ratio at 1.6, comparatively, Ahmedabad is at 4.0, Mumbai at 3.8, Kolkatta at 2 and Chennai at 1.8,” the Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had tweeted. “People are still going out, there are weddings, people are not wearing masks or maintaining social distance and yet the numbers and positivity rate have continued to decline. This seems to be an indicator that most of the people in the city have been exposed to the infection. In the absence of behavioural change, that seems to be the most logical reason for why the numbers are going down, especially after a surge like the one in November,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). She feels that the number of cases is unlikely to spike again to the levels in November, unless the virus mutates significantly. With fewer new cases, the number of active cases, or those currently infected, also dropped below 15,000 on Tuesday — the first time since August 31. The Delhi government has scaled up testing to around 71,800 samples a day on average over the last week. This has increased from an average 52,617 tests conducted a day during the first week of November. After a meeting with the Union home minister Amit Shah in mid-November, the Delhi government said it planned to scale up testing to between 100,000 and 120,000 a day, at least half of which would be done using RT-PCR tests. The alternate rapid antigen tests are cheaper, easy to deploy outside lab settings, and give results within 15 minutes. However, they are also less accurate and can detect only around half of positive cases correctly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/highest-number-of-tests-second-lowest-positivity-rate-in-over-200-days/story-izC7gNc5Px3BCMii0rK7FN.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||80% ICU beds reserved for Covid patients occupied, will review situation in 10 days, Delhi govt tells HC||The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked the Delhi government to review the reservation of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in 33 private hospitals for Covid-19 patients after the government informed the court that 80% of the reserved beds are occupied. The government also sought another 10 days to review the situation in view of the wedding season, the cold weather and bad air quality.The court was hearing a plea by the Association of Healthcare Providers, through advocate Sanyam Khetarpal, which had challenged the September 12 decision of the Delhi government to reserve 80% ICU beds in 33 private hospitals for Covid-19 patients. This order was stayed by the high court on September 22 by a single judge bench.Later, on October 9, a division bench of the court took up an appeal by the Delhi government, but refused to vacate the stay while adjourning the matter to November 27. The AAP government then approached the Supreme Court against the two orders. But the Supreme Court refused to interfere with the HC order and asked the government to seek relief from the high court.On November 12, a division bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad vacated the stay considering the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city at that time. Additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain, appearing for the Delhi government, on Tuesday told justice Navin Chawla that they have been monitoring the occupancy status of hospitals across Delhi, including the 33 hospitals, on a dynamic basis, considering the emergent nature of the pandemic.He told the court that the government would need more time to monitor the situation keeping in mind the wedding season, the bad air quality and rate of infection. He said a meeting was held under the chairmanship of Delhi health minister on December 11, during which it was decided that the order on reserving beds may be continued, in view of the fact that on December 10, the total occupancy of reserved ICU beds was 70.7%. Further, about 138 non-Covid ICU beds were still available with these 33 hospitals.He also said the meeting decided that the situation shall be reviewed after 10 days.According to an affidavit filed by additional standing counsel of Delhi government, Sanjoy Ghose, on December 11, 1,088 of 1,539 Covid ICU/ HDU beds (70.7%) at these 33 hospitals were occupied. Furthermore, in 12 of 33 hospitals, the occupancy of Covid ICU/ HDU beds was more than 80%, while seven hospitals had 100% occupancy. Also, a total of 792 non-Covid ICU beds were available in the 33 hospitals of which 654 were occupied, the affidavit said.However, these facts were disputed by the petitioner counsel, senior advocate Maninder Singh. “Why does the state create infrastructure because you are virtually nationalising everything. 1,782 ICU beds in the government hospitals are vacant. The data means nothing,” he said.Following this, the court asked the government to review the situation and place an updated record before it. The matter would be now heard on December 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/80-icu-beds-reserved-for-covid-patients-occupied-will-review-situation-in-10-days-delhi-govt-tells-hc/story-k1VMTwRCN79W6nwt3TrhuM.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Only 70,000 old vehicles in Delhi have high security plates, shows data||The Delhi government has so far managed to affix high-security registration plates (HSRPs) on only around 70,000 vehicles registered prior to April 2019. Data with the state transport department showed that despite several drives conducted over the past three years, nearly 25 lakh vehicles in Delhi still do not have high-security registration plates affixed on them. As per rules, vehicles registered before April 1, 2019, in Delhi, have to get HSRP and colour-coded stickers from dealers by applying at bookmyhsrp.com/index.aspxThe new vehicles registered after April 1, 2019, do not need to undergo the process as they come equipped with HSRPs and stickers.Records seen by HT showed that HSRPs have been affixed on around 70,000 old vehicles (registered prior to April 2019) and only 10,000 of them have got the fuel-based colour coded stickers on them.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the reason for the low number of vehicles getting HSRPs was more than one. “Firstly, people, in general, are not very forthcoming. Many still continue to use fancy number plates, which is illegal and entails a fine. Secondly, there were still some teething problems being faced by customers because of which directions have been issued to dealers to ensure that applicants get SMS alerts about every update on their plates and stickers. Thirdly, there is also some laxity in enforcement. I have directed the enforcement teams of the transport department to start an intensive drive again,” he said.,” he said. As many as 239 vehicles were prosecuted across the city for not having high-security number plates on their cars on Tuesday, the first day of the drive, said special commissioner (transport) KK Dahiya. A fine of Rs 5,500 is being slapped on violators as per provisions of the amended Motor Vehicles Act and conditions of registration certificates.“The objective of limited enforcement drive is to sensitise vehicle owners to follow the provisions of MV Act, which includes having HSRP and colour coded stickers. We have started the drive in random selective areas of Delhi. We hope it will lead to more compliance,” he said.The challans were issued in areas like Wazirpur, Saket, Shastri Park, Paschim Vihar, Dwarka, Rajghat, Talkatora Stadium, Akshardham Temple, Delhi Cantonment, Peeragarhi, Pusa, Shahdara, Preet Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Ridge Road and Malai Mandir/RK Puram, data showed. Dahiya said only four-wheelers registered in Delhi are being targeted at the moment. “No action is being taken against vehicles registered in other states and two-wheelers in general, as of now. We will soon intensify the drive with 50 teams as people have been given enough time to switch over to high-security registration plates . HSRPs have been mandatory for a decade now, still, there is low compliance,” he said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor has urged the Lieutenant Governor to direct the transport department to postpone the crackdown by six months, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said that the exercise can be carried out once the online process is streamlined.Car owners, however, said the issue is also at the supply end and called the process of getting an HSRP and sticker “arduous”. “I had received my slot in the first week of November, but I am yet to get the number plate. The company needs to train its executives better as when I call on their helpline number, it is almost of no help,” said Sunil Vohra, a resident of Pitampura. Some took to Twitter to register their complaint. Sunil Rangra said, “I am running from pillar to post for my HSRP but Rosmerta is not responding . They are harassing law abiding citizens. I have already mailed the CM office, but haven’t received any response. I request the CM office and the transport minister to intervene.” At the same time, there were also several happy customers who lauded the home delivery service started by the government. Anubhav Anand, who got is HSRP affixed three weeks ago said, “The HSRP installation process was a pretty clean and hassle-free experience of booking online and having the new car licence plates installed at the comfort of your home.”Another customer said the company should also provide the contact number of the person assigned to affix the number plate at home.Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited said it has streamlined the entire process. “Our capacity to manufacture HSRP is now 20,000 plates per day and there are over 300 dealers from where clients can pick up the plates or stickers. On an average, we are getting 2,500 bookings every day. From November till now, we have received a total of 23,400 orders, of which affixation of 21,169 plates has been completed through home delivery,” as spokesperson of the company said.Last year, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) had directed HSRP and colour-coded stickers for all vehicles by October 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/only-70-000-old-vehicles-in-delhi-have-high-security-plates-shows-data/story-iyQksy6GasD3XvFqyCLjiJ.html
15-12-2020||Chandigarh||Halwara International Airport: Foundation stone laid for boundary wall||A little over a week after the re-carpeting of the approach road to the new Halwara International Airport started, Fatehgarh Sahib member of Parliament (MP) Amar Singh laid the foundation stone for its boundary wall on Tuesday.Singh was accompanied by Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma, additional chief administrator (ACA) of Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA), Bhupinder Singh, airport director SK Saran and Congress leader Kamil Singh Boparai. The MP said that the upcoming airport will boost economic development and generate employment opportunities in Halwara and Raikot. He added that the approach road and boundary wall are critical requirements to start work on the new terminal building.He said that the 2,340-metre boundary wall is being built at a cost of Rs 3.01 crores and will be completed in six months. Sharma said that the work was going on in full swing and the government is fully prepared to start flights as soon as required infrastructure including approach road, boundary wall and the interim terminal building are ready.Boparai said that the establishment of the airport will attract new industries to the district. The Punjab government and Airport Authority of India (AAI) had signed the agreement for a joint venture to set up the airport in 2018. The project will be implemented through a joint venture company (JVC) formed with the majority stake of 51% of the AAI and 49% of the state government through GLADA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/halwara-international-airport-foundation-stone-laid-for-boundary-wall/story-eVMthC78ahSRQUtzTUBVqO.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi court acquits 36 foreigners who attended Tablighi Jamaat meet||A Delhi court on Tuesday acquitted 36 foreigners, who were chargesheeted for attending the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin markaz in defiance of the government guidelines issued in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic in the country, stating that the attendance register does not even prove that the accused arrived at the markaz on the dates mentioned against their names or that they were staying at the markaz till the end of March.It said that the prosecution has failed to prove the presence of any of the accused persons inside the markaz from March 12 to April 1, and there is no question of any violation. It said that no photographs and videos have been provided by the prosecution as evidence either.Chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg acquitted the foreigners from 14 countries of all charges, stating that there is not even an iota of evidence to prove that the prohibitory orders issued by the ACP, Lajpat Nagar, were published—perusing which the people residing at the markaz could have known about the restrictions on gatherings.The court said that the station house officer (SHO) of Nizamuddin police station was aware of the actual number of persons gathered at the markaz since beginning, yet failed to take any timely measures to ensure the dispersal of the gathering despite being aware of the government guidelines.“Else, if he was not so aware of the actual or even approximate numbers staying inside markaz till the last day of evacuation exercise, he in all probability is deposing falsely about his daily visits to markaz and briefing of the people stranded therein with government guidelines.“In any case, his testimony has failed to pass the test of creditworthiness and hence identification by him of the accused persons in the court is not sufficient to discharge the onus of prosecution to prove the presence of the accused at markaz during the relevant period,” the court stated in its order.The judge also said that even though the original register was produced, however, neither the author nor the person in whose presence the entries were made in the register of the names, states and the passport numbers of the foreign nationals has been examined by the prosecution in its evidence to prove the correctness of the entries made.“…a bare perusal of the register reflects that it has several columns however the column headings are not self-explanatory to ascertain the nature of information contained in each column. In the absence of appropriate column headings, it is difficult to ascertain as to whether the date against the registration number is the date of arrival of a particular person at markaz or date of registration/date of advance booking.“Thus, mere exhibition of the register in evidence shall not have the effect of proof of correctness of the contents of the register. This is besides the fact that the contents of the register do not even otherwise prove that the accused arrived at markaz on the dates mentioned against their names or that they were staying at markaz till March 30-31,” the court said.The court also said that mere uploading of the prohibitory order on the Delhi Police website shall not have the effect of promulgation. It also said that the prosecution has even failed to prove the disobedience of any of the directions contained in the order by any of the accused.“In the case in hand, the prosecution has failed to lead any evidence of promulgation of the order under section 144 CrPC by ACP, Lajpat Nagar, in the sense that not even an iota of evidence about publication thereof so as to bring the same to the notice of persons staying in markaz has been brought on record,” the court said.On August 24, the court had framed charges against the foreigners under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 (disobeying regulation) of Epidemic Act, 1897.The charges were also framed under Section 51 (obstruction) Disaster Management Act, 2005.However, the accused were discharged for offences under Section 14 (1) (b) (violation of visa norms) of Foreigners Act, sections 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) of IPC.The judge also said that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge u/s 188 IPC against the accused, as there is “no iota of evidence” for the first two prerequisites of promulgation and actual knowledge of the prohibitory order.It said that both the witnesses who were examined were “conspicuously silent” on the mode of the promulgation of the prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC while stating that they were not publicised in press, radio or television.“No copy of any newspaper, audio/video clip containing the contents of the order for publication on radio or television has been put on record,” the judge said….The entire examination in chief of both the witnesses is conspicuously silent about the mode and manner of promulgation of order u/s 144 CrP.C. by the ACP Lajpat Nagar,” the judge said.The court said that the witness (Inspector Mukesh Walia, PS-HN Din, New Delhi) had taken a stand that he kept apprising the markaz management about the government guidelines and preventive measures required to be taken during Covid-19. However, even in the communication sent to the management on March 28, there was no mention about the prohibitory notice restricting the gathering of people.The judge also said that handwritten lists of evacuees or list of persons allegedly shifted to different hospitals/quarantine centres were prepared by the medical teams at the time of screening of the persons at the gate of markaz during March 25 to April 1. However, the lists have not been produced either along with the charge sheets or anytime during the prosecution evidence.The court also rejected the submission of the police that they had identified the accused and Inspector Walia had seen one of the accused at the markaz during his visits there between March 12 and April 4. It said that a perusal of the passports reflects that some of the accused were allegedly seized prior to May 15 from different masjids/shelters situated within the jurisdiction of PS Chandni Mahal even though as per the charge sheet, the accused were at hospitals/quarantine centres.It said that the contradiction in the case renders the plea raised by the accused persons in their defence where they had stated that none of them was present at the markaz during the relevant period and they had been picked up from different places so as to maliciously prosecute them upon directions from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India.The foreigners were chargesheeted for attending the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin markaz area allegedly in violation of visa norms, indulging in missionary activities illegally and violating government guidelines issued in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-court-acquits-36-foreigners-who-attended-tablighi-jamaat-meet/story-ojl7S3x3J3c7qstnqHE1vL.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||HC restrains nurses from strike, forces them to return to the discussion table||Around 3,000 nurses of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) were forced to call off their strike on Tuesday after the Delhi high court restrained them continuing their protests and told them to resume work.The nurses are demanding a hike in salary based on an anomaly in the implementation of the sixth pay commission’s recommendations. The hospital and the Union health ministry both maintain that the interpretation by the AIIMS nurses is not correct. On Tuesday, Justice Navin Chawla, while issuing notice to the nurses’ union on the plea of the hospital, said that the stay is being granted after the AIIMS had given an assurance to the court that it is looking into the grievances of the protesters.“Keeping in view of the submissions and assurances made by AIIMS that it would look into the grievances of the respondents (nurses), this union is restrained from continuing the strike,” the court said.As nearly 3,000 nurses went on the strike, AIIMS Delhi had decided to outsource the nursing services on a contractual basis. The decision was taken in a meeting attended by the chairman, director, deputy director and senior faculty of the AIIMS administration.In its plea filed through advocate VSR Krishna, the AIIMS has contended that it is forced to move the court against the illegal strike declared by the AIIMS Nurses Union from December 14.Appearing for the petitioner, the counsel said the strike was in violation of the Industrial Disputes Act. He said that the strike also violated an earlier order of the division bench prohibiting any sit-in protest or sloganeering on the AIIMS campus by employees.He said the strike is not in public interest, while also stating that the strike is also “illegal” given the fact that the grievances of the nurses’ union are already under consideration by the AIIMS management. It said the AIIMS is discharging essential services and is also engaged in public utility services.The plea said the strike called by the union is gravely against public interest as AIIMS is a premier institution where patients come from all over the country for treatment. It said such a strike gravely prejudices the ability of the nurses to cater and serve these patients.It also said AIIMS is in the forefront of the battle against Covid-19 and is regularly treating Covid patients in addition to its general patient load. It also said no notice of six weeks was given to the institution by the union, before starting the strike which is a violation of the Industrial Disputes Act.After the submissions of the petitioner counsel, the court restrained the nurses from continuing the strike and posted the matter for further hearing to January 18, 2021.The nursing union, however, said they will challenge the high court order.“We are planning to challenge the order and present the court with the details of our demand. That is the only way we have of resolving the issue,” said one of the executive members of the nursing union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-restrains-nurses-from-strike-forces-them-to-return-to-the-discussion-table/story-kwIFTrS3gjBoX9YLZASIwO.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt appoints consultant for road redesign project||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the Delhi government has appointed a consultant for its ambitious road redesign project under which 540km of arterial roads in the city will be developed with features such as landscaping, and cycle and pedestrian tracks. Kejriwal chaired a review meeting on the proposal and directed the consultant to submit a detailed project report (DPR) by February next year so that all works can be completed in two years (by early 2023). Public Works Department (PWD) minister Satyendar Jain, the PWD secretary, the PWD engineer-in-chief and various other officials of the department were also present in the review meeting.“The consultant is responsible for preparing and submitting a DPR by February, based on which the tenders will be given and the operations to design the 540km of roads will begin by June 2021. People face issues because there are bottlenecks on roads, which lead to traffic congestion,” the government said in a statement. “The priority will be on removing the bottlenecks first, for a smooth flow of traffic and creating an organised lane system. The second goal would be to increase the efficiency of the existing space of the roads in the city so that spaces are best utilised as per their abilities. There will be measured and planned spaces for vehicles, non-motorized vehicles, footpaths, and side-lanes. The footpaths will be widely mapped to an average of 10 feet for the convenience of the pedestrians. These footpaths will be redesigned and reconstructed as per a standard height for the convenience of the physically handicapped. The project will help increase greenery, re-harvesting system will be implemented in the sewer drains,” it said. The chief minister directed that not even an inch of the surface of any road or roadside should be left uncovered, in order to ensure that there is no dust on the roads. Adequate grasses and shrubs will be planted on all surfaces to ensure dust control, a spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-appoints-consultant-for-road-redesign-project/story-gRiRkJYsZTaNRcBJWVcwnK.html
15-12-2020||Chandigarh||MC to take over Mohali roads and parks under GMADA from Apr 1, 2021||The municipal corporation (MC) will take over maintenance of parks and roads of sectors under the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) from April 1, 2021, Punjab cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu has said. Addressing mediapersons at the MC office in Sector 67 here on Tuesday, Sidhu said residents of sectors 66 to 69 and sector 76 to 80 would also get relief from January 1 as they would start paying a lower water tariff when MC took over the water supply from GMADA, which was charging much higher prices. The MC takeover of parks and roads under GMADA however would be done by April 1, the ensuing fiscal, Sidhu added. The survey of works completed by the Authority was continuing following which the takeover would be completed, he added. Maintenance would be easier and quick as the local councillors would be able to immediately identify and follow up with repair and maintenance of roads and look after nearly 565 big and small parks of the city, Sidhu said. There is a big disparity between GMADA and MC water tariffs as the former charges nearly Rs 5 to Rs 20 per Kilolitres (1,000 litres) depending upon residential/ commercial and other the types of water connections. MC charges vary from Rs1.80 to Rs 5 per KL. Sidhu said the development of the city would get a major push because of the Urban Environment Improvement Programme (UEIP) under which Rs20 crore had been received. Besides, there was a fresh inflow of Rs45 crore and city beautification and development works costing Rs100 crore were underway. Replying to a media query, Sidhu said that during the tenure of the previous government no provision of funds for public health services had been made. Only funding of Rs4 crore and Rs5 crore had been given to the MC because of which hardly any maintenance work could be carried out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-to-take-over-mohali-roads-and-parks-under-gmada-from-apr-1-2021/story-AXNDTEYuOPjL4oTj4YXkHN.html
15-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: 20-yr-old booked for raping woman on pretext of marriage||A 20-year-old employee of a private firm was booked on Tuesday for raping a woman on the pretext of marriage. The accused has been identified as Ashish of Radha Vihar Colony, Bhamian Kalan.The 20-year-old victim is a resident of Ram Nagar, Bhamian Kalan, and pursuing a course in computer applications. She stated in her complaint that Ashish’s aunt lives in the same colony as her and they met six month ago. She said that on August 29, the accused asked her to come to his aunt’s house. But, when she got there, Ashish was alone and told her that his aunt and mother had gone to Uttar Pradesh. Then, he established physical relations with her on the pretext of marriage. In October, Ashish took her to his home and raped her again.The woman alleged that he made excuses every time she asked him to solemnise the marriage. She added that on Sunday, the accused refused to marry her, following which she lodged an FIR.ASI Sukhwinder Singh, who is investigating the case, said that a case has been registered against Ashish under Section 376 (rape) of Indian Penal Code.

15-12-2020||Noida||UP Gate turns into city of tents as farmers’ numbers swell; leaders to hold mahapanchayat on Dec 17||Ghaziabad: Having so far called a Bharat Bandh, going on a hunger strike, protesting at respective district headquarters and freeing up expressways of tolls, among other strategies as part of their protest, farmers are now mulling over their future course of action so as to get the central government to listen to their plight against the three new farm laws. Meanwhile, the UP Gate protest site has turned into a “city of tents”, with the gathering swelling up in numbers.The farmers have held siege at the UP Gate in Ghaziabad since November 28, and blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the National Highway 9 since December 3. Rakesh Tikait, one of the leaders of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) and its spokesperson, said now it is up to the government to plan a “rann niti” (strategy) to break the deadlock over the farm laws. “We are sitting here and now it is up to the government to make ‘rann niti’. We have a big panchayat at Sisoli in Muzaffarnagar (village of BKU’s founder leader Mahendra Singh Tikait). This time, we will hold this big panchayat at UP Gate. People from western UP will arrive in large numbers; khap panchayats have also been called here. Farmers from other areas and states are already here,” Rakesh Tikait said.He added that every farmer is keeping an eye on outsiders and if found they will be subjected to “gola lathi” – a way of tying up the hands and legs of a person and then putting across a stick behind the knees and held by palms, interlocking the limbs.“We are keeping an eye on outsiders and this time, we will tie them up, gola lathi-style, for two hours and then hand them over to the police. Farmers who are being stopped en route have been asked to stage sit-ins at the site. Our core-committee will decide the future course of action,” he added. Some other BKU leaders said that blocking the entire national highway could also be considered as a future course of action. “They initially floated the narrative that protesting farmers were “naxalites”. Then they said that those on protests were “big farmers” and then later they said they have the support of other groups of farmers. Despite all this, we are showing restraint. The day things go out of hand, there will be a flashpoint,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of BKU.So far as part of the protests, farmers have given a call for Bharat Bandh, besides blocking a portion of highway in Ghaziabad and even making toll plazas free of cost and protesting at district headquarters. “Further, we may choke borders and even highways. We know this will create problems for commuters but we are helpless. How long will we continue to sit here? There is also an attempt to stop our supporters from coming to the site. They are being stopped in Rampur, Brijghat and other places on the highway,” Singh added. UP Gate turns into city of tents Meanwhile, the UP Gate protest site has turned into a city of tents, with farmers camping at the site under temporary tents which have come up off late, besides tractor trolleys, mini trucks and even cars and other vehicles.The BKU leaders estimate that the overall farmers strength at the UP Gate has now reached 4,000-5,000 strong, with about 400-500 tractor trolleys lining up from UP Gate up to Khoda on NH 9, and more likely to arrive with the call of mahapanchayat on December 17.“Farmers have made all arrangements for food and have brought in rations to sustain them for months. We have 24x7 langars and several kitchens operating. Every tractor trolley has carved a space for itself and converted to tents with tarpaulin sheets on top. This serves as a safe house for rest and sleep. The entire area has been turned into a small city in itself. There is nothing to worry about. However, with each day passing, the government’s attitude is more unwelcome,” said Salik Ram Yadav, a farmer leader from Prayagraj. The UP Gate site is seeing daily arrival of tonnes of fruits and vegetables and food is being prepared aplenty to feed everyone. The number of community kitchens and food stalls operating has now gone up to about 10 at the site, while about three to four medical camps have also been set up. Some private hospitals and doctors off late have sent their ambulances and staff for ailing farmers. Shyam Kumar, who has arrived from Roorkee, is selling blankets at the site. “I generally put-up stalls in exhibitions but this time, I tried selling at the UP Gate. Farmers are showing keen interest and some have even purchased blankets,” he added.Like him, Pintu Gupta is selling kurta-pajamas and Jawahar jackets at UP Gate. He is from Ghazipur in UP and lives in Delhi. “These traditional outfits are liked by farmers. So, I came here and put up a stall and stocked various colours of kurta-pajama and sadri,” he said. The temporary library at UP Gate is also attracting farmers. Several youngsters have put up the library on the footpath of NH 9, and said that one of the titles, ‘Kisan Patrika,’ has so far sold about 5,000 copies.“This small book explains the three farm laws in detail and costs ₹5. During the past 12 days, we have sold about 5,000 copies. Other titles are also being sold. We have also offered books free of cost for reading and farmers take them and return after reading,” said Ashish Kumar, a resident of Shahdara in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-gate-turns-into-city-of-tents-as-farmers-numbers-swell-leaders-to-hold-mahapanchayat-on-dec-17/story-iNPTY3EgntEF9G6EVn3riN.html
15-12-2020||Noida||Developer arrested in connection with bike bot ponzi scheme||Greater Noida: A team from the Noida police and the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) on Monday arrested Satinder Bhasin alias Montu Bhasin, the director of Bhasin Group, in connection with the bike bot ponzi scheme. According to the police, Bhasin was allegedly in contact with bike bot mastermind Sanjay Bhati, and had received ₹98 crore as investment from Bhati to allot commercial space in his company-owned Grand Venice Mall. Police said that the suspect was wanted in two FIRs (nos. 385/19 and 697/19) registered at the Dadri police station. The district court had also issued a non-bailable warrant against him in these cases. Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that the EOW, Meerut, is probing this case. “The EOW in its investigation found Bhasin’s role in the fraudulent activity in the bike bot scheme. He had got some money from bike bot mastermind Sanjay Bhati. The police team conducted a search and arrested him from Surajpur in Greater Noida,” he said. Police said Sanjay Bhati, the alleged owner of Garvit Innovative Promoters Limited (GIPL), had floated the fictitious bike bot scheme. Bhati had allegedly set up the company in 2010, and floated the scheme in 2017. The suspects would allegedly seek ₹62,000 as investment per motorcycle from people. They were allegedly promised ₹9,765 as monthly return from their investments, accumulating to ₹1.17 lakh per annum income. The offer was so lucrative that soon, over 2.25 lakh people made payments for multiple motorcycles and were allegedly cheated to the tune of ₹3,500 crore, said officers.“Police investigations showed that Bhasin had got ₹98 crore transferred to his company’s bank accounts from Bhati. Bhasin had also issued some “allotment letters” for commercial space in his shopping mall to Bhati. However, the commercial property was not officially registered/transferred,” Noida police said in a press note. The police and EOW teams have so far arrested 23 suspects in relation to the bike bot scheme. The developer was not available for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/developer-arrested-in-connection-with-bike-bot-ponzi-scheme/story-eoOXvhhWH7zhcQ7yXuphwO.html
15-12-2020||Noida||Students duped of ₹12 lakh on pretext of merchant navy job||Noida: As many as four youths were allegedly duped of ₹12 lakh by a Noida-based firm on the pretext of providing them merchant navy jobs.A complaint was filed at Sector 20 police station by 21-year-old Rishikesh Kumar Jaiswal, a native of Bihar and a graduate in nautical science.“I had uploaded my resume on an online job portal last year and was contacted by a Noida-based company in August. I checked the company’s profile and it seemed genuine. Then three of my friends also applied with them. We even met their executives in October in Noida after which they took our documents and ₹12 lakh, and assured us that we will get our joining within two weeks,” said Jaiswal.He said that the placement company finally contacted them in January this year. “The company officials asked us to go to Mumbai after which they stopped responding to our calls and messages. We then went to their office in Noida Sector 10, and after a lot of pressure and with help of the local police, they gave us two cheques each which bounced. Then the lockdown happened and they kept giving us fake assurances,” said the complainant, adding that the company officials then said that the joining will happen before Diwali. But when nothing was finalized, the victims came to the Noida office which by then had been abandoned, the police said, adding that the youths later found out that other students across the country had been duped in a similar manner by the suspects.Jaiswal’s three friends are natives of Tamil Nadu, the police said.Based on the complaint, a case was registered against the company under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.“A probe in the matter is underway. We have a few leads and are questioning some people to find more information about the people behind the scam. We will nab them soon,” said Rakesh Kumar Singh, station house officer, Sector 20 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/students-duped-of-12-lakh-on-pretext-of-merchant-navy-job/story-GlVGeiU0pB6MdqrDRJPINK.html
15-12-2020||Noida||UPPCL offers one-time settlement scheme for power consumers in commercial category||NOIDA: To provide some respite to power consumers in the commercial and industrial category who could not clear their outstanding dues owing to the Covid-19 crisis, the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has asked all the distribution companies in the state to begin ‘Covid-19 one-time settlement (OTS)’ scheme for them. The scheme will be effective between December 15, 2020 and January 31, 2021. Earlier, the OTS scheme was applicable for urban and rural domestic consumers only, said officials of the Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL). PVVNL chief engineer, Virendra Nath Singh, said, “The scheme has started from Tuesday and will continue till January 31. Under this scheme, the consumers of various commercial and industrial categories would get 100% waiver on surcharge on pending electricity bills up to November 30.” The defaulters will have to clear the pending dues at one go, the officials said.Singh further said that to avail the benefits of this scheme, the urban consumers will have to apply online with the office of the executive engineer or sub-divisional officer concerned, while in rural areas applications will have to be filed at the common service centre. “This facility will provide big relief to commercial and industrial category consumers, who could not clear their outstanding dues in the wake of pandemic. The scheme will also cover consumers who were slapped with a fine after an anomaly found during an electricity checking drive,” he said. According to the officials, the scheme will benefit shops, hotels, restaurants, hostels, marriage halls, commercial establishments like cinema halls, banks, private hospitals and nursing homes, diagnostic centres, and schools, among others. The scheme will also benefit small and medium industrial units having a contracted load less than 100 HP (75 kW), and mushroom and other farming activities, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/uppcl-offers-one-time-settlement-scheme-for-power-consumers-in-commercial-category/story-UwzepdfTW2oU7cG9KqB0aN.html
15-12-2020||Noida||UP govt issues health index , Noida district bags second position||NOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar district, with a composite score of 0.67, stood second in the district-wise health index issued by the state government on Tuesday. The district has maintained this rank for the last nine months.District magistrate Suhas LY said that GB Nagar’s best performing indicator is the percentage of antenatal care (ANC), which calculates the access and use of health care during pregnancy. “The antenatal period presents opportunities for reaching pregnant women with interventions that may be vital to their health and well being, as well as that of their children. Getting antenatal care at least four times increases the likelihood of receiving effective maternal health interventions during the antenatal period. GB Nagar scored a full 100 points in this section,” he said. He added that the percentage of children who received full immunisation is among other best performing indicators. “It was the dedication and commitment of our health officials and workers that the district topped with a full score of 100 in this section as well. Not only that, Bisrakh, Dadri and Jewar blocks of the district are among the top performing blocks in the state,” Suhas said. Bhadohi district topped the list with composite index of 0.74 in the state.Chief medical officer (CMO) of the district Dr Deepak Ohri said that to measure relative performance of a district in terms of composite health indicators, different indicators are computed using an index which summarises the number of outcomes and data integrity indicators. “The ranking of districts helps us identify the reasons for poor performance in terms of availability and quality, and also gives an outline for taking appropriate actions,” he said. Giving details of the methodology of the ranking system, the CMO said that it covers indicators from all critical domains of health, including ANC, delivery, immunisation, postnatal care and communicable diseases. “The coverage and quality of these indicators determine the overall composite index of the district,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-govt-issues-health-index-noida-district-bags-second-position/story-MgLPcaFl7Y5xyv3Zq1Jm1K.html
15-12-2020||Noida||Three killed, two injured as truck hits SUV on Yamuna Expressway||Greater Noida: Three persons died while two others were injured when a truck, going from Noida to Jewar, allegedly lost balance, hit the divider, jumping on to the opposite side of the road and collided with an SUV which was coming from Siddharth Nagar, on Tuesday around 1.30 am. Umesh Bahadur, the station house officer of Jewar police station, said the accident took place near Jewar Bangar village. “Five persons of a family were going from Siddharth Nagar to AIIMS in Delhi via Greater Noida in a Mahindra Scorpio. Police investigations showed that a relative of the victims was admitted to the Delhi hospital for a kidney transplant. They were going to see the patient. The Scorpio was running smoothly on its way. However, when it reached Jewar, a truck on the Noida-Agra side lost balance, hit the divider, and then rammed into the SUV on the opposite side,” Bahadur said. Police said the accident was severe and the occupants of the SUV were critically injured and trapped in the damaged vehicle. He said passersby informed the police, after which a team reached the spot and rushed the victims to a private hospital. The deceased were identified as SUV driver Pawan Dubey, 38, Rinki Kumari, 25, and Anita, 35, residents of Siddharth Nagar. The two injured victims were identified as Suman, 27, and Subhash Kumar, 55. Police said all five persons are relatives.The injured victims have been admitted to a private hospital in Greater Noida while the bodies have been sent for post-mortem. The accident also created a traffic jam for about an hour on the Yamuna Expressway. The police team brought cranes and cleared the road. Bahadur said the suspect truck driver managed to escape after the accident. “We found that it was the fault of the truck driver. It appears he was speeding. It is also possible that he may have slept off on the driver’s seat and lost balance of the vehicle. We have seized the truck, which bears a Haryana registration number. We are trying to trace the suspect and the vehicle’s owner,” he said. The victims’ family has not filed a complaint in this regard.Last week, the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) had directed Jaypee Infratech Limited, the concessionaire of the expressway, and the traffic police to reduce the speed limit on the expressway to 75 kilometre per hour (kmph) from the current 100 kmph, in view of safety of motorists due to foggy conditions. This was put into place from December 15 till February 15. Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, traffic, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that he has directed the officials to ensure compliance of the advisory.The Yamuna Expressway witnessed 357 accidents, in which 822 people were injured and 145 others died, from January to July 31, 2019, as per an RTI reply, while in 2018, at least 659 road accidents took place which resulted in 1,388 injuries and 111 deaths.Built at a cost of ₹12,839 crore by Jaypee Infratech, the 165-km stretch was opened for commercial operations in August 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/three-killed-two-injured-as-truck-hits-suv-on-yamuna-expressway/story-op6QkPqceJm684TxaaTDfN.html
15-12-2020||Noida||Cold wave grips Noida as city sees season’s coldest day||Noida: Noida saw the coldest day of the season yet on Tuesday, with the minimum temperature dropping to 8 degrees Celsius. According to weather analysts, the mercury is expected to drop further in the coming days.The region is experiencing two conditions – cold wave and cold day – at the same time as both, the minimum and maximum temperatures are falling. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts Wednesday to be even colder as the mercury is set to drop by another degree.The maximum temperature for Noida was recorded at 17.5 degrees Celsius on Tuesday against 15.5 degrees a day earlier. On Monday, the minimum temperature for Noida had been recorded at 8.8 degrees Celsius. So far, November 23 was the coldest day of the season, with a minimum temperature of 8.2 degrees Celsius. The humidity during the morning hours is 100%, as per the IMD. Meanwhile, the average minimum for Delhi-NCR, based on data from the Safdarjung observatory, was recorded 4.1 degrees Celsius, also the season’s lowest, with the IMD predicting Wednesday to see mercury drop to as low as 3 degrees Celsius.“Both the cold wave and cold day conditions will prevail in the region till Friday, December 18. This is because the winds are directly entering NCR from the northern Himalayan states, which have received a fresh and heavy batch of snowfall. The icy cold winds will keep entering the region and the mercury may drop a degree further,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.Cold wave is a condition when the minimum temperatures are about 4.5 degrees below the season’s normal, while cold day is a condition when the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees below the season’s average. According to the weather department, the fog is over the upper surface that is blocking the sunlight, thereby impacting the maximum temperatures, leading to cold conditions. “Usually the fog is below the surface but currently, due to stronger winds, fog has reached 300 to 400 metres above the surface, which is blocking the sunlight. This is the reason that the maximum temperatures have been impacted as well. The cold conditions will continue for another four days and there will be some rise in mercury after December 18. But the cold conditions will prevail till January,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/cold-wave-grips-noida-as-city-sees-season-s-coldest-day/story-waVUDpigXlFDY4X6QNyQSI.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||AIIMS nurses call off strike after 2-hour meet with hospital administration||The Nurses Union of Delhi AIIMS called off their strike on Tuesday night after an around two-hour meeting with the hospital administration, even as the Delhi High Court restrained it from continuing its agitation. On Monday, around 5,000 nurses of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here went on a strike over their long pending demands, including those with regard to the Sixth Central Pay Commission. “They (nurses) have called off their strike and have joined their duties,” AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria told PTI. The hospital administration, along with health ministry officials, held a meeting during which the union was assured that all “local issues” would be addressed immediately, while those pertaining to the ministry will be dealt separately as early as possible, an official privy to the developments said. Following the meeting the Union called off its strike, the official said. The nurses’ union’s demands include correction of an anomaly in the fixation of the initial pay as per the Sixth Central Pay Commission (CPC), redressal of issues such as abolishment of gender-based reservation in the recruiting process of nursing officers and contractual appointments, enhancement of hospital accommodation and cadre restructuring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aiims-nurses-call-off-strike-after-2-hour-meet-with-hospital-administration/story-6VPyjjraHk0SrTjahK75SP.html
15-12-2020||Noida||Noida’s air quality drops to ‘poor’ again||Noida: After being in ‘moderate’ category for a day, Noida’s air quality slipped to ‘poor’ on Tuesday as the weather conditions became unfavourable for the ventilation. The air quality of Greater Noida and Ghaziabad also dropped, but stayed within the ‘poor’ levels. On Monday, Noida had reported its best air quality (‘moderate’) since November 17. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Tuesday was 243 against 176 a day earlier. Greater Noida’s air quality was 290 against 256 a day earlier, both ‘poor’. Ghaziabad’s AQI also worsened from lower level of poor category towards the upper level. On Tuesday, the AQI of Ghaziabad was 282 against 243 a day earlier. AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to the weather analysts, while the excessive winter conditions make the air heavy and trap the pollutants, the stronger winds would still help with ventilation and if the local emissions spike, the drop in air quality will only be marginal. “The wind speed on Tuesday was 12km per hour while the temperature also dipped leading to cold waves. On Monday, the wind speed was over 15kmph. The winds will prevail for next few days and thus despite resistance due to the low temperatures, the ventilation will be there. So the air quality will be okay and if it worsens, it will be a marginal drop,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. The fine particles or PM2.5 levels also spiked and are currently two-time the standards. On Tuesday, PM2.5 for the past 24 hours in Noida was recorded at 106.64 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³) against 99.24 µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 level for Greater Noida was 131.50 µg/m³ against 119.19 µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 levels for Ghaziabad on Tuesday also increased to 129.99 µg/m³ against 112.49 µg/m³ on Monday. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 µg/m³. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), AQI is likely to improve over next few days due to stronger winds. “Though the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to fall, better ventilation conditions are forecasted for the next 72 hours, due to high wind speed and deepen nocturnal boundary layer height. AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate today from the moderate to the poor category, and likely to improve on 16th and 17th Dec to the poor to moderate category,” said a SAFAR statement on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-air-quality-drops-to-poor-again/story-4qDekAMGr4wtV0YqWDIaeL.html

Spread across 12 acres, work on this project is likely to be started by January-end, 2021. According to officials, Noida will spend ₹30 crore on the development of the Vedvan Park. On Tuesday, it issued a tender for horticulture works worth ₹15 crore, and tender for works worth the remaining ₹15 crore, related with civil work, will be issued in the next two days.“This park will be one of its kinds in the city. It will offer a unique opportunity for residents to enjoy at this park,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty of the Noida authority. Officials said that the park will be devoted to Indian scriptures and saints. Sector 78, where the park is going to come up, is home to several newly-built group housings. Besides the park, the authority is also hiring agencies for other horticulture projects in the city that include development of two wetlands and a small park to beautify the city.“The Vedvan-themed Park is devoted to Indian scriptures and saints who wrote these scriptures. The objective is to provide residents or visitors an opportunity to understand old scriptures and how these writings can have a positive impact on life. The saints whose sculptures will be built are yet to be decided,” said Singh.Officials said Vedvan will have different varieties of medicinal plants and traditional Indian fruit bearing trees.“Families would be able to take their children to these parks and teach them about spiritual and medicinal values of the trees,” said Singh.Meanwhile, Greater Noida is set to have its first open gym for public use at the City Park on Wednesday, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-issues-tender-for-vedvan-park/story-eTx2ORswPivDVNhlNczAzK.html
15-12-2020||Noida||RITES to prepare estimate for 7km stretch of 44km link road to connect Jewar airport with Ballabhgarh||GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) has roped in the central government agency, RITES, as the consultant to prepare an estimate for building 7-km long road, which will be part of a 44-km expressway to be built to connect proposed Jewar airport with the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway at Ballabhgarh in Haryana.“We have asked RITES to prepare an estimate required to construct the 7km stretch that is part of 44km link road. Since the 44km road will be an additional link road between Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, a new bridge will be built across Yamuna. Therefore, RITES will conduct a study and help in finalizing the alignment of the 7km stretch,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida.The Union minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari, had last year directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to explore options to connect Jewar with the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway at Ballabhgarh. The objective was to provide an additional link to the proposed international airport at Jewar with the rest of the national capital region, said Yeida officials.Yeida said that once estimate, alignment and site of a new bridge are finalised, NHAI will start work on this 7km stretch as it is already working on this project in Haryana region.“The best thing is that NHAI is funding the entire 44km link road, including the 7km stretch that comes under our jurisdiction. RITES will decide the site of a new bridge as per the alignment, and provide all technical aspects of this project so that we can coordinate with NHAI and work is put on fast-track,” said Singh.Zurich International AG -- the Swiss firm selected to develop the Jewar airport – is likely to start construction for the project by mid-2021, with a completion deadline of 2023-24.“This 44km link road will be ready before 2024 so that the Jewar airport enjoys connectivity with rest of Delhi-NCR areas,” said the Yeida CEO.The international airport at Jewar, with a budget of around Rs 25,000-30,000 crore, is touted as the biggest in the country as it is to be developed on 5,000 hectares of land when it reaches its full capacity, said the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/rites-to-prepare-estimate-for-7km-stretch-of-44km-link-road-to-connect-jewar-airport-with-ballabhgarh/story-y20dZFxa7HLD0GTSUKMp1O.html
15-12-2020||Chandigarh||Look, a flock of birds over Chandigarh’s Matka Chowk||What’s murmuration? It’s a phenomenon resulting from a large group of birds, usually starlings, flying in intricately coordinated patterns across the skies. And now it will be recreated at Matka Chowk, an art installation of birds, in perpetual motion, as the rotary near the Government Museum and Sector 17 gets a revamp, complete with fancy lighting, landscaping and fountains.Beautification plans for the chowk were sanctioned last year by the UT administration with work scheduled to start in February this year before the Covid-19 pandemic delayed things.The project, which has restarted, is likely to be completed in a couple of weeks. The theme of the flock of birds centres around murmuration. “Murmurations at Chandigarh visualises the relationship between a group and the individual by mimicking a swarm of migratory birds. The artwork poetically illustrates how we, as humans, strive to live autonomously within societies defined by rules and conventions,” explains Sandeep Goyal, the man behind the beautification drive. A businessperson, media entrepreneur, philanthropist and the first CEO of the Punjab CSR Authority, Goyal took over the maintenance work of the chowk from the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) around two-and-a-half years back. Proposing a creative uplift to the chowk, Goyal’s designs were forwarded by the CHB to the UT urban planning department, which submitted these to the Chandigarh Heritage Conservation Committee (CHCC). After nearly 18 months and several design tweaks later the CHCC cleared it.Final approvals came from the administration in September for the project that’s entirely funded by Goyal. “360 birds and rods have been installed. The landscaping remains to be done. The water body around the Matka (installation at the chowk) will be repaired and fountain will be changed. Also, the Matka will be refurbished and synchronised with the rest of the design,” said Goyal.Meanwhile, the overhauling of the rotary has been criticised from some quarters as going against the “heritage” of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/look-a-flock-of-birds-over-chandigarh-s-matka-chowk/story-CEVYhOgpE5dKVVQjXAcgqL.html
15-12-2020||Noida||As mercury dips, tractor-trolleys and UP Gate flyover come as saviour for protesting farmers||Ghaziabad: With the minimum temperature hovering around eight degrees Celsius on Tuesday, 97-year-old Soran Singh from Bulandshahr is busy walking at the UP Gate which has now become one of the major protest sites for farmers. Skinny legs with one yet to recover fully from fracture which he suffered three years ago, Singh says that he takes up two-three rounds around the UP Gate to keep himself warm in the biting cold. “The leg still pains a lot but my stick helps me out. The weather is very cold and I retire to sleep late evening in my tractor-trolley where I have made a bed with ‘puaal’ (haystack) and use blanket to cover self,” he said. Around four thousands of farmers at the UP Gate have their tractor-trolleys covered with tarpaulin sheets and converted them to small houses to prevent themselves from winter chill. The vehicles are stuffed with daily use items, along with blankets and quilts. “We are on a warpath. These tractor-trolleys are our homes now till we continue our fight. We have about 20-25 women who sleep inside trolleys while men spread blankets on road below the trolleys. There is limited space inside trolleys, so many women prefer to sleep in sitting position huddled together to ward off winter chill,” said Kunti Devi, who is part of a farmers’ group from Shahjahanpur in UP. The farmers said that they also light up bonfire with pieces of wood. “We have also brought little children with us as they cannot stay back home without their mothers. Women generally get up at 3am and go to water tankers to bathe. The water in tankers is ice-cold,” said Madhuri Kushwaha, another member of the group. Protesters like Premwati Devi who is from Prayagraj said that she had held a roadside corner below the UP Gate flyover along with women from her group as dozens of tractor-trolleys are stationed there. “We have laid down mattresses and are using blankets to cover ourselves. The flyover gives us cover and protects us from dew. Farmers are attuned to face adverse weather conditions throughout the year. So, we are facing winter chill and taking our protest forward,” Premwati added. While majority of the tractor-trolleys are conventional, some of the trolleys which have arrived from Uttarakhand have provision of air-conditioners as well. “The trolley is mounted in form of a cabin behind the tractor and is also modified from inside. The AC unit gets power from the generator and also from the tractor. Several farmer leaders also hold meetings inside. It belongs to one of our farmer leaders,” said Dilbag Singh, a farmer at UP Gate who arrived from Udham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand. The farmers said that the space between two tractor-trolleys is also covered with tarpaulin sheets to create more space to prevent farmers from dew. “The weather is adverse but we are holding ground. If Modiji (the Prime Minister) gives go ahead for our demands, we will go back home. Otherwise, we continue living here in trolleys, More such vehicles will arrive in coming days. Some trolleys have also installed solar panel for providing lights and charging of mobile phones. Many streetlights on this stretch were working initially, but now they are off,” said Prabhjit Singh, another farmer from Udham Singh Nagar. When asked, the National Highways Authority of India officials said that the power connection to the streetlights were cut off by some people and they were using it for running heaters, generators and other electrical appliances. “Just because the wires have been damaged, the streetlights are not functioning at present,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/as-mercury-dips-tractor-trolleys-and-up-gate-flyover-come-as-saviour-for-protesting-farmers/story-yf7qJ5owW3PAQKJVvQmVQK.html

15-12-2020||City||BJP opposes Dawar’s proposal to rename Ludhiana’s Mini Rose Garden||The district unit of Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) has opposed Congress MLA (Ludhiana central) Surinder Dawar’s proposal to name Mini Rose Garden in Kidwai Nagar after late BJP veteran leader and former state health minister Satpal Gosain. A group of BJP councillors led by district president Pushpinder Singal met mayor Balkar Sandhu over the issue at MC Zone ‘A’ office on Tuesday and demanded that Lord Mahavir Mini Rose Garden in Kidwai Nagar not be renamed after Gosain as he himself had named the park. Dawar however, said that they had proposed to name the park after Gosain, and the mayor has to take the final decision in this regard. Singal said, “Gosain has done a lot of work for the city and, the Mini Rose Garden was also established due to his efforts. He named the garden after Lord Mahavir, and the civic body should not change it.” “Few Congress leaders, including the MLA and councillors, had proposed that the name should be changed as a tribute to Gosain, but it should not be done. MC should instead name a prominent place, road, or junction after Gosain as he was loved by the people and had worked hard for the development of the city,” he added. A BJP leader said that during the last rites of Gosain on December 1, Dawar and area Congress councillor Gurdeep Neetu had announced that the garden would be named after him. However, the Jain community had objected to the same due to which the BJP had decided that it would not be changed. Despite attempts made to reach the mayor, he was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-opposes-dawar-s-proposal-to-rename-ludhiana-s-mini-rose-garden/story-QjJ6iVu3Qjrl8HFBcWBF3I.html

15-12-2020||Chandigarh||President of Ludhiana agri varsity’s teachers’ body accused of misusing post||Fissures have appeared between members of the Punjab Agricultural University Teachers’ Association (PAUTA) after ex-president Mukesh Siag accused the incumbent HS Kingra of making a mockery out of the democratic setup of the teachers’ body.In the meantime, Kingra’s hunger strike entered its seventh day on Tuesday. Referring to an email issued by Kingra on December 11 from the dharna site which stated that members of the teachers’ body should not indulge in bickering and mud slinging, Siag replied, “I chose not to bicker but I will take the liberty to respond. I consider you solely responsible for eroding the credibility of PAUTA by not getting the elections conducted in time. You have been misusing your post to disrespect the faculty and bring a bad name to the varsity.”“First, the teachers’ body should get a duly-elected executive. Therefore, irrespective of whoever gets elected, we will be able to take up issues collectively with the administration and government,” he added.While Kingra was not available for comments, KS Sanga, member of the PAUTA executive body, said that the faction led by Siag was backed by vice-chancellor Dhillon and they want to create a rift between members of the teachers’ body. He said the election was delayed due to the pandemic and a few other reasons.“Now, it has been decided that the election will be conducted on January 20. Earlier, vice-chancellor BS Dhillon while addressing the faculty had indicated that Kingra’s post is unconstitutional. Without naming him, the V-C said that an individual was occupying the post for over two years in violation of the constitution of the teachers’ body,” Sanga said.The elections which are scheduled to take place after the stipulated term of one year, have not been conducted since 2019, said a faculty member.Siag urges Kangra to end hunger strikeIn a letter, Siag said, “Irrespective of our differences, I am very concerned about your health. It’s astonishing that your close friends in the group allow you to take such an extreme step. My humble request to you is that you have done your bit, so please end your fast for your family and well- wishers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/president-of-ludhiana-agri-varsity-s-teachers-body-accused-of-misusing-post/story-YC8f6Be4HLjpFlp8XF2DDO.html
15-12-2020||Gurugram||Farmers continue stir at Haryana-Rajasthan border||Farmers from various states protesting against the new farm laws continued to block a stretch of Delhi-Jaipur national highway at Shahjahanpur in Alwar district on Tuesday for the third consecutive day. Farmers’ groups said that they would continue their stir at the Jaisinghpur-Khera border till the Haryana Police allows them to proceed to Delhi. Sanjay Madhav, the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that farmers from both Rajasthan and Haryana, besides other states, were joining the stir in large numbers. “The numbers are multiplying on a daily basis. Farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have been joining us on a daily basis. They are reaching here in tractors and trolleys and the numbers will continue to increase in the coming days,” said Madhav. He said that farmers from Sri Ganganagar and Hanumangarh in Rajasthan had also arrived at the stir with tractors and trolleys on Tuesday while civil society members and lawyers had also extended support. “For the next few days, our plan is to continue with demonstrations while allowing more farmers to join us. We have been camping here day and night, and won’t relent till the three laws are rolled back,” said Madhav.Farmers across the country have been protesting against the three newly enacted farm laws — The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 — passed by Parliament during the monsoon session. The farmers fear that the new laws will put them at the mercy of large corporations and lead to the removal of the minimum support price they receive on important crops. Farmers’ groups and civil society members from Gurugram and Nuh have also extended their support to the stir at the Khera border. Azad Khan, Haryana vice-president, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said that farmers from Nuh had joined the agitation and were pitching in with food and other requirements. “We were proceeding towards Delhi but were stopped from doing so by the police. Farmers from Haryana and Rajasthan have come together for the agitation,” said Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-continue-stir-at-haryana-rajasthan-border/story-ug2TXETjyaecdfuniGhPxM.html

15-12-2020||Gurugram||Health officials undergo Co-WIN system training for vaccine management||From tracking beneficiaries for Covid-19 vaccine to monitoring supply and storage of it on a real-time basis, the Gurugram health department officials are getting trained in Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) system — a digital platform which will be a repository of information for the management of Covid-19 vaccination in the coming months. Initially, officials said, Covid-19 vaccine will be provided only to the beneficiaries registered by the authorities on Co-WIN, with a self-registration option likely to be added at a later stage.For this, the district health department officials, who have been trained by the state in the last two days on Covid-19 vaccine guidelines, will impart training on December 17 to their medical officers, representatives of Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), Municipal Corporation of Gurugram and other health staff on using Co-WIN.“Everything related to Covid-19 vaccine is linked with Co-WIN platform,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, who attended the two-day state-level training on Covid-19 vaccination that concluded on Tuesday. “Co-WIN is the extension of the existing electronic Vaccine Network (eVIN), which is a real-time platform to track the supply and storage of vaccines used in routine immunisation programme,” he said.Functions and operationsCo-WIN keeps a record of everything — from inventory management (supply and storage) of vaccines, monitoring of temperature at the cold chain system, registration of beneficiaries, date and time of vaccination and final certificate on completing the vaccination.“At the district level, it will have all the details of the session sites along with the list of beneficiaries who will be inoculated at a particular site at a particular time,” said Singh.According to the guidelines, Covid-19 vaccine will be provided only to beneficiaries registered on Co-WIN. The process has already started with the registration of healthcare workers in the district. More than 36,000 vaccine beneficiaries for the first phase are already registered on the Co-WIN platform. The process of registering frontline workers, part of the priority group, is yet to be started.According to Singh, with the help of Co-WIN, they will club together at least 100 beneficiaries per session site for inoculation. “At present, we have the list of healthcare workers of private hospitals, nursing homes, clinics and diagnostic labs. Through the application, 100 beneficiaries will be allocated one designated session site, along with the date and time for vaccination,” said Singh.Likewise, for the second dosage of Covid-19 vaccine, the portal will generate the date and time. “And, once the vaccination has been completed, it will also generate a certificate which people can collect at Common Service Centre (CSC),” said Singh.The digital platform will have the list of vaccinating officers and supervisors who will be administering the vaccine. “Through the application, vaccinating officers will verify the registered beneficiary at the session site. Only after authentication, people will be inoculated,” said Singh.The ID proofs should correspond to the details provided while registering on the Co-WIN platform.The vaccination team at session sites will consist of five members. A vaccinating officer, who will be authorized to give vaccine; vaccinating officer 1 (police personnel, civil defence) who will do the registration; vaccinator officer 2, who will verify the identification documents; vaccinator officers 3 and 4, who will be responsible for crowd management.Self-registration on Co-WINThe portal will also have a self-registration link for others who are currently not covered under prioritised population. The self-registration, however, will be available in the later phases of implementation, according to Covid-19 guidelines. Citizens will have to provide basic details like name, date of birth, permanent and current address, details of co-morbidities, along with an ID proof.Planning aheadThe district health department will also reach out to the deputy commissioner regarding the Co-WIN platform and other aspects of vaccination on December 18 as a part of the task force meeting, to discuss issues of manpower, identification of session sites, such as community centres, schools and banquet halls, besides the existing 1,275 sites used for routine immunisation.“MCG will be roped in to provide the list of frontline workers who will have to be registered on the Co-WIN platform. They will be deployed as vaccinating officers, who will be assisting in multiple stages of vaccination from verification of documents to keeping a tab on adverse events following immunisation,” said Dr Virender Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-officials-undergo-co-win-system-training-for-vaccine-management/story-WYsdBtbfXUufLEPyI49JoM.html
15-12-2020||Gurugram||53 property deeds in restricted area under DTCP scanner||As many as 53 registries carried out in the restricted area, within a 900-metre radius of the IAF ammunition depot, are under the scanner of the department of town and country planning (DTCP).DTCP officials said that they will probe whether a no-objection certificate has been obtained for carrying out the registry. A report will be submitted to the district administration in this regard in the next week, said officials. The decision was taken following a review meeting on the restricted area, organised by the district administration on Monday. As per the rules, for registration of sale deed of a plot in a controlled area smaller than or equal to one acre, the seller has to obtain a NOC from DTCP. Officials said that the norm for the area of the plots has been changed recently to curb the sale of small plots in agricultural lands. “The meeting was held to discuss the status of the restricted area around IAF ammunition depot, particularly in the 300 metres adjoining the depot. We have been asked to conduct a probe into the registration of 53 property deeds, which took place despite the restrictions. We will check whether NOC was issued by DTCP,” said Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, Gurugram. As per the norm, there can be no construction in the 900-metre area adjoining an ammunition depot. However, the state government, after several petitions by the local residents, had submitted in the Punjab and Haryana high court that notified area could be reduced to 300 metres, which would pave the way for regularisation of the remaining area, where a large number of residential constructions have come up. The court, however, directed the government to clear the area within 300 metres of the depot before such action is approved. Mann also said that the department has been asked to work jointly with other civic agencies to carry out demolitions in the 300-metre area. “A drone survey will also be conducted in this area to figure out the status of construction and for this, the air force authorities have also permitted that these machines can be flown up to a height of around 10 metres,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/53-property-deeds-in-restricted-area-under-dtcp-scanner/story-2sk8JiYHntiaNk3DEr2fWI.html
15-12-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram shivers as mercury hits season’s lowest of 4.5°C||The city recorded a minimum temperature of 4.5 degrees Celsius on Tuesday — the lowest of the season so far — nearly five degrees below the normal and six degrees below the previous day’s minimum temperature of 10.5 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature on Tuesday stood at 17.5 degrees Celsius, five degrees below the normal and a slight drop from the previous day’s maximum temperature of 18 degrees Celsius. Officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that cold winds from snow-capped mountains were responsible for the drop in mercury. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature will hover around 20 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature is expected to stay at 6 degrees on Wednesday. As per the weekly forecast, clear skies will prevail on Wednesday. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said, “When the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees below the normal, we say that it’s a cold day,” said Srivastava. He said that colder days could be expected this week. Another IMD official said that the minimum temperature could touch three degrees Celsius on Wednesday. “The temperature might settle at three degrees Celsius on Wednesday and hover around four degrees Celsius on Thursday and Friday, after which it might increase a little. The dip in temperature is primarily due to heavy snowfall in northern regions. There is no prediction of rain for now,” said the official. Air quality in the city stayed in the “moderate” category for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. Gurugram recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 184 (moderate), a deterioration from Monday’s AQI of 101, which was in the same category, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin. The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5) — the city’s primary pollutant — was recorded at 132.1 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) on Tuesday, as per the data by CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. The concentration of PM2.5 pollutants on the previous day stood at 235.45ug/m3. According to the early air quality warning system for the National Capital Region (NCR), the air quality is likely to remain in the “moderate” category on Wednesday and Thursday. The air quality is likely to start deteriorating marginally from Friday but will remain largely in the poor category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-shivers-as-mercury-hits-season-s-lowest-of-4-5-c/story-YhSWhniiR4ZdLOqNgJgSJM.html
15-12-2020||Gurugram||Three dead as speeding bus rams van near Farrukhnagar||Three college students were killed and four injured when a speeding Haryana Roadways bus rammed a van they were travelling in, on the way to Farrukhnagar, on Tuesday morning. The police said the collision took place near village Kaliyawas Chowk, 16 kilometres from the city on Gurugram-Farrukhnagar Road, around 8am. The van driver took a right turn towards a petrol pump and the speeding bus coming from Gurugram side rammed the van. The bus driver fled the spot as soon as people started gathering, said police. Seven injured students and at least seven bus passengers were rushed to the hospital, where doctors declared a woman and a man, later found to be cousins, dead. Another student died while undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Sector 38 on Tuesday afternoon. The deceased have been identified as Varsha (20), Akshay (21) and Prashant (20) of Luksar village in Jhajjar. The bus from Palwal depot was on its way to Jind from Gurugram. Rajesh Rathi (42), who was at the wheel of the van, sustained injuries and is undergoing treatment at a private hospital, the police said. Passersby, who witnessed the incident, informed the police control room. They told the police that the speeding bus skidded for at least 50 metres after hitting the van. Rathi said that he picked up students from different villages and dropped them at Shree Guru Gobind Singh Tricentenary (SGT) University in Farrukhnagar every day. “It seems the (bus) driver was not looking straight at the road and was talking. Before he could take control of the wheel, the bus rammed my van. I have been ferrying these students for the past one year and this is the first time such an incident has taken place. I am still not able to come out of trauma,” he said. Joginder Singh, sub-inspector of Farrukhnagar police station and investigating officer in the case, said that passersby helped ferry the victims to the hospital. “One of the students died in the afternoon, while undergoing treatment, and two died on the spot. The bodies were handed over to the families on Tuesday, after the autopsy,” Singh said. Singh said the extent of damage suggested that the bus was being driven at a speed higher than 100 kilometres per hour. A case under sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), and 304A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Farrukhnagar police station. The police said the deceased were students of nursing, pharmacy and physiotherapy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-dead-as-speeding-bus-rams-van-near-farrukhnagar/story-2aHKpu9KDLfG10nE7epUGL.html
15-12-2020||Gurugram||Community dependence survey, floral sampling done for proposed biodiversity park in Sohna||The district administration’s Gurujal Society — which is responsible for implementing the mandate of the Jal Shakti Abhiyan in Gurugram — has completed its floral sampling and community dependence surveys in Damdama and Kherla villages of Sohna block, where a biodiversity park is proposed to come up. A detailed project report (DPR) for the same is expected to be ready by March 2021, officials said on Tuesday.Gurujal’s proposal aims at reviving a native Aravalli forest on approximately 400 acres of hilly land over the next five years, with plantation work progressing on 50 to 100-acre plots. Preliminary socio-economic and ecological assessments of the area have been completed, as have drone reconnaissance surveys to help in demarcating the park’s boundaries.Gurujal found that the area houses an unspecified leopard population, evidenced by pug marks and droppings found on field visits. As part of the survey, the park has also been divided into 50-acre segments, with vegetation surveys carried out in each. “This gives us a granular picture of where invasive species are present, and where new native species need to be planted. We have already identified a nursery site to cultivate saplings and administrative approvals for nursery development have been completed,” said Shubhi Kesarwani, programme director, Gurujal.The project area, according to ecologist Sunil Harsana, has a richer presence of native rootstock than other Aravalli patches in Gurugram, such as Bandhwari, which have been denuded due to mining and real estate. While invasive species, such as mesquite trees, are also prevalent in the Damdama-Khedla patch, the vegetation is not as denuded, Harsana explained, adding that the biotic pressures on this forest are mainly from grazing and collecting of wood, which is far more manageable than rampant encroachment.The dependency survey found that the residents of Damdama and Kherla villages are highly reliant on the forest for natural resources, particularly for fuelwood. A report prepared by Gurujal states, “Overexploitation of forest resources continues to pose a severe threat... to the forest area of Damdama and Khedla villages.” The current population of both villages was found to be about 10,000 people, across 2,000-odd households.The dependency survey, which studied a sample size of 958 households, found that each household’s level dependence on forest resources depends on the size of the family, the median age of the family, their level of formal education, and their proximity to the forest.“Since forest activities are labour-intensive and require more workforce, it is largely larger families that are more dependent on forest and in both the villages, women are the ones who are visiting the area more for the collection of fuelwood. Households with large families have a higher demand for forest resources, and they have more human resources to meet this demand,” states Gurujal’s survey report.The survey also revealed an inverse relationship between the level of formal education of a household and its dependence on the forest. “Education creates alternate sources of employment, so educated people are less dependant on forest resources as higher education creates better sources of employment and other future opportunities. Hence, it diverts livelihoods to diverse fields from extracting forest resources so, there is an inverse relationship between education and forest dependency in both the villages,” Gurujal observed.It was also found that families with larger landholdings were less dependent on forest produce, since they had access to alternative means of livelihood other than agriculture and cattle grazing. Meanwhile, households with smaller landholdings were present in closer proximity to the forest, and use it to graze a range of livestock, from goats to cows, buffalo, bulls, camels and horses. “Villagers visit the forest area majorly for collection of fuelwood, grazing animals and to visit temples... Grazing and feeding livestock is dependent on forest resources, and it causes ecological pressure on the environment,” the survey report states.“We have to design the DPR keeping the interests of these people in mind. Otherwise, they may resist the development of the park. For example, since most foraging happens for firewood, we will have to redouble our efforts at implementing the Centre’s Ujjwala scheme in the area so that people have fuel to cook with. Our final project report will suggest more such measures so that community dependence on forest resources is made sustainable,” said Kesarwani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/community-dependence-survey-floral-sampling-done-for-proposed-biodiversity-park-in-sohna/story-G8G9sP76x65QNHTlutgKXP.html
15-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG to track sanitation staff using GPS-enabled smartwatches||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is planning to track its sanitation staff through GPS-enabled smartwatches to ensure their attendance at their designated areas of work, officials said.In July, around a dozen sanitation workers were given these smartwatches on a trial basis. MCG officials privy to the matter said that the feedback of the trial was positive and hence, they have decided to extend the coverage to all 8,000 sanitation workers gradually. Besides, the MCG is also attaching GPS machines to all sanitation vehicles.“The smartwatches have been extremely useful in the tracking the 12 sanitation workers as it gave us constant information of their movement and helped us keep a check on whether they were reporting to their designated areas of work. Now, we have decided to extend this to all the sanitation workers working under the MCG and then subsequently, cover other workers, if a need arises. Initially, around 600 sanitation workers will be given the smartwatches and gradually, it would be handed out to all,” a senior MCG official of the health wing said.For the procurement of smartwatches as well as developing an integrated software for the purpose, the MCG has floated a tender in excess of Rs 20 crore last week, said the official.“The feedback of the trial was positive and hence, we are looking to cover more sanitation workers with smartwatches. The MCG is committed to ensuring that all civic works are catered to, and completed in a timely manner,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.The MCG had decided to use these smartwatches after receiving complaints from residents that sanitation workers were failing to turn up, especially in Covid-19 containment zones, and that waste was not being collected for more than a week.The use of GPS-enabled smartwatches has led to protests by workers against public bodies in several cities in the past. In March, the union of sanitation workers of the Chandigarh municipal corporation protested against its use. They carried out a similar protest in October as well.In September, sanitation workers also protested outside the Noida authority office for using smartwatches.Naresh Kumar Malkat, the secretary for the Haryana Nagar Palika Karamchari Sangh and a sanitation supervisor for the MCG, said that whenever the civic body starts distributing smartwatches, sanitation workers in Gurugram will also protest against this move.“The smartwatches should be applicable to all MCG employees and not limited to just the sanitation workers. The MCG also needs to realise that most sanitation workers will not have the technological advancement to understand its functioning. They need to organise workshops explaining sanitation workers the way the smartwatches operate, step by step. We don’t expect that the MCG will take any steps in this regard and hence, we too will protest against the move when the distribution starts,” said Malkat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-track-sanitation-staff-using-gps-enabled-smartwatches/story-UbcAx8z69tJ5tWU3uWu5HL.html
15-12-2020||Gurugram||DTCP to deploy drones to identify offences in illegal colonies||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has decided to conduct a drone survey of around 700 illegal colonies that have come up in the district. Officials said that the drone survey will help in fixing the geographical range of the offences and identifying the constructions carried out in these colonies. Officials said that this decision has been taken to curb construction of illegal colonies in the city. There are around 650 illegal colonies that have already been identified and listed by the revenue department in its upgraded property registration software, they said. To conduct the survey using a drone, the department has asked its empanelled contractors to submit proposals, which shall be evaluated at the earliest so that the exercise can commence by next month. Sanjiv Mann, a senior town planner, said, “The survey will generate good quality pictures with technical specifications that will help the department finalise the status of each colony. Any new violation can be easily identified and action can be initiated using these pictures. It will also help the government identify the areas where more than 50 percent development has taken place so that a decision can be taken on their notification for grant of services and infrastructure.” Stopping large-scale illegal development of colonies in Gurugram has been a priority for the department of town and country planning in the last one and half years, as these colonies are burdening the city’s infrastructure and also causing revenue loss to the state government, said officials. As per DTCP estimates, around 100 colonies came up in 2019 and 2020 alone on the outskirts of the city, in Bhondsi, Badshahpur, Manesar, Farrukhnagar, Pataudi and Sultanpur, over 500 acres of land. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that they have carried out more than 100 demolition drives in the last one year to curb illegal constrictions and stringent action has been initiated against developers and property dealers. “The drone survey will greatly help in fixing the boundaries and status of construction in these areas. It has already been ensured that registries of properties in such colonies are not carried out by the revenue department,” he said. City-based property dealers suggest that the reason people are buying plots in illegal colonies is that the cost is less, payments can be made in parts and there is no need to follow building plans as prescribed by the DTCP and MCG. Also, many owners prefer to run shops, dairies and other ventures in such colonies, which is not allowed in approved areas, they said.According to Pravesh Singh, a property dealer who is familiar with these colonies, plots in such colonies are available for between Rs 10,000 per square yard and Rs 30,000 per sq yard, whereas the minimum starting price for buying a plot in an authorised colony is Rs 65,000 per sq yard. “The price difference is too high and for the lower-middle class, there is no other option,” he said. Mann, who was earlier the senior town planner of MCG, also said that under the present rules, there is no provision for creating basic infrastructure in illegal colonies. “These settlements need to be notified and only those developed on more than 50 percent can be regularised. The drone survey will also help in checking the level of development in these colonies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-to-deploy-drones-to-identify-offences-in-illegal-colonies/story-0bm1v0LBc8BAwWLMPKNTyI.html

According to the order, the senior superintendent of police of the CBI, Sector 30,Chandigarh, or the officer who is heading the office has been directed to arrest Bajwa and ensure his presence before the commission on or before the next date of hearing on March 3, 2021. Several house buyers have filed complaints against Bajwa, who faces around 45 cheque bounce cases amounting to ₹20 crore. He was declared a proclaimed offender in August last year and February this year.Raises concern over police workingWhile issuing the directions to the CBI, commission president Sanjiv Dutt Sharma also raised concern over the police working, adding that in “such peculiar circumstances, where the accused has parted with huge amount of poor litigants and is roaming freely despite issuance of notice of various non-bailable warrants against him, this commission is left with no alternative except to seek the help of some other agencies to maintain the rule of law in the State of Punjab”.“It is important to mention here that the accused is wilfully and intentionally not appearing before the commission. It is also mentioned that as per our record, he is facing a number of execution proceedings that are pending before this commission... We have also noticed that a number of non-bailable warrants are issued through SSP, Mohali, but every time some report comes with the remark that he is not found. We feel that even with the connivance of police, this man is trying to defeat the very purpose of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019,” noted the commission. Bajwa’s advocate Dinesh Kumar Sharma said: “We have not got the copy of the order yet, but we are refunding the money to the parties. Due to the lockdown, we could not sell our properties, and thus, were faced with financial issues. We will be sorting all the issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/consumer-commission-directs-cbi-to-arrest-sunny-enclave-promoter/story-cH0y7pHy5FQxSl1YI9K2JP.html
15-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh records first ‘cold day’ of season||Chandigarh recorded its first “cold day” of the season on Tuesday, following which India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned of cold wave conditions in the coming days.The IMD declares a “cold day” when minimum temperature falls below 10°C and maximum temperature falls 4.5-6.4°C below normal. On Tuesday, even as maximum temperature went up from Monday’s 14.6°C to 17.2°C, it was still five notches below normal. Meanwhile, minimum temperature went down from 11°C to 9.6°C, falling below 10°C for the first time since December 3.Visibility stayed over 1 kilometre in the morning. The weatherman said shallow to moderate fog will be present in the coming mornings, but it will disperse later with sunlight expected during the day. “Due to this, maximum temperature will increase, but clear weather at night will lead to drop in minimum temperature. Recent snowfall in Himachal Pradesh will also contribute to chances of cold wave conditions in and around Chandigarh,” he said. Cold wave occurs when minimum temperature falls 4.5-6.4°C below normal. In the next three days, maximum temperature is expected to remain between 17 and 18 degrees while minimum temperature will remain between 7 and 8 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-records-first-cold-day-of-season/story-oZWqAPWVdlaMm9gwLukKPL.html
15-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn to go ahead with Tribune flyover project||A year after the Punjab and Haryana high court stayed the axing and transplanting of trees for Chandigarh’s first flyover at Tribune Chowk, the UT administration has decided to go ahead with the project.The 1.6-km flyover is to be built from near the GMCH-32 roundabout up to the railway overbridge near Hallomajra on Dakshin Marg after passing over Tribune Chowk. On March 3 last year, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had laid its foundation stone. To come up at a cost of ₹184 crore, it is being touted as a solution to the traffic chaos witnessed at the busy intersection. However, after an NGO, The Run Club, moved the HC, the uprooting and cutting of trees was stayed in November last year. The project got further delayed as the administration got busy in Covid-19 pandemic management.Now, UT adviser Manoj Parida said a report has been prepared to be submitted in the HC before January 11, which is the next date of hearing. The report is in favour of constructing the flyover. “Earlier, 2,700 trees were to be axed, but now only 700 will be removed. We will go ahead with our plan to construct the ambitious project,” he said.On HC’s directions, Parida in December last year had constituted a technical committee to examine various suggestions on alternatives to the flyover project. As many as seven models were submitted to the committee, comprising senior UT officials and chief engineers from Punjab, Haryana and the National Highways Authority of India. After scrutinising all models, the committee had termed the alternatives unviable. Nearly 1.5 lakh vehicles cross the rotaries of Dakshin Marg and Purv Marg near Tribune Chowk on a daily basis. Initially, the UT administration had planned a 7-km flyover, but the Centre reduced the length to 3.5km. Later, the ministry of road transport and highways further reduced the length to 1.6km.

15-12-2020||Delhi||Cold wave conditions in Delhi from December 16 to 18||Delhi woke up to the coldest day in December, as the minimum temperature dropped to 4.1 degree Celsius on Tuesday morning. The capital is likely to witness cold wave conditions from December 16 to 18, according to forecasts made by the Regional Meteorological Center (RMC) in Delhi. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) designates days as cold wave days in the plains if the minimum temperature is 10 degree Celsius or lower and at the same time 4.5 degrees or more below the normal minimum temperature for the day for two consecutive days. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();North-western winds form Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir are the reason for the recent fall in Delhi’s temperature despite clear skies, HT reported on Tuesday. These states are experiencing heavy snowfall. The Delhi RMC has, however, forecast partly cloudy skies for the national capital from December 19 to 21, with shallow fog in the morning. This will bring relief from the cold. The skies are likely to remain clear until December 18.November was coldest since 1949November was exceptionally cold too in the national capital. The mean minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung station – considered to be representative of Delhi – was 10.2 degree Celsius. This was the lowest since 1949, when the mean minimum temperature was 10.2 degree Celsius. Four cold wave days were also experienced in the month. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();December so far is warmer than 2018To be sure, December so far has not been exceptionally cold in the national capital. The average minimum temperature observed at the Safdarjung station has been 10.15 degree Celsius. This is higher than the average minimum temperature observed during the same period in 2019 (9.05 degree Celsus) and 2018 (9.29 degree Celsius). The average maximum temperature for this period (26.7 degree Celsius) is also higher than that in 2018 (24.7 degree Celsius) and 2019 (23.1 degree Celsius) at the station.This can change as winter progresses. The IMD considers the December to February period as winter. It had predicted below-normal minimum temperatures for most subdivisions of north and northwest India at the beginning of the season. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Minimum temperatures are rising in Delhi and neighbouring areasThe below-normal minimum temperatures and cold wave conditions this year might have to do with moderate La Nina conditions prevailing in the Pacific Ocean. La Nina refers to a weather phenomenon in the east-central Equatorial Pacific when sea surface temperatures are below the long-term average. This leads to colder winters in India. The minimum temperatures in December in both Delhi and India have, however, been rising if we look at the long-term trend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cold-wave-conditions-in-delhi-from-december-16-to-18/story-qWgogVP5AZMRYrbVKPLjVK.html

Each operator has either one or two buses. Most of these buses are procured on bank finance. With schools closed there is no income. We are forced to pay the EMIs. Almost all sectors have opened up, but only schools have not started and there no chance of it starting soon.”Tanaji Salunke, another bus operator, said, “Since March, there is no income, but we have to insure the buses, even though they are standing still. Because buses are idle, maintenance has increased. As the operators are not able to pay EMI’s, financial institutes are threatening to seize the vehicles.”Nitin Dhole, Nana Kamate and Hemant Kulkarni, a triumvirate of operators, said, “The government must think about our livelihood. All taxes, like professional tax, should be waived. Government must instruct the banks to waive the interest on EMIs for the last few months.”Rashid Inamdar said, “We tried to tie-up with some companies for employee transport, but most of the companies are doing work from home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/school-bus-operators-declare-bankruptcy-as-emi-on-vehicles-begins-to-seriously-hurt/story-4bHckBhWBJ0r188Wlzag3L.html

He was immediately put on ventilation.Bhattacharjee’s condition improved very fast, said doctors who attended on the veteran CPI(M) leader at a well-known private hospital in south Kolkata. A 13-member medical board was formed for his treatment. Bhattacharjee has been suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for more than a decade. “Bhattacharjee was in a very critical state when he was admitted and we were extremely concerned. But the doctors chose the correct path of treatment and the former chief minister responded very well. He literally fought back,” Dr Rupali Basu, CEO of Woodlands Hospital, told HT.“He was discharged from hospital with acceptable clinical parameters. He was given homecare advice regarding nutrition, medication, nebulisation, bipap, physiotherapy etc. A team of doctors and nurses went to his home. Bhattacharjee interacted with us and thanked the doctors,” said Dr Basu. Also read: Pranab Mukherjee’s son does not want his book published.

Gurjeet Singh Lall attacked Allan Isichei, after the two had a brief verbal row over Lall’s spitting in the street. Lall was found guilty of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility in October; he was not present in court during sentencing on Monday.A person is detained under Section 37 of the mental health act, when the court is satisfied that it is necessary to do so to protect the public from serious harm. The court may also impose restrictions on discharge, which may be subject to permission from the ministry of justice, and conditions.Detective inspector Jamie Stevenson of Scotland Yard said, “It beggars belief that a man could go to his local pub for a quick drink on a Saturday evening and not return home, but that is the terrible reality that Isichei’s family have been left with. His loss is immeasurable, and is of course most felt by his loving family.”“There was no good reason for Lall to have had a knife in his possession that day, and no good reason for him to use it. I am glad that he was convicted after the jury rejected his claim that he was acting in self-defence, and that he has now been detained indefinitely,” he added.A Scotland Yard statement said that Isichei went to a pub before 6pm on the day, and left around 6.30pm. Moments later he encountered Lall as he walked towards his home on St Mary’s Avenue South.The two had a brief verbal disagreement over Lall’s spitting in the street. Words were exchanged and as Isichei walked away, Lall spat on the ground again, at which point Isichei turned. More words were exchanged.Lall produced a knife and used it to stab Allan in a struggle in which the latter managed to disarm him. Apparently not realising how badly he was injured, Isichei got up and walked down the street before stopping. He then staggered to a neighbour’s address and rang the doorbell, pleading for help.Police and paramedics treated him at the scene before placing him in an ambulance that was forced to stop shortly after it left as his condition deteriorated; he was pronounced dead around 8pm.The police traced Lall to his home address after following a blood trail from injuries he had sustained in the incident. A post-mortem found that Isichei had suffered multiple knife injuries. The cause of death was a wound to the abdomen. During police interview, Lall claimed, in a prepared statement, that he had acted in self-defence.Isichei’s family said, “He spent his time putting others before himself and the graphic camera footage shown in court clearly shows he was the victim of someone who chose to carry a knife.”The family added, “Why was a person with a history of carrying knives, who was only arrested while carrying one in January 2019, allowed to be back on the streets unsupervised to carry out this senseless killing?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/southall-spitting-row-indian-origin-man-sentenced-to-long-term-mental-hospital/story-At4T9poZPJJJiu6NSIOtHK.html
15-12-2020||Lucknow||‘Mungerilal ke haseen sapne’: UP minister’s jibe on AAP’s 2022 poll announcement||Uttar Pradesh minister Siddhartha Nath Singh on Tuesday made light of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would contest the 2022 UP assembly elections. Singh said that Kejriwal was a ‘habitual liar’ and that his government had failed to check the spread of Covid-19. In a lighter vein, Singh said Kejriwal’s attempt to enter the state’s political scenario was like ‘Mungerilal ke haseen sapne’ which, he added, would be called ‘Kejriwal ke haseen sapne’ after 2022 UP assembly polls. ‘Mungerilal ke haseen sapne’ was a popular comedy show of the 90s directed by Prakash Jha. Singh reminded Kejriwal of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, which the latter contested and lost badly in Varanasi, and said it was hard to imagine how he turned out the hapless people of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand from Delhi during the trying times of Covid-19. He said the Yogi government received them, provided them free ration, gave them sustenance allowance and got them tested for Covid-19 for free. Singh said, “It is surprising that the Delhi CM has something to comment on UP government despite his failure to meet the expectations of Delhi on more than one occasion.”Also read: PM Modi says farmers surrounding Delhi misguided, blames Opposition“UP has conducted more than two crore Covid-19 tests against 72 lakh done by Delhi. Delhi has a population of 2 crore while UP has a population of about 24 crore and the number of total cases in Delhi is 6.08 lakh and in UP the figure is 5.66 lakh. We are conducting over 1.75 lakh tests daily,” said Singh, who referred to Delhi high court’s observations against Delhi government for ‘poor’ handling of the Covid-19 crisis. Singh said UP government has received accolades from the World Health Organisation for the efficient Covid-19 management. “Now look at the facilities. We have two AIIMS in UP and you are not able to even manage one. We have added 52 new medical colleges in the state in the past four years. If you want to have more facts, we are open for a debate,” Singh said while challenging Kejriwal. Singh further said Kejriwal owed an apology to the people of Purvanchal for saying that they come to Delhi on a ticket of Rs 500 and get free treatment of Rs 5 lakh. He pointed out that “the unemployment rate of Delhi is over 45 per cent and we have given employment to over four lakh youths in the past three-and-a-half years. Over 1.5 crore youths have become self-reliant with the assistance of the state government… Delhi government also claims 1,024 primary schools. We have 1.35 lakh primary schools in UP and over 50,000 of them have been upgraded under ‘Kayakalp’ scheme.”Singh said Kejriwal was in the habit of confusing people. “He is claiming that AAP volunteers are moving around in the state with oximeters. I would suggest you (Kejriwal) to kindly get your oxygen level checked with an oximeter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/mungerilal-ke-haseen-sapne-up-minister-s-jibe-on-aap-s-2022-polls-announcement/story-85TRlygf156W686vQeIWtK.html

The government and the election department should also announce compensation if any person dies due to the infection, he added. “Otherwise, the elections should be postponed until the situation normalises,” he said.Chauhan said virus cases are likely to rise in winters and the union is worried about the well being of teachers. “We hope that the government and state election department will take notice of our genuine concerns,” he said.The district electoral officers of Shimla, Una, Kullu, Mandi and Hamirpur have issued the reservation roaster for the post of gram panchayat pradhan. The panchayat and urban local bodies (ULB) election are likely to be held in the state in January and announcement is likely be made soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-govt-teachers-union-resents-panchayat-polls-amid-pandemic/story-U0idosrdB9yq9bvB1Te9mL.html
15-12-2020||City||NABARD should focus on agriculture sector to uplift Himachal’s rural economy: CM||The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) should work with greater focus on the agriculture sector to strengthen the rural economy in Himachal Pradesh, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said on Tuesday.He was presiding over the NABARD State Credit Seminar 2021-22, organised by its regional office. The theme of the seminar was ‘Collectivisation of Agricultural Produce for Enhancing Farmers Income’. The CM also released NABARD State Focus Paper-2021-22 and a booklet on ‘Various Refinance Schemes of NABARD’ on the occasion.Thakur expressed hope that ‘The State Focus Paper’ will act as an input for the credit and infrastructure planning by bankers and state government to prioritise allocation of funds for development. He said this annual exercise aims at promoting the increased production in agriculture and allied sectors and generating job opportunities in the farm as well as non-farm sector by the envisaged credit support.“Being a special state, on account of its hilly terrain and other socio-economic conditions, planning needs of Himachal cannot be equated with other states,” the CM said.He said the state needs special parameters while working out its credit and developmental needs and implementing strategies. Average land holdings in Himachal Pradesh is one acre and constitute 88% of total land holdings of the state against the national average of 1.15 hectare and 86.21%respectively. Eighty percent of the total cultivated area in the state is rain-fed. All these factors of the low productivity and production of agriculture pose challenges for the planners and stakeholders, he said.Appreciating the concept of Farmer Producers’ Organisations (FPO) of NABARD, Thakur said the main objective of the FPOs was collectivisation of agricultural produce, value addition and collective marketing so that farmers can fetch better prices of their produce. He said the cumulative assistance sanctioned to the state under Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) was ₹8,679.28 crore as on date, which is a major facilitator in creation of infrastructure.The CM said bankers should issue Kissan Credit Cards to each and every eligible farmer in the state to facilitate them in availing credit as per their needs. He said NABARD has estimated ₹ 2,7724.04 crore credit potential in priority sectors in the state for current fiscal, which is 7.22% higher than year plan of ₹ 2,5857.26 crore. Agri laws in farmers’ interestThe CM said the Centre’s three agriculture laws are aimed at protecting the interests of farmers and free them from exploitation at the hands of middlemen. He said farmers will be able to get best price of their produce in any market of their choice.Thakur expressed hope that the professional and personal relationship between NABARD and Himachal Pradesh government will go a long way to benefit people of the state.Congratulates state police for bagging CCTNS awardChief minister Jai Ram Thakur congratulated director general of police Sanjay Kundu and members of Himachal Pradesh Police for being conferred the CCTNS Award for ‘Best Performing State’ in Good Practices on Criminal Crime Tracking Network Information System (CCTNS)/Inter-operative Criminal Justice System (ICJS) among hilly states of the country.Thakur expressed hope that Himachal Pradesh Police will continue its outstanding services to the people of the state in future and earn a name for the state.The award was announced during a two-day seminar organised by the National Crime Records Bureau on CCTNS and Inter-operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS). The seminar was presided by minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy.CCTNS is used by the police to create and share a database of crime and criminals with each other to track them in real time.

The cyber experts and officers of the Embassy of Nepal and India traced her with the help of her mobile number locations and her activities on social media on November 27. She was rescued by Sehore police.Police also arrested a resident of Asta, Mahesh Siloriya, 21, who called her to Sehore for marriage, under section 370 (trafficking), said Kripa Shankar Chaubey, member child welfare committee. “The girl’s mother works in a reputed company in the middle east while the girl lives with her father in Nepal. She was quite active on different social media platforms and was easily misguided by Siloriya,” said Chaubey.A senior police officer said that Siloriya had told the girl that he would kill himself if she didn’t come to Sehore.“The girl said she met with Siloriya over Tiktok two years ago. They used to talk with each other through video calls. The girl’s family came to know about their friendship a few months ago and they tried to stop her from talking to the man in India. In November, Siloriya called the girl and asked her to come to Sehore otherwise he would kill himself,” said Sameer Yadav, additional superintendent of police, Sehore. “The girl boarded a Kathmandu-Lucknow flight and reached Lucknow on November 25. He boarded a train on November 26 and reached Bhopal on November 27.

A BJP delegation from West Bengal, which met the Chief Election Commissioner in New Delhi on Monday, also cited discrepancies in the draft voters’ list and alleged that names of dead voters have not been deleted. “The BJP requests your intervention to ensure early deployment of CPF else the ruling Trinamool Congress, with the active support of West Bengal Police, will make campaign very difficult, resulting in widespread violence,” stated a letter submitted to the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC). Accusing the West Bengal Police of showing a partisan role, the BJP alleged that even though the attack on the convoy of JP Nadda, party’s national president, was carried out in full glare, the police remained silent spectators. “Political murders have been going on since the Lok Sabha polls and 132 BJP workers have been killed till date. They have got heightened in the last few months. The state police invariably deflect these as personal enmity and family feud and no action is taken. All this makes normal political activities very challenging.”Also read: PM Modi says farmers surrounding Delhi misguided, blames OppositionThe Trinamool Congress has rubbished the allegations saying that the BJP is doing a drama. “Deployment of central forces ahead of the elections is a routine exercise.

People have seen central forces in previous elections. They will vote for the TMC,” said Kunal Ghosh, a spokesperson of TMC. In a separate letter submitted to the CEC, a BJP leader from the state alleged that constituencies along the Indo-Bangla border have seen a sharp rise in new voter registration.“It gives an impression of illegal cross border infiltration duly supported by the local ruling party activists. This, if allowed, will not only affect the security of the country but will also have a profound impact on the entire election process,” Sabyasachi Dutta, BJP leader, wrote in his letter.The BJP has also requested the poll panel not to utilize member of the West Bengal State Government Employees Federation as they have allegedly pledged their support to the chief minister and her party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-bjp-requests-ec-to-deploy-central-forces-bring-in-model-code-of-conduct-at-earliest/story-CofWYd0eTtAl1GSJTsn9nJ.html

The decision was taken in a meeting attended by the chairman, director, deputy director and senior faculty of the AIIMS administration.“Our Union is ready for talks with the administration. We are feeling bad for patients but we’re helpless as our demands haven’t been met.

We were busy serving the people. But the government retracted from the demands that were met earlier. None of our demands are new. All of our demands are important.

15-12-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand okays police reforms, hiring of experts to solve complex crimes||Uttarakhand has agreed to a series of police reforms for achieving modernisation and efficacy including hiring of professionals to solve complex cybercrimes and economic offences apart from introduction of a digitised system for policing.These reforms, to be introduced over the next two years, were discussed between director general of police Ashok Kumar and State home secretary Nitesh Jha on Monday at the police headquarters. These suggestions were offered by nine committees formed by Kumar to consider necessary reforms and turning the State police SMART which, when expanded, stands for sensitive and strict, modern with mobility, alert and accountable, reliable and responsible and trained and techno-savvy. “The suggestions for the reformative measures given by the committees were discussed in detail with the home secretary who in principle agreed to implement most of them,” said DGP Kumar.“Among the major reforms, state police would hire the services of professionals in solving cases of cybercrime and economic offences which are becoming complex and serious day by day. Apart from this, e-beat book system would also be implemented to digitise the working in police stations,” said Kumar. He also announced that the State police would soon acquire 100 MUVs to improve the mobility and response time of police. “These cars will have modern equipment on the lines of UP’s Dial 100 mechanism. To modernise the city police, we would equip them with short-range weapons instead of long-range ones. The tourist police will also be improved with development of new infrastructure for them,” Kumar added. On reducing the stress of posting in hilly areas among the personnel, Kumar said that its tenure would be halved. “The posting tenure in hilly areas would be reduced to 8 from 16 years for constables and for head constables, it would be reduced from 12 to 6 years and 8 to 4 years for sub-inspectors,” said Kumar.

We would also increase the cash reward limit of DGP to police personnel from existing Rs 20,000 to Rs 2 lakh. A separate budget will be there for it,” said Kumar. Among the other important reforms, he said, “Police would introduce the entry of women in fire service and continue the practice of serving e-summons, which was introduced during the pandemic to deal with restrictions. We have also planned a new PHQ building soon which would be spread in an area of about two acres.” Also Read: Sherwood College: Uttarakhand police books 50 people including principal Home secretary Nitesh Jha said that the home department has agreed to most of the reforms except a few on financial grounds which, too, would be resolved soon.

The court had, thereafter, issued several directions to the authorities to survey whether buildings in Delhi were compliant with the norms of seismic stability, identify non-compliant ones, take necessary action and also develop an action plan.In his plea seeking contempt action against the authorities, Bhargava has said that “despite serious intervention by the high court over a period of five years”, the authorities “have shown little concern for larger public interest and did not move an inch” to formulate and implement an action plan.He has contended that there has been a “deliberate and wilful non compliance/violation of various orders” passed by the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-seeks-aap-govt-dda-stand-on-contempt-plea-over-quake-stability-orders/story-wW6mzTOuVByyUQqvozEeJN.html

The app also has a panic button which connects the person directly with the SP in case of any emergency. The police-people mobile app interface is the brainchild of 2014 batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Santosh Kumar, posted as Sheohar SP. He made a presentation before Prime Minister Narendra Modi and senior officials from the Union home ministry at the 54th All India Conference of Director Generals and Inspector Generals of Police -2020, earlier this month.“It is a proud moment for Bihar police in general and Sheohar police in particular to get recognised at the national level. The initiative is transparent, corruption-free and unbiased. Other states are also following, as it has instilled confidence about policing and developed a bonding of trust between police and people,” said the SP, who is an engineering graduate from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (NSIT), Delhi University.

15-12-2020||Mumbai||Save aircraft carrier Viraat from dismantling: Shiv Sena to Centre||The ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra on Monday urged the Centre to grant a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for the transfer of the decommissioned aircraft carrier Viraat, being dismantled at Alang in Gujarat, to convert it into a museum.In a letter to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, party MP and spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi stated, “It would be a crying shame if we let go our history without giving the benefit of knowledge to our future generation.“Viraat’s preservation is well merited and deserving of strong consideration. It can be saved if the Government of India so desires. I am certain that the Maharashtra Government will be ready to cooperate in restoring and preserving the historic ship”.Chaturvedi pointed out that a sea harrier monument was recently dedicated to Mumbai with an aim to motivate the youth to serve the nation.She said the monument keeps the legacy of Viraat alive.Viraat, the world’s longest serving warship that was decommissioned by the Indian Navy three years ago, arrived off the Alang coast in Gujarat for dismantling in September this year.The warship, which was inducted into the Indian Navy in 1987, was purchased by Shree Ram Group for a sum of Rs 38.54 crore at an auction in July this year.Chaturvedi further said a model of INS Mumbai was also dedicated to the city of Mumbai at Worli.“Let Viraat be a living, breathing and thriving memorial of India’s nationalism, patriotism and pride. Let us be preservers than destroyers of our rich history,” she said.Though there is an offer to convert the warship into a museum it awaits a No Objection Certificate from the Defence Ministry for transfer of the ship, she wrote. “Granting the NoC would help save the ship. We must use our decommissioned naval ships to help citizens better understand the significance of India’s maritime history,” Chaturvedi stated.Viraat holds the record for being the world’s longest serving warship.It was the second centaur-class aircraft carrier which was in service with the Indian Navy for 29 years before being decommissioned in March 2017.There were proposals in the past to preserve it as a maritime museum.In July 2019, the Central government said in Parliament that the decision to scrap Viraat was taken in due consultation with the Indian Navy.It is the second aircraft carrier to be broken down in India. In 2014, Vikrant was dismantled in Mumbai.In November, 2018, the Maharashtra government cleared an estimate of Rs 852 crore for the ambitious maritime museum project - which was to be located in Sindhudurg district along the coastal Konkan belt of the state.In May, 2019, the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) floated Expressions of Interest (EOI) for converting Viraat into an integrated tourism facility and for operating it on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) basis.However, there were no takers for the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/save-aircraft-carrier-viraat-from-dismantling-shiv-sena-to-centre/story-cMngWKEELQaUMwt8WOQOKO.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Artist by the road||Like the pages of an art-gallery coffee table book, the pavement wall consists of a series of hand-drawn paintings. One shows a woman peeking out from behind her veil. Nearby, with a setting sun in the background, a woman is sitting on a seaside cliff while a man in glasses gazes towards the viewer. Who can these people be? What is their story?“There is no story,” says Sarju Gihara, the painter. In his 20s, he has drawn these panels on the boundary wall of Gurugram’s Government Industrial Training Institute. His painting stall, crammed up with paint cans and brushes, stands on the pavement facing the busy Mehrauli Road. Slim and solemn, Mr Gihara has brooding eyes and a soothing voice. His calm face evokes the immense patience that artists cultivate during long sittings, working on a same canvas for hours or even for days.“I actually saw two separate images on the newspaper, they fascinated me and I put them together,” he says, referring to the panel with no story.There are other art works, too, along the wall. And next to his stall, on a single wooden frame, the introspective portraits of two men draw the attention —“this is me, and this is my friend Ramu.”Mr Gihara now takes out his mobile and scrolls through pictures of the works he executed as assignments for a handful of institutions in the city. One is a wall-sized Taj Mahal in a government school. He is blushing, as if showing off wasn’t part of his nature.“I’m not para-likha (literate),” he clarifies without any prompt. But he has painted the word ‘painter’ in Hindi in many places along the wall. “A friend wrote it for me on a sheet of paper, and I simply drew the alphabets, as I would have drawn people or nature.”Mr Gihara’s father, a native of Badaun in UP, has been running a bamboo blinds stall on this same footpath, a bit farther away, for years. “I’ve spent my whole life here,” Mr Gihara says. Gesturing towards the roadside, he mutters that “this whole stretch is my childhood.”While well-versed in his father’s profession, the young man’s passion lies in drawing and painting, and it has been so since his early years. Like many artists, he is trying to earn through his art. He also paints shop hoardings and sign boards on commission.His father used to paint too, but gave that up after his marriage. Mr Gihara will never do that, he says. “My dream is to become a kabildar (talented) painter and earn through my abilities... I’m nowhere near it, but I’m trying.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-artist-by-the-road/story-ejMZaVLs9JfrVuBnwJR7UM.html
15-12-2020||City||The downfall of Mohali’s Purab Premium Apartments||Once touted as a game changer in high-storey housing projects in the city, the Purab Premium Apartments in Sector 88 have failed to meet the high expectations and are, in fact, hitting new lows.Poor facilities, unsafe surroundings and absence of a security system have made the Rs 750-crore project untouchable among prospective buyers. And a lack of interest by the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has been one of the key reasons behind the downfall of the 15-storey housing project the contract for which was given to Simplex Infrastructure Private Limited.Out of a total 1,620 flats, built in three categories, almost half of the flats are empty, and going by the past record, are unlikely to fill up in the future, too. Besides, of the total flats, 954 have been allotted, but only 600 families are residing there. Also, 186 units are either surrendered by the allottees or unsold, while 480 dwellings are still not ready for allotment.On Monday, the residents of Purab Premium held a protest outside PUDA Bhawan in Sector 62 against GMADA. The allottees even stated they were ready to sell their property, but no one was ready to buy.Written complaint submitted to VBWhat’s more, the project also came under the scanner of the Punjab vigilance Bureau after residents in a written complaint had alleged that sub-standard material was used in the construction and that whatever was promised in the brochure before they invited applications was not in the detailed notice inviting tenders (DNIT). The residents also alleged huge financial irregularities.Col Dalwinder Singh (retd), general secretary of the residents association said, “The project was publicised as a dream project with world-class amenities, but this remained only on paper. Of all other projects launched by private builders, Purab Premium Apartments are considered the worst and no one is ready to buy a flat here.”A resident, SK Loona, said the residents felt insecure as many tenants were staying as paying guests and created ruckus for them. Many tenants were staying without proper rent agreements or police verification and some had shown forged documents, he added.Other residents have alleged that GMADA installed a low-capacity and poor-quality water tank on the top floors of the building and that the tanks were unable to bear the pressure and were breaking down.Out of a total 38, 50% of lifts were not working, housekeeping services had not been restored, horticulture services were not being provided, basement parking was not yet ready, CCTV cameras were non-functional, and neither were light sensors and light timers. Since the outbreak, cleaning of the common area, garbage lifting and horticulture were not being carried out and even prior to that, the arrangements were sporadic.Chief engineer of GMADA Devinder Singh said, “Since the agency abandoned work, it took some time to allot the work at our own risk and cost. Now, we have allotted the maintenance work and it will be sorted out soon.”Last year in October, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) had imposed a fine of ₹59 lakh on GMADA for illegal use of electricity in different cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/the-downfall-of-mohali-s-purab-premium-apartments/story-qVESMi41Hm3ow8cPLiBxIP.html

15-12-2020||Chandigarh||Handing over GMSH-16 to private player to set up medical college on Chandigarh admn’s mind||Even as it is persuading the central government to upgrade Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, to a medical college, the UT administration is now also mulling over handing over the facility to a private player for achieving this.The alternative is based on a scheme proposed by the Niti Aayog - “Scheme to link new and/or existing private medical colleges with functional district hospitals through PPP”. Under the scheme, the entire infrastructure of the hospital will be handed over to a private player and in exchange, the corporate will establish the medical college and operate the OPD services. Of the total beds of the hospital, half will be marked as “market beds” and the rest as “regulated beds”. Market beds will have a market price tag, which will help subsidise the regulated beds. Confirming the proposal, UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “We had earlier submitted a detailed project report with the ministry of health and family welfare for establishing an undergraduate medical college at GMSH-16. Now, we are also exploring a new scheme under which the hospital will be handed over to a private player for upgrading it to a medical college.” UT officials are scheduled to attend a meeting with the central government officials and the Niti Aayog on the issue on Tuesday. “We will further examine the alternative after attending the meeting,” said Parida. Adding that it is still in concept stage, Parida said, “In any privatisation plan, existing service conditions of employees are protected.”100 more MBBS seats for cityUnder the plan submitted with the government, the medical college is proposed to offer 100 MBBS seats, associated with the 500-bed hospital. GMSH, spread over 12 acres, is already offering Diplomate of National Board programmes in five specialities. In order to establish the medical college’s academic block, libraries and hostels, UT had earmarked 15 acres at Sarangpur village. The city currently has only 150 MBBS seats at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, which also has 125 seats for postgraduate programmes. The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research offers only postgraduate programmes with around 310 seats. The process for affiliation of the proposed medical college has also begun, and requisite documents have been submitted to Panjab University. For departments, such as anatomy, which have not been established at GMSH, but are a basic requirement for the MBBS course, faculty members from GMCH, Sector 32, will be roped in until the new college starts functioning in a full-fledged manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/handing-over-gmsh-16-to-private-player-to-set-up-medical-college-on-chandigarh-admn-s-mind/story-6LzoDnylRU5HzmxRdsM0vM.html

15-12-2020||Chandigarh||Sippy Sidhu Murder: CBI says no evidence found against judge’s daughter||Five years after city based lawyer Sippy Sidhu’s murder, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has informed the CBI court that it has no evidence of the involvement of a former Punjab and Haryana high court judge’s daughter in the crime. The Federal agency, however, has said it will like to keep investigations open as it has “strong suspicions about the role of (woman’s name hidden) to eliminate Sippy Sidhu.”Lawyer Sukhmanpreet ‘Sippy’ Singh Sidhu, 36, was shot dead in a Sector 27 park in Chandigarh on September 20, 2015. The case was transferred to CBI in 2016 after allegations by his family about the involvement of the judge’s daughter. The woman, reportedly a friend of Sippy, was summoned and questioned twice by Chandigarh police during the initial probe. Sippy’s family had held protests alleging that she was being shielded by the police. The UT administration had on January 22, 2016, recommended a CBI probe in the case. Why final report if probe kept open, asks courtAccording to the order of the special magistrate court for CBI, Ravish Kaushik, the CBI report said that despite thorough investigations the bureau could not gather sufficient evidence against the “accused.” Even though CBI termed the report “final”, it requested the court to give directions to continue further investigations and accept an “untraced report”. To this, the court said it “fails to understand” how this report could be treated as final if investigations were kept open. “If investigations on certain aspects are still pending then why is the CBI filing an untraced report?” the court asked. It (court) has now has directed the investigating officer to clarify if the document is a final report, untraced report or just a simple status report.Directions were also issued to CBI to submit the documents and statements of the witnesses mentioned in the report.Sippy’s mother Deepinder Kaur Sidhu has also questioned the final report, alleging “from the outset we have been saying it’s the judge’s daughter who is involved. If they have submitted any such final report, then they must have been pressurised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sippy-sidhu-murder-cbi-says-no-evidence-found-against-judge-s-daughter/story-Qmbo7FVW57hwMhgxixNCsI.html

He is being supported by four of his friends, who are escorting him in a car.Sekhon said his elder brother Gurvinder Grewal had been camping at Tikri border for the last two weeks to protest against the Centre’s three farm laws.“I am a professional horse rider and decided to reach the dharna site on horseback. My family cultivates on nearly 100 acres of land and we know the consequences of these three laws. I will travel 335km on my horse to reach Tikri border. After that, I am planning to visit Chilla, Ghazipur and Singhu border to extend support to the farmers,” he added.He said there was no need to carry food or other essential items because everything was being provided by farmers on the way to Delhi borders. “The farmers are coming forward to feed my horse too. The farming community is so humble that they are making all arrangements for humans as well as animals while the Union government is so egoist that it is not listening to the farmers’ grievances,” he added.The rider further said farmers from Haryana and Punjab are coming in large numbers to join the agitation at Delhi border.“In our absence, my parents will look after our fields. I will return home only after the Union government repeals these three laws,” Sekhon said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-man-sets-off-on-horseback-to-join-farmers-agitation/story-q9CXc0F2zQkEmCrx1jAhrJ.html
15-12-2020||City||Former servicemen from Haryana plan to return 3,200 gallantry medals||Expressing solidarity with protesting farmers, former servicemen from Haryana have collected 3,200 gallantry medals which they are planning to return to President Ram Nath Kovind if the government fails to repeal the three controversial farm laws.Kapil Dev, a resident of Haryana, who had retired from the rank of naik, said the former servicemen under the banner of ‘Sabka Sainik Sangharsh Committee’, which comprises retired soldiers from Haryana, Punjab, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, have written a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind to return 25,000 medals in protest against these three laws.“We have collected over 3,200 medals so far and waiting for the President’s reply. This government has failed to understand the pain of farmers and soldiers. We are deeply hurt by the Haryana government’s decision of digging roads and using water cannons and tear gas to restrict farmers from reaching Delhi borders. Our sons are fighting on the border and we are growing food for the nation. But there are some people who are calling us terrorists, Khalistanis and Maoists,” he added.Balwan Singh, 80, from Jhajjar, said eight men from his family have sacrificed their lives for the nation. “We know very well how to secure the borders and feed the people of this country. These politicians neither know how to grow food nor how to protect the nation, but still they are explaining us the benefits of these three farm laws. It is a very shameful act,” he added. Subedar Major (retd) SP Singh from Punjab’s Gurdaspur said he served in the army for 30 years before retiring in 2013.“I had been cultivating on my two acres of land. The government wants to keep soldiers and farmers in deplorable conditions. The government brought these laws to ruin farmers. Those people, whose forefathers never went to the border and fields, are telling the benefits of these laws and calling us anti-national,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-servicemen-from-haryana-plan-to-return-3-200-gallantry-medals/story-gAfugRaSA7H3CylcGLX6NO.html
15-12-2020||City||Farmers protest outside DC offices in Haryana||Farmers came out in large numbers and took out protest marches before holding day-long demonstrations outside the offices of deputy commissioners (DCs) in Haryana as the agitation against Centre’s three farm laws evoked massive response on Monday. Not only the opposition parties, but different employees’ bodies such as Haryana Sarv Karamchari Sangh and Asha Workers’ Association also extended support to the peasants. The agitation has already brought several farmer associations on a single platform. The protests remained peaceful. In Karnal, hundreds of Sarv Karamchari Sangh members marched in support of the farmers, while in Kurukshetra, the district bar association joined the dharnas at the mini secretariat. In Rohtak, farmers came out on tractors and assembled outside DC office. The farmers held protests outside the offices of DCs in Hisar, Bhiwani, Sonepat, Jhajjar, Jind, Fatehabad and many other districts. “Everybody should come forward to join this fight for the future of the farming community,” said Ratan Mann, Haryana BKU (Tikait) state president. Vikram Kisana, a farm leader protesting at Kaithal mini secretariat, said even as elderly farmers and women were protesting in harsh winter conditions, the government was not taking them seriously. He said that the farmers’ agitation has now become a “jan andolan”. The district authorities had made elaborate arrangements and heavy police deployment was made around the mini secretariat buildings. In Rohtak, police placed barricades near the DC office. In Jind, farmers removed barricades outside DC’s office and entered the building to give their memorandum. Former Congress’ Meham MLA Anand Singh Dangi sat with farmers outside Rohtak DC office, while former INLD MLA Om Prakash from Loharu extended support to the farmers at Bhiwani’s Siwani. Protesters had started assembling around 9am and lifted their protests at 5pm after submitting memorandums of their demands to the DCs. Gherao Kanwar Pal’s residence in YamunanagarFarmers and activists affiliated with the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU, Charuni) gathered outside the residence of Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal in Yamunanagar’s Jagadhri as part of their protest against the three farm laws on Monday. The protesting farmers asked the minister to “leave” the government to stand in their support. Earlier, farmers with support from the district bar association, Sarv Karamchari Sangh, and other unions had staged a sit-in at Jagadhri Grain Market. Similar protests were seen in Ambala. Dushyant urges farmers to end stirUrging farm unions to end the agitation and hold talks with the Centre, Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Monday said the central government had been working in the interest of farmers.“The farmer organisations should also take steps that are beneficial for the agriculture sector...as the farmers are facing losses due to this protest,” he said in Delhi after meeting Union road and transport minister Nitin Gadkari to expedite road development works in the state.In a statement, an official spokesperson said that during the meeting with Gadkari, the deputy CM discussed various issues, including farmers’ agitation.Responding to a question regarding the same, he said, “A positive solution is expected soon.”Stating that “initially the farmer organisations wanted to include the MSP in writing,” he said now the central government has agreed to it.Dushyant said under the Bharatmala project, three greenfield corridors were being constructed in the state — first from Amritsar to Gujarat, second from Gurugram to Gujarat and third from Ismailabad (Kurukshetra) to Narnaul.He said that the state government had placed a demand for the construction of East-West Corridor in Haryana before Gadkari and two proposals were sent by the state government to the Centre in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-protest-outside-dc-offices-in-haryana/story-kmKGtTsyUBN9AOapiJL5nN.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC reprieve for bank CEO booked in ₹3.18-crore loan fraud case||The Bombay high court (HC) has granted interim protection from arrest to Sanjay Sawant, chief executive officer (CEO) of Raigad Sahakari Bank, booked in connection with purported fraudulent disbursement of ₹3.18 crore as loans against forged life insurance policies drawn in the name of 124 Mumbai residents.The alleged fraud came to light after one of the bank’s account holders, Jayashree Sawant, received communication from the bank for repayment of a loan of ₹5.75 lakh.On May 18, 2019, Kalachowky police station registered an offence based on her complaint, alleging that one Adavkar had forged life insurance policies in her name and used them to obtain the loan.The investigation revealed that in all, loans of ₹3.18 crore were disbursed by the bank in the name of 124 residents, using similar modus. Police have since arrested some bank officials and private individuals linked with the fraud. Sawant, the bank’s CEO, had moved HC, claiming that though loans were sanctioned under his signature, he had to depend on the report made by his subordinates. He maintained that the forged documents were so similar to originals that it was impossible to notice any difference. He urged the court to grant him pre-arrest bail, claiming that he was misled by the main accused Adavkar, an agent of the bank, and some of his bank officials.Assistant public prosecutor Pallavi Dabholkar opposed the plea by pointing out that Adavkar was appointed to the bank by the Sawant himself — indicating that the CEO was hand in glove with the prime accused. She submitted that looking at the large number of victims, it was impossible to believe that the CEO had no role to play in the fraud.Justice Sarang Kotwal, however, noticed that the charge-sheet filed in June against other accused in the case made no reference to any role played by Sawant. The judge felt that it was possible that the bank CEO was misled by the forged documents, and granted him interim anticipatory bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-reprieve-for-bank-ceo-booked-in-3-18-crore-loan-fraud-case/story-IqHkzJGMOGdL4Q3pNGl2CO.html
15-12-2020||Chandigarh||Virus spread in Haryana continues to dip for third week in row||After a gap of 49 days, fresh coronavirus infections reported in Haryana came down to a four-digit figure last week as the decline continued for a third successive week. The state reported 8,496 new cases between December 7 and 13 as compared to 11,374 the week before, according to the health department data. The weekly drop in infections was thus of 2,878. The decline had started in the last week of November after a sharp surge in infections during the festive season and due to a range of relaxations in terms of allowing different activities, including reopening of educational institutions. The three-week dip in number of new infections is significant in view of enormous amount of sampling, particularly the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, being done for the last three weeks. The RT-PCR is considered the gold standard test for Covid-19 diagnosis. Over 8 lakh samples tested in 21 daysA health official said more than eight lakh samples were tested in the last three weeks and in about 87% of these, RT-PCR kits were used. Officials, however, said that the decline in infections should not lead to lowering of guard as a fresh spike in cases can occur during the winters. As per the sampling data, a record 2.81 lakh people were tested across the state during November 23-29 followed by 2.79 lakh people during November 30-December 6 and 2.43 lakh last week. Following the aggressive testing, the positivity rate in the state has shown a gradual decline. It came down to 6.4% from last week’s 6.54%, data showed. Seven of the 22 districts have a critical positivity rate of more than 6% with Karnal dropping out of the critical category, according to last week’s data. The other critical districts also showed a decrease in positivity rate. Faridabad’s positivity rate came down to 11.7% from 12.1%, while Gurugram’s dipped to 9.2% from 9.6%. Rewari recorded positivity rate of 8.2% from last week’s 8.37% and Hisar’s rate came down to 7.2% from 7.6%. Panchkula maintained 7.7% positivity rate, while Panipat district’s positivity rate dropped to 7.4% from 7.5%. Ambala’s rate plunged to 6.8% from 7.1%. Thirteen districts — Karnal, Mahendergarh, Sonepat, Rohtak, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad, Sirsa, Bhiwani, Yamunanagar, Palwal, Jind, Kaithal and Jhajjar — had positivity rate of less than or 6%, but higher than the desirable positivity rate of less than 2%. Charkhi Dadri (1.6%) and Nuh (1.2%) maintained their desirable positivity rate of less than 2 %. Meanwhile, the state death toll due to the disease rose to 2,733 on Monday with 16 more fatalities, while 993 fresh cases pushed the infection tally to 2,53,385. The fresh fatalities included four from Hisar, three from Panipat and two each from Sonepat, Rohtak and Fatehabad districts. The bulletin said that among the districts which reported a big spike in cases included Gurugram (197) and Faridabad (175). Haryana’s recovery rate is 95.33%, according to the bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/virus-spread-in-haryana-continues-to-dip-for-third-week-in-row/story-kiy9gUuJDEGU3jrt8CpxPI.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||Accused is not influential, her tweets about Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, Aaditya Thackeray, did not incite anyone, claims her counsel||The counsel for Thane resident Sunaina Holey, who has been booked under section 505(2) and 153(A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for posting abusive tweets against chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and his son minister Aditya Thackeray, has submitted that as per a Supreme Court (SC) judgement, Holey is not an influential person and hence her tweets and comments should be disregarded. Her attorney said that her comments posted between July 25 and 28 on Twitter should not be treated like comments made by politicians and journalists that incite hatred among communities. Holey has applied for quashing of the first information report (FIR) against her by the Mumbai Police and cyber cell. In his submissions to the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik, advocate Dr Abhinav Chandrachud referred to the SC judgement of July 2020 in the Amish Devgan case, wherein it was observed that cognisance needed to be taken against controversial statements made by influential people. While referring to Devgan, the Apex court held that the statements made by him during a television programme were objectionable as they hurt the sentiments of a community. Dr Chandrachud then referred to the other observations made by the SC bench, wherein it had laid down a principle with regards to application of section 153(A). He submitted that the principle clearly distinguished between statements and comments made by influential people and those made by the common man. He submitted that as Holey was neither a journalist nor a politician, she would fall in the latter category and hence, her comments against the CM and his son should be disregarded. He further submitted that the statements in no way created any law and order situation, and the entire premise of her booking was misconceived. However, senior counsel Manoj Mohite opposed the submission and informed that Holey followed the central ruling party on Twitter and had thousands of followers, implying that her tweets could have resulted in inciting people and creating a law and order situation. While responding to a query by the bench in an earlier hearing as to how foreign courts dealt with the issue, Dr Chandrachud, while referring to a judgement by the US Supreme Court in the Whitney versus the State of California, submitted that the court had made an observation which is a classic. “The court held that bad speech could be reformed by more speech and not by silencing it,” he said. He further cited sections of the judgement which differentiated between advocating and inciting. Dr Chandrachud said that courts across the globe had upheld the right to freedom of speech and expression wherein the individual was advocating a thought but not inciting others. In the case of Holey, he submitted that she had only expressed her views but had not incited anyone against the CM and his son. Due to paucity of time, the court adjourned the matter and posted it for hearing on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/accused-is-not-influential-her-tweets-about-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-aaditya-thackeray-did-not-incite-anyone-claims-her-counsel/story-0uMbhom9qS46OSR6Q2u3hO.html
15-12-2020||Chandigarh||You’ll sell your soul if it serves your purpose: Punjab CM hits back at Kejriwal||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday hit out at his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal for making “desperate attempts” to hide his government’s failure to protect famers’ interests, adding that it will not save him and his Aam Aadmi Party from their wrath in the next Punjab assembly elections. “Just as every Punjabi knows that I am not one to be cowed down by any amount of false enforcement directorate (ED) or other cases, they also know that you (Kejriwal) will sell your soul if it serves your purpose,” he said, reacting to the AAP leader’s Twitter post that alleged Amarinder struck a deal with the Centre to get his son’s ED case forgiven.Daring Kejriwal to cite an instance when he (Amarinder) backed off under pressure of ED or any other agency, the Punjab CM pointed out that from the Operation Bluestar to SYL and now farm laws issue, he had always done the right thing for his people. Asserting that the whole world had seen how Kejriwal had sold off farmers’ interests by notifying one of the farm laws in the national capital at a time when farmers were preparing to march to Delhi, Amarinder said the Delhi chief minister had exposed his own “setting” with the central government/Taking a dig at Kejriwal’s anger over the conspiracy of certain vested interests to undermine the farmers’ agitation by linking it with anti-nationalism, the Punjab CM said farmers needed no endorsement of their genuineness from the man who had hobnobbed with Khalistanis in the run up to the 2017 state polls. Meanwhile, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) leaders Manish Tiwari, Ravneet Bittu and Jasbir Singh Dimpa also lambasted Kejriwal and his party for trying to mislead people with their “fake propaganda” and using old pictures of Amarinder Singh with Ambanis, and spreading lies and unsubstantiated accusations against the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/you-ll-sell-your-soul-if-it-serves-your-purpose-punjab-cm-hits-back-at-kejriwal/story-40QaWrk9FYl6LjYrmpfYbL.html

Holding photographs of the deceased farmers, their kin will raise the issue of farm suicides and agrarian crisis in the state. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), which has been protesting against the Centre’s new agriculture laws at the Tikri border for the past two weeks, claimed it has collected data from news reports that shows over 1,900 farmers have committed suicide since 2017.“The families of farmers and farm labourers approached us to raise the issue. We have decided to hold a dharna at the Tikri border on December 16,” said Jaswinder Singh Longowal, state executive president of the union. “We have given a call to all victim families to reach the border as we have decided to highlight the issue of farm suicides. A massive protest will be held with photographs of deceased farmers.”Gobinder Singh, Sangrur block chief of the union, said four buses will ferry families of farm suicide victims from the district on Tuesday morning. “The remaining families will move on Wednesday,” he said.45-year-old farm labourer dies at Singhu borderThree days after joining protesters at the national capital’s Singhu border, a 45-year-old farm labourer from Moga district died on Monday morning.Makhan Singh of Bhinder Kalan village had reached the Singhu border to support the farmers’ protest on Friday. Villagers said he was not affiliated to any farm union and had joined the protest in solidarity. While listening to speeches near the main stage, his condition suddenly deteriorated on Monday morning. He was rushed to a hospital in Sonepat, where doctors declared him brought dead. The cause of death is yet to be ascertained.Makhan is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter, who got married last month. Farm unions have demanded compensation and job for his next of kin from the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/widows-kin-of-farm-suicide-victims-in-punjab-to-join-stir-at-delhi-s-tikri-border/story-wWP8ELQqX2mc32f2wMIclM.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||Juhu residents complain of Mumbai civic body’s inaction on illegal construction||Residents of a building at Juhu have criticised the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for dragging its feet regarding a dangerous illegal construction in the area. Residents of Archana Kutir building claim that they have been complaining for the past three months about dangerous illegal constructions around their property, for which no action has been initiated by the civic body so far.Since the first week of October, residents have sent close to 70 emails complaining about the illegal structures to the state government and BMC, but no reply has been received. The ground-plus-five-storey structure is surrounded by a compound wall which is sandwiched between two alleged illegal structures. The wall has developed cracks, and residents fear that it may collapse at any point.Kunal Bharti, secretary of Archana Kutir building, said, “The adjacent resto-bar Copa Lounge has constructed a wooden partition on our compound. There was a space between the bar and our compound which they have encroached on. We have been complaining to the local administrative ward, but no action has been initiated.”Replying to the complaints, Kabir Luthryia, one of the owners of Copa, said, “We have proof that the wooden partition on their compound wall existed since the past eight years. The residents of Archana Kutir had agreed to have it constructed. They had first made noise complaints against us, and to tackle that we had put up the wooden partition so that the sound would be confined to our area. It is of no use to us, and we will remove it immediately.”On the other side of the Kutir building, construction work on a residential structure on a plot named Periera Villa has also damaged the compound wall. Peeyush Gupta, secretary of Archana Kutir, said, “The building is being illegally constructed, and we are tired of complaining to the BMC about this since months. Despite the structure being under construction, some of the flats have been sold and families have occupied rooms in this building, which does not have an occupation certificate yet. No action has been initiated against them.”When residents tried contacting Vishwas Mote, assistant municipal commissioner of K-West ward (Juhu), he did not revert to their queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/juhu-residents-complain-of-mumbai-civic-body-s-inaction-on-illegal-construction/story-A4aJzdSw9z0pvdmveNvejM.html
15-12-2020||Chandigarh||Farm unions, political parties protest across Punjab||In response to a call given by the joint action committee of 32 farm unions, their members staged protests at all district headquarters in Punjab on Monday. Braving the cold weather, they gathered outside district administrative complexes to protest against the Centre’s new farm laws, which they labelled pro-corporate and anti-farmer. Even political parties, including the ruling Congress besides Shiromani Akali Dal and Aam Aadmi Party, held separate protests. No untoward incident was reported at any of these protests. Congress state chief Sunil Jakhar led the party’s protest at the Shambhu border in Patiala district. Addressing a number of cabinet ministers and party MPs and MLAs, he said as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre had agreed that the three agriculture laws had many flaws, it should scrap them immediately. Jakhar said instead of making amendments, the Union government must roll back these bills without any further delay. “The permanent solution for agrarian crisis is easy if the Centre agrees to guarantee MSP to farmers and empower states to formulate laws on agriculture,” he said. Also targeting Akalis, he said they were hand in glove with the BJP in enacting the laws, and even the AAP government had already implemented them in Delhi. Meanwhile, the district administrative complex in Patiala saw protests by farm bodies. Hundreds of farmers also held dharnas outside deputy commissioner offices in Sangrur and Barnala districts.“Our main leadership is protesting on the border of the national capital, and the second rung leadership are leading the protests here,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakounda) in Patiala. In Bathinda, it was a show of strength for farm groups, particularly left-leaning Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), which held separate protest outside the civil hospital and also took out a peaceful march. It was joined by a large number of women and children. Activists of other farm bodies in Bathinda protested outside the district administrative complex, where AAP MLA Baljinder Kaur also joined. AAP workers also held protests at other district headquarters. Leaders of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) staged a protest at Golden Gate on the outskirts of Amritsar. Party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal slammed the BJP for creating a communal divide to torpedo the farmers’ stir. Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SCPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur also took part in the protest. Even farm bodies protested at the district headquarters in Amritsar and other parts of Majha. However, Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Committee, which has its base in Majha, protested separately on railway tracks near Jandiala Guru, where they have been sitting since the farm laws were passed. Though the ‘rail roko’ has been lifted in the entire state, KMSC continues to block passenger trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farm-unions-political-parties-protest-across-punjab/story-EmMX58E8pu2Bpbg8MMJWAP.html
15-12-2020||City||Punjabi University’s liabilities piled up even as state grant doubled in five years||Even as the annual grant being provided to Punjabi University by the state government has doubled in the past five years, the funds are still not enough to clear the varsity’s liabilities of over ₹200 crore. The grant has gone up from ₹76.7 crore in 2014-15 to ₹152.97 crore in 2019-20. In the ongoing fiscal, the varsity is expecting funds worth ₹108 crore, while the government has already provided ₹20 crore as a special grant for it to clear its committed expenditure.However, the university’s expenditure in 2020-21 is pegged at ₹676 crore, against an expected income of ₹380 crore, leaving ₹296-crore deficit. The university also has an overdraft of ₹140 crore, which is expected to touch ₹150 crore by the end of the year.The extent of financial mismanagement can be gauged from the fact that the varsity is finding it hard to arrange funds for paying salaries and pensions for November. In October, former vice-chancellor Prof BS Ghuman had approached the state government for a bailout package of ₹300 crore.Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said the issue has been discussed at the secretary level, and the higher education department has been asked to submit a detailed report on how such a situation arose.“The varsity liabilities are more than the annual budget of the higher education department. The government cannot afford to clear liabilities, as it is required to see how and why the varsity landed in such a financial mess,” the minister said, adding that despite lesser annual grant, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, was doing fine.“As far as Punjabi University is concerned, besides annual grant, we have provided special bailout packages to meet expenditure every year. The government cannot provide such packages every year,” he said.Meanwhile, newly appointed V-C Ravneet Kaur said “serious talks” are on with senior officials of finance and higher education departments.“A special financial plan is also in the works to be presented before the state government to seek immediate funds,” she said, adding that meetings are being held to identify reasons behind the financial crunch. “The state government will be briefed about it,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjabi-university-s-liabilities-piled-up-even-as-state-grant-doubled-in-five-years/story-yH1TuayHjgJjGJVl0IkaaN.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||Shakti bill: Will deny hope of justice, 90 groups tell Maharashtra CM||Women’s rights groups have opposed sections of the newly-tabled Shakti bill, likely to be taken up Tuesday, for introducing the death penalty for rape, gang rape and penetrative sexual assault against children, and for suggesting an amendment to Section 375 on presumption of consent, which they said would make it difficult for the prosecution to establish the offence of rape.State home minister Anil Deshmukh tabled the Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 2020, and the Special Courts and Machinery for the Implementation of the Shakti Bill, 2020 on the first day of the winter session on Monday, The bills propose amendments to criminal laws in the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (Pocso Act), as well as seek the establishment of special trial courts. Once passed, the bills will also require the Centre’s nod.Over 90 women’s rights groups, activists, lawyers and academics wrote to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray last week stating that the bills would “completely deny women any hope of justice” and sought “a larger consultation with activists, lawyers and academicians who are working on these issues”.The issue of consent has remained a contentious one in the history of sexual assault legislation. In 2013, the Justice JS Verma Committee — formed after the death of the 23-year-old physiotherapist who was brutally assaulted in Delhi by a group of men — arrived at a set of amendments to the Criminal Law to provide for a quicker trial and enhanced punishment in cases of heinous assault against women.The Criminal Law Amendment Act, passed in 2013, amended Section 375 (which penalizes rape) to explain consent as “unequivocal voluntary agreement”, “through words, gestures or any form of verbal or non-verbal communications” — this was not part of the penal code previously, and clarified that the absence of “no” on part of a woman in the act of sex cannot be construed as a “yes”.The Shakti bill seeks to add an explanation to Section 375 — “where parties are adults and the conduct of such parties from all circumstances surrounding the same appears that there was consent or implied consent, a presumption of consent will be made” — which, legal experts said, negates the clarity offered by the current law.“In a lot of cases, the accused takes the plea of consent. With such an explanation added, it will become impossible for the prosecution to establish rape. Such an explanation negates and nullifies the very offence of rape,” the letter stated.Women’s rights activists have also raised concerns over the introduction of the death penalty for specific heinous crimes, including penetrative sexual assault against children and gang rape, which they said will not help survivors of assault. “It is the certainty of investigation, trial and punishment that works as a deterrent rather than the severity of punishment,” it added.Veena Gowda, who practices with the Bombay High Court and is one of the signatories of the letter said, “The government should implement existing laws to curb violence against women, and have dedicated gender budgets. The provisions of the Shakti bill have been made without considering similar, already existing provisions in the law.”The bills also seek to punish the filing of “false complaints” or providing “false information” regarding sexual and other offences against women solely with the intention to humiliate, extort, threaten or defame the accused.This would only prove to be a deterrent to women from filing complaints or providing information regarding sexual offences, leading to a lower reporting rate for sexual offences, activists said.Nandita Shah, co-director of rights group Akshara Centre, and one of the signatories, said, “The way they are looking at false cases, and even the clause on the death penalty will only end up leaving women more vulnerable. So while the intention might be that the government wants to protect women, it doesn’t have to be done in this way. We are hoping they will take some criticism on board, and not pass the bill without further discussion. If it gets passed on Tuesday, we will have to look for ways for protection against clauses.”The Shakti Bill has been tabled along the lines of the Disha Act, passed by the Andhra Pradesh legislature in February, which also carried stricter punishments including the death penalty for heinous crimes of violence against women and children, a 21-day deadline for the trial of brutal assault cases, and penalizing the harassment of women on digital and social media. The Shakti bill mandates investigation and filing of the charge sheet within 15 days and the trial to be completed in 30 days after filing of the charge sheet.Chandra Iyengar, former home secretary of Maharashtra said, “It is important to have a legislation with dedicated provisions to curb violence against women and children. It is the state’s attempts to show vulnerable groups that the power of the state is behind you. Some aspects of the bill definitely need more debate, such as the clause on presumption of consent. However, with respect to the death penalty, my view is what other equally stringent punishment exists to deter perpetrators of violence?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shakti-bill-will-deny-hope-of-justice-90-groups-tell-maharashtra-cm/story-4Q56c190nXd2DumkQEmIZN.html
15-12-2020||City||Church defends move to include rape accused former bishop Mulakkal’s photo in calendar||The Thrissur Archdiocese of Syro-Malabar church on Monday justified its decision to include the photo of rape accused former Jalandhar bishop Franco Mulakkal in the church calendar, saying he was only an accused in the case and was not officially removed from the post. “Mulakkal is facing some charges and his trial is progressing. As of now, he is only an accused. He continues to be a bishop and only his administrative duties have been divested. Calendar was a routine exercise and there is no room for a controversy in this,” said Father Akkamatathil Raphael, managing editor of the church mouthpiece.Angry believers and church reformers had protested and burnt copies of the calendar at many places in Kerala on Sunday, after Mulakkal’s photo was printed displaying his date of birth (March 25) and other basic details on the March page. Protestors said glorification of such a person by an official church publication was against human rights and natural justice. “By trying to project Mulakkal as a person of worthy reverence, church authorities are justifying his actions too. This is against natural justice,” said Augustine Vattoly, former convener of the Save Our Sisters Forum (SOS). SOS was formed in the wake of sit-in protest by five nuns against Mulakkal two years ago in Kochi. The case against former bishop surfaced in 2018 after a 43-year-old nun complained to the police in Kottayam that he had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016. The nun is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab. Mulakkal denied the charges, saying he was framed after he took action against her for financial irregularities at the convent. Later, a special investigation team of Kerala Police arrested him and he was removed from the post of bishop later. The trial in the case is in its final stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/church-defends-move-to-include-rape-accused-former-bishop-mulakkal-s-photo-in-calendar/story-gkiat5CuOHelEhOAyS5z8J.html
15-12-2020||Chandigarh||Runaway couple from Fatehabad lands in soup over wrong info to high court||A Fatehabad youth and a girl are in for a trouble with the Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday issuing contempt notices against both of them for supplying wrong information in their plea before the court. The authorities have also been asked to apprise the court in February of action taken in their case under the provisions of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act as at the time of marriage, both of them were found underage. The couple in the plea filed on September 24 had claimed that the boy was 21 years’ old and girl’s age was stated to be 20. The plea was filed seeking protection of their life and liberty as they had married on September 21 against the wishes of their parents.However, family members of one of them got whiff of the petition and appeared during the proceedings through a lawyer on September 24, stating that they were minors. This prompted court to get their age verified. The court also made it clear that if both of them are found to be below the marriageable age, the court would not prohibit their prosecution. On October 5, the authorities apprised the court that the girl was 17 years and six months old, while the youth’s age was 20. The court questioned their counsel as to how marriage was conducted between minors. However, no satisfactory response was forthcoming from them. Upon this, the court sought response from the duo by October 29 as to why they should not be proceeded against under the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act. No response, however, came from both of them on the adjourned date. The court, while referring the matter to contempt of court, said that if no reply is filed by the them to the notice issued to them, no further latitude will be given and it will be taken that they have nothing further to say in the matter and naturally, therefore the contempt petition would be taken to its logical end. Now, the contempt of court bench on Monday has sought response from them as to why contempt proceedings should not be initiated and further, an affidavit has been sought from either Fatehabad superintendent of police or deputy superintendent of police with action-taken report on February 16 in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/runaway-couple-from-fatehabad-lands-in-soup-over-wrong-info-to-high-court/story-6VXMaNTHaS9Nahi9lEmjvI.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena’s Pratap Sarnaik moves breach of privilege motion over Kangana Ranaut’s tweet||Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik on Monday moved a breach of privilege motion over a tweet by actor Kangana Ranaut which was carried by several news outlets. In a letter submitted to the principal secretary of the state legislature, Sarnaik sought breach of privilege motion against the print, electronic and social media for allegedly publishing false stories based on Ranaut’s tweet. While Sarnaik has named Ranaut and quoted her tweet, the legislator has not named any media outlet in his letter.The Sena legislator, in the letter, said that electronic media and print media outlets ran unverified news stating that a Pakistani credit card was allegedly found at his place by Enforcement Directorate (ED) during their searches, leading to defamation of his family. He requested the principal secretary of the state legislature to forward his notice to the Privilege Committee of Maharashtra Assembly so that an inquiry can be initiated.Sarnaik, in his notice, said ED conducted two raids at his residence and found nothing suspicious during the raids. “ED called me and my son for inquiry and we are cooperating with ED and there is no issue... But after Kangana’s tweet, some electronic media and print media published news on December 12 and 13 against me that were defaming and baseless as ED has officially said nothing about seizures in their raids,” Sarnaik said. He, however, quoted Ranaut’s tweet in his letter: “He had threatened to break my face when I had said Mumbai was feeling like POK. India recognise those who are staking everything for you and those who are taking everything from you. Where you place your faith their lies your future. India Pakistan na ban jaye sambhalo yaaron. (sic)” Ranaut had tweeted this on December 12 in response to a tweet by a Dharmendra Chhonkar, where he said, “@KanganaTeam was right. Credit Card of Pakistan National recovered from Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik’s residence.” “This is absolutely baseless and incorrect. It has been defamatory and therefore request you to forward the notice to the privilege committee of the state assembly for further action,” Sarnaik said in the notice. Later speaking to reporters outside Vidhan Bhavan, Sarnaik said, “I have submitted the motion today. I am of the firm opinion that such news reports are only meant to defame me. I have filed a breach of privilege motion against Ranaut for publishing false stories, including ‘Pakistani credit card was found at Pratap Sarnaik’s home’, ‘Rafael [fighter jet] documents were found’, ‘documents of partnership with Donald Trump were found’, etc. to defame me and my family.”In the monsoon session of the legislature held in September, Sarnaik had moved a privilege motion against Republic TV’s editor-in chief Arnab Goswami, stating that the news anchor referred to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a disrespectful manner and presented news with malafide intent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-s-pratap-sarnaik-moves-breach-of-privilege-motion-over-kangana-ranaut-s-tweet/story-eXND2tAAI9QPKy1RrvEfmI.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||Destination Goa: Travel portals record surge in Indians travelling for Christmas and New Year||While Goa saw an influx in domestic travellers after flying restrictions were gradually lifted from various parts of the country, travel to the tourist state had initially dropped drastically after Maharashtra implemented new rules for those seeking entry from its neighbouring state. However, the new testing rules have been unable to deter travellers for too long according to travel portals.Shubhangi Arora, a Delhi-based media professional paid ₹15,000 for her return ticket to Goa. “I have booked my trip to Goa for the New Year. I expected my air ticket to cost less than ₹10,000, but I was surprised to see that despite the government’s cap on airfares, tickets are not as cheap as expected.”Tickets from Mumbai to Goa for December 24 and return on January 2 cost above ₹12,000 on most web portals.Sources from Mumbai airport said that currently, 20 flights operate between Mumbai and Goa daily.Yatra.com spokesperson said that while being conscious of the safety norms, travellers are going ahead to book their trips. “Over the years, Goa has been one of the many preferred domestic destinations for customers around Christmas and New Year. Year after year, the demand for this destination has increased, with more people visiting it to spend quality time with their friends and family. This year too, we have witnessed a spike of about 37% in terms of booking inquiries,” said the spokesperson.EaseMyTrip co-founder Nishant Pitti said that until last month, maximum people were booking their air tickets only three days before the travel date. Now, people are booking flights to Goa in advance for Christmas and New Year. “We are seeing that traffic for Goa has picked up again for Christmas and New Year travel, which is a good sign,” he said.According to MakeMyTrip, aside from Goa, Lonavala, Mahabaleshwar, Pondicherry, Coorg, Shimla, Manali and Darjeeling are also seeing an increase in searches and bookings for the upcoming winter holiday season. “Flight bookings on MakeMyTrip indicate a 25% month-on-month growth to domestic leisure destinations, and we hope to see this traction growing during the Christmas and New Year period. As state-wise travel regulations continue to evolve, travellers are willing to wait it out and firm up their bookings within a week or less from the travel date. Currently, hotel bookings for the Christmas and New Year period stand at one-third during the same period last year. However, the recovery in the past few months makes us confident that these numbers will continue to show an upward trend as we close in on the holiday season,” said Vipul Prakash, chief operating officer, MakeMyTrip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/destination-goa-travel-portals-record-surge-in-indians-travelling-for-christmas-and-new-year/story-IC3Qyk1UoDyo1mYs7zyGyL.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||₹21,992-crore supplementary budget tabled by Maharashtra government; ₹1,000-crore for farmers||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on the first day of the winter session on Monday tabled supplementary demands worth around ₹21,992 crore, in addition to the annual budget.Of this, the notable expenditure of around ₹10,000 crore will be made for farmers. Of this ₹2,850 crore will be used for procuring paddy at minimum support price (MSP) and giving bonus to paddy growers, ₹2,211 crore to help farmers affected due to natural calamities, ₹2,000 crore for repairs and maintenance of roads and bridges and their constructions under hybrid annuity scheme, ₹1,000 crore for the state’s share of Prime Minister Crop Insurance scheme, ₹902 crore for National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and ₹877 crore for infrastructure development in municipal corporations and nagar parishads.Supplementary budget refers to additional expenditure required for the year for unforeseen expenses over and above the annual budget.During the monsoon session, the state government had sought ₹29,084 crore over and above the annual budgetary outlay.The supplementary demands tabled by deputy chief and finance minister Ajit Pawar made a provision of ₹1,000 crore as financial aid to Maharashtra State Road Transportation Corporation (MSRTC) — a state-run corporation — to provide salary to their staff till the end of the financial year (March 2021). Currently reeling with financial trouble, MSRTC needs ₹150 crore every month to pay salary to its staff. The amount of ₹1,000 crore will be used to provide salary from November to March whereas the remaining ₹150 crore will be given back to the state as the state had provided the amount from the state contingency fund to pay October salary to the staff, said an official, wishing not to be named.It has earmarked ₹475 crore for the legislators for local area development (LAD) funds. Under Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) LAD scheme, each MLA gets funds of ₹3 crore a year for development works in his or her constituency. For the proposed memorial of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar at Indu Mill Compound, ₹100 crore has been earmarked.Further, it has allocated ₹39.72 crore for Shiv Bhojan Thali, a staple food scheme for the poor. Under the scheme, which is a pet project of the MVA government launched in January this year, the original cost of a thali is ₹10 but was reduced by half due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As part of its preparation for Covid-19 vaccination programme, the state government has sought ₹22 crore to store Covid-19 vaccine in air-conditioned facilities with negative pressure.The state has been preparing to administer Covid-19 vaccine to around 3.25 crore people in three phases that includes health workers, frontline workers and citizens above the age of 50 years and those suffering with comorbidities.It has also decided to allocate ₹50 crore as ex-gratia to be given to the families of police personnel who died after being infected with Covid-19.

15-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra reports 2,949 new Covid-19 infections, tally rises to 1,883,365||After 24 days, Maharashtra reported fewer than 3,000 fresh Covid-19 cases in a day with 2,949 new infections taking the tally to 1,883,365 on Monday. The lower numbers are, however, attributed to fewer tests. In the past 24 hours, 45,905 samples were tested, while the average of the past seven days was 53,041. State health department officials, meanwhile, said infection rate was on the decline and that herd immunity could be playing a major role in the drop in number of infections.Maharashtra also added 60 fatalities on Monday to take the toll to 48,269. Of the fatalities reported on Monday, 27 occurred in the past 48 hours and eight were in the past week. The remaining 25 deaths were from the period before last week. The case fatality rate (CFR) remained constant at 2.56%.Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 477 fresh infections to take its tally to 291,113. It also reported fatalities in single digits with seven deaths, pushing the toll to 10,984.Health department officials said the rate of infection was under control as the positivity rate, a key parameter to see how rapidly the infection is spreading, is around 7%. The state has witnessed a dip in the overall positivity rate in the state over from nearly 20% in October to nearly 16% in December. On October 13, the overall positivity rate was 19.89%, which dropped to 17.9% on November 13. The overall positivity rate on Monday stood at 16.03%.A state health department official said the infection spread was seeing a dip, which is why the positivity rate was going down gradually. “If one looks at the positivity rate of just one month, between November 14 and December 14, it shows a substantial decline in positivity rate. The positivity rate in this period was 7.05%, lower than the overall positivity rate. A significant percentage of the population could have developed antibodies, which is a reason for lower infection rates now. We are happy that the numbers are showing a dip, but the administration remains on guard,” he said, requesting anonymity. State surveillance officer, Dr Pradeep Awate said, “The declining trend is continuing, which is a relieving part. The rate of infection is decreasing and herd immunity could be playing a major role in it.”Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman of communicable diseases prevention control and member of the state-appointed technical committee, echoed Awate’s view on herd immunity and said, “The Serosurveys that have been carried out in Mumbai and Pune are indicators that congested areas that saw many cases are now seeing fewer cases. Indications are that a herd immunity-like situation is occurring in the state. There are a lot of people who were affected, but might not be detected. However, we are still seeing cases coming out, so the viral activity has not stopped.”After a brief upswing in active cases, they have dipped marginally in the state. The active cases in the state had seen a slight increase between December 10 and 13. The state’s active caseload had gone to 74,104 on Sunday after it had dropped to 71,910 on December 10. Mumbai, too, had seen a rise in active caseload, which reached 13,112 on Sunday, a jump from 11,886 on December 10. The active caseload in the state, however, dipped on Monday to 72,383, owing to more discharges recorded on Monday. Mumbai now has 13,582 active cases. State authorities have attributed the increase in active cases to a delay in logging in discharges.In the last 24 hours, 4,160 patients were discharged, which took the tally of recovered patients to 17,61,615. The state’s overall recovery rate stood at 93.54%. The state has so far tested 11,748,362 samples and has an overall positivity rate of 16.03%. Currently, 504,406 people are in home quarantine and 4,335 people are in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-reports-2-949-new-covid-19-infections-tally-rises-to-1-883-365/story-ooVSZhsfgH4XlZvuu0rmHK.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||2 clubs, 2 restaurants in Mumbai raided, fined ₹43K by BMC for flouting Covid-19 rules||Cracking the whip on restaurants and nightclubs running till late hours and flouting Covid-19 rules, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) raided two restaurants and two nightclubs on Sunday night and fined 560 visitors for not wearing masks. The civic body has also issued show-cause notices to the clubs for violating the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and operating beyond the deadline. This comes days after BMC announced that it would carry out random inspections at nightclubs that are not following any safety measures.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “There were gross violations found at Bombay Adda in Bandra last night [Sunday]. Nearly 275 people were fined for not wearing masks. We want to advise and warn citizens that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over yet. We are strongly against imposing a night curfew; however, citizens should not create havoc around Christmas and New Year, which will force us to impose the curfew.”A first information report (FIR) was registered against Bombay Adda by the BMC for flouting Covid-19 rules. A senior civic official said, “There was no social distancing followed at the Bandra club, and many were not wearing masks. A fine of ₹30,000 was imposed on the club.” Bombay Adda refused to comment of the matter.The other three establishments fined are located in Dadar, Kandivli and Malad.A total of ₹43, 200 in fines was collected from all four establishments.According to the Epidemic Act, more than 50 people are not allowed to gather at any location at a time. The Covid-19 curve of the city started declining since November, and BMC fears that such gatherings could lead to another surge in cases. This is not the first time that the BMC has raided night clubs. On December 5, BMC raided three nightclubs in Bandra and Lower Parel, after receiving a tip that the clubs were operating past the deadline. Subsequently, around 1,000 people were asked to leave the premises by BMC officials during the raid. Many were also fined by for not wearing masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-clubs-2-restaurants-in-mumbai-raided-fined-43k-by-bmc-for-flouting-covid-19-rules/story-aTLmj5mHkVL7CpJqCAutPJ.html
15-12-2020||Chandigarh||Farm reform bills: Protesters lay siege to Ferozepur Road in Ludhiana||Activists affiliated with at least 13 farmer and trade unions laid siege to Ferozepur Road outside the Mini Secretariat on Monday to register their protest against the contentious farm reform laws. A farmer leader, requesting anonymity, said, “Instead of rolling back the laws, the Centre is maligning farmers as Khalistanis and beguiled men backed by urban naxals.”The protest, which began as a peaceful sit-in, turned disruptive when workers of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ugrah faction) laid siege to both sides of the road and demanded that deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma visit the site and receive their memorandum. This led to a mammoth traffic jam on both sides of the busy Ferozepur Road. Serpentine queues enveloped Bhai Wala Chowk and Bharat Nagar Chowk.Soon, the traffic police swung into action and diverted vehicles heading from Jagraon Bridge to Mall Road and Bus stand, while the traffic heading from Bhai Bala Chowk was diverted towards Pakhowal Road and Ghumar Mandi. The change in routes led to further chaos in Fountain Chowk and other parts of the city.Protest lasted two hoursThe traffic conundrum lasted for nearly two hours as protesters raised slogans against the ruling BJP government and the local administration. The farmers were backed by lawyers and the Sanchar Nigam Executive Association, a body representing 900 BSNL officials. Some industrialists also formed a human chain on National Highway- 44 near Dhandari to support the protesting farmers.Eight BKU farmer bodies that were protesting at a fuel station near Bharat Nagar Chowk were seen instructing their volunteers not to interact with the media saying a few irresponsible statements had dented their protest. The activists held placards explaining how the new bills were anti-farmer and pro-corporate.The protesters were only pacified after Sharma arrived on the site and received their memorandum around 4pm.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Ugraha’s Ahmedgarh block in-charge Gurmail Singh said, “Our non-violent protest is our strength. Until yesterday, the government was not bothered by our plight but now the world is taking note of our protest. The government is dismissing us as ‘anti-nationals’ and our protest as ‘politically motivated’ but their tactics to tarnish our image seems to be backfiring on them.”“The meetings between the Centre and farmer leaders have exposed the ministers’ agenda. The incumbent regime is only looking forward to benefit their crony-capitalist friends,” he said.On why the farmers were not accepting the proposed amendments, he said, “The big corporates would ensure the amendments are tweaked, scrapping the laws is the only solution.” ‘All sections of society on guillotine’Retired excise and taxation officer Balkaur Singh, who is not associated with the Ugraha faction, said, “This is not a mere farmer protest. All sections of society will be affected. If the big corporates occupy each sector, land owners, and grocery owners will be reduced to peasants and work for them.” Amrik Singh Kadian of the BKU Kadian faction said, “We will not leave the Singhu Border until the government scraps the three controversial laws. They are testing our patience, but with each passing day our protest is gathering momentum. It is heartening to see that even after being beaten up, none of our protesting farmers have resorted to violence. We will emerge victorious in the end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farm-reform-bills-protesters-lay-siege-to-ferozepur-road-in-ludhiana/story-wWUZebYy4ZKH5bx2GG32MJ.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||Hrithik Roshan-Kangana Ranaut email fight case transferred from Mumbai cyber cell to CIU||Actor Hrithik Roshan’s 2016 first information report (FIR) against actor Kangana Ranaut, which was previously probed by the Mumbai cyber police station, has now been transferred to the crime branch’s crime intelligence unit (CIU) after Roshan’s lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani recently wrote to Mumbai Police reminding them that there has not been any progress in the case since 2016. The actor had filed a complaint after getting hundreds of emails from Ranaut’s account.A crime branch officer confirmed the development on Monday and said that CIU will check where exactly the investigation had stopped and will continue the probe.Roshan had filed a complaint with the cybercrime police station in 2016 against unidentified individuals under sections 419 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 66(c) and 66 (d) of the Information Technology Act.“Our client also met top police officers when he reiterated all the facts and informed them about the trauma being caused to him and his family. He also reiterated his request for a timely investigation. However, till date, there has been no progress in the investigation, and the aforementioned case is still pending. We thus request to kindly look in the matter and issue appropriate orders to kindly direct completion of investigation at the earliest since the same is pending since 2016,” states the letter sent by the actor’s lawyer to Mumbai Police (HT has a copy).Roshan, in a letter to the then police commissioner Rakesh Maria and the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) cybercrime division, had alleged that a person was in contact with his friends and fans using a fake email address. Roshan came to know about the fake account when he started receiving calls from his friends asking why he was not replying to their e-mails.Actor Ranaut’s name came into the picture after the e-mail exchanges between her and an account supposedly belonging to Roshan were leaked to the media.The cyber police station had then recorded the statements of Ranaut and her sister while investigating the fake e-mail account case. Her lawyer had then questioned the “genuineness of the entire complaint lodged by Roshan.”The public battle between the two actors started after Ranaut in an interview referred to Roshan (“silly ex”) without naming him. Following this, in March 2016, Roshan and Ranaut had sent legal notices to each other.At the centre of the mud-slinging was an email ID from which Ranaut claimed to have received messages from Roshan, which proved they were in a relationship. Roshan, however, said he had never had an email account with that ID, and that it was an impostor who had been communicating with Ranaut all along.He then filed the police complaint to track down the person responsible for the fake email ID from which Kangana had received the emails. However, police were unable to track the user.An officer had then said that the emails originated from a US server, and in the absence of data from there, no user could be identified.The police previously also contemplated closing the case in absence of evidence, sources said.Reacting to the latest development, Kangana’s team tweeted, “His sob story starts again, so many years since our break up and his divorce but he refuses to move on, refuses to date any woman, just when I gather courage to find some hope in my personal life he starts the same drama again, @iHrithik kab tak royega ek chote se affair keliye?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hrithik-roshan-kangana-ranaut-email-fight-case-transferred-from-mumbai-cyber-cell-to-ciu/story-saGqaX1xlcLsXOopkhagPN.html

On the basis of the suicide note, police have booked Tony, a fruit vendor, his wife Nidhi and the victims’ neighbour Anu for abetment of suicide. The trio are still on the run.The teenager and her mother had hung themselves on the first floor of the house on Saturday night. While the woman was declared dead on arrival, her daughter struggled for life for 33 hours before succumbing. The woman’s husband said that Tony, a fruit vendor, who frequently visited their neighbour Anu, had sent objectionable messages to the minor girl on a social networking site. After a police complaint was lodged, the two parties compromised and the accused stopped coming to Anu’s house. On December 12, the accused accosted the victims in the street and humiliated them. Anu again sent indecent messages to his daughter, following which his wife and daughter ended their lives, the complainant said. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Harmesh Lal, who is investigating the case, said it appears to be a case of suicide pact. An FIR under Sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered.

15-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CET cell extends deadline of pre-admission registration for professional courses||The state common entrance test (CET) cell late on Monday released a notification extending the pre-admission registration process for all professional courses. This notification is applicable to all undergraduate and postgraduate courses including engineering, pharmacy, architecture and management courses.According to the notification, the registration process for admissions to BTech courses in state institutes has been extended till December 22 instead of the original date of December 15. Similarly, registrations for BArch and MBA/MMS courses have been extended from December 13 to December 20.“A revised and detailed activity schedule for admissions will be published with two-three days on the official website www.mahacet.org,” stated the notification.With admissions to first-year professional courses delayed again, several institutes are worried about the academic time left for the incoming batch. “It looks like the registration process has been extended because the CET cell is yet to release results of common entrance exams conducted for various courses. In this case, first-year batches of all professional courses will only get to start their academic year by mid or end of January 2021, which will be ridiculous,” said the director of a city-based management institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cet-cell-extends-deadline-of-pre-admission-registration-for-professional-courses/story-KfIWdeWQh6qjDqTPhfujQO.html

15-12-2020||Mumbai||17 Maharashtra government bungalows including CM Uddhav Thackeray’s residence on list of water bill defaulters, says RTI activist; CMO denies allegation||As many as 17 government bungalows occupied by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, his deputy Ajit Pawar and other senior ministers are in the list of defaulters for water bill dues worth ₹2,456,469, according to information collated by Right To Information (RTI) activist Shakeel Ahmed Shaikh. The chief minister’s office (CMO) has, however, denied the charges and clarified that the two bungalows occupied by the CM have no water bills pending. All government offices and official residences are managed and maintained by the state’s public works department. Shaikh said that as per the information collated from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) website, Varsha and Torna — the bungalows occupied by Thackeray — owe ₹28,719 towards water bills from April to October. Similarly, the dues for Devgiri, which is occupied by Pawar, are ₹135,300, and ₹115,288 is due for Seva Sadan which is occupied by water resources minister Jayant Patil. The highest due at ₹144,415 is for water usage at Ramtek, the bungalow occupied by food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal. Interestingly, the list also includes Sagar, the official bungalow occupied by Leader of Opposition and former CM Devendra Fadnavis, for dues to the tune of ₹124,553. The state guest house Sahyadri’s unpaid water bill is ₹745,856, Shaikh said.A clarification issued by the CMO stated there are no dues for water usage at Varsha and Toran. “The water works department of BMC has given a report which says there is no unpaid bill for water usage at both the bungalows,” the statement reads. The statement, however, does not have any clarification for the unpaid bills for other bungalows occupied by other ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/17-maharashtra-government-bungalows-including-cm-uddhav-thackeray-s-residence-on-list-of-water-bill-defaulters-says-rti-activist-cmo-denies-allegation/story-84ggMcoOo2gQE8qej5S3kM.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||Withdraw collector’s order allotting Kanjurmarg land for Mumbai Metro car shed, then proceed by law, HC asks Maharashtra government||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday asked the state government to consider withdrawing October 1, 2020, order of the Mumbai suburban district collector, allotting 102 acres of salt pan land at Kanjurmarg for construction of an integrated Metro car shed.“We can’t allow this order to remain in force,” said the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni. “Prima facie, we are of the view that the matter should go back to the collector. It’s better you settle these issues before you proceed further (with the construction of the proposed Metro car shed at Kanjurmarg),” the bench added.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni responded to the suggestion, saying he will take instructions and inform the government’s response, to the court suggestion on Wednesday.The bench also delineated further possible course of action, saying either the collector withdraws the order or the bench will set it aside on the ground of procedural infirmities. Then, the court said, the collector will be free to proceed in accordance with law and status quo, as on the date of withdrawal or striking down will be maintained in the meantime.The court was hearing a petition filed by the central government seeking a stay on the metro car shed work at Kanjurmarg. Staking claim over the salt pan lands, the central government has moved HC challenging October 1, 2020 order of the collector, allotting 102 acres out of Survey No 275 (part) to Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA).On October 6, the collector transferred possession of the salt pan land to MMRDA and two days later the authority, in turn, handed it over to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited, which is constructing the Metro car shed.Centre has claimed that the entire salt pan lands in the belt, including the 102 acres at Kanjurmarg, belong to its salt department and has always been under the administrative control of the deputy salt commissioner.By a separate petition Centre has also challenged November 1, 2018, the order of the Maharashtra revenue minister, upholding addition of names of the state government and some private parties in ownership column of several salt pan lands at Nahur, Mulund, Kanjurmarg, Mandale, Malvani and Pahadi areas of Mumbai.The court on Monday also heard a petition filed by one Maheshkumar Garodia, who too has challenged the Collector’s order and subsequent transfer of possession of the salt pan land for the Metro car shed.HC’s suggestion came after senior advocate Shyam Mehta, who represented Garodia, pointed out that Garodia, a legal representative of the erstwhile salt manufacturer had a beneficial interest in a vast tract of salt pan land, including the 102 acres plot, and he has filed a suit concerning the entire land leased to his predecessors and interim orders are granted in his favour, first by HC, which are subsequently confirmed by Bombay city civil court, after the suit was transferred there.Mehta pointed out to the bench that the Collector was aware of the fact that Garodia was in possession of the land, that the suit was pending, that there was an interim injunction in his favour, but no notice was issued to him before transferring the land to MMRDA and handing over its possession for construction of the metro car shed.Mehta submitted that till January 2020 the technical advisory committee of the state government maintained that Kanjurmarg was not viable for construction of the metro car shed. Therefore, they changed the reservation of the land at Aarey Colony and spent over Rs. 200 crores for preparations at Aarey Colony. And now they are claiming that the Kanjurmarg land is most suitable for the project.HC found force in Mehta’s complaint that the October 1 order does not even refer to the petitioner and the court proceeding. “The order itself shows that the Collector is aware of the pending suit, but he just turns a blind eye towards the court proceedings,” said the bench. “Is this a proper exercise of power,” the judges asked and opined that the order could not be allowed to continue.The salt pan land at Kanjurmarg has become a bone of serious contention between the Maharashtra government and the Centre. Earlier, Devendra Fadnavis of BJP had decided to construct the car shed for Mumbai Metro line 3 at Aarey Colony, despite steep opposition to vast tree cutting required for the car shed.After Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress combine government came in power in Maharashtra, it responded positively to cry of environmentalists and shifted the metro car shed to Kanjurmarg - a location which the Fadnavis government had specifically rejected.Uddhav Thackeray led government has now decided to construct an integrated metro car shed at Kanjur Marg for metro line 3, 4, 4A and 6, instead of constructing #separate car sheds for these lines individually.Senior advocate Milind Sathe and advocate Saket Mone, who represented the project proponent MMRDA, on Monday highlighted financial benefits of constructing the integrated car shed. They said MMRDA will have to spend an additional amount of ₹2,328 crore on land acquisition and ₹1,600 crore as operational costs, if the integrated car shed at Kanjur Marg was stayed by HC.They added that there will be loss of ₹2.5 to ₹3 crore per day if the court stayed the ongoing work of Metro car shed at Kanjurmarg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/withdraw-collector-s-order-allotting-kanjurmarg-land-for-mumbai-metro-car-shed-then-proceed-by-law-hc-asks-maharashtra-government/story-epytgfMy1LuoLR7Y8M4xYO.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||More schools reopen for Class 9 to 12 in Maharashtra, attendance increases||Three weeks after the Maharashtra education department reopened school for Class 9 to 12 in several parts of the state, the number of students attending schools has seen a 60% increase with more schools reopening, data shared by the education department has revealed. According to the data, as on December 14, nearly 8 lakh students were attending schools every day while more than 15,000 schools have reopened over the past 3 weeks. On November 23, the education department reopened more than 9,000 schools in various parts of the state such as Chandrapur, Solapur, Satara, Beed and Amravati. Schools said that since the gradual reopening, the number of students seems to be increasing. “We are seeing a good response from students now. More than 80% of students in Class 10 are attending school now, which is a good sign. Parents are sending their children as the initial anxiety and fear seem to be receding a bit,” said Balu Bhoyar, principal, Karamveer Vidyalaya in Chandrapur. As on Monday, more than 90% schools reopened in Gadchiroli, Osmanabad, Satara, Solapur, Jalgaon and Nanded districts. A total of 50% schools for Class 9 to 12 reopened in the state by Monday. “Students are enthusiastic about attending schools and the attendance is seeing a steady rise. All the safety rules with respect to Covid-19 are being followed by schools. Teachers who have tested positive have been isolated and taken care of,” tweeted state education minister Varsha Gaikwad. Teachers said some parents were still sceptical about sending their children to school due to the fear of contracting the virus. “When we ask them to fill an undertaking before sending students, they get a bit worried and hence do not sending children yet,” said the teacher of a school in Latur. As per the standard operating procedures laid down by the education department, only 50% students in these schools are asked to attend classes on a rotational basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/more-schools-reopen-for-class-9-to-12-in-maharashtra-attendance-increases/story-Kjo5ZD6h08wIBAxBTv98JI.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||Libraries shut, Mumbai colleges provide e-library, e-books access to students||The Covid-19 pandemic had already turned regular classrooms into virtual lecture rooms and now libraries, too, have moved online for several city colleges. Students, who would flock libraries for reference books before exams, are being provided with access to e-libraries, e-books and in some cases, teachers are even sharing reference material and notes online. “Our online classes have been running very smoothly and teachers have ensured students have all necessary reference books in e-book version for easy accessibility,” said Sobhana Vasudevan, principal RA Podar College, Matunga, adding that teachers at their college have also formed groups of students to ensure reference notes are shared among the class. “In case of non-availability of an e-version of any book, teachers share prints of necessary notes to ensure students are not at loss,” said Vasudevan.The concept of subject textbooks is common for traditional courses in the science, commerce and arts stream. However, students of unaided or self-financed courses heavily depend on reference books as study material. Most colleges follow the University of Mumbai prescribed curriculum and reference books mentioned by the Board of Studies (BoS), making it convenient for students to find study material in libraries.“Every year, the exercise of putting notes together for certain topics is marked as assignments for students in order to encourage them to read more. This year, most teachers ensured the reference material is posted in virtual classrooms, so that students don’t struggle for notes before exams,” said co-ordinator for the Bachelor in Mass Media (BMM) course at a suburban college. What has also helped is that several colleges, over the past few years, have already set-up their e-libraries to ensure easy accessibility of books for students and staff. “Our students have the advantage of referring to any book from our library online, and this has been very advantageous during the entire semester for both students and teachers. Sharing notes for every subject became easier and we’ve also been conducting our semester exams smoothly,” said Parag Ajgaonkar, principal of N M College, Vile Parle. Students, too, have formed their own groups on social media and are sharing notes among themselves. “My friend and I found out about a BCom in Banking and Insurance (BBI) students’ group on Facebook, where students from several colleges share notes of different subjects given to them by their respective teachers. This way we have managed to amass a lot of notes and be better prepared for exams,” said Yash Dedhia, a second-year student at Wilson College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/libraries-shut-mumbai-colleges-provide-e-library-e-books-access-to-students/story-IYLbmGNRQHABGsA9hoBvCM.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||Overnight rain in Mumbai brings down temperatures and pollution||Sporadic spells of light showers in the city and suburbs between Sunday and Monday not only led to the coldest day this season but also helped disperse pollutants making it the best air quality since October 19. The air quality index (AQI) on Monday was 76, falling under the satisfactory category, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The last time Mumbai recorded an AQI lower than this was 68 (satisfactory) on October 19 and thereafter the AQI started rising. It was 90 (satisfactory) on October 20 and fluctuated between the poor and moderate categories up till Diwali (November 14). The AQI remained in the moderate category through rest of November with isolated spikes (on a few days) with poor AQI. However, after almost two months, light showers over the past four days improved air quality. Mumbai witnessed intermittent spells of light showers between Sunday night and Monday morning allowing a marginal drop in minimum temperatures and considerable drop in maximum temperatures leading to cool conditions. Between 11.30pm Sunday and 8.30am Monday, the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 4.8mm rain while 13.8mm was recorded at Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai. Between 8.30am and 5.30pm Monday, 6.2mm rain was recorded in south Mumbai and 1.1mm in the suburbs. Maximum rain between Sunday and Monday was recorded at Kandivali at 18.6mm followed by Colaba and Mazagaon 8.4mm. This allowed the maximum temperature to drop to 26.9 degrees Celsius, 5.4 degree Celsius below normal in the suburbs, which is the lowest this season and second lowest for the month in nine years. The lowest maximum temperature over the past decade was recorded on December 6, 2017, at 23.6 degrees Celsius. On Monday, south Mumbai recorded the maximum temperature at 27 degrees Celsius, 4.5 degree Celsius below normal. On Sunday the maximum temperature was 27.6 and 27.4 degree Celsius in the suburbs and south Mumbai respectively. The minimum temperature fell marginally from previous days to 22 degrees Celsius, both in the suburbs and in south Mumbai, which was above normal. Mulund, Kandivali, and Powai had the lowest minimum temperatures in the city below 20 degrees Celsius. The weather bureau predicted the possibility of light rain for Tuesday as well. “Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) received light to moderate intermittent overnight showers that continued on Monday morning. Satellite images had indicated heavy cloud cover over north Konkan region,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD). Showers are expected till Wednesday, according to IMD, due to the confluence of northwesterly (coming from western disturbance over north) and southeasterly winds (coming from a low-pressure system over the Arabian Sea) extending over northwest India. “December rain is not routine for Mumbai but showers led to traffic snarls, poor visibility, moist and wet conditions through the city, said Hosalikar. He highlighted that weather radar images on Monday had shown a cloud patch from Raigad (Navi Mumbai, Alibag, Panvel), over MMR (Mumbai, Thane, Palghar), and Nashik. Meanwhile, apart from Mumbai, Nashik recorded 9.8mm rain, Harnai 4.4mm, Thane 4.2mm, and Mahabaleshwar 2.2mm. Is it common to see such weather in Mumbai during December? Scientists researching tropical meteorology said two weather systems - the formation of western disturbances (WD) during this time of the year was common over northern parts of the country and the Himalayan plain while the occurrence of low-pressure weather systems over the Arabian Sea was being observed during this time of the year as well. “However, the simultaneous formation of the WD and low-pressure system at the same time is quite interesting. We need to study how rare this and understand how the confluence of winds from these two systems plays a role during December for both coastal cities and those in interior parts of Maharashtra,” said Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll, senior scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Management, Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/overnight-rain-in-mumbai-brings-down-temperatures-and-pollution/story-8UyuENG8P6hXV5OL5kpAWK.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: A year on, no police officer found guilty for clashes at Jamia||Delhi Police has decided to absolve its personnel of charges that they had used excess force when they stormed the Jamia Milia Islamia campus on December 15 last year, officers familiar with the findings of a probe into the incident said, adding that the statements of around 60 witnesses were recorded and CCTV camera footage from the spot was analysed before reaching this decision.An inquiry into the incident was ordered after images of purported police brutality on the campus that evening went viral on social media. Separately, the police arrested 22 persons for the violence that broke out in and around the university on December 13 and December 15. Also Read| A year after Jamia violence: Lives upended, campus stays on edgeOfficers privy to the details of the probe said on condition of anonymity that the crime branch inquiry committee did not find any officer guilty, prima facie (at first sight), and has not recommended action against its personnel. The 22 arrested persons, which include locals (about three are students such as Sharjeel Imam and Asif Iqbal Tanha) have been charged under sections of rioting, damaging public property, criminal conspiracy, obstructing public servant in discharge of his/her duty.The police are likely to submit the findings of the inquiry report to the Delhi high court, which is hearing several pleas filed by civil society groups seeking action against the police.On the evening of December 15, 2019, Delhi Police entered the university campus, fired tear gas shells and baton-charged students and some locals inside after violence broke out near the university. Police said at the time that the rioters, a majority of whom were local residents, had entered the campus and hurled stones from inside. Police defended the decision to enter the campus, saying it was taken in order to catch the rioters. After the incident, however, several videos surfaced on social media in which police teams were seen breaking CCTV cameras, beating students, and firing tear gas shells on the campus, particularly its central library.HT has learnt from many senior police officers that the crime branch was ordered to start a probe because it involved verifying CCTV camera footage and analysing multiple videos posted on social media groups. Within the Delhi Police, the crime branch functions as a unit that’s separate from the local force.Unlike other inquiry proceedings in the past, when officers had been transferred from their place of posting while an investigation into a police action was underway, no officer was transferred or rebuked for their involvement in alleged brutality on the Jamia campus.HT contacted the crime branch chief special commissioner of police, Praveer Ranjan, for a response, but received no response despite repeated text messages and phone calls. Police spokesperson Eish Singhal, also deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi), said: “ The case is sub-judice. The courts are hearing the matter.”A crime branch officer, who did not wish to be named, said: “No one was indicted in the inquiry because the findings did not support the allegations. There is CCTV footage of the incident, which shows rioters pelting stones from inside the campus. There are also videos of police urging rioters to come out peacefully or not indulge in any violence. Even the National Rights Human Commission did not find fault in police’s act of entering the university.”A university spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.Retired Indian Police Service officer Vikram Singh, who was the director general of Uttar Pradesh police between 2007 and 2009, said that unlike other cases, the Jamia violence case should have been dealt with differently.“Police should have finished their inquiry and come public with their findings within a month or 90 days at the most... This case involved students. It does not take more than a month to complete inquiry in such cases. People have the right to know,” Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-a-year-on-no-police-officer-found-guilty-for-clashes-at-jamia/story-msWzhAfewrd2dJQZ9hDgLN.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Kalita trying to create narrative to implicate Kapil Mishra, say police||The Delhi Police on Monday claimed before a city court that Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Devangana Kalita, an accused in a north-east Delhi riots case, was creating a “narrative” in the media to show that BJP leader Kapil Mishra was behind the communal violence and, if the investigation, the prosecution and the country were to continue on the foundation of what was being reported in the media, then that would the end of the rule of law.Police told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that there was allegedly another narrative of “inscrutable indolence” created by the accused to show the prosecution in a bad light. The court was hearing the bail application of Kalita.Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, claimed that the accused was creating “narratives” to allegedly show that Mishra was behind the riots and making these narratives viral to make people believe that it was the truth.“The accused is trying to show that Kapil Mishra was behind all these and that the police were investigating only one side. The accused first create a narrative and then they make it viral and then make people believe that this is what happened as everybody is saying so. The accused create a narrative and file multiple petitions on it. Media houses pick it up and media houses will continue to pick up the narrative because if it has been pleaded in the petitions, then most of the people will start believing that,” Prasad said.He further said narratives were created to show that the police were allegedly carrying out a biased investigation. He said from the statements of witnesses, it was seen that the narrative that supporters of the amended citizenship laws started the riots was false.As per the case of the prosecution, Kalita was a part of the organisation Pinjra Tod which actively participated in protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and instigated the riots.To this, Kalita’s counsel Adit Pujari said just because Kalita was part of the Pinjra Tod group, it does not mean that she supported Sharjeel Imam, another accused in the riots conspiracy case. He further said there were posters to free Imam at the farmers’ protests as well.“Are all those farmers also part of the riots too? Multiple people have different views. That’s the beauty of a democracy,” he said.The court will further hear the bail plea on December 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-kalita-trying-to-create-narrative-to-implicate-kapil-mishra-say-police/story-GnCefYnrSGBqaiF9XVLEFM.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Positivity rate among contacts lower than among general population, shows data submitted to court||Only 2.77% of the people who were traced as contacts of a Covid-19 patient were found to be positive till date, according to the data submitted by the Delhi government in the Delhi high court. In comparison, Delhi’s cumulative positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among those tested – was 8.36% (as on Monday), as per the government data. This is contrary to what experts say -- that the positivity rate should be as high as 50 to 70% among close contacts; for example, those in the same family. Also, the daily positivity rate had shot up to almost 37% during the first surge in Covid cases in June and July, and up to 30% for RT-PCR tests during the recent November surge. Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayIn a status report filed through the additional standing counsel Satyakam, the Delhi government informed the court that a total of 19, 54,261 contacts had been traced for positive cases out whom 54,154 tested positive. With 601,150 cases, this means that just over three contacts were traced for every case in the city. The data also showed that very few people – 0.008% or 562 of the 665,513 placed under quarantine – violated it. The data was submitted to a bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad on Monday while hearing a plea by a lawyer Rakesh Malhotra seeking a ramping up of testing in the city. As per the data, the positivity rate among the contacts was the highest in the south-east district, where 6.48% of the 48,755 contacts were found positive. This was followed by Shahdara with 5.19% and north-west with 3.65%. On Monday, Delhi reported 1,376 new cases of the infection with fewer than the average 63,944 tests. The city also reported 60 deaths due to Covid-19, taking the total toll to 10,074 so far. After reporting fewer than 50 deaths for two days in a row, the numbers went up on Monday. This has also increased the 10-day case fatality ratio – proportion of deaths among those tested positive – to 2.54%, as per the daily health bulletin. Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology, All India Institute Medical Sciences said, “The positivity rate among contacts should be much higher than that of the general population. In fact, studies show that it could be as high as 50% to 70% among close contacts such as family members, depending on whether the index patient was symptomatic and also the duration of contact.” During the hearing on Monday, the bench asked the Delhi government to give the districts which has seen a surge in the number of cases so that testing can be ramped up in these areas. It also sought to know the current situation while also seeking to know whether the government had started a fresh sero survey. The matter was adjourned on Monday due to the paucity of time and would be now heard on December 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/positivity-rate-among-contacts-lower-than-among-general-population-shows-data-submitted-to-court/story-IwZ67hjWn3mIFhymS4AMUO.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||DDA to announce new housing scheme, offer 1,175 new flats||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is soon going to announce its new housing scheme that will offer 1175 flats, mostly in the middle and high income group, in December end or January next year, said a senior DDA official.The land-owning agency will table the proposal for the 2021 housing scheme in the next authority meeting, which was earlier scheduled to be held on December 10. A new date is yet to be finalised.Of the 1,175 flats, 700 will be in the Middle Income Group (MIG) category, 200 in the High Income Group (HIG) category and the rest will be in the economically weaker section. The flats are located in south-west Delhi’s Dwarka and south-east Delhi’s Jasola.According to a senior DDA official, the MIG flats, which is around 1200-1300 sqft, will cost close to R1.2 crore, while the HIG flats, which are 150-170 sqft, will cost more than Rs 2crore.“Once the proposal is passed by the authority, we will launch the 2021 housing scheme. The 700 MIG flats are located in two sectors (16B and 19B) in Dwarka, while the HIG flats are in Jasola. The EWS flats are located in Manglapuri in Dwarka,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity. After three unsuccessful housing schemes, the land-owning agency is hoping for a good response this time around to its new housing scheme as the flats on offer will be spacious and located in areas which are well connected to the rest of the city.Last year, the DDA has put 18,000 flats for sale initially, but had to reduce the number of flats in the scheme to 10,294 later, as it didn’t get the desired response. The land-owning agency had received 45,012 applications for its flats, but it could sell only 8,438 flats — 488 HIG, 1,555 in MIG, 5,172 in low income group (LIG) and 1,223 EWS category flats — of which close to 6,000 flats were later returned, according to a senior official aware of the development.One of the main reasons for poor response to DDA’s housing schemes in the past has been the location of the flats. A majority of the flats put on sale by the DDA last year were located in Narela, which is not well connected with the rest of the city.“We are hopeful that this scheme will receive a good response, as the flats are located in Dwarka and Jasola, both places being well connected with public transport,” said the official.Sabyasachi Das, former planning commissioner of DDA, said, “It will be profitable for DDA to construct more housing in Dwarka as compared to Narela, as the former is a developed area and is well-connected to the Metro. Even Jasola is has good public transport system in place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-to-announce-new-housing-scheme-offer-1-175-new-flats/story-cufwFSJIE3DuxiGWxoqzNK.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Students should not be charged for digital degrees, Delhi court tells DU||The Delhi University on Monday informed the Delhi High Court that it had constituted a committee for proposing charges for issuance of digital degree certificate on whose recommendations, it is charging ₹750 from the students for whom the printed degree has not been issued and ₹1,000 from the students for whom the printed degree has been issued.The DU, represented by advocate Mohinder Rupal, told Justice Pratibha Singh that the reason behind charging the students for the digital degrees is that several people have to be employed to process these degrees. He also said that since the timeline is too short, the varsity is adopting these measures, there won’t be any need for charging more.“…but I can’t say anything right now. We have to do it on war footing,” he said.However, the court said that the students should not be charged for the digital degrees and that they should be free of cost.“There is a problem. I think degree certificates should be given free of cost. Paper is costing more, there you are not charging but for creating an electronic degree , you are charging!,” the bench remarked.It asked the Delhi University as to whether issuance of digital degree certificates will be made an annual regular feature or it is only for this academic year after the students raised several grievances on the imposition of an exorbitant fee proposed to be charged for the provision of digital degrees.The court was hearing a plea by a few students who had moved to the court seeking directions to the University to declare their results and issue the degrees.Appearing for the students, their counsel Sarthak Maggon, told the court that the University, in their consolidated annual fee charged to the students, already accounts for provision of degree certificates/migration certificates and hence they should not be permitted to charge students for providing a digital copy of the same degree.He said that such a charge imposes additional burden on the students and it would be exorbitant given that production of digital degrees after putting into place the appropriate format must not be chargeable at par with physical printed degrees since the nature of production and procurement of such degrees is cost effective once the technical infrastructure has been appropriately set up.The varsity in its affidavit has justified the charges of digital degree, stating that it has adopted General Financial Regulations, 2017 regarding transactions involving financial implications which makes the user Charges as an essential component of the non- tax revenues.During the hearing, the judge also sought to know whether the transmission of data for uploading on Digilocker with respect to all the students in all courses of DU is going to be followed in feature and if so, within what timelines.The court said that there has to be a proper timeline for uploading the data while adding that, immediately upon declaration of results, a digital degree is being generated within a period of one month and that data should be transmitted to the Digilocker.The matter would be now heard on December 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/students-should-not-be-charged-for-digital-degrees-delhi-court-tells-du/story-efbQmT61tCrFtPx3zQmyKN.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Govt narrows on five firms for the next phase of the Central Vista redevelopment project||The Centre has narrowed down on five construction firms for the next phase of the Central Vista redevelopment project— the redevelopment and restructuring of the Central Vista Avenue, which includes the majority of the Rajpath stretch and the row of government offices that are parallel to it, senior officials said.According to officials aware of the development, the five firms — Tata Projects Limited, Shapoorji Pallonji Group, ITD Cementation, NCC limited and PSP Projects limited — submitted their technical bids on Monday. “The technical bids will now be evaluated. After this, those who qualify will place their financial bids in a few days,” said a senior official requesting anonymity. “Seven bidders had participated in the pre-bidding meeting for the project held in November,” the official added.Tata Projects Limited has also been tasked with the construction of the new Parliament complex after it emerged as the lower bidder for the tender with a bid of Rs 861.90 crore when financial bids for the project opened on September 16, and was awarded the contract to construct the building on September 29. When contacted by HT a spokesperson for the firm declined to comment.The nodal agency for the project; the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has also revised the estimated cost for the project from ₹463 crore to ₹502 crore, according to the modified tender document reviewed by HT. The tender for the redevelopment of the Central Vista avenue also mandates the firms to maintain it for five years from completion, and requires that the project be complete within 300 days. Work will also need to be carried out in patches in order to minimise the portion of the avenue that is cordoned off at any given time, according to the tender floated in November. This phase will also require contractors to install air purifiers and keep construction noise under preset thresholds, HT had reported on November 9.“The contractor may have to execute the work in three shifts with large manpower of workers, supervisors and professional engineers,” the tender document said.Whichever firm is selected, it will be responsible for comprehensive maintenance and operation for a period of 60 months after completion of construction. The second phase of the project will include the demolition of dozens of office buildings.Broadly, the plan includes razing buildings such as Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan that house important government ministries to build a common secretariat for roughly 70,000 central government employees who are currently located across 30 buildings.According to the revised cost estimates: Rs372.9 crore will be for the ‘Civil Work & Horticulture Component’, Rs 113.7 crore for the ‘Electrical & Mechanical component’ and Rs15.51 crore for ‘Operation & Maintenance’ for five years. “This estimate, however, is given merely as a rough guide,” according to the tender document.The plan, being handled by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, involves having a new Parliament building in place by India’s 75th Independence Day in 2022, while the entire project is slated to be finished by 2024.“The work is to be carried out strictly within 10 months i.e. the period available between two Republic Day Celebrations i.e. RDC 2021 & 2022. There is no scope of failure in completing the project by November, 2021 after starting the work in Feb, 2021… The work is to be completed within a short period of 10 months. This condition has been incorporated to check the financial strength as well as capability to mobilize resources required for a work of this magnitude,” CPWD had noted in a pre-bidding meeting held in November according to minutes of the meeting reviewed by HT. The work on the second phase of the project comes at a time when the apex court last week had directed the Centre to immediately stop all construction and ancillary activities in the historically significant Central Vista area of New Delhi where a new Parliament, Central Secretariat and union ministries’ offices are planned to be built. The Supreme Court, had however, allowed the government to proceed with the foundation stone laying ceremony on December 10, and procedural paperwork stating that there cannot be alterations to the site.Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the new Parliament House on Thursday, describing the event as a milestone in India’s democratic history and asserting that the building will become the symbol of a 21st century nation and Aatmanirbhar Bharat, or self-reliant India.In the ambitious Central Vista project the new Parliament complex, has an earlier deadline of 2022 under the Central Vista redevelopment plan, and will be among the first plans to be finalised. The redevelopment will also see shifting of the Prime Minister and the Vice President’s residence, North and South Block turning into a museum as well as new administrative offices with an underground metro on either side of the avenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-narrows-on-five-firms-for-the-next-phase-of-the-central-vista-redevelopment-project/story-AG2gAy4hNlBfXbryFXB1dP.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Mayors set up ‘offices’ outside Delhi CM residence||The mayors of the three BJP-led municipal corporations started clearing pending files from their makeshift offices from outside Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Monday, the eighth day of their protest against the government for alleged non-payment of dues. The deadlock between the mayors and the government entered into its eighth day on Monday.From Tuesday, between 1pm and 2pm, the mayors will conduct public dealings from the same location.On Monday, files pertaining to development work and other administrative works were brought to the temporary office outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s Flag Staff Road residence by municipal officials. The mayors said that they will continue doing office work from here till the time the chief minister orders for the release of Rs 13,000 crore, which they allege the government owes to the municipal corporation.The three mayors started their office work around 11.30 am and met officials throughout the day to clear pending work, as they had not been attending office for the past one week. The mayors said that the public can come and meet them at their makeshift office between 1pm and 2pm.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said, “Today, we met a few people from the public. But from Tuesday, we will do public dealings from here. Those who come to our office at the Civic Centre will be redirected to come and meet us here. They can tell us in advance and we will take the necessary police permission. Unlike Kejriwal, we can’t let the public suffer.”In the temporary tent erected outside the CM’s residence, the mayors had set up their offices by putting banners which read “Mayor’s office” followed by the name of the respective corporation.“We had called the additional commissioners and heads of the departments to discuss pending work. We have given them instructions that the municipal work shouldn’t suffer due to our protest. Now onwards, the files will be brought here for clearance,” south corporation mayor, Anamika Mithilesh Singh, said.Nirmal Jain, mayor of East corporation, added, “It is unfortunate that the CM doesn’t want to talk to the mayors and find a solution to the problem. After all the issue we are raising will have an impact on Delhi. But he is just not concerned.”Reacting to the ongoing protest of the mayors, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday said the BJP is just doing “drama all day” and “playing dirty politics”.“The mayors of the BJP ruled MCD are sitting outside the residence of Delhi chief minister and chilling there. At the same time, the commissioners of the BJP ruled MCD are on leave for the last 15 days. The mayors have left the MCD to God. The people of Delhi want cleanliness and governance and they are now regretting about electing them,” said senior leader and AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj. He said the AAP has also exposed a scam of Rs 2500 crores, wherein the north MCD waived off the money owed to it by the South MCD. “This scam is much bigger than the Commonwealth Games scam which happened under the then chief minister Sheila Dixit. This is the biggest scam in the history of Delhi, but the BJP has not responded on this matter as well,” Bhardwaj said. BJP complaints to NCW against AAPThe Delhi BJP has filed a complaint with the National Commission for Women (NCW) against the AAP-led Delhi government for installing CCTV cameras near the tent setup by the mayors outside the CM’s residence. Citing privacy of women councillors, who have been sitting on protest outside the CM’s residence, the BJP said the CCTVs were being installed in violation of the “Delhi Rules for regulations of CCTV camera systems in NCT of Delhi 2018.Demanding an inquiry, the BJP said the way CCTVs were being installed invaded the privacy of female councillors.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “What happened yesterday outside CM’s residence was unfortunate. It is a question of privacy of women councillors. Why do they want to install CCTVs near the tent? There are already so many CCTVs in the area. We have requested the commission inquire into the matter.”Senior Aam Aadmi Party leader and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said by disallowing to install CCTV cameras outside the CM’s residence, the BJP mayors and councillors are trying to hide their misdeeds. “They did not only manhandled the officials who were installing the cameras, but also broke the devices. They are definitely trying to hide some conspiracy which they are hatching by sitting outside the CM’s residence,” he said. Bhardwaj said the cameras overlook the street and have nothing to do with privacy. “By that logic, the cameras installed at similar location outside the LG’s office should also be removed and broken. Why didn’t the BJP raise the privacy issue on that? The cameras were not being put to peep into anyone’s house. The logic of woman’s privacy and all is totally absurd,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mayors-set-up-offices-outside-cm-residence/story-2v7fks7TSaTqxcuau0cvTJ.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Nearly 3,000 AIIMS nurses go on strike to demand better pay||Nearly 3,000 nurses working at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) went on an indefinite strike from Monday onwards seeking higher remuneration due to an “anomaly” in the implementation of the previous pay commission’s recommendations. As per Harish Kajla, president of the AIIMS nursing union, there was an anomaly in implementing the sixth pay commission’s recommendations and after several meeting their demand had been accepted by the health minister last year. However, nothing changed on the ground. The AIIMS administration, however, claimed that the anomaly was “perceived” by the nurses and the sixth pay commission committee members and the finance department had clearly said that there was no anomaly in the implementation. “Unfortunately at this time of a pandemic, the nurses have gone on a strike. The nurses union had put in 23 demands, almost all of which were met by the institute or the government. One demand of a perceived anomaly as per the sixth pay commission remains. Multiple meetings have been held, even with one of the committee members who drafted the pay commission recommendations. It has been explained to the nurses union that their interpretation is not correct and beyond the purview of the notification,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS. He added, “At this time, when the country is going through so many hardships, when a lot of people have had to accept pay cuts and loss of their jobs, the nurses are asking for a pay hike. It seems very inappropriate.” “Today, some contract nurses were hired. AIIMS is known for the quality of treatment and the administration wants to leave the lives of people in the hands of nurses on contract now,” said Kajla. The AIIMS administration however said that the patients were being managed by resident doctors, senior faculty members and staff. “We have around 4,000 nurses at AIIMS; the senior nurses – of ranks of assistant nursing officer and above – have not gone on strike. Nearly 3,000 level I and II nurses are on strike. We have put more senior residents on duty to cover for the striking nurses. The senior faculty and other staff members are managing the patients,” said a senior official, on condition of anonymity. Further, the administration has stated that the strike is in contravention of a Delhi high court order that says no employee or staff can cease work for any reason or shout slogans and hold demonstrations within 500 metres of the campus. Meanwhile, a government official said that since the demand for salary is not covered under the previous circular, the Central government has agreed to view it as a fresh demand. “This will therefore have to be examined as a fresh demand. It was also stated that the Ministry is open to placing the fresh demand before appropriate authorities for sympathetic consideration and therefore the AllMS Nurses Union may be requested to reconsider and withdraw the call for any strike, especially during these trying times, due to the national priority of effectively tackling Covid-19 pandemic,” read an order dated December 14 by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nearly-3-000-aiims-nurses-go-on-strike-to-demand-better-pay/story-a60vqAzrpsTgjHHuJOKivN.html
15-12-2020||Chandigarh||PSPCL office in Ludhiana’s Fountain Chowk crying for attention||Walking into the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited’s (PSPCL’s) two-storeyed sub-station building in Fountain Chowk, one is met by a sight of absolute dilapidation, with broken window panes, piled up meters and eclectic clutter greeting visitors at the onset.  Long forgotten files, loose electric wire and damaged transformers can be seen collecting dust in the building that has a footfall of 50 to 80 people daily.As per officials, the civil maintenance wing of the PSPCL is in charge of the 60- year-old building’s upkeep. Stagnant water and choked sewerage near the entrance of the building also paint a grim picture. Piled up electricity meters at the entrance, near the stairs and loose hanging wires endanger visitors.A visitor, Suresh Pal, said, “I visited the Fountain Chowk office today to deposit my electricity bill. I have to stand in queue every time as there is only one cash counter.” “At the entrance of the building, electricity meters have been stacked up and bicycles are parked inside the building. The wires of electricity meters installed in the building are hanging in the open. The authorities are clearly not bothered about the safety of their own staff and the public visiting the office.”Parvesh Kumar, a 65-year-old, visitor, said, “The condition of the office is miserable and the department is making no attempts to improve the facilities. I live in Ghumar Mandi and prefer paying my electricity bill at this office. The windows panes make the vist all the more daunting in the cold weather.”An official requesting anonymity, said, “There is a need to repair the building as all the window panes are broken and damaged transformers, pipes and wires are kept in the rear of the office in the open. The condition of the toilets is also deplorable. The higher authorities must provide better facilities to the workers.”When contacted, SS Josan, chief engineer of protection and maintenance wing, said, “I will look into the matter and visit the sub-station office.” He asserted that they had received no intimation from officials regarding need for maintenance, but they will take cognisance of the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pspcl-office-at-ludhiana-s-fountain-chowk-crying-for-attention/story-IyEJqEuGKbIPpFsqZQQXsL.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality improves, temperature falls||While the national capital’s temperature fell, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) officially announcing the onset of winter, strong winds that blew over Delhi from Sunday night helped improve its air quality from “very poor” to “moderate”.Despite Monday being a sunny day, the minimum and maximum temperatures fell in Delhi. According to IMD, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official recording for Delhi, was 8.4°C and the maximum temperature was 19.4°C, which was four degrees below the season’s normal.On Sunday, Delhi recorded a maximum of 20.7°C—three notches below normal. The minimum, meanwhile, was recorded 11.1°C.Scientists said that cold northwesterly winds from Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, which are experiencing heavy snowfall, are the reason for the fall in Delhi’s temperature.“Even though the sky is clear and it is sunny, the cold winds are not allowing the ground to get warm and this is the reason we are feeling colder,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said.Meanwhile, the Central Pollution Control Board data shows that the overall air quality index (AQI) reading of Delhi on Monday was 160, in the “moderate” range, which is uncommon for the month of December when the low temperature and wind speed lead to high pollution.In many pollution monitoring stations, such as the ones in Aya Nagar, Lodhi Road, Pusa, and Indira Gandhi International Airport, the average hourly AQI readings had reached the “satisfactory” zone.On Sunday, the overall AQI reading was recorded 305, in the “very poor” zone. IMD scientists said that strong winds which continued to blow over Delhi from Sunday evening helped dispersal of pollution particles.Srivastava said, “After the passing of a western disturbance, which took place on Saturday, wind speeds tend to pick up and that’s what Delhi experienced. On Sunday night, winds picked up and continued to blow through the night, which is rare because, during winters, wind at night tends to be calm. On Monday too, the winds were consistent and the average speed was around 12-15kmph.”Srivastava said that the wind speed is expected to improve further on Tuesday, which will keep the pollution levels low.VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, also said that air quality over the next few days is expected to remain in the “moderate” to “poor” range. “We do not see any major deterioration at least for the next three or four days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-improves-temperature-falls/story-2BiGOLnlC6SkBhoMkOnTaN.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Police deploy cargo containers as barricades at Singhu border||Delhi Police on Monday placed cargo containers at Singhu border near the barricades that divides the security personnel from protesting farmers. Two cargo containers were seen placed at the border on Monday which police officers said are being used to replace with the mud-laden dumpers that have been stationed here since Day One of the agitation. The protests, overall, remained peaceful at Delhi’s borders on Monday.A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said that deployment at Singhu border remained the same as the farmers’ agitation entered into its 18th day on Monday. More public announcement systems were installed on Monday by the Delhi police and a drone was also used to keep an eye on the gathering now spreads across 5-6 kilometers on the Delhi-Sonepat highway.Additional deputy commissioner of police, Jitendra Kumar Meena, said that the situation continued to remain peaceful at Singhu border on Monday. “We ensured sufficient deployment and the situation is being continuously monitored,” he added.The day was also peaceful at Ghazipur border on Monday even as some protesting farmers tried to block the other two carriageways of the Delhi-Meerut expressway earlier in the day. However, they were immediately disbursed by the police and their own leaders.Traffic at the Delhi-Meerut Expressway also remained the same, with one carriageway leading from Ghaziabad to Delhi closed and the other connecting Delhi to Ghaziabad operating as normal. The NH-24 service lane, which has been blocked by the farmers November 27 onwards, also continued to remain closed for traffic on Monday.Chilla border that was closed by the farmers since December 1, and was cleared on Sunday morning, witnessed normal traffic movement on Monday. However, because a small group of farmers had stayed back, still occupying one lane near the central verge at the Gautam Buddha Dwar, on the Delhi - Noida border, the traffic moving from Noida to Delhi slowed down.Apart from Chilla and Ghazipur borders, seven borders that continued to remain completely blocked, are Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Jharoda, Piao Maniyari, and Mangesh in outer and south-western parts of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-deploy-cargo-containers-as-barricades-at-singhu-border/story-cg407Ar8m4YiCbfvPGEbxO.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Supporters of VM Singh stay put at Ghazipur, say ‘outside groups’ trying to divide and rule||A day after farmer leader Sardar VM Singh expressed his dissatisfaction with the ongoing agitation, triggering a deluge of criticism from other protesters, members and supporters of his organisation, the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, assembled at the Ghazipur border on Monday and alleged that some “outside groups”, at behest of the Centre, have been trying to divide protesting farmers. They asserted that they will continue to participate in the ongoing agitation.Singh on Sunday told HT that the agitation was “not going right” and farmer unions should not make scrapping of the laws a precondition for talks with the government or shut the door on negotiations. Several leaders of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a platform leading the protests, dissociated themselves from Singh’s comments. The national working committee of the AIKSCC on Monday removed VM Singh as its convener.Around 500 to 600 farmers from parts of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Uttarakhand, who are associated with Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, have been participating in the protest at the Ghazipur border since December 3. Prior to that, they were protesting at the Burari ground.Tarun Chawdhary, a farmer from Hapur and a member of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, said, “There are people who are working for the government and trying to play the divide and rule game. Some of them are sitting here among us. Whatever VM Singh said was wrongly interpreted. He has been fighting for the rights of farmers for years. It’s because of him that we, sugarcane farmers, have managed to survive in UP over these years.”On Monday, several posters and banners of VM Singh and his party were spotted at the protest site. There were around 20-24 trucks and trolleys of his supporters parked on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, where farmers have been protesting since November 26. Kulwinder Singh, another farmer from Pilibhit in UP, said, “There have been rumors on social media about VM Singh and his supporters opting out of the protests. But they are all wrong. We have two demands --- complete repeal of new farm laws and a law on Minimum Support Price (MSP). We will not go anywhere till the government accepts these demands.”VM Singh had said the farmer unions had “shifted goalposts”. “Our initial demand was about legislating a private member’s bill in Parliament to guarantee MSP...If the government brings a law to guarantee MSP, then farmers shouldn’t care about whether Adani or Ambani is buying (produce),” he said. Sardar Jagdeep Singh, a farmer from Saharanpur and a supporter of VM Singh, said, “Our leader knows much more about laws than any other person protesting here. Some of the protesting groups are trying to sideline him. But we will stay put and continue our protest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/supporters-of-vm-singh-stay-put-at-ghazipur-say-outside-groups-trying-to-divide-and-rule/story-UYYnKpitu27repPT8l2sCL.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal, Amarinder Singh trade barbs over new farm laws||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh were on Monday locked in a political slugfest over contentious farm laws that have prompted protests across the country, questioning each other’s intent on supporting farmers who have hunkered down at the Capital’s borders, even as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader observed a day-long fast to oppose the pieces of legislation.Kejriwal said the new farm laws will lead to immense inflation and will only favour a few capitalists, as he termed them “anti-farmer and anti-common man”. The Delhi CM, who joined AAP leaders, ministers, MLAs and volunteers at the party office for the fast in support of the protesting farmers, said the new farm laws “gives licence to inflate”.Addressing party workers at the AAP headquarters on Rouse Avenue Road, Kejriwal said the three farm laws will increase the prices of essential commodities by “about 16 times in just four years” and added that the new legislation legalised unlimited hoarding of farm produce.Earlier in the day, Kejriwal criticised the Punjab CM for mocking his fast by calling it “theatrics”. “Captain, I have stood with the farmers from the beginning. Did not let Delhi’s Stadium become a jail, fought the Center. I am supporting the farmers by serving them. You set-up a deal with the Centre to get your son’s ED (Enforcement Directorate) case forgiven, sold the farmers’ movement? Why?” Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi.In response, Singh said he cannot be “cowed down” by any ED case. “Just as every Punjabi knows, I am not one to be cowed down by ED or other cases, you Mr @ArvindKejriwal will even sell your soul if it serves your political purposes. If you think farmers are going to be taken in by your dramatics then you are totally mistaken,” Singh tweeted.Kejriwal said that the Punjab CM was “part of the committee which drafted these bills. These Bills are YOUR ‘gift’ to the nation.” “Captain sahib, why do BJP leaders never accuse u of double standards the way they accuse all other leaders?” he added.Singh said Kejriwal’s “desperate” attempts to “hide” his government’s “utter failure” to protect farmers’ interests will not save him from their wrath, nor will they safeguard his party from being decimated in the next Punjab assembly elections.To this, the Punjab CM said: “These farm laws were NOT discussed at any meeting & your repeated lies will not change that Mr @ArvindKejriwal. And naturally BJP can’t accuse me of double standards as I don’t have any nexus with them like you have. They after all have to cover up their collusion with you!”Kejriwal responded to Singh again, saying: “Its a part of record that ur committee drafted these laws. YOU had the power to stop these laws, tell the people of this country that such laws were being contemplated by the centre. Why did u go along wid the centre?”Joining the day-long fast by AAP leaders later in the day, Kejriwal said the laws will give “big private companies” the licence to rapidly increase prices of commodities. “These laws will cause massive price hike in the country and running your households will become very difficult as salaries won’t increase at the same rate. Do not think that you are doing any favour to the farmers by supporting them in their protest. In fact, the protesting farmers are doing a favour to all of us. If not rolled back, these laws will push the common man into a major crisis. We all need to protest against these laws. The AAP is standing beside farmers and supporting their demands,” he said.The day-long hunger strike was also observed by Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, health minister Satyendar Jain, environment minister Gopal Rai and food minister Imran Hussain. Many other AAP leaders and volunteers also joined the protest across different states in support of the farmers, the party said.Delhi assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel also observed a day-long fast. BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra criticised Kejriwal for his hunger strike. “The farmers’ movement has become a battle of political groups, not farmers. Look at the AAP and Captain Amarinder Singh’s tweet war, they are fighting each other. Do you think they are fighting for the interest of farmers? No, they are fighting to see who can sit on the throne without doing any work,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-amarinder-trade-barbs-over-new-farm-laws/story-GN67lqVWNc9CUUULltIlhI.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Several farmers keep day-long fast, warn of indefinite hunger strike if demands not met||Eighty-five-year-old Randheer Singh from Haryana, 40-year-old Arjun Arya from Madhya Pradesh and 28-year-old Seema Bharti from Uttar Pradesh came together on Monday to observe a 10-hour hunger strike at Delhi’s borders, to strengthen their demand for the withdrawal of the three new farm laws. The farmers said Monday’s ten-hour strike, from 8am to 5pm, was a symbolic protest and it may soon take the shape of an indefinite hunger strike, if the government doesn’t agree to their demands.Also Read| Will resume talks, but with some riders: Farmer unionsSingh, a farmer from Jind, has been camping at Singhu border since November 26 when the police had stopped them from entering Delhi. After more than a fortnight of peaceful protest, farmer groups had given a call for hunger strike on Monday after multiple rounds of talks with the government failed.One of the eldest members of the group to observe the hunger strike, Singh said, “Even on the 18th day of our protest, we are all full of energy as we were on Day One. The movement is not about us individuals anymore. Even if any of us have to sacrifice ourselves, we will not step back,” Singh said.At Singhu border, at least 10 farmers, three of them women, observed the day-long hunger strike. One of them, Seema Bharti, a 28-year-old farmer from Sindhauli in Uttar Pradesh, said if the government remains deaf to their requests, they will intensify the protest. “If nothing works, we will walk into Delhi like we had planned and make the government heed our demands,” she said.Apart from Singhu, a group of 10 farmers observed the fast at Ghazipur border, and another group of 20 of went without food at the Tikri border.At the Chilla border, two farmers were seen observing the ten-hour fast.Rakesh Tikait, 51, leader of Bharatiya Kisan Union Takait (BKU) faction in Uttar Pradesh were among those who kept the fast at Ghazipur. “It’s unfortunate that the government has forced farmers, who provide food to the nation, to go on a hunger strike. We had on Sunday said that we are ready for discussions but the government has not extended an invitation as of now. It government clearly doesn’t think about the farmers,” he said.At Tikri border, at least 20 farmers took part in the hunger strike. Among them was Bogh Mansa, 68, a farmer from Mansa district of Punjab. “The government has neither been able to explain how the new farm laws are good nor been able to tell us why they can’t be withdrawn,” he said.Two farmers took part in the hunger strike at Chilla border. Brushing aside the rumours that farmers have left the site, Yogesh Pratap Singh, 35, state president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu), said, “There have been rumours that we have backed out but that’s not true. We just opened the road for the convenience of the people. We will sit here and protest for as long as it takes.”A group of students and activists on Monday also participated in a protest held in Shaheedi Park, ITO. “The new farm laws would cause enormous harm to the public, marginal farmers, and urban-rural workers by forcing them to buy essential commodities at inflated prices. Moreover, the introduction of contract farming through another law aims to hand over the reins to corporates. These laws have shown that the BJP government is anti-people, anti-worker and anti-small farmer,” said Dinesh Kumar, member of Krantikari Yuva Sangathan (KYS), a student organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/several-farmers-keep-day-long-fast-warn-of-indefinite-hunger-strike-if-demands-not-met/story-UQUBl0MFkPNfNG0KtKCHQK.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Deadly fungal infection reported in patient with Covid-19 at Ganga Ram hospital||Doctors from a city hospital have seen an increase in cases of a rare fungal infection with immune-compromised coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients getting it. If not detected early, the infection – Mucormycosis also known as black fungus – can kill half the patients and lead to loss of vision or jaw in others. Sir Ganga Ram hospital has seen 10 cases of Mucormycosis in the last 15 days in patients who either had Covid-19 or had recently recovered from it. In comparison, the hospital sees about five cases of the infection in a year. Also Read: Remdesivir may be highly effective against coronavirus, case study finds“Like any fungal infection, Mucormycosis is opportunistic and happens in mostly immune-compromised patients like those with diabetes, kidney disease, or those who have had transplants. Even in the cases that we have seen recently, the patients had other comorbid conditions but Covid-19 seems to have weakened their immunity further. Also, many Covid-19 patients are given steroids and other drugs that might lower their immunity further,” said Dr. Shaloo Bageja, senior eye surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram hospital. A 32-year-old businessman from West Delhi was diagnosed with Covid-19 on November 20. His fever did not break for four days and he started getting excessive cough and breathing difficulty. He was admitted to a hospital and was given antiviral drugs, steroids, oxygen and other supplements. He was discharged after seven days. He returned to the hospital with a nagging left-side nose obstruction and eye swelling. He did not respond to antibiotics and pain killers and started losing vision rapidly on the affected side. The entire left-side of the face had become numb. His tests revealed that he had Mucormycosis. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe infection had affected his left sinus, eye, upper jaw bone and muscles, and even the brain. Surgeons had to remove the affected tissue. He was given antiviral medications and critical care support. He survived but was disfigured. “Early clinical suspicion on symptoms such as nose obstruction, swelling in the eye or cheeks, and black dry crusts in the nose should immediately prompt the conduct of a biopsy in the OPD and start of the antifungal therapy as early as possible,” said Dr Manish Munjal, senior ENT surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. “Especially if a patient has a history of Covid-19 and other comorbidities,” said Dr Bagheja. The symptoms may take a couple of weeks to just a couple of days to become grave. “The spread of the infection depends on how your immune system is working. It may take up to two weeks for the situation to become grave where we might need to remove the eyes of the patients. However, in the current cases we saw that the infection got worse even within a couple of days and it also happened in young patients – 30 to 40 year olds,” said Dr Bagheja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/deadly-fungal-infection-reported-in-patient-with-covid-19-at-ganga-ram-hospital/story-ayia134CSHDNzNqnbIl5qL.html
15-12-2020||Pune||Forest dept takes action against visitors bringing pets to Taljai forest area||The state forest department has begun to take action against visitors bringing their pets to the Pachgaon Parvati forest area, which encompasses the Taljai area as well. “Over the past week, several morning walkers complained verbally to the forest officer on duty in the Pachgaon Parvati forest area about pets being walked in the area. We took action starting at 4 am until 9 am where upon we penalised visitors with pets. One person faced a penalty of Rs 2000,” said Deepak Pawar, deputy conservator of forests. The forest officials are taking action based on rules as per the India Forest Act 1927, section 26, and the Wildlife protection act. The India forest Act 1927, section 26, states that the forest officer may evict from a reserved forest or from any land in a reserved forest, any person who, in such forest, trespasses or pastures cattle, or permits cattle to trespass, or clears or breaks up such land for cultivation or for any other purpose and may demolish any building erected or construction. “We have given a fair warning today, and we plan to continue the vigil every morning. If people with pets still don’t pay any heed to this, they we will take strict action and also bring charges against them,” said Rahul Patil, district forest officer. “By bringing pets into the forest area, they are disrupting the biodiversity, and scaring the wild animals and birds. Sudden barking, or even two dogs fighting could also cause harm to other walkers,” Patil added. Amit Shahane, a regular walker, and resident of Sahakar nagar said, “Post lockdown, when the tekdis were opened to walkers, we saw several owners bring their pets in cars or on two-wheelers for walks in the forest area. There is an ignorance of the rule that pets are not allowed in a forest area and also there is no vigilance from the forest department. If we leave the main gate where forest staff are, there are atleast five entry points from were pets and their owners can enter the forest. Infact, had it not been for some joggers’ complaints, no one would have taken action.” On the issue of vigilance, forest officer Patil replied, “We have begun the tendering process for the compound wall demarcating forest area, of which 300 metres is yet to be complete. Once it is done, we will have better vigil over the forest area and also stop illegal entry into the forest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/forest-dept-takes-action-against-visitors-bringing-pets-to-taljai-forest-area/story-4MCnblV784t0z72MqYkCOJ.html
15-12-2020||Pune||English-medium schools in Pune to shut down ops between Dec 15 and 17 to protest non-payment of fees by parents||Most English-medium schools in Pune and surrounding areas, which are a part of the Federation of Schools Association in Maharashtra (FSAM), will remain shut between December 15 and December 17, said the federation. The schools took the decision on Monday to protest against the non-payment of fees by over 50 per cent of parents. Rajendra Singh, state president of FSAM, said that the schools are struggling to survive due to financial crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and claimed that almost 1,400 schools will take part in their protest.“There are only 30 per cent parents who have given the fees. At least 58 per cent parents who are capable of paying fees have not yet paid. This puts the schools in a tough spot. There is infrastructure expenditure and teaching and non-teaching staff which continues to be paid by schools. In this situation, paying fees is important. How are schools going to survive if parents don’t pay the fee?” asked Singh. “In case the issue is not resolved till the end of December, our schools across Maharashtra may start an indefinite closure of online teaching in January,” said SinghJayshree Venkatraman, principal, SNBP international school, Rahatani, said that the school has five branches across the city and 1,000 teaching and non-teaching staff.“We have communicated properly with the parents since the start. We understand that the parents are affected, but there is only so much we can help. It is difficult for us to run the school till March because of financial crisis. We have time and again waived the fees of annual concerts, transport and others. But we still have to pay the teachers who are working day and night for the students,” said Venkatraman.Milind Ladge, Aryan World School from Warje, who is also a part of the school strike, said that his total staff is over 900. “As the lockdown started, we have been hit very hard. The first instalment was due on March 15, but because of the lockdown the fee payment got delayed. Even then we communicated to the parents that they should pay the fees as the pandemic gets over. Till October, I have paid my staff in full. Since, then there has been discrepancy in payment as all our funds are over,” said Ladge. Advocate Anubha Sahai, president, India Wide Parents Association (IWPA), said that as far as the fee is concerned during the pandemic, schools cannot commit 100 per cent fees. “We are willing to pay the fees, but not 100 per cent. We have told the government to conducts audit of schools. If the audits are done, the scenario will be clear. Other states have given a relief to parents. So, in Maharashtra why is nothing happening? Why are schools not ready for audit? They have not followed school fee regulations for the last couple of years. The government should take over these schools or provide aid. Parents are not demanding relief every year. Government should intervene,” said Sahai.Schools which will be shut for three days*SNBP International Schools*Indira School*Priyadarshini Group of Schools*Aryan World School*Orbis School*Innovera school *City pride school*Saraswati Bhuwan English School *Kunjir public school *Master mind school*Dwarka international school*Novel School||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/1-400-schools-in-pune-to-shut-between-dec-15-and-17-to-protest-non-payment-of-fees-by-parents/story-EKbsTzZijajGJO4gsa2VrI.html

It is tough to estimate the losses immediately. Grapes crack due to the cold.”Khapre added, “Grape vineyards have been seeing bad weather for the last three years. Earlier, rains washed out the crop. Due to lockdown, grape producers sold their produce at throw away prices.”Grape farmer Shankar Gangude from Nashik district said, “My grape crop is ready. I was planning to sell the grapes in the next two weeks as almost all grapes are ready. Due to the change in weather, I am now worried. Grape is a very sensitive crop and its production cost is very high.” Khapre expects the grape crops pan-Maharashtra, Nashik, Pune, Sangli, Solapur, and Latur – to be affected by the rain.Hari Patil, a pomegranate farmer from Sangola in Solapur district, said, “Apart from grapes, these rains are going to affect the pomegranate and tomato crops as well.”Rohit Gadre from Ratnagiri said, “Due to the rain and cold, we are worrying about the flowering of the mango crop. It might bring down mango production everywhere. This is mainly the flowering season for the mango fruit.”Covid lockdowns bigger threat for exportersMaharashtra is the largest grape exporter in India. All India Grapes Export Association president Jagannath Khapre said, “We are more worried about Covid-19 than the weather. Recently, England and Germany announced lock downs.

15-12-2020||Bhopal||Women from Chambal stitch a success story, turn crisis into opportunity||A group of 10 women from a backward village in Madhya Pradesh that has the poorest sex and child at birth sex ratios in the Chambal division, have proved their mettle and earned everyone’s respect by not only becoming the sole bread-earners of their families during the economic crisis engendered by coronavirus pandemic but also helped 100 other women earn their livelihoods. It’s their journey from debt-ridden women to becoming owners of a café and stitching centre, which is inspiring all. The ten women of Dhurkuda village of Morena district, where the female sex ratio is 871 for 1,000 men-- which is 60 points lower than the state’s average sex ratio of 931-- and child sex ratio is just 794 girls for 1,000 boys i.e., 124 points lower than the state average of 918, according to census 2011, dreamt in January of becoming entrepreneurs for financially supporting their families. According to the women, they took a loan of Rs 1 lakh and started a dry mushroom business. However, they were left in debt of Rs 50,000 due to the Covid-19 lockdown. They faced criticism and embarrassment as their business failed. The women started making masks in April. They invited at least 100 other women from different villages to become a part of their mask-making business.“They changed their destiny with their hard work and made 83,000 masks from May to November. They earned Rs 8.3 lakh and made Rs 4.3 lakh of profit. Now, these women have started a Didi café and stitching centre at tehsil office in Pahargarh block and some of them emerged as sole bread-earners of their families,” said Dinesh Singh, district project manager of National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) of Morena. A member of the group Aradhna Dhakad, 40, said, “In our area, women are still treated as second-class citizens who have no voice and say in anything.” “I am a post graduate and I wanted to do something to improve the condition of women in my village. In January, I came in contact with these nine women and we decided to do some work to set an example that women can also earn money,” said Aradhna. She says forming a self-help group to sell dry mushrooms was the first step.“We took a loan of Rs 1 lakh under National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) and started the work of drying mushrooms in January. But before we could have started the business, lockdown was imposed in the country. We were in debt of Rs 50,000.” Aradhna says it opened them up to severe criticism. “People started giving suggestions and opinions to us that women should stay at home and women don’t understand the basics of business,” she said.Another member of the group, Ravita Shakya, 28, said, “We failed in our business and my husband, who was a labourer, also came back from Delhi to the village after the lockdown. We were facing a tough time as we didn’t have money to have food properly. I was ready to do any hard work to help my family financially.” Ravita said it was Morena district project manager of NRLM, Dinesh Singh, who told them about the demand for masks in rural areas. “We collected Rs 2,000 to purchase clothes and other items to start stitching masks,” said Ravita. Also Read: Little trade in MP mandis in October after passing of farm laws, traders say“We stitched about 300 masks in a month and earned Rs 3,000. It boosted our confidence and panchayat secretaries and sarpanchs helped us in selling the masks,” said Anita Dhakad, another member of the group. She went on to say that the pioneering group of women then contacted at least 100 more women, mainly migrant labourers from different villages, for stitching masks and gave them Rs 25 per 10 masks. “In the past seven months, we stitched about 83,000 masks,” said Anita. “When we earned Rs 3,000 by selling masks, I can’t explain my happiness as my son was ill and I didn’t have money for his treatment. All the women of the group decided to give money for treatment of my son,” said Renu Jatav, 30.

Now, family members and other relatives have started respecting me,” said Renu. Aradhna Dhakad, said the women have decided to establish a more permanent business. “We started a café and a stitching centre in December first week. We are getting good response as women and men both are coming to us for work and guidance,” said Aradhna. Morena district collector Anurag Verma hopes this group’s story may perhaps help in mindset change. “We will promote the story of these 10 women in the area to change the mindset of people towards women and to empower women.

15-12-2020||Chandigarh||Sukhbir accuses BJP of creating communal divide to torpedo farmers’ protest||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday accused the BJP, its former ally, of creating a communal divide to derail the farmers’ protest on the outskirts of Delhi. “I’ve been told by our senior party leader in Delhi that the BJP has asked its cadre to name the farmers’ stir as Sikh vs Hindu and torpedo the struggle. While doing so, that party wants to create a rift between the communities. But we won’t let it succeed. Hindu-Sikh unity remained intact even during the bad days in Punjab and it will stay intact even now,” Sukhbir said while addressing a protest against the farm laws in Amritsar. Accusing the BJP of pitting people from different faiths against each other to win elections, Sukhbir said: “It is making a similar attempt in Punjab now.” Asserting that the BJP-led government had not only targeted federalism but also the freedom to protest, he said: “These farm bills will damage the farmers’ interest and benefit the corporates.” Sukhbir’s wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who too addressed the protesters, had quit the Narendra Modi government in September, opposing the new farm laws aimed at liberalising the agriculture sector. Harsimrat was the only SAD representative in the Modi government. The SAD, one of the oldest BJP allies, has since backed the farmers’ agitation, demanding the three laws be repealed.SYMBOLIC CEREMONY IN BACKDROP OF FARMERS’ STIRSukhbir addressed the gathering after attending the bhog ceremony of the akhand path at Akal Takht to mark the 100th foundation day of the SAD. Initially, the SAD had planned a three-day programme at Anandpur Sahib to mark its centenary but cancelled the programme, saying the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s farm laws would suffer if the event was held on a large scale. It decided to mark the occasion symbolically at the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs, where the party’s foundation was laid in 1920. Interacting with the media, the SAD chief said, “The party still stands by the Anandpur Sahib resolution that demands more powers for the states. This resolution was once dubbed as a separatist one, but today it’s become a necessity. Because of our stand, other states have started demanding that the federal structure be strengthened.” He said that the party will reach out to families of Akali workers who made sacrifices for the Panth, Punjab and the country in 100 years and honour them. AKAL TAKHT JATHEDAR GIVES EVENT A MISS Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh skipped the event. In his absence, Takht Kesgarh Sahib jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh presented the SAD president with a siropa (robe of honour), while former Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh looked on. Giani Harpreet Singh, who sent his personal assistant Jaspal Singh to represent him, faced criticism from Sikh bodies for favouring the SAD while addressing the function organised by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to mark its 100th foundation day a month ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sukhbir-accuses-bjp-of-creating-communal-divide-to-torpedo-farmers-protest/story-wyJQRoD8qJjXgNsLsYVeKK.html
15-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra becomes first state in India to get dedicated action plan to protect pangolins||The Maharashtra forest department is set to be the first state in India to have a dedicated action plan for conservation of pangolins – the world’s most trafficked animal. Pangolins are listed in Schedule I of India’s Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, implying the highest degree of protection. The principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF-wildlife) recently got nod from the state for its proposal to form a study group to prepare a five-year conservation action plan for pangolins. “We have been informed that the proposal has been accepted,” said Nitin Kakodkar, PCCF-wildlife, adding, “The committee will look into aspects such as population estimation, distribution, habitat protection and most importantly, illicit trafficking hotspots. Unlike tigers and leopards, these are species that have never been in focus despite having a huge ecological role.” M Maranko, regional deputy director (west), Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), said, “Maharashtra will be the first state to have such a plan. People eat pangolin meat, their scales are valuable in the international market, and are kept by some as a sign of good luck or for superstitions allegedly involving witchcraft. This activates the illegal trade. Our mandate is to coordinate with states, collect intelligence and make the public and enforcement agencies aware.” Kakodkar said the proposal was planned based on a detailed proposal by Vishwas Katdare, member of the State Board of Wildlife and IUCN Species Survival Commission Pangolin Specialist group member. “Katdare has been actively working towards pangolin conservation in Ratnagiri for the past four years and will be a leading member of this committee,” he said, adding the panel will be headed by additional principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife-west) Sunil Limaye and also include the WCCB, among other members. “Stray cases of pangolin poaching are regularly being reported from Maharashtra. To address this, we need inputs from local people (primary data) to understand the trade and its channels. We need to understand whether it is happening at the local level or if there is an organised network (secondary data). There will be a special focus on Mumbai to check whether the city as a port is functioning as a hub for this trade,” said Kakodkar. Katdare, the founder of Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra (SNM), a non-profit operating for the past 26 years, has been studying the population using 40 camera traps and spreading awareness about pangolins across Ratnagiri. Over the past two years, 23 pangolins have been rescued by local people with help from SNM and the forest department. From October, SNM extended their research to Sindhudurg district. “Taking this in perspective, I submitted the proposal to the department to have a roadmap for protecting this species across Maharashtra where pangolins are distributed in maximum numbers along Konkan and Vidarbha. These mammals can survive in different types of habitats, and thus monitoring them is key,” said Katdare. Meanwhile, WCCB has seen six major cases of pangolin in Maharashtra in 2020. On June 10, six persons were arrested from Nanded and one from Pune where two live pangolins were rescued and on August 30 six persons were arrested at Satara with a live pangolin and items worth Rs. 1.10 lakh. Maranko explained that based on interrogations with those involved in the trade, they found out that the modus operandi involved local villagers training hunting dogs to catch pangolins. “These dogs are weekly taken to forest areas where they track the scent of pangolins and lead villagers to their burrows. Once pangolins are caught, their scales are removed and sent to the supplier. Their meat is partially processed, consumed by local villagers, and also given to the dogs, which are made dependent on the pangolin meat to easily repeat the process,” he said. Experts welcomed Maharashtra’s decision and said other states needed to follow it. “As long as the pangolin’s habitat is protected along with strict control on illegal trade, we can have some hope for the species,” said Aniruddha Mookerjee, consultant wildlife advisor, WildCRU, University of Oxford. While Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Odisha in central India are the major areas for pangolin trapping, the scales move to the north east for export, he explained. “The consumption of pangolin meat is much higher in the north eastern states. If states like Assam and Meghalaya can join the states in central India in creating a holistic plan for conservation of both the subspecies, it should have a far better chance of survival,” said Mookerjee. In February, a study by the South China Agricultural University identified pangolins as the potential intermediate host of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). The study announced the discovery of a 99% genetic match between the new 2019-nCoV virus and a strain of the virus found in pangolins. “We thought that after Covid-19, the trade would reduce but unfortunately in all probability it appears to be the same,” said Saket Badola, head, TRAFFIC India, a wildlife trade monitoring group, adding, “There have been limited efforts to understand the population distribution and estimation for pangolins. We have been flagging this issue repeatedly. However, with interventions being introduced in Maharashtra, Uttarakhand doing a population estimation exercise with the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, and MP also involved in good work through targeted approaches, awareness among enforcement agencies is much more, and it is clear they are prepared.” PANGOLIN TRADE ENTERS GUJARAT FROM MAHA, FOREST DEPARTMENT FLAGS ISSUE The PCCF of the Gujarat forest department wrote to Kakodkar recently about a latest case busted at a farmhouse in Navsari district during the last week of November wherein a live pangolin was seized, which was brought by one of the accused from Katkol village in Nagpur. In all 13 people were arrested in a joint operation by the WCCB and forest department. However, since the live animal was transported from Maharashtra, the PCCF from Gujarat requested the state to address such wildlife crimes. PANGOLINS: WHY SHOULD YOU CARE? - Pangolins or scaly ant-eaters that are nocturnal creatures spend most of their life as solitary animals (except during mating). - Being insectivorous mammals, they feed on eggs, larvae and adults of ants and termites acting as biological pest controlling agents. Their long sticky tongue is used for feeding on insects and are devoid of any teeth. Remain inactive and hide in their burrows during day-time. They roll their body to form a ball like structure in-case they sense the presence of predators in their vicinity. They secrete strong odour through their anal glands that is used in defense. - The keratin scales are believed to have medicinal properties and are used widely in traditional Chinese. The scales are also used in manufacture of boots, bullet-proof jackets etc. The scales and skin of an adult Pangolin together weighs about 3.5 kg. - Pangolin are listed in Schedule I of India’s Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, implying the highest degree of protection, and grouped as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. - The species is also listed under the Appendix I of the International Convention of Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which prohibits international commercial trade. - Among eight pangolin species globally, four each are found in Asia and Africa. India is home to two species - Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) and the Indian Pangolin (Manis crassicaudata). Chinese pangolin is known to occur in Northern and North-Eastern India. Indian Pangolin is widely distributed throughout the country except the Himalayan region.

The country also decided to ‘ring-fence’ or isolate completely from exposure the elderly from Covid-19, however, the death toll increased amidst the elderly, especially in the nursing homes. While it did find some initial success in controlling the virus, mounting deaths prompted an investigation into the situation.The commission called out the previous and current governments for inaction over already known structural problems in the care system for the elderly and blamed them for being ultimately responsible. It also mentioned that the overall spread of the disease could be another leading cause for the death toll. “These shortcomings meant that elderly care was unprepared and ill-equipped to deal with a pandemic. The employees in elderly care were largely left alone to handle the crisis situation,” the commission said in a statement.Nursing home residents account for a little less than half of the almost 7,700 Covid-19 related deaths in Sweden. “We also assess that the measures were insufficient in several respects,” the commission noted when referring to the intervention by government and agencies in protecting the elderly and said that the measures had arrived too late.Prime Minister Stefan Lofven admitted the failure in protecting the older people but said that the regional authorities, and not the central government, are responsible for health and elderly care.The commission’s findings come after the Health and Social Care Inspectorate had warned of serious shortcomings in Sweden’s elderly care, noting that only six per cent of nursing home patients were examined by a doctor.Deaths per capita in Sweden is found to be more than its Nordic neighbours despite remaining lesser than some European countries that imposed lockdowns. Sweden has reported 320,098 overall Covid-19 cases and 7,667 total fatalities so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unprepared-ill-equipped-to-deal-with-pandemic-panel-finds-sweden-s-failure-to-protect-elderly-during-covid-19/story-StaqTcwaBBdifzY3XhQ6PJ.html

So today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden,” McConnell said on the floor of the Senate, and went on to congratulate Harris, adding, “Beyond our differences, all Americans can take pride that our nation has a female vice-president-elect for the very first time.”Only a handful of Republicans have acknowledged Biden’s victory, so as to not upset the president, including Senator Mitt Romney. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, has still not congratulated Biden.In a speech after the electoral college victory, Biden had for the first time shown impatience with Trump and his Republican allies’ refusal to accept the election’s outcome, and slammed them for launching an “assault on democracy” over their efforts to overturn the election result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-republican-breaks-with-donald-trump-congratulates-joe-biden/story-I6xz0WMYLJor0WNtiRKYQL.html

It also prohibits the disclosure of the identity of rape victims, according to a statement released by President Arif Alvi’s office on Twitter.The statement provided few additional details. Leading Pakistani English-language newspaper The Dawn reported that under the new law any official who shows negligence in investigating rape cases could face a three-year prison sentence. The paper also reported that repeat offenders could be chemically castrated.Suspects found guilty of raping women and children potentially face a death sentence in Pakistan.The new law comes months after Prime Minister Imran Khan promised to remove deficiencies in existing laws to ensure speedy justice for rape victims.Khan recently also hinted at public executions or surgical castration of convicted rapists after two assailants gang raped a woman on a deserted highway near the eastern city of Lahore in September. The attack shocked Pakistan, even though attacks violence women is common in the deeply conservative Muslim country.Before the new law, rape cases could drag on for years, mainly because of faulty investigations and flawed laws, making it difficult for victims to come forward to share their ordeal.The new law will lapse if Parliament does not approve it within 120 days.Nearly 1,000 women are killed in Pakistan each year in so-called “honor killings” for allegedly violating conservative norms on love and marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-issues-new-law-for-speedy-trials-of-alleged-rapists/story-SqO3sjhmghEI9ueGAeLhaO.html
15-12-2020||World||Biden plans Cuba reset in rebuke of Trump’s sanctions strategy||President-elect Joe Biden’s team plans to bring the US closer to normalized relations with Cuba, reversing many of the sanctions and regulations imposed during the Trump administration, according to people familiar with the matter.That strategy includes reducing restrictions on travel, investment and remittances for the island nation that are perceived to disproportionately hurt Americans and ordinary Cubans, said the people, who requested anonymity because the new administration is still coming together. Other measures that target Cuba for human rights abuses would remain in place, the people said.The prospect of a détente between Washington and Havana rekindles memories of the thaw that Biden helped champion during the Obama administration, when the two nations restored diplomatic ties that had been broken for decades following Fidel Castro’s rise to power.But the president-elect is returning to an even messier scene: the Cuban economy is suffering its worst crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union amid fallout from Covid-19 and US sanctions. At the same time, Cuban intelligence officers have helped prop up Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, allowing his regime to consolidate its grip on power in defiance of demands for free and fair elections.With a packed domestic agenda, it’s unclear how quickly Biden will move on implementing his Cuba policy. Even if some changes happen early, the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown could delay the benefits of any measures that allow for greater travel to the island. It’s also unclear whether Biden will increase staffing at the US embassy in Havana. The Trump administration pared back diplomatic operations after strange illnesses, including brain trauma, afflicted some US diplomats and their families.Biden said in October that the US needed a new Cuba policy, though his team has been firm in condemning efforts by Havana to silence dissidents, including a recent raid on a house full of activists and artists.The president-elect has also denounced Venezuela’s Maduro as a dictator. Just as the Trump administration connected Cuba and Venezuela policy, using sanctions as a tool intended to spur political change, Biden’s team may try to leverage a rapprochement in exchange for the Cubans reducing their presence in Venezuela and supporting a diplomatic resolution to the crisis there, according to the people.Another complicating factor is Florida. While Biden’s advisers have criticized Trump’s Latin American policies for being heavily influenced by electoral politics, particularly the goal of winning the Sunshine State, they still face a sobering reality: The Democratic Party must defend a narrow House majority in 2022. Any policies that are perceived as easing pressure on Cuba and Venezuela without getting significant concessions from their left-wing governments could risk backlash at the polls.For their part, investors are showing an early vote of confidence in Biden’s potential Cuba policy. The $43 million Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, which is geared toward Cuba and the Caribbean, has surged 40% since the US election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-plans-cuba-reset-in-rebuke-of-trump-s-sanctions-strategy/story-WulMH84e5niiJapCdZui3N.html

Biden is the second Democratic candidate to win the Peach State since Bill Clinton in 1992.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump attacked Georgia’s Republican leaders for not overturning Biden’s win, and on Sunday sought to preemptively blame Governor Brian Kemp for a loss in the Senate races while demanding he call a special legislative session“What a fool Governor @BrianKempGA of Georgia is. Could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way. Demand this clown call a Special Session and open up signature verification, NOW. Otherwise, could be a bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th,” Trump tweeted.The Senate runoff elections will take place on January 5, which will decide the control of the Senate majority for the next two years. Warnock will be facing off against Senator Kelly Loeffler, while Ossoff will be challenging Senator David Perdue.Democrats need to win both seats in order to deadlock the Senate, in which case Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast the tie-breaking vote.Meanwhile, the final Electoral College results are 306 for Biden and 232 for Trump. The electoral votes will be sent to the US Congress for verification at a joint session, the final stage of the election, which is scheduled for January 6.Biden will be sworn in as the 46th US president on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-elect-biden-heads-to-georgia-to-campaign-for-democrats-in-upcoming-senate-runoffs/story-ykpMrKnwG65UiCJo3dOpNK.html

The deputy speaker’s post is vacant.“Today’s meeting of the Constitutional Council has discussed the appointments to various vacant constitutional commissions,” National Assembly chairperson Ganesh Prasad Timilsina said after the meeting, according to Nepali website Kantipur. He did not elaborate.Nepal watchers said PM Oli is keen to get the council to appoint former home secretary Prem Kumar Rai to head the powerful Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority as its chief commissioner. The commission is mandated by the Constitution to investigate persons holding public office and their associates for corruption.Leaders of Prachanda’s faction within the ruling party underline that any appointment by the Oli-led government before holding consultations with the Prachanda faction would be a violation of the peace pact between PM Oli and Prachanda.One of the conditions to let PM Oli continue as the NCP chairperson and the prime minister was that he would consult the party leadership before a policy decision or a key appointment.PM Oli’s rivals suspect that the prime minister would like the anti-graft commission to probe Prachanda and his associates who have been piling pressure on him to step down.The NCP was formed in 2018 with the merger of the PM Oli -fronted Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and the Prachanda-led Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre). The honeymoon, however, did not last long and the merged entity which came to power, the NCP, has been staring at a split for months.PM Oli’s rushed effort to get the anti-graft watchdog chief’s appointment through comes right ahead of the meeting of the communist party’s standing committee where Prachanda and his associates including former prime minister Madhav Nepal are expected to ramp up pressure on PM Oli to quit and go ahead with key appointments only after consulting them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-oli-races-to-get-new-anti-graft-watchdog-heads-for-a-showdown-with-prachanda/story-0nqEfgJMplKliYzlM0lunO.html
15-12-2020||World||Moderna Covid-19 vaccine boards safety wagon; roll out by next week likely||The US regulator on Tuesday released new data confirming Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine was safe and effective, a strong sign that it could receive emergency approval in days and be ready to roll out by next week.The Food and Drug Administration said there were “no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA (emergency use authorization)” and confirmed an overall efficacy of 94.1 percent.Distribution of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine began on Monday and if the FDA green lights Moderna’s, rollout of some six million doses could start next Monday.That would represent a powerful second weapon against the virus in the worst-hit country in the world, where more than 300,000 people have died from Covid-19 and a winter surge continues across much of the country.- Stops severe cases -The FDA document offered the clearest look yet into the Moderna vaccine, which was co-developed with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).On Thursday, an independent group of scientists will convene to debate everything known so far about the product, which Moderna and the NIH began developing in January using cutting-edge mRNA technology.The panel is expected to vote in favor of an EUA, and the FDA normally acts upon its recommendations.According to the new data release, the two-dose regimen protected younger people slightly better than it did older people.In a clinical trial of 30,400 people, 196 fell ill with Covid-19 by November 21 -- 11 in the vaccine group and 185 in the placebo group.Efficacy was 95.6 percent for people aged 18-65; 86.4 percent among those aged 65 and older; and 94.1 percent overall.Importantly, of 30 cases of severe Covid-19, all occurred in the placebo group.The FDA also looked at detailed safety data, at a median of nine weeks after participants had received the second shot, which is taken 28 days after the first.- Cutting-edge technology -The most common side effects associated with the drug, called mRNA-1273, were injection site pain in roughly 90 percent of cases; fatigue in 70 percent, headache in 60 percent, muscle pain in 60 percent, joint pain in 45 percent and chills in 45 percent.Few of these effects were classed as “severe” and when they were that tended to occur more in the young than in the old. Lymphadenopathy, or swollen lymph nodes occurred in 1.1 percent of the vaccine group compared to 0.6 percent of the placebo group.There was an imbalance in allergic or inflammatory reactions by the immune system -- which occurred in 1.5 percent of the vaccinated population compared to 1.1 percent of the non-vaccinated.But there were none that were classed as severe or anaphylactic.Throughout the follow-up period to date, there have been three reports of Bell’s palsy -- a facial paralysis condition -- in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group.The Pfizer trial saw four people get Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group, and none in the placebo group.In both cases, the FDA said there was insufficient information to determine that the vaccine was the cause of this paralysis, which normally resolves within three months.Andrew Morris, a University of Toronto professor of medicine who has studied the condition, told AFP however “it is becoming increasingly likely that there is an important relationship with Bell’s (facial) palsy.” “The absolute risk -- in light of the risks associated with Covid-19 -- is small,” he stressed.The frequency of life-threatening events was low, around one percent in each group, and there was no suggestion that the vaccine was the cause.Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) which makes human cells express a surface protein of the new coronavirus.This simulates an infection and trains the immune system to be ready in case it encounters the real virus. The mRNA is encased inside fatty particles. Both companies used a slightly different formulation resulting in different cold-storage requirements: -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) for Pfizer; -20 degrees Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) for Moderna.The US hopes to immunize 20 million people this month, with health care workers and long-term care residents at the front of the line. Authorities want to reach the rest of the population by summer, but much will depend on vaccine confidence. Experts estimate more than 70 percent of people will need to be vaccinated to bring the outbreak to a close.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-boards-safety-wagon-roll-out-by-next-week-likely/story-GA47rJ1rOJbnU3no1KMtwJ.html
15-12-2020||World||UK plans big fines for online companies over harmful content||Social media and other internet companies face big fines in Britain if they don’t remove and limit the spread of harmful material such as child sexual abuse or terrorist content and protect users on their platforms, officials said Tuesday.Separately, Irish regulators fined Twitter for a data breach, in the first penalty for a US tech company since Europe introduced strict privacy rules.Under legislative proposals that the UK government plans to launch next year, tech companies that let people post their own material or talk to others online could be fined up to 18 million pounds ($24 million) or 10% of their annual global revenue, whichever is higher, for not complying with the rules.The proposals, contained in the UK government’s Online Safety Bill, will have extra provisions for the biggest social media companies with “high-risk features,” expected to include Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.These companies will face special requirements to assess whether there’s a “reasonably foreseeable risk” that content or activity that they host will cause “significant physical or psychological harm to adults,” such as false information about coronavirus vaccines. They’ll have to clarify what is allowed and how they will handle it.All companies will have to take extra measures to protect children using their platforms. The new regulations will apply to any company whose online services are accessible in the UK and those that don’t comply could be blocked.The UK government is also reserving the right to impose criminal sanctions on senior executives, with powers it could bring into force through additional legislation if companies don’t take the new rules seriously - for example by not responding swiftly to information requests from regulators.The European Union is also expected later Tuesday to unveil its own long-awaited sweeping overhaul of digital regulations. The EU proposals will include measures aimed at reining in the tech giants. They will also update the bloc’s 20-year-old rules on e-commerce by making online platforms take more responsibility for their goods and services, such as weeding out shady traders and taking down illegal content such as hate speech.Meanwhile, the Irish Data Privacy Commission issued Twitter with a 450,000-euro ($540,000) fine for a security breach. The company triggered an investigation after reporting the breach in January 2019, which affected users of the social media company’s Android app.But it didn’t report it quickly enough, because of “an unanticipated consequence of staffing between Christmas Day 2018 and New Years’ Day,” the company said.“We take responsibility for this mistake and remain fully committed to protecting the privacy and data of our customers,” Twitter said.It’s the first punishment for a big U.S. tech company since the EU’s strict privacy rules, known as General Data Protection Regulation, took effect in 2018.Under GDPR, a single regulator takes the lead role in cross-border data privacy cases as part of a “one-stop shop” system. But the system has come under question, with Ireland’s watching facing criticism for taking too long to decide on cases. The Twitter decision was also delayed after regulators in other EU member states objected to Ireland’s draft penalty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-plans-big-fines-for-online-companies-over-harmful-content/story-OSDDogEJ8Q1zweYaKQJrqO.html

The Supreme Court last week turned away an effort backed by Trump to toss out election results in states won by Biden.While Trump’s allies could still mount protests next month after the new Congress is seated but before the Jan. 20 inauguration, there is no chance the Democratic-led House would indulge any further attempts to overturn the election results.Senate Republicans have hesitated to oppose Trump’s false claims about the election results in part because they need his base to show up for Georgia’s two Jan. 5 runoff elections. Those races will determine whether Democrats retake the Senate majority with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes.Trump’s efforts to fight the election results have been backed by both Georgia senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who face challenges from Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.McConnell’s recognition of Biden’s win comes as Congress and Trump have yet to agree on an omnibus spending package to fund the regular operations of government, as well as more than $900 billion in additional relief for the coronavirus-battered economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mitch-mcconnell-recognizes-biden-as-president-elect/story-q83gLBHP1dTjf9jhOtKkmI.html

15-12-2020||World||EU: Thousands of liters of dangerous hand sanitiser seized||The European Union’s anti-fraud body said almost 140,000 liters of dangerous hand sanitiser have been seized across the region since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) said Tuesday the product originated from Turkey and was contaminated with dangerous levels of methanol, a substance likely to create headaches, blurred vision and that can sometimes lead to blindness when used in hand sanitizers.OLAF started the operation in August after Danish authorities passed on information relating to the seizure of 6,000 liters of hand sanitiser from Turkey. The anti-fraud body then relayed the information to all 27 EU member states and OLAF spotted a suspicious shipment to Ireland at the end of September.The cargo was stopped in Dublin and analysis confirmed the presence of “unacceptably high levels of methanol,” said OLAF, adding that further investigation led to the discovery of other stocks of the same sanitiser, while a second shipment was also contaminated.The investigation later established that several companies based in the EU had ordered hand sanitizers from the same Turkish manufacturer operating under various names.“Since the onset of the pandemic, OLAF has been active in fighting illicit material related to COVID-19 such as counterfeit and substandard face masks, rapid tests, hand sanitizers,” said OLAF director-general Ville Itälä. “These products should protect people, not harm them. OLAF investigations have detected over 900 companies involved so far, and the list is growing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-thousands-of-liters-of-dangerous-hand-sanitiser-seized/story-sXqxgCLwp3uzBgdvT3JJ8J.html

Governments at all levels in Xinjiang fully respect ethnic minorities, and provide necessary training for voluntarily registered workers to improve their skills for employment,” Wang said.Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutors have rejected calls by exiled Uighurs to investigate China for alleged crimes against humanity in XUAR.Reports from The Hague said that members from Uighur exiled had handed a dossier of “evidence” to the court in July accusing China of locking more than a million Uighurs in re-education camps and of forcibly sterilising women.But the office of prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said on Monday it was unable to act because the alleged acts happened on the territory of China, which is not a signatory to The Hague-based ICC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/570-000-uighurs-forced-to-work-on-cotton-farms-in-xinjiang-think-tank-report/story-KXf5pVIZ4MjrGHB6ZDXNUO.html
15-12-2020||World||Moderna vaccine found safe, effective ahead of FDA review||Moderna Inc.’s vaccine is safe and effective for preventing Covid-19, US regulators said, clearing the way for a second shot to quickly gain emergency authorization and add to the country’s sprawling immunization effort.The Food and Drug Administration’s staff said in a report on Tuesday that the experimental vaccine is 94.1% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19, confirming earlier results released by the company.The report was posted online ahead of a meeting Thursday of agency advisers who will vote whether to recommend authorization before a final FDA decision. The agency doesn’t have to follow the advice of the independent vaccine experts, though it often agrees with its advisory panels. Last week, the FDA authorized a similar vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE after an advisory panel voted 17-4, with one abstention, to support its authorization.The FDA got a much deeper look at Moderna’s clinical-trial data than the numbers previously released to the public by the company. Notably, the agency was able to review the shot’s effectiveness across a broad range of racial, ethnic and age groups, and look at evidence of how well the shot worked for people with pre-existing medical conditions that make them more vulnerable to severe Covid-19.The agency found the shot was similarly effective across racial and ethnic groups and those with underlying medical conditions. It was 86.4% effective in people age 65 and over, according to the report, and 95.6% effective in those 18 to 65.Both the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine are based on messenger RNA technology that hasn’t been previously used in inoculations. Additionally, both are two-dose vaccines, meaning once people receive an initial shot they will need to return to their care providers weeks later for an additional injection.Between Pfizer and Moderna, Operation Warp Speed officials have said 20 million people in the US are expected to get their first shots by year-end.Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations are rising across the country, increasing pressure to get the pathogen under control. While health officials are hopeful that the immunization push will begin to slow a pandemic that has killed more than 300,000 Americans, it’s not yet known what effect the vaccines have on transmission of the disease.Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine was cleared first in the UK where there were a few reports of serious reactions that led regulators there to advise against anyone with a history of significant allergies getting the shot. The FDA did not take such a step, but told facilities where the vaccine would be administered to have medication on hand to treat possible allergic reactions, including a severe form called anaphylaxis.Moderna’s vaccine isn’t yet approved in any other countries and hasn’t yet been used on anyone outside of a clinical trial.Once the US grants authorization, advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must meet, as they did last week on Pfizer’s vaccine, to give Moderna’s shot the green light and provide offer specific recommendations for use and monitoring. Moderna’s vaccine will be distributed to sites around the country where health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, are expected to get the earliest doses.Pfizer and BioNTech’s first vaccines were sent to more than 600 sites around the country. The shot must be kept extremely cold and requires special freezers to transport, while Moderna’s can be kept in more traditional cold storage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-vaccine-found-safe-effective-ahead-of-fda-review/story-qjvIys4G5ZDp8InefWQpuL.html
15-12-2020||World||US ramps up vaccinations up as second Covid-19 shot nears||Hundreds more US hospitals are set to begin vaccinating their workers Tuesday as federal regulators issued a positive review of a second Covid-19 vaccine shot needed to boost the nation’s largest vaccination campaign.The Food and Drug Administration said in documents posted online that its initial review confirmed the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, bringing the shot to the cusp of US authorization.A panel of outside experts will offer their recommendation Thursday, with a final FDA decision expected soon thereafter.The positive news comes as hospitals across the US begin ramping up vaccinations with the shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech’s, which the FDA cleared last week.Packed in dry ice to stay at ultra-frozen temperatures, shipments of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine are set to arrive at 400 additional hospitals and other distribution sites, one day after the nation’s death toll surpassed a staggering 300,000. The first 3 million shots are being strictly rationed to front-line health workers and elder-care patients, with hundreds of millions more shots needed over the coming months to protect most Americans.A second vaccine can’t come soon enough as the country’s daily death count continues to top 2,400 amid over 210,000 new daily cases, based on weekly averages of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The devastating toll is only expected to grow in coming weeks, fueled by holiday travel, family gatherings and lax adherence to basic public health measures.The first vaccine deliveries have provided a measure of encouragement to exhausted doctors, nurses and hospital staffers around the country.Johnnie Peoples, a 43-year-old survival flight nurse, was excited and a little nervous Monday afternoon as he unzipped his flight suit and stuck out his left arm to become the first person to receive the vaccine at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor.“Just to be a part of it is a good feeling,’’ he said.Since March, he’s transported critically ill Covid-19 patients by jet from smaller hospitals around the state to the university medical center. It’s up-close-and-personal work that requires him to adjust ventilator settings and administer infusions to keep blood pressure from plummeting.In Florida, government officials expect to have 100,000 doses of the vaccine by Tuesday at five hospitals across the state.“This is 20,000 doses of hope,” said John Couris, president and chief executive officer, Tampa General Hospital, after the delivery of 3,900 vaccine vials on Monday. Each vial has five doses.Because the vaccine requires two rounds, the people getting injections now will need a second shot in about three weeks.Vaccinations were also expected to kick off Tuesday in New Jersey, which is dividing some 76,000 doses among health workers and nursing home residents. The federal government is coordinating the massive delivery operation by private shipping and distribution companies based on locations chosen by state governors.Following another initial set of deliveries Wednesday, officials with the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed in Washington said they will begin moving 580 more shipments through the weekend.“We’re starting our drumbeat of continuous execution of vaccine as it is available,” Army Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer for Warp Speed, told reporters Monday. “We package and we deliver. It is a constant flow of available vaccine.”Shots for nursing home residents won’t begin in most states until next Monday, when some 1,100 facilities are set to begin vaccinations.Perna and other US officials reiterated their projection that 20 million Americans will be able to get their first shots by the end of December, and 30 million more in January.That projection assumes swift authorization of the Moderna vaccine up for review this week. Like the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Moderna’s requires two shots for full protection.Last month, Moderna and NIH reported that their shot appeared to be nearly 95% effective across various ages and racial groups, according to results from an ongoing 30,000-person study. The main side effects were fatigue, muscle aches and injection-site pain after the second dose. Those flu-like reactions are common to many vaccines and are a sign the vaccine is revving up the immune system to help fight off the virus.Moderna reported no major safety problems from its study. But FDA’s panel is certain to scrutinize the data for any indications of possible severe allergic reactions or other rare side effects. Officials in the UK are investigating several adverse reactions there with Pfizer’s vaccine and FDA is closely monitoring the rollout here for similar reports.Both Moderna’s and Pfizer-BioNTech’s shots are so-called mRNA vaccines, a brand-new technology. They aren’t made with the coronavirus itself, meaning there’s no chance anyone could catch it from the shots. Instead, the vaccine contains a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ramps-up-vaccinations-up-as-second-covid-19-shot-nears/story-WZFJPLr3LuADm1tbnVWwQM.html
15-12-2020||World||UK’s Christmas plans will cost many lives, health journals say||Two of Britain’s most influential journals for healthcare and medical professionals jointly called on the government on Tuesday to scrap plans to relax Covid-19 restrictions for five days around Christmas or risk overwhelming the health service.In what was only their second joint editorial in more than 100 years, the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal said the government should be tightening the rules rather than allowing three households to mix over five days.“We believe the government is about to blunder into another major error that will cost many lives,” the editorial said.It argued that, far from giving people an opportunity to let their guard down over Christmas, Britain should be following the more cautious examples of Germany, Italy and the Netherlands which have just announced they were tightening restrictions.Britain has recorded 64,402 deaths from Covid, the second highest number in Europe.The article came a day after the government announced that due to a surge in cases London would be moving up into “Very High Alert” level, the most restrictive of England’s tiered system of rules to try to contain the virus.London mayor’s Sadiq Khan also said the government should look again at its Christmas plans and the call from the respected journals will add to mounting pressure on the government to change course. So far, ministers have deflected such calls by stressing the need for citizens to act responsibly.The two journals said that unless there was a change of policy the state-run National Health Service (NHS) would face a stark choice after Christmas: stop most elective and non-urgent work or become overwhelmed by Covid patients.“The main impact of a further surge in Covid-19 inpatients is likely to be felt most by those with other conditions,” the editorial said.It said the government had been too slow to introduce restrictions in the spring and again in the autumn, and accused it of “squandering money on failure” by lavishing funding on a national Track and Trace system that was ineffective.“It should now reverse its rash decision to allow household mixing and instead extend the tiers over the five-day Christmas period in order to bring numbers down in the advance of a likely third wave,” the editorial said.The government has said its plans are kept under review but has not indicated it would reverse its decision.“What we’re asking people to do is the minimum possible, there is scope for three households to come together during that period,” Steve Barclay, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, told LBC radio. “It is a difficult time so we don’t want to criminalise families for coming together at Christmas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-christmas-plans-will-cost-many-lives-health-journals-say/story-yBUsATlzbjMJ2PMNZDKojN.html
15-12-2020||World||UK’s Boris Johnson to visit India in January ahead of trade talks||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will visit India in January to try to boost ties, with talks on a free-trade agreement due to start next year.The British government has made the expansion of global trading opportunities a priority after Brexit, and is pursuing trade deals with countries including the US, New Zealand and Australia. The Indo-Pacific region is also high on the UK’s agenda, and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab held talks with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in New Delhi on Tuesday.“We want to deepen our economic partnership,” Raab told reporters. “Working toward an enhanced trade partnership next year, which itself will be, we hope, a stepping stone toward a future free-trade agreement.”India is the UK’s 17th-largest trading partner and total trade between the two countries was worth $16.5 billion in 2019, according to Bloomberg data.It will be Johnson’s first major bilateral trip since becoming leader, his office said in an emailed statement. The UK has also invited India, alongside South Korea and Australia, to join next year’s G-7 summit as a guest country.‘Indispensable Partner’“India is an increasingly indispensable partner for the UK as we work to boost jobs and growth, confront shared threats to our security and protect our planet,” Johnson said in the statement.India has sought to forge strong ties with the UK, as well as France, as it seeks a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council amid months-long border tensions with China. New Delhi is also seeking more investment to shore up its Covid-hit economy.Jaishankar said both sides’ trade ministers are in talks and that India would work with the UK on a range of issues, including the United Nations.“The problem we have today about narrow representation at the leadership levels of the UN is in many ways a challenge to its credibility and its effectiveness,” Jaishankar said at Carnegie India’s technology summit on Monday, referring to the UN Security Council, whose five permanent members -- Britain, France, China, Russia and the US -- have veto powers. India has joined nations including Japan and Germany in calling for UNSC reforms.Johnson’s office said tackling climate change will be one of the focuses of his India visit, ahead of Britain hosting the UN COP26 climate summit in Glasgow next year. Johnson will also be the guest of honor at the annual parade in New Delhi to celebrate India’s Republic Day on Jan. 26.In preparation for the end of the Brexit transition period on Dec. 31, the UK has also signed deals with the likes of Canada and Japan, preserving the benefits of trade agreements it had as a member of the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-boris-johnson-to-visit-india-in-january-ahead-of-trade-talks/story-8hnLuepvNATDzFpWSVco2O.html
15-12-2020||World||Micromanaging every content online not effective approach of regulation: Facebook’s Nick Clegg||The most effective approach of regulation is not the one that seeks to “micro manage” every content online but rather the one that holds companies accountable and insists on a high level of transparency of systems and policies, Facebook Vice-President for Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg said on Tuesday. Speaking at the Facebook Fuel for India 2020 event, Clegg said the digital industry is still young and has had a profound impact on the way in which one works and interacts. He said it is right that rule makers and democratically elected rule makers should seek to introduce new guidelines and guardrails in the way in which the internet operates. “What I observe is that the most effective and intelligent approach to regulation is one that doesn’t seek to try and micromanage every post and every line of content online... but instead to hold companies like Facebook accountable, and insist on a high level of transparency for the systems and the policies that they have in place,” he added. Further, he said regulations that do not “hinder the way in which the international economy now relies on international data flows” would be a “sensible overall approach”. Currently, digital platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google are categorised as intermediaries and regulated by the IT Act, 2000 that defines their role to be limited to processing, storing and transmitting data of third party users.The Indian government is working on amending the IT rules for intermediaries to make them more responsive and accountable. The government is also crafting data protection law to ensure privacy, safety and security of user data. These include provisions around the handling of data of adults and minors, storage within the Indian borders and penalties for non-compliance. Facebook and WhatsApp have drawn flak in India over issues like handling of hate speech and misinformation on these platforms. Clegg noted that the company is “very responsive” to law enforcement requests in India or elsewhere for cooperation and that it disables a huge number of accounts and groups on Facebook and Instagram for nefarious behaviour. However, WhatsApp is a private, intimate messaging system that is quite different from the public or semi-public experience of Instagram and Facebook as it is end-to-end encrypted, he said. “What we say to policy makers in India and elsewhere is because we can’t see the content that doesn’t mean that we cannot use signals that we do pick up, what is called metadata. We can use metadata to pick up signals so that we can go after people on an encrypted messaging system,” Clegg said. He added that about two million WhatsApp accounts are removed every month, especially when they are used for bulk broadcast of messages, which is not the purpose of the app. “We will continue to explain to policy makers as best as we can, that we think that millions and billions of people around the world, expect the privacy of an intimate end-to-end encrypted messaging service, even as we continue to cooperate with them in other ways,” he emphasised. Asked if it would make sense to have India-specific community guidelines, Clegg said it is a complex issue. “The complex thing about all this is that Facebook as a company has been put under tremendous political pressure, whether its in India or elsewhere, by people who have different views and often conflicting views about what shouldn’t and shouldn’t be circulating freely on the internet, even though it is legal,” he said. Clegg said given that Facebook is a global company, it has community standards that it applies evenly and consistently. “It doesn’t mean that there aren’t national legislative requirements and other exceptional requirements that we don’t respond to,” he said. He cited the example of Germany where it is illegal to say certain things about the Holocaust, which was not the case in other countries, and so Facebook geo-blocked that content in Germany. “There is adaptability... they must be for specific circumstances,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/micromanaging-every-content-online-not-effective-approach-of-regulation-facebook-s-nick-clegg/story-ISANBijW9s8aQaejEFFCUP.html

15-12-2020||World||Bombs, shooting attack in Kabul kill 4: Officials||A bombing and a shooting attack in Kabul killed at least three people, including a deputy provincial governor, while a deputy provincial council chief was killed in western Afghanistan on Tuesday, officials said.The attacks are the latest in relentless violence in Afghanistan even as the Taliban and Afghan government negotiators hold talks in Qatar, trying to hammer out a peace deal that could put an end to decades of war.According to Tariq Arian, an Afghan interior ministry spokesman, a sticky bomb attached to the armored vehicle belonging to Kabul’s deputy provincial governor killed two people, and wounded two others.The deputy provincial governor and the apparent target of the attack, Mahbobullah Mohibi, was killed alongside his secretary while two of his bodyguards were wounded, Arian said. The bombing took place in the Macrorayan neighborhood of Kabul.Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, condemned the attack and said the recent increase in attacks across the war-torn country is a clear enemy of the Afghan peace process.Sima Samar, special presidential envoy and state minister for human rights, tweeted that the “people are tired of terrorist attacks every day.” Samar also urged the Taliban to agree to a ”cease-fire to stop the killing and more bloodshed.”Also in Kabul, gunmen shot and killed a police officer and wounded another policeman, said Ferdaws Faramarz, spokesman for Kabul’s police chief. An investigation was ongoing, he added.In violence elsewhere, a deputy provincial council head in western Ghor province was killed while another council member and their driver were wounded when a sticky bomb attached to their vehicle detonated on Tuesday, said Arif Aber, spokesman for the provincial governor.The slain council chief, Abdul Rahman Atshan, was the apparent target of the attack, which took place around noon in the provincial capital of Faroz Koh.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the Kabul or Ghor attacks. The Islamic Sate group has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in the capital in recent months, including horrific attacks on educational institutions that killed as many as 50 people, most of them students.The Taliban have waged bitter battles against IS fighters, particularly in IS strongholds in eastern Afghanistan, while continuing their insurgency against Afghan government forces.Separately, the Afghan defense ministry said Tuesday the army repelled a Taliban attack in the district of Arghandab, in southern Kandahar province. At least seven Taliban fighters were killed, it claimed.On Monday, the ministry announced authorities were investigating reports that an alleged airstrike over the weekend killed around a dozen civilians, including children, in Arghandab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bombs-shooting-attack-in-kabul-kill-4-officials/story-efTgEn1A7ZEfr171L5i59K.html
15-12-2020||World||China central bank urges wider acceptance of cash as payments go digital||China’s central bank has called for wider acceptance of cash in economic activities and vowed to punish those who refuse to accept cash payments in the wake of a widening gap in access to digital services.China’s online payments via barcodes and third-party payment apps such as Ant Group’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings’ Tenpay have gained in popularity over the years on government policies to promote innovation.Some merchants and institutions have become reluctant to accept cash due to reasons such as cost control or user experience, with the trend accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a notice on Tuesday.“Renminbi (yuan) cash is the most basic means of payment. Entities or individuals cannot refuse to accept it,” the PBOC said, adding that the central bank will investigate and punish firms or individuals that refuse to accept cash or adopt discriminatory measures against cash payments.In a separate statement, the central bank said payments of some basic public services such as medical treatment, water, electricity and gas fees have gradually migrated online.The transition has left the elderly behind, as it is more difficult for some of them to adapt to the new digital technologies compared with younger people, it said. “The innovation of consumption and payment methods should be conducive to...protect people’s livelihood and enhance the public’s sense of happiness,” the PBOC said in the notice.The PBOC urged that all entities and individuals should not discriminate or carry out any inconvenient measures to exclude cash payment and create “gaps of digitalisation”.“Non-bank payment institutions must not promote the concept of cashless or discriminatory means of cash payment in any forms,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-central-bank-urges-wider-acceptance-of-cash-as-payments-go-digital/story-I9sQIHPonUk2STfQwcG4hN.html
15-12-2020||World||Democrats squeezed as Covid-19 relief bill talks continue||Top Washington negotiators continued to reach for a long-delayed agreement on Covid-19 relief, but rank-and-file Democrats appeared increasingly resigned to having to drop, for now, a scaled-back demand for fiscal relief for states and local governments whose budgets have been thrown out of balance by the pandemic.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin by phone Monday evening and continues to press for help for struggling states and localities. But top Democratic allies of President-elect Joe Biden came out in support of a $748 billion plan offered by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and hinted they won’t insist on a pitched battle for state and local aid now.“We cannot afford to wait any longer to act. This should not be Congress’ last Covid relief bill, but it is a strong compromise that deserves support from both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. “We cannot leave for the holidays without getting relief to those Americans who need it.”The message from Coons, a confidant of Biden, and a similar message from Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., came as a bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a detailed Covid-19 aid proposal on Monday in hopes it would serve as a model for their battling leaders to follow as they try to negotiate a final agreement.But the group was unable to forge a compromise on GOP-sought provisions shielding businesses from Covid-19-related lawsuits, a key priority of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Kentucky Republican is pressing a lowest-common-denominator approach that would drop the lawsuit shield idea for now if Democrats agree to drop a $160 billion state and local aid package.Pelosi has insisted for months that state and local aid would be in any final bill, but as time is running out, Democrats appear unwilling to hold the rest of the package hostage over the demand. Several Democrats appeared at the bipartisan news conference endorsing the $748 billion package.“I found it interesting that they separated out the state and local and liability provisions. Senator McConnell had suggested that earlier,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “Seems to me that we’re making some progress on it.”Cornyn, a McConnell lieutenant, spoke after a dozen or so lawmakers unveiled two bills. One is a $748 billion aid package containing money for struggling businesses, the unemployed, schools and vaccine distribution. There is also $45 billion for transportation and transit assistance, funding for rural internet service and help for the Postal Service, among other provisions. The other bill proposes a $160 billion aid package for state and local governments and a modified liability shield that is backed by Republicans and Democratic moderate Joe Manchin of West Virginia, but it is probably too politically freighted to advance.The path forward for their proposals — and for Covid-19 aid more generally — remains unclear, though Cornyn said the bipartisan plan has lots of “good stuff” for any year end agreement.Any agreement is likely to be forged in parallel negotiations between Pelosi and Mnuchin — closely watched by McConnell.Outstanding issues in the leadership talks include a potential second round of direct payments to individuals, a plan for $300-per-week bonus unemployment benefits, state and local aid, and the GOP-sought liability shield against Covid-19-related lawsuits.Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she hoped that top Capitol Hill leaders and the administration will use the proposals as the basis for a Covid-19 relief package “that is urgently needed by our struggling families, our hard-hit small businesses, our stressed-out health care providers, our overwhelmed Postal Service, our challenged schools, and so many others.”Lawmakers also worked to finalize a yearend catchall funding package that will be the basis for the last significant legislation of the Trump presidency.There’s a hoped-for deadline of midnight Friday to deliver the completed package to President Donald Trump, which is when a partial government shutdown would arrive with the expiration of last week’s temporary funding bill. But there’s no guarantee that the massive year end measure will be completed in time. If the talks drag, further temporary bills could be needed.Negotiations on the $1.4 trillion catch all spending bill are “essentially finished,” said a congressional aide participating in the talks. While details are closely held, “the status quo is prevailing.” That means Trump would get another $1.4 billion or so for a final instalment to continue construction of his long-sought US-Mexico border wall.Republicans have succeeded in killing a $12 billion plan to break last year’s budget mini-agreement by using accounting maneuvers to pad veterans health care funding to accommodate big cost increases from expanding access to health care services from private providers. Instead, a different set of moves is being employed to provide for equivalent spending increases for other domestic programs.The post-election lame-duck session is the last chance to wrap up the unfinished work this year, a goal of all involved, though they have been slow until now to forge the often-tricky compromises required to pull the measure together.Pelosi has not thrown in the towel on her drive to obtain state and local aid, which was part of the almost $2 trillion CARES Act that passed the Senate unanimously in March. But many Republicans are adamantly against the idea now.President-elect Joe Biden wants as much Covid-19 relief as possible but has no direct influence on the negotiations. While he’ll empower Democrats after taking office next year, GOP leaders like McConnell are playing hardball and have forced Pelosi to scale back her demands. And while McConnell supported a $300-per-week bonus unemployment benefit this summer, he’s pulled back since the November election.No. 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland displayed flexibility in an appearance on CNN on Sunday that Republicans interpreted as a harbinger of further Democratic retreat.“The legislative process is a give and take and the items that I just mentioned are absolutely critical to get done, and although I think state and local assistance is critically important, the others are critically important too,” Hoyer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-squeezed-as-covid-19-relief-bill-talks-continue/story-aNAoy9p2zLGLnBcmXgNTLM.html
15-12-2020||World||SolarWinds Orion hack: Pentagon, White House and US army impacted||Communications at the US treasury and commerce departments were reportedly compromised by a supply chain attack on SolarWinds, a security vendor that helps the federal government and a range of Fortune 500 companies monitor the health of their IT networks.According to Reuters, which broke the news on Sunday, hackers believed to be working for Russia have been monitoring internal email traffic at the US treasury and commerce departments. Reuters reported that the hackers managed to hide malicious code in a software update for a tool called Orion, which is typically used to make IT simpler with a single panel for administering various parts of a network.Earlier this year, hackers believed to be sponsored by the Russian government managed to inject malware into Orion updates released between March 2020 and June 2020 which provided them with a strong foothold for future hacking.SolarWinds, publicly-listed in Austin, is a Texas-based company with a value of over $6 billion. According to the company, it has over 300,000 customers including more than 425 of the US Fortune 500 all ten of the top 10 US telecommunications companies, all five branches of the US military, all five of the top five US accounting firms, the Pentagon, the State Department, the National Security Agency, the department of justice and the White House.The Pentagon is the biggest customer, with the army and the navy being big users. The department of veterans affairs, which is heavily involved in the US response to Covid-19, is another Orion customer and the biggest spender on the tool in recent years. The National Institutes of Health, DHS and the FBI are also amongst the many branches of the US government that have previously bought the tool.The immediate impact of the revelations is expected to be purely operational as Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) has recommended government civilian agencies to stop using SolarWinds Orion. “The compromise of SolarWinds’ Orion Network Management Products poses unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks. Tonight’s directive is intended to mitigate potential compromises within federal civilian networks, and we urge all our partners—in the public and private sectors—to assess their exposure to this compromise and to secure their networks against any exploitation,” CISA’s acting director Brandon Wales said. This is the fifth emergency directive issued by CISA under the authorities granted by Congress in the cybersecurity act of 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solarwinds-orion-hack-pentagon-white-house-and-us-army-impacted/story-Ckx6ToAZfPwuNG5oRJW7ZL.html
15-12-2020||World||Vladimir Putin finally congratulates Joe Biden on winning US presidency||Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Joe Biden a congratulatory telegram after the Electoral College formalized his victory in the November 3 election, making him among the last world leaders to recognize the US president-elect.Putin wished Biden luck and said Russia and the US can contribute to solving global problems, according to a Kremlin statement Tuesday. “For my part, I am ready for cooperation and contacts with you,” Putin said in the statement.The Russian president had previously said he wouldn’t recognize the election results until they were accepted by Biden’s opponent or confirmed in a “legitimate” way.The Democratic candidate’s Electoral College win over President Donald Trump, who’s refused to concede defeat, was finalized after electors in each state voted Monday. Trump and his allies are still protesting the result, but with more than 50 post-election lawsuits rejected, including by the US Supreme Court, they have no viable path to overturn it.Polish President Andrzej Duda, who considers himself a political ally of Trump, also congratulated Biden after the Electoral College vote. In a letter, he said Poland and the US were “strategic partners” joined by the values of “freedom, justice, democracy and the primacy of international law.”Russia, which was accused by US intelligence agencies of intervening in 2016 to help get Trump elected, has been wary of Biden, who is likely to seek to emphasize his support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and traditional US allies. Russia is also concerned about the risk of new sanctions by the incoming administration.Putin’s telegram came a day after hackers tied to the Russian authorities were suspected of involvement in one of the most audacious attacks on US government agencies in recent memory, as part of a global campaign involving malware inserted into updates by a software maker. Russia has denied involvement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-finally-congratulates-joe-biden-on-winning-us-presidency/story-Ud5kgKxLeJoBeJDeWyYeiI.html
15-12-2020||World||Brazil says China ‘not transparent’ on Covid-19 vaccine emergency use||Brazil’s health regulator Anvisa said on Monday China’s health authorities are not transparent in their authorization of Covid-19 vaccines for emergency use, a statement that may further inflame political tension in the South American country.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a consistent critic of China, has repeatedly cast doubt on the CoronaVac vaccine being developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd.Meanwhile, Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, a Bolsonaro enemy, said the state expected to start vaccinating its residents in January, though Brazil’s most populous state will not be able to use CoronaVac until it is approved by Anvisa.“Brazil is the international leader in the evaluation process for CoronaVac,” Anvisa said in a statement on its website on Monday.“The vaccine has had an emergency use authorization in China since June of this year. The Chinese criteria for granting emergency use authorization are not transparent, and there is no available information about the criteria currently in use by Chinese authorities to make these decisions.”China’s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbing said on Tuesday China had been attaching “great importance” to the safety and efficacy of its vaccines.While Brazil’s health regulator has long been largely apolitical, Bolsonaro has been appointing allies to it in recent months, stoking fears among health professionals that its decisions may be affected by political considerations.At least tens of thousands of people have taken the Sinovac vaccine in China’s emergency use programme, officially launched in July, that targets limited groups of high-risk people.China has not made public details of how it determines whether a novel coronavirus vaccine is qualified for emergency use. Its National Health Commission did not respond to a request for comment. A Sinovac representative declined to comment but referred to a news conference in October at which a health official said the emergency inoculation was launched after stringent reviews and in accordance with China’s laws and World Health Organization’s rules.These vaccines showed “very good safety and immunogenicity readings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials”, the official said at the time. CoronaVac is undergoing Phase 3 testing in Sao Paulo.Doria said earlier on Monday that efficacy data would be released on December 23, eight days later than initially planned, to allow for a larger sample size and more complete analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-says-china-not-transparent-on-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use/story-c6TftwNSBRNCHTneoSuGZI.html
15-12-2020||World||Poor countries face long wait for vaccines despite promises||With Americans, Britons and Canadians rolling up their sleeves to receive coronavirus vaccines, the route out of the pandemic now seems clear to many in the West, even if the rollout will take many months. But for poorer countries, the road will be far longer and rougher.The ambitious initiative known as COVAX created to ensure the entire world has access to Covid-19 vaccines has secured only a fraction of the 2 billion doses it hopes to buy over the next year, has yet to confirm any actual deals to ship out vaccines and is short on cash.The virus that has killed more than 1.6 million people has exposed vast inequities between countries, as fragile health systems and smaller economies were often hit harder. COVAX was set up by the World Health Organization, vaccines alliance GAVI and CEPI, a global coalition to fight epidemics, to avoid the international stampede for vaccines that has accompanied past outbreaks and would reinforce those imbalances.But now some experts say the chances that coronavirus shots will be shared fairly between rich nations and the rest are fading fast. With vaccine supplies currently limited, developed countries, some of which helped fund the research with taxpayer money, are under tremendous pressure to protect their own populations and are buying up shots. Meanwhile, some poorer countries that signed up to the initiative are looking for alternatives because of fears it won’t deliver.“It’s simple math,” said Arnaud Bernaert, head of global health at the World Economic Forum. Of the approximately 12 billion doses the pharmaceutical industry is expected to produce next year, about 9 billion shots have already been reserved by rich countries. “COVAX has not secured enough doses, and the way the situation may unfold is they will probably only get these doses fairly late.”To date, COVAX’s only confirmed, legally binding agreement is for up to 200 million doses, though that includes an option to order several times that number of additional doses, GAVI spokesman James Fulker said. It has agreements for another 500 million vaccines, but those are not legally binding.The 200 million doses will come from the Serum Institute of India, the company that will likely make a large portion of the coronavirus shots destined for the developing world. CEO Adar Poonawalla says it has a confirmed order for 100 million doses each of a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and one from Novovax.“We don’t have anything beyond that in writing,” he told The Associated Press. “If they want more, they’ll have to place more orders.”He said the lack of commitment from COVAX will mean a much longer wait for people in developing countries. Poonawalla also noted that his company’s first priority would be making shots for India, which has suggested it wants at least 300 million vaccines. It’s likely India would not be able to take all of those at once, but a big order could delay the distribution of vaccines for other parts of the developing world, Poonawalla said.Potentially further slowing down the process is that neither the AstraZeneca vaccine nor the Novovax one has been licensed by any regulatory agency yet — and any injection distributed by COVAX will likely need WHO approval. COVAX does not have any supplies of the two vaccines that appear to be most effective so far — the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and the Moderna one. The United Kingdom has already begun giving the Pfizer vaccine, and the United States and Canada are rolling it out this week. Some Gulf countries have also authorized it.Still, GAVI said they “aim to start rolling out safe and effective vaccines to COVAX (member countries) at scale within the first and second quarters of the New Year.”Even with vaccines in hand, the rollouts will take many months, even in rich countries, and many developing ones are facing serious logistical challenges that will add to delays, noted Dr. Gagandeep Kang, an infectious diseases expert at the Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India.Even senior officials at the WHO have acknowledged privately that attempts to fairly allocate vaccine through the initiative are flawed, despite publicly lauding its success.“The whole call for global solidarity has mostly been lost,” said Dr. Katherine O’Brien, WHO’s vaccines chief, during a recent internal discussion, a recording of which was obtained by the AP.Asked to clarify her remarks, O’Brien said in an email that “every country should have access to Covid-19 vaccines, as early as feasible.”Adding to COVAX’s difficulties, O’Brien noted at a news conference this month that it was still $5 billion short to buy the doses it’s planning to obtain next year.According to a report GAVI issued ahead of a meeting this week, the alliance itself concluded that the risk COVAX will fail is “very high,” saying it was “established in record time and has to navigate unchartered territory.”But John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, criticized Western countries for buying up the global vaccine supply “in excess of their needs while we in Africa are still struggling with the COVAX (effort).”With no certainty about which shots would work, governments scrambled in recent months to sign multiple deals to ensure their citizens would have at least some Covid-19 injections. Canada, for example, bought nearly 200 million vaccines — enough to cover its population of 38 million about five times over.Nkengasong called the idea that people in rich countries would get immunized while Africans go without “a moral issue.”Beyond the ethics, experts note that failing to protect people in the developing world will leave a reservoir of coronavirus that could spark new outbreaks at any time.Amid fears COVAX can’t deliver, some developing countries are pulling out entirely or seeking their own private deals. Earlier this month, the tiny Pacific island nation of Palau announced it was abandoning the initiative and would get donated vaccines from the U.S. instead. Other low and middle-income countries, including Malaysia, Peru, and Bangladesh, have stayed in the initiative but also recently inked their own deals with drugmakers as a Plan B.Anban Pillay of the South African Ministry of Health said that joining COVAX was just a stop-gap measure before signing bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies.Kate Elder, vaccines policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders, said “it’s increasingly looking like the ship has sailed on equitable vaccine distribution” — and GAVI, WHO and others need to discuss how to increase vaccine manufacturing.To that end, South Africa and India have asked the World Trade Organization (WTO) to waive some provisions regulating intellectual property rights to make it easier for manufacturers in poor countries to make Covid-19 drugs and vaccines. But many rich countries are reluctant to do that.As more countries in the West authorize the vaccine, “the difference between people in rich countries getting vaccinated and the lack of any vaccines for the developing world will become quite stark,” said Anna Marriott, health policy manager at Oxfam. “And it will only prolong the pandemic.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poor-countries-face-long-wait-for-vaccines-despite-promises/story-wcJQ5xkFIotslF5v2JIscN.html
15-12-2020||World||Australian PM says China coal ban would breach WTO rules||Australia’s prime minister said Tuesday that China would be violating World Trade Organization rules and a bilateral free trade agreement if it banned Australian coal.Prime Minister Scott Morrison was replying to a report in China’s state-owned Global Times newspaper that said Beijing’s main planning agency had given power plants approval to import coal without restrictions, except for Australian coal.Morrison said he was treating the report as “media speculation” because the Chinese government had yet to clarify its position.“If that were the case, then that would obviously be in breach of WTO rules,” Morrison told reporters. “It would be obviously in breach of our free trade agreement and so we would hope that’s certainly not the case.”China has targeted various Australian exports as relations with the country have deteriorated after Australia called for an independent inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic.Asked about the report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin gave no specifics but said China had “recently taken measures against some imported Australian products in accordance with law and regulations.”China has consistently said Australia is entirely responsible for disruptions in economic and political ties motivated by what it sees as anti-Chinese bias among Australian politicians, civic leaders and media outlets.Wang said China would “never accept” accusations of unfair trade practices, and accused Australia of having politicized bilateral exchanges in trade, investment, science and technology, while targeting Chinese companies with increased security checks on investments.“We hope that the Australian side will reflect on itself, be consistent with its words and actions, and effectively provide good conditions and atmosphere for China-Australia practical cooperation in various fields, rather than the other way around,” Wang told reporters at a daily briefing.China’s pique has pitted Australia’s most important trading relationship against its alliance with the US, which has rolled out increasingly harsh measures against Beijing over trade, technology and human rights.Beijing’s grievances against Australia range from accusations of Chinese meddling in Australian politics to the barring of tech giant Huawei and the government’s push for an independent investigation into the pandemic that is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Coal and iron ore, Australia’s most lucrative exports, appear to have suffered due to Chinese barriers, while wine, lumber and other products have also seen their Chinese markets reduced.Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said Australia was close to finalizing a complaint to the World Trade Organization over Chinese tariffs imposed on barley.“We see these reports and obviously are deeply troubled by them,” Birmingham told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. referring to the reported coal import ban.“They, if true, would indicate discriminatory trade practices being deployed by Chinese authorities and we would urge them to rule that out swiftly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-says-china-coal-ban-would-breach-wto-rules/story-OnMgTD3dfvRcR9g7Zv0MpK.html
15-12-2020||World||Covid-19 update: New variant of virus detected in London, doctors observe deadly fungal infection in patients||With nearly a year into the pandemic, the world is still reeling under the impact of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as it continues to infect thousands across the countries. In the United Kingdom, strictest restrictions were placed on Monday as the cases continue to grow in record numbers. In the United States, meanwhile, Pfizer Inc and partners delivered the first vaccines to 141 of 145 locations targeted by the US government for the first day of a nationwide rollout on Monday. Singapore became the first Asian country to approve the Pfizer vaccine and said it expects to start receiving shots by the end of the year. In India, the number of daily coronavirus cases dropped to lowest since July 6 as it recorded 22,065 fresh cases of the deadly virus. In Italy, the government is considering stringent nationwide restrictions as the Christmas holidays near. Here are the latest update in the Covid-19 pandemic:1) A new variant of coronavirus has been identified in London which is said to be responsible for the spike in cases. It was initially detected in southeast England, where the cases are now rising the fastest. However, there is no scientific evidence that the variant is more dangerous or infectious. “The variant may or may not be contributing to that,” Whitty said at a press conference, adding: “We don’t know what’s cause and effect,” England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on Monday as he cautioned against blaming it for the spike. 2) The World Health Organisation (WHO) also confirmed the new variant of Covid-19; the world health body said that it is aware of a genetic variant of the virus identified in about 1,000 individuals in the UK. During a press conference on Monday, WHO executive director Michael Ryan said, “This virus evolves and changes over time, and we’ve seen different variants emerge.” The WHO is working with an international laboratory network to see if the variant is becoming more prevalent internationally.3) In India, doctors from a Delhi hospital observed an increase in cases of a rare fungal infection in recovering coronavirus patients. As per hospital authorities, the deadly infection which if not detected early, can kill half the patients and lead to loss of vision or jaw in others, was triggered by Covid-19. In the last 15 days, ENT surgeons at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) have seen 13 cases of “Covid-19-triggered mucormycosis (Black fungus)”.4) A group of researchers in France have found that dogs can sniff out Covid-19 and identify patients including the asymptomatic ones. In the preliminary study in PLoS One and conducted in March, dogs who sniffed swab samples of armpit sweat could tell which samples came from Covid-19 patients and which were from people who tested negative for the new coronavirus. Dogs can identify infected individuals with 85% to 100% accuracy and rule out infection with 92% to 99% accuracy, news agency Reuters reported quoting Dominique Grandjean of Alfort Veterinary School in France.5) Singapore became the first Asian country to approve Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine and said it expects to start receiving shots by the end of the year. The government also said that it expects to have secured enough vaccines for everyone by the third quarter of next year.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-new-variant-of-virus-detected-in-london-doctors-observe-deadly-fungal-infection-in-patients/story-qTtzmM4mcVItHZhmDrkEPP.html
15-12-2020||World||A decade later, Arab Spring legacy lost in wars, repression||Was it real?It’s all been erased so completely, so much blood has been shed and destruction wreaked over the past decade. The idea that there was a moment when millions across the Middle East wanted freedom and change so much that they took to the streets seems like romantic nostalgia.“It was very brief, man. It was so brief,” said Badr Elbendary, an Egyptian activist.Elbendary was blinded on the third day of his country’s revolt in 2011, when security forces shot him in the face during clashes with protesters. Today, he’s in the United States. He can’t return home. Many of his comrades from the protests languish in prisons in Egypt.In December 2010, the uprising began in Tunisia and quickly spread from country to country in revolts against longtime authoritarian rulers. It became known as the Arab Spring, but for those who took to the streets, the call was “revolution.”The uprisings were about more than just removing autocrats. At their heart, they were a mass demand by the public for better governance and economies, rule of law, greater rights and, most of all, a voice in how their countries are run.For a time after 2011, the surge toward those dreams seemed irreversible. Now they are further than ever. Those who keep the faith are convinced that yearning was real and remains — or is even growing as people across the Arab world struggle with worsening economies and heavier repression. Eventually, they say, it will emerge again.“We have lowered our dreams,” said Amani Ballour, a Syrian doctor who ran an underground clinic treating casualties in the opposition enclave of Ghouta outside Damascus until it collapsed under a brutal siege by Syrian government forces in 2018. She has since left the country.“The spirit of the demonstrations may be over for now ... But all those who suffered from the war, from the regime’s repression, they won’t put up with it,” she said from Germany. “Even in the areas controlled by the regime, there is great frustration and anger building up among the people.”“Eventually” could be years.The region is traumatized by its most destructive decade of the modern era, perhaps the most destructive in centuries.Across Syria, Yemen, and Iraq, millions have lost their homes in war. Armed factions have proliferated in those countries and Libya. Poverty rates have risen around the region, especially with the coronavirus pandemic.Activists and analysts have had a decade to pore over why it went wrong.Secular liberals failed to present a cohesive front. Islamists like the Muslim Brotherhood overplayed their hand. Labor organizations, neutered by autocratic rule, couldn’t step up as a powerful mobilizer.The United States and Europe were muddled in their responses, torn between their rhetoric about backing democracy and their interest in stability and worries about Islamists. In the end, they largely listened to the latter.Gulf monarchies used oil wealth to smother any revolutionary tide and back reactionary powers. Russia, Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates waded into the region’s wars with military forces and arms for allies.Ultimately, few expected just how wide some leaders were willing to throw open the gates of Hell to keep power.Syria’s Bashar Assad proved the most ruthless. Faced with armed rebellion, he and his Russian and Iranian allies decimated cities, and he used chemical weapons on his own people, clawing back Syria’s heartland.After he was ousted in 2011, Yemen’s strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh tried to regain power by allying with the Iranian-backed Shiite Houthi rebels. Together, they captured the capital and Yemen’s north. The resulting civil war has been catastrophic, killing tens of thousands and pushing the population toward starvation in the world’s worst ongoing humanitarian disaster.In Libya, the US and European countries retreated from involvement after their bombardment helped bring down Moammar Gadhafi. The oil-rich Mediterranean nation promptly collapsed into a constantly shape-shifting civil war. Over the years, it has involved the many local militias, units of the old national army, al-Qaida, the Islamic State group, Russian mercenaries, and Turkish-backed Syrian fighters, with at least two — at one point three — rival claimant governments.Syria’s civil war gave the Islamic State group a theater in which to build strength. From there it burst out to overrun a swath of Syria and Iraq, opening up yet another war that wreaked destruction in Iraq.In Egypt, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi often points to the wreckage around the region to bolster one of his key claims to legitimacy — “without me, chaos.” He often says stability is needed while he reshapes the economy, an argument that resonates among many Egyptians.After crushing the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamists, his government has arrested secular activists and others, often bringing them before terrorism court.Still, uprisings erupt in the region, pointing to how the ambitions of the 2011 revolts still echo.Massive protests demanding the ouster of ruling elites spread around Lebanon and Iraq in late 2019 and early 2020. In Sudan, protesters forced out autocrat Omar al-Bashir, then tried to dislodge the military from power as well, with only partial success.“Change is not overnight. I don’t want to be all wonky and say the French Revolution took decades, but it did. It doesn’t happen over a year or two,” said Ramy Yaacoub, who was involved in Egypt’s protests and post-revolution politics during the heady days after Hosni Mubarak’s fall. He founded and now heads the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Studies in Washington.Some activists have turned to improving themselves, studying and building skills, keeping away despair.Elbendary, who has regained partial sight in one eye, has been doing consulting work on community organizing, policy research, independent media development and conflict resolution around the region.It’s a generational conflict, he said, and the hope lies with a generation gaining knowledge that can one day benefit their homelands.But when?Several years at the most optimistic, he said — not for real change, “for a slight opening, a slight margin where we can breathe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-decade-later-arab-spring-legacy-lost-in-wars-repression/story-8MclI7iV7huM7pTqRB4xQL.html
15-12-2020||World||UK unemployment rate highest since 2016 as pandemic impact worsens||UK unemployment surged in the three months through October, exposing the brutal impact of the coronavirus on the economy.The figures will revive criticism that Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak acted too late when he expanded programs to support jobs and businesses hit by the worst downturn in 300 years. Many firms had already taken the decision to axe jobs.The number of people looking for work jumped surged by 241,000 in the period, taking the jobless rate to 4.9%, the highest since 2016, the Office for National Statistics said Tuesday.It followed an increase of 243,000 in the third quarter, a rise last seen in the financial crisis of 2009. Job cuts, known as redundancies in the UK, increased by a record 217,000 through October, while the number of people on payrolls was 819,000 below pre-pandemic levels in November.The government expects the jobless rate to rise to 7.5%, and a potential no-deal exit from the European Union’s single market will make it even harder for the economy to bounce back.Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc is cutting more than 5,000 jobs this year as reduced air travel hammers its aerospace engine business. Heathrow Airport, Britain’s busiest, says it’s trying to avoid reducing staff by implementing wage cuts, prompting more than 1,000 employees to go on strike earlier this month.The Bank of England also added stimulus in November, increasing its bond-buying program by 150 billion pounds ($198 billion) and predicting contraction in the fourth quarter. Its next policy announcement is due Thursday.Since October, the emergence of vaccines for the virus have raised hopes that the UK economy can start getting back to normal in 2021, albeit with new barriers to trade from Brexit.Bloomberg Economics now sees unemployment peaking at 7% next year, instead of 7.3%. Nevertheless, the Confederation of British Industry doesn’t see output returning to pre-pandemic levels until the following year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-unemployment-rate-highest-since-2016-as-pandemic-impact-worsens/story-Ui1vSQ1fFcylbemCChO5gJ.html

Various testimonies surfacing from the non-Chinese world reveal that Beijing has in fact intensified its operations against Uyghurs by putting more people in internment camps during the pandemic times.In fact, the Uyghur Muslims in Chinese “re-education” camps are forced to eat pork every Friday, confirmed Sayragul Sautbay, who was one of the victims of the atrocities being committed by the Chinese government.Answering to a question of Schmitt regarding effects of coronavirus on churches, synagogues, worship places, which have been closed or shut down and how repressive regimes like China is using the situation to their benefit in suppressing Uyghurs, Pompeo upheld religious freedom as one of the fundamental rights.“I am incredibly proud of the work we have done on religious freedom. It’s this most fundamental right, this human right that - from which all others flow. If you get religious freedom rights and tolerance for people of faith, so many good things happen in your country. So we’ve worked on this - is so we’ve worked hard on religious freedom,” remarked Pompeo.He also rued the fact that leaders across the world are opening bars and casinos but places of worship were still not permitted to open.“It’s very discouraging to see leaders use an excuse of the coronavirus to allow bars and casinos to be open, but not permit places of worship, people to gather around their faith,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-slams-china-s-treatment-of-uyghurs-compares-it-to-nazi-germany/story-YGYwO20OXrsdP3pzhMFgXP.html
15-12-2020||World||Japan’s ‘Twitter killer’ given death penalty for nine murders||A Japanese man dubbed the “Twitter killer” was sentenced to death by a Tokyo court Tuesday for murdering and dismembering nine people he met online.Takahiro Shiraishi, 30, admitted killing and butchering his young victims -- all but one of whom were women -- who he met on the social media platform.His lawyers had argued he should receive a prison sentence because his victims, aged between 15 and 26, expressed suicidal thoughts on social media and so had consented to death.But on Tuesday “the death sentence was handed down” to Shiraishi, a court official told AFP.“None of the nine victims consented to be killed, including silent consent,” the judge said, according to public broadcaster NHK.“It is extremely grave that the lives of nine young people were taken away. The dignity of the victims was trampled upon,” the judge reportedly added.NHK said 435 people turned up to watch the verdict, even though the court only had 16 seats available for the public.Shiraishi used Twitter to contact users who posted about taking their own lives, telling them he could help them in their plans -- or even die alongside them.The father of one 25-year-old victim said in court last month that he “will never forgive Shiraishi even if he dies”, NHK reported at the time.“Even now, when I see a woman of my daughter’s age, I mistake her for my daughter. This pain will never go away. Give her back to me!” he said.Japan is one of few developed nations to retain the death penalty, and public support for it remains high.Years usually pass between sentencing and execution, and the last execution was in December 2019, when a Chinese man was hanged for the murder of a family of four.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-twitter-killer-given-death-penalty-for-nine-murders/story-mx47GBPFSJweAC9wqbzLhL.html

Jimmy, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail on Saturday, after being charged with the draconian National Security Law.Lai was handcuffed and chained around the waist while being escorted to court earlier today, South China Morning Post reported.He is expected to spend the coming four months in detention while police comb through his social media posts and examine his overseas visits to gather evidence.Calling Jimmy Lai a “true patriot”, Pompeo said: “He cares deeply about the people of Hong Kong, as does our administration. This is another example where General Secretary Xi Jinping broke a promise. He made a 50-year commitment for freedom for the people of Hong Kong and he’s now bashed it. He’s now taken it away with his national security law that caused the imprisonment of Jimmy Lai, who was simply trying to speak about the basic rights for the people of Hong Kong.”In an interview with Newsmax, Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party cannot be trusted.“I fear that Hong Kong is becoming just another Chinese-run communist city, and that’s too bad. It’s inconsistent with what Xi Jinping had promised and it’s another example of the fact that you simply can’t trust with the Chinese Communist Party says. You have to verify every single thing that they assert,” he said. In August 2020, Jimmy was arrested under the new National Security Law.The charge stems from comments Lai purportedly made on Twitter and in interviews asking foreign countries to sanction the city.This comes after a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers were arrested in the month of October over protests after the draconian National Security Law was imposed on the city by Beijing.The law criminalizes secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces and carries with it strict prison terms. It came into effect from July 1.Several of those disqualified were sitting lawmakers, who were subsequently ejected from the parliament by Beijing overruling constitutional precedent and bypassing Hong Kong’s courts on November 11, sparking the mass resignation of the entire pro-democratic camp.

15-12-2020||World||New York governor Andrew Cuomo denies former aide’s sexual harassment allegations||New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday denied a former aide’s allegations over the weekend that he sexually harassed her by making inappropriate comments about her appearance.Cuomo told reporters the claims that former economic adviser Lindsey Boylan made in a series of tweets Sunday were “not true.”“I fought for and I believe a woman has the right to come forward and express her opinion and express issues and concerns that she has,” the 63-year-old Democratic governor said, making his first comments on the allegations. “But it’s just not true.”Cuomo’s press secretary previously denied the claims on his behalf.Boylan, who is running for Manhattan borough president, tweeted that Cuomo “sexually harassed me for years.” She added that “many saw it, and watched.”“I could never anticipate what to expect: would I be grilled on my work (which was very good) or harassed about my looks. Or would it be both in the same conversation? This was the way for years,” she continued.Boylan, 36, worked for the Cuomo administration from March 2015 to October 2018, serving first as executive vice president of Empire State Development and then as a special adviser to Cuomo for economic development.Earlier this month, Boylan tweeted that working in Cuomo’s administration was the worst job she ever had, calling the environment “beyond toxic.”Personnel memos written in 2018 and obtained by The Associated Press indicated that Boylan resigned after she was confronted about complaints about her own office behavior.Boylan did not provide details of Cuomo’s alleged harassment and didn’t respond to messages from The Associated Press.Boylan tweeted Sunday, “To be clear: I have no interest in talking to journalists. I am about validating the experience of countless women and making sure abuse stops.”Cuomo didn’t answer when asked Monday if he remembered instances where he commented on Boylan’s looks, instead reiterating that he denied her allegations.“On the tweets, I totally respect a woman’s right — fought for a woman’s right to express any concern, any issue she has in the workplace. I support that. But the tweets were simply not true.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-denies-former-aide-s-sexual-harassment-allegations/story-g40ObmZZFL9v3AUYWyB1HK.html
15-12-2020||World||Boko Haram claims kidnapping of hundreds of Nigerian students||Jihadist group Boko Haram on Tuesday claimed responsibility for the abduction of hundreds of school students in northwest Nigeria.“I am Abubakar Shekau and our brothers are behind the kidnapping in Katsina,” said the leader of the group behind the 2014 abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls in Chibok, in a voice message. At least 333 students are still missing since the attack late Friday on the all-boys Government Science Secondary School in northwestern Katsina state.The attack was initially blamed on armed groups locally known as “bandits”, who are active in the unstable region where kidnappings for ransom are common.The army said Monday it had located the hideout of the men, and that a military operation was under way.More than 100 gunmen on motorcycles stormed the rural school north of Kankara town, forcing students to flee and hide in the surrounding bush.A number of boys were able to escape, but many were captured, split into groups and taken away, residents told AFP.The kidnappings occurred in the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari, who condemned the attack and ordered security stepped up in schools, with those in Katsina state closed.Tuesday’s claim of responsibility marks a major turning point in the advance of jihadist groups in northwest Nigeria.Boko Haram, and a splinter group the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), are waging an insurgency in Nigeria northeast and are thought to have only a minor presence in the northwest.But concerns have grown of jihadist inroads into the region, especially after fighters claiming to be in the northwest released a 2020 propaganda video pledging allegiance to Boko Haram’s leader.Buhari has made the fight against the group a priority, but the security situation in northern Nigeria has deteriorated since his 2015 election.#BringBackOurBoys has been trending on social media since the weekend -- a reference to a similar hashtag used after the girls’ 2014 abduction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boko-haram-claims-kidnapping-of-hundreds-of-nigerian-students/story-mZ4DT1E8UeYqFTRsS5SYKP.html

Elderly and infirm residents of such facilities have been the most vulnerable demographic in Canada during the coronavirus pandemic.Lévesque was followed by Anita Quidangen, a health care worker in Toronto, the first person in Ontario to get the injection.The beginning of the historic vaccination programme was greeted by Anita Anand, Canada’s minister of public services and procurement, who tweeted, “Today, Canada is receiving 30K doses of the authorised Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.”That initial shipment of 30,000 is part of the first installment of 249,000 that will arrive in Canada in the days to follow as Anand said they will be available by December 31, with millions more doses expected by the end of the first quarter of 2021.The start of the vaccination has also led to a sharp rise in the number of Canadians “willing to be immunised against Covid-19 as soon as a vaccine is available to them”, according to the non-profit public polling agency Angus Reid Institute.About 48% of Canadians now want to be vaccinated immediately, an increase of 8% over last month, indicating that scepticism is gradually eroding as reports of vaccinations in the UK and the US come in along with announcements of the jabs being available in Canada.But the agency noted that “while more in this country express a desire for inoculation sooner rather than later, the number of those who say they will not get a vaccine has remained static at roughly one-in-seven”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/optimism-in-canada-as-first-quebecers-get-vaccinated-for-covid-19/story-8zuI1s8t8i8iKFpcPllGfM.html

The attorney general is President-elect Joe Biden’s pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department; he’d be the first Latino in the post.“We’re investigating because we got reports, information, complaints about conditions, incidents,” Becerra said. “We believe that it merits looking into Amazon’s protocols, practices, based on information that we have received.” The court filing from Becerra lists media reports about three Amazon workers’ deaths but said the company mentioned none of them in its responses. It says he learned more about the company’s infection rate from its blog posts than from its subpoena responses.The company did not respond to a request for comment left through an email provided for reporters. Amazon said in a statement to The Sacramento Bee that it is “a leader in providing Covid-19 safety measures for our employees — we’ve invested billions of dollars in equipment and technology, including building on-site testing for employees and providing personal protective equipment. We encourage anyone to compare our speed and actions in this area to any other major employer.” Becerra wants a Sacramento County Superior Court judge to find that the company hasn’t given specific details on its coronavirus prevention efforts in response to subpoenas issued Aug. 19, including its sick leave policies and cleaning procedures. He also wants access to the company’s raw data on the number of infections and deaths at its facilities in California.“We urgently need to know about complaints made by Amazon associates to the company about working conditions, potential retaliation taken against employees who raise these workplace safety concerns,” he said. “We don’t have time to drag our feet ... our state finds itself in the thick of this pandemic.” His office wants to know which facilities have the highest infection rates, how the company defines which employees have been diagnosed with the virus, any contacts it has had with health officials, and documents related to any lawsuits or investigations by individuals or other agencies.Becerra routinely declines to comment on ongoing investigations but called a virtual news conference to criticize Amazon for making billions of dollars during the pandemic as consumers increasingly turn to online purchases over brick-and-mortar stores — profits that he said are built on the labor of employees who put themselves at risk.The company projects sales will top USD 100 billion in the final quarter of 2020, and in the third quarter, “its revenues soared while its profits tripled compared to 2019,” Becerra said.“While Amazon continues to operate profitably, it has been less than forthcoming about its operations and its practices to protect its workers,” he said.The attorney general said the subpoenas followed months of informal communications with the company over its health and safety policies.The company has missed several chances to comply, Becerra said, but he has made no decision on whether its practices are adequate — in part because he has not received enough information from the company.The probe began last spring, his office said in seeking the court order, and officials first sent Amazon a letter in May seeking information.Cal-OSHA, more formally known as the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, and the San Francisco Department of Public Health also have launched investigations. Officials in other states also are investigating Amazon workers’ complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-subpoenas-amazon-over-worker-safety-in-covid-19-pandemic/story-yrb9aEy0BQzgQE2H0ets2H.html

More than 40% of citizens were placed in the highest risk category.However London, whose 9 million people and world-leading financial centre make it the engine of the British economy, was initially left in the middle tier of restrictions.Tussle over SchoolsThe main difference between the top alert levels is that bars and restaurants, which can stay open under certain conditions in Tier 2, must close their doors in Tier 3 and can only operate takeaway services.There are also additional curbs on socialising in Tier 3, but workplaces and schools are told to remain open.Three local councils in the capital - Greenwich, Islington and Waltham Forest - unilaterally instructed schools in their boroughs to close, but were overruled by the national government which ordered that schools should remain open.The tussle between local and central authorities reflected the tensions and complexities involved in attempting to bring the virus under control whilst protecting certain aspects of life deemed vitally important, such as children’s education.Schools were closed to most pupils for several months during the first wave of the pandemic, when there was a strict national lockdown. Since they reopened in September, the government has emphasised it wanted children in school as much as possible.For other parts of London’s social fabric, especially pubs, restaurants and cafes that have been hard-hit since the start of the pandemic, the move into Tier 3 was expected to cause further hardship.“Moving into Tier 3 before Christmas will be deeply disappointing for Londoners, and a terrible blow to the capital’s hospitality, leisure and cultural sectors,” said John Dickie, director of Strategy and Policy at business campaign group London First.MutationsThe Tier 3 restrictions will come into force in the capital from 0001 GMT on Wednesday. England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said the detection of the new variant was not the reason for the decision to put London in Tier 3 - the reason was the sharp rise in infections.He said there was no evidence that the clinical outcome was different for the new variant.“There are many variants. It just happens that this one has quite a few more mutations than some of the other variants, so that’s the reason why we’ve taken it particularly seriously,” Whitty said during a news conference with Hancock.The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that Britain had reported the variant, but added that mutations were not uncommon, a view echoed by several other experts.Martin Hibberd, professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said the reports were “not surprising and it was too early to say how important it is yet,” adding it was believed that one previous mutation had let the virus to spread more easily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tighter-covid-19-restrictions-imposed-in-london-as-coronavirus-infections-surge/story-mV2x0YPOfI3g66U6Py5atN.html
15-12-2020||World||Joe Biden slams Donald Trump after securing electoral college vote; William Barr quits||US President-elect Joe Biden on Monday called upon the country to “turn the page” in a victory speech after the electoral college voted to reaffirm his 2020 White House win. He also went on to express rare outrage and impatience with President Donald Trump and his allies’ “assault on democracy” for their refusal to acknowledge his defeat. Shortly after the vote, William Barr, the once loyal attorney general who later disputed Trump’s election fraud claims, resigned, ending a souring relationship.Biden formally won 306 electoral college votes as electors voted in state capitals around the country either virtually or in person, fulfilling a pro forma responsibility that wouldn’t have received so much public attention but for Trump’s refusal to acknowledge his defeat. Trump expectedly won 232.ALSO WATCH | ‘Democracy prevailed’: Joe Biden after electoral college affirms his victory “If anyone didn’t know it before, we know it now. What beats deep in the hearts of the American people is this – democracy,” Biden said in remarks from Wilmington, Delaware. “And so, now it is time to turn the page, to unite, to heal.”Biden had been publicly patient with Trump’s constant efforts to question and overturn the election result, giving the president time to come to terms with his defeat. He had extended the same understanding to Republican lawmakers, a majority of whom have also not acknowledged Biden’s victory fearing Trump’s wrath.The dam broke on Monday, though. Biden ripped into Trump, mentioning him by name more times than he has before in any speech after winning the election, and also the Republicans, accusing them of launching an “unprecedented assault on democracy”. Biden listed out Trump’s efforts — the legal challenges that were heard and rejected by 80 judges around the country, including the Supreme Court, the multiple recounts, and the political pressure on elected Republican officials and election officials.“Every avenue was made available to President Trump to contest the results,” Biden said. “Respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy – even when we find those results hard to accept. But that is the obligation of those who have taken a sworn duty to uphold our constitution.”Biden became the “projected” winner of the election in the week of November 3, when polling closed. He was then “officially” the winner on December 8 when all 50 states and Washington, DC “certified” the election result setting up the electoral college vote for December 14. The electoral college votes cast on Monday will be counted by the House of Representatives on January 6, another formality elevated to prominence. Trump allies in the House expect to use that part of the process to try to overturn the election one last time. They will fail, as they have so far, and the president-elect will be sworn in on January 20.Shortly after the electoral college vote became clear in the evening, Trump announced the departure of Barr, who has publicly disputed Trump’s poll fraud claims, saying his department had found no evidence of irregularities of the scale that could change the outcome of the election.Barr’s exit had been imminent since his public break with the president. But instead of being hounded out of office like his predecessor Jeff Sessions, Barr managed a carefully choreographed exit that appeared amicable. So much so that Trump tweeted out Barr’s resignation letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-slams-donald-trump-after-securing-electoral-college-vote-william-barr-quits/story-iX2i3zUsko4sm40jtXmpJN.html
15-12-2020||World||US formally blames Iran for abduction, death of ex-FBI agent Robert Levinson||The Trump administration for the first time on Monday formally blamed Iran for the presumed death of retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, publicly identifying two Iranian intelligence officers believed responsible for his abduction and imposing sanctions against them.Levinson disappeared in Iran under mysterious circumstances more than a decade ago, and though U.S. diplomats and investigators have long said they thought he was taken by Iranian government agents, Monday’s announcement in the final weeks of the Trump administration was the most definitive assignment of blame to date.The announcement is the latest in a series of tough actions the Trump administration has taken toward Iran as it works to cement an aggressive posture that may complicate any efforts by incoming President Joe Biden and his national security team to radically change course once they take office next month. U.S. officials pre-emptively made clear Monday that no deal with Iran should be finalized without providing for the release of Americans who remain detained there.Besides calling out two high-ranking intelligence officers by name, U.S. officials also said the Iranian regime sanctioned the plot that led to Levinson’s abduction and lied for years about its involvement in his disappearance through disinformation campaigns aimed at deflecting responsibility and covering up the government’s role.“The abduction of Mr. Levinson in Iran is an outrageous example of the Iranian regime’s willingness to commit unjust acts,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.The Iranian intelligence officers, Mohammad Baseri and Ahmad Khazai, are alleged to have been involved in Levinson’s abduction and probable death. Under the sanctions, any property or assets they hold in the United States would be frozen. Though it’s unlikely they have bank accounts in the U.S., the sanctions could also limit their movements or financial dealing outside Iran. The men have met with intelligence officials from other countries and also led delegations, U.S. officials say.There was no immediate reaction in Iranian state media Monday night to the announcement.In a statement, the Levinson family thanked Trump administration officials and called Monday’s announcement “just one step in a long road toward achieving justice for him, but it is an important one.”“Robert Levinson will never come home to his family alive because of the cruel, cynical and inhumane actions of the Iranian authorities,” the family said. “Because of these men and others like them, our wonderful husband, father and grandfather died alone, thousands of miles from everyone he loved.”Monday’s announcement is the latest aggressive Trump administration action against Iran since the president two years ago withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, a signature foreign policy achievement of predecessor Barack Obama.Since then, the Trump administration has steadily ramped up pressure on Iran, re-imposing a wide swath of sanctions and taking other actions, including killing the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in a drone strike at the airport in Baghdad this year.That move, coupled with retaliatory attacks against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, stepped-up sanctions against Iranian proxies in Lebanon and Yemen and the recent killing of an Iranian nuclear scientist outside of Tehran that has been attributed to Israel, have left the impression that Trump is seeking to box in Biden when he takes office in January.Biden has said he wants to reenter the 2015 nuclear deal but also improve and expand on it. Those prospects may prove difficult to realize if the situation escalates in the next five weeks.Officials said they were announcing sanctions now, one month before Trump leaves office, not for any political reasons but simply because they had finally accumulated enough information to formally hold Iran accountable. They also said that no agreement with Iran should be reached in the next administration without a deal to free three Americans who they said remain imprisoned there.The announcement comes nine months after U.S. officials revealed that they had concluded that Levinson “may have passed some time ago” though they did not disclose at the time the information that led to that assessment. Officials on Monday would not describe any additional intelligence, except to say that all evidence they had pointed in the direction of Levinson having died in captivity.Levinson vanished on March 9, 2007, when he was scheduled to meet a source on the Iranian island of Kish. For years, U.S. officials would say only that Levinson was working independently on a private investigation. But a 2013 Associated Press investigation revealed that Levinson had been sent on a mission by CIA analysts who had no authority to run such an operation. He would be 72 years old now.FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement that “this situation is personal because Bob served as a special agent for 22 years and will always be a part of the FBI family.”The family received a video in late 2010 as well as proof-of-life photographs in 2011 in which he appeared disheveled with a long beard and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit like those given to detainees at the Guantanamo Bay prison. Even then, his whereabouts and fate were not known, and the Iran government has consistently denied having any information about Levinson.Earlier this year, a federal judge in Washington held Iran liable for his disappearance, saying the country was “in no uncertain terms” responsible for Levinson’s “hostage taking and torture.”____Associated Press writers Matthew Lee in Washington and Jon Gambrell in Dubai contributed to this report.Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-formally-blames-iran-for-abduction-death-of-ex-fbi-agent-robert-levinson/story-sQ7VZ7HNACIpcTpCB3x1QN.html
15-12-2020||World||Joe Biden says ‘democracy prevailed’ as he officially wins US presidential race||President-elect Joe Biden pointedly criticized President Donald Trump on Monday for threatening core principles of democracy even as he told Americans that their form of self-government ultimately “prevailed.”Also Read | Joe Biden clears 270-vote mark as electors affirm his victorySpeaking from his longtime home of Wilmington, Delaware, on the day that electors nationwide cast votes affirming his victory, Biden was blunt in critiquing the damage done by Trump’s baseless allegations that the contest was stolen. Such arguments have been roundly rejected by judges across the political spectrum, including the justices at the Supreme Court.Democracy, Biden said, has been “pushed, tested, threatened.” But he said it proved to be “resilient, true, and strong.”“The flame of democracy was lit in this nation a long time ago,” Biden said. “And we now know that nothing, not even a pandemic or an abuse of power, can extinguish that flame.”Biden and his team hope that the formal victory in the Electoral College combined with his record-setting 81 million-vote count will help the country unify and accept his presidency. But the challenge facing Biden was evident as many congressional Republicans, including some of the party’s top leaders, refused to officially accept Biden’s win. Trump, meanwhile, shows no sign of conceding.The president-elect acknowledged an irony in the circumstances, noting that he won with the same number of electoral votes — 306 — as Trump did four years ago. Trump hailed that win as a “landslide.”“By his own standards, these numbers represent a clear victory then, and I respectfully suggest they do so now,” Biden said.A candidate needs to win 270 electoral votes to clinch the presidency.The fact that Biden had to even give such a speech shortly after electors voted to make him the president — a usually routine and even mundane step — shows how extraordinary the post-election period has been, with Trump trying to thwart Biden at every turn.Despite that, Biden struck a familiar theme of his presidential campaign, pledging to be “a president for all Americans” who will “work just as hard for those of you who didn’t vote for me as I will for those who did.”“Now it is time to turn the page as we’ve done throughout our history,” he said. “To unite. To heal.”He said that was the only way the country could overcome the worst health crisis in more than a century, saying that in the face of the pandemic, “we need to work together, give each other a chance and lower the temperature.”Whether his message will have any effect remains to be seen. Top Republicans have mostly continued to back Trump and his unsubstantiated claims of a rigged election and, even once Biden takes power, are unlikely to give him any of the traditional honeymoon period.Biden recalled that one of his jobs as vice president four years ago was to formally recognize Trump’s electoral victory in the Senate after 2016, and he said he expected the same process to occur this time — saluting the small number of GOP senators who have acknowledged his victory. But there are many other leading Republicans who have continued to side with Trump.And after losing dozens of legal challenges on the state and federal level, Trump is expected to push forward with new litigation this week. Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani says he expects five more lawsuits at the state level.Even after he takes the White House, Biden faces a narrowly divided Senate. Next month’s runoff elections in Georgia will decide which party controls the chamber. There’s also a thinned Democratic majority in the House as the GOP picked up seats even as Trump lost.Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is set to hold a hearing Wednesday on election “irregularities.” Johnson has questioned why Congress wasn’t informed that the taxes of Biden’s son Hunter were under federal investigation during Trump’s impeachment trial last year.The president was acquitted in a Senate trial that centered on Trump’s dealings with Ukraine’s president and on whether he abused his office by seeking an investigation into the Bidens. Hunter Biden served on the board of directors of a Ukrainian energy company.The younger Biden said in a statement last week that he just recently learned that he was under investigation. He also said he committed no wrongdoing.Biden’s deputy chief of staff, Jen O’Malley Dillon, downplayed the notion that the investigation could hamper Biden’s ability to pursue his agenda.“The president-elect himself has said this is not about his family or Donald Trump’s family,” O’Malley Dillon said. “It is about the American people’s families. And I think we’re going to continue to stay focused on the issues that are impacting their daily lives.”___Weissert reported from Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democracy-prevailed-biden-aims-to-unify-divided-nation/story-4woraODusaGUWLCHIL9sgL.html
15-12-2020||World||South Korea criminalizes sending anti-Kim leaflets to North Korea||South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s progressive camp passed legislation that criminalizes sending leaflets to North Korea, months after Kim Jong Un’s regime demanded action to stop the “human scum” behind the messages.Moon’s Democratic Party and its allies, who wield a supermajority in parliament since an election in April, passed the “anti-leaflet” bill late Monday on a mostly party-line vote. Backers have said the leaflets conflict with agreements between the two Koreas and cast a pall over negotiations with Pyongyang.Conservatives launched a filibuster trying to halt the legislation and human rights groups have argued that it limits constitutionally protected free speech. The main conservative opposition People Power Party has said it might challenge the law in the Constitutional Court.The bill calls for prison sentences of as long as three years for those convicted of sending leaflets across the border to North Korea. It also bans propaganda broadcasts and anti-Pyongyang material postings at the inter-Korean border.While millions of leaflets have been flown across the border for more than a decade, Pyongyang stepped up its pressure on Moon over the messages around June -- a little more than a month after reports on Kim’s health raised questions about his grip on power. Defector-led groups largely responsible for the leaflets often include cash, rice and USB memory sticks to entice North Koreans to retrieve the balloons.Kim Yo Jong, the North Korean leader’s sister, warned in June that Moon’s government would pay a “dear price” if it continued to allow “mongrel dogs” to send the leaflets. Shortly after, North Korea blew up a $15 million joint liaison office built by South Korea north of the border that served as a de facto embassy -- destroying one of the most tangible symbols of Moon’s rapprochement efforts.US President-elect Joe Biden is set to shake up relations with Kim Jong Un. Biden has said he wants to “jump start” a campaign with US allies and others for denuclearization, and move away from the personal diplomacy embraced by outgoing President Donald Trump and Moon, which led to high-profile summits but no tangible steps to wind down Kim’s nuclear program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-criminalizes-sending-anti-kim-leaflets-to-north-korea/story-65lmErtUZVYdumcX9Po54O.html

While the United Kingdom last Tuesday became the first country to start Covid-19 vaccination outside trial stage, the United States, on Monday, too, began its vaccination drive. Both countries have given emergency use authorisation (EUA) to Pfizer Inc’s vaccine candidate; Canada and Bahrain are also among countries to have granted Pfizer vaccine candidate permission to be used in emergency cases.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHere are the latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccine development front:1. President Donald Trump on Monday announced the administration of the first Covid-19 vaccine in the United States. “First vaccine administered. Congratulations USA! Congratulations World!” tweeted Trump as vaccinations began across the US. While healthcare workers are first in line for a shot, acting secretary of defence, Christopher Miller, was among those to receive a shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine.Also Read | First Covid-19 vaccine administered in the US, tweets President Donald Trump2. Developers of Russia’s Sputnik V, which Moscow claims is the world’s first registered vaccine against Covid-19, on Monday said it had shown an efficacy of 91.4% based on the final analysis of data from clinical trials. The calculation, the developers said, was based on analysis of data of the volunteers who received the first and second doses of Sputnik V, or a placebo, at “the third and final control point of 78 confirmed cases in accordance with the Phase III clinical trials protocol.”Also Read | Sputnik V over 91% effective in final analysis, shows data3. Israel’s defence ministry has said the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) has “successfully completed” phase one of the domestic Covid-19 vaccine trials and plans to start phase two “in the coming days.” Phase two, the ministry said, would take place with approximately 1,000 volunteers, which, if successful, would be followed by a third phase involving up to 30,000 volunteers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-us-begins-vaccination-drive-russia-claims-its-sputnik-v-over-91-effective/story-UOcJCiFiXIWYu7oDyfXB5O.html
15-12-2020||World||Covid-19: UAE launches inoculation using Chinese drugs giant Sinopharm’s vaccine||The United Arab Emirates has launched Covid-19 vaccinations in the capital Abu Dhabi, health officials said Monday, days after it approved the jab by Chinese drugs giant Sinopharm. The wealthy Gulf nation is one of the first countries to start widespread inoculation, after Britain became the first to roll out a campaign using a vaccine by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. Gulf countries UAE and Bahrain, where third-phase trials of the Sinopharm vaccine were carried out, have both officially registered it for public use after it was previously approved for emergency use for frontline health workers.Also Read: UAE, Turkey to resume flights for first time since coronavirusResidents in the capital can book an appointment through the Abu Dhabi Health Services (SEHA) hotline.“Residents can book an appointment for the vaccine now, free of charge,” a SEHA operator told AFP, with local reports saying at least 45 hospitals and clinics were equipped with the vaccine.Sinopharm -- which uses an inactive form of the novel coronavirus -- is administered in two doses, 21 days apart, according to SEHA.The UAE has so far recorded more than 184,000 novel coronavirus cases, including 617 deaths. China has four vaccines, including Sinopharm, in the final stages of development and is well advanced with mass human testing in a number of countries, including Brazil, the UAE and Turkey.But unlike vaccines being developed by Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, little information has been published about the safety or efficacy of Chinese vaccines.Also Read: Abu Dhabi to reopen for foreign tourists amid vaccine optimismIn Peru, clinical trials of a Sinopharm vaccine were suspended after neurological problems were detected in a test volunteer.Chinese vaccine frontrunners Sinovac and Sinopharm had pre-orders for fewer than 500 million doses by mid-November, according to data from London consultancy Airfinity -- mostly from countries that have participated in trials.Britain’s AstraZeneca, meanwhile, has pre-orders for 2.4 billion doses, and Pfizer for about half a billion orders.Two vaccines have undergone third-phase trials in the UAE -- the Sinopharm project and Russia’s Sputnik-V, named after the Soviet-era satellite.Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum said in November that he had received an experimental coronavirus vaccine, joining other top UAE officials to take part in the trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uae-launches-inoculation-using-chinese-drugs-giant-sinopharm-s-vaccine-in-capital/story-GzYowuIkhWiF1XqpEvhjfK.html
15-12-2020||World||Aware of reports of new Covid-19 variant in UK, says WHO||The World Health Organisation is aware of reports that a new variant of COVID-19 has been identified in the United Kingdom, although there is no evidence to suggest that the mutation will impact the effectiveness of vaccines against the disease, WHO Health Emergencies Programme Executive Director Mike Ryan said on Monday.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier in the day announced that a new variant of COVID-19 had been identified in the south of England, and was responsible for roughly 1,000 cases.“We are aware of this genetic variant I think reported in about 1,000 individuals in England, and the authorities in the UK under Matt Hancock’s leadership are obviously looking at the significance of this,” Ryan said at a WHO virtual press briefing.According to the WHO official, there was no evidence to suggest that the new variant of the disease would transmit more easily or undermine vaccines against COVID-19 that are being rolled out.“Does this make this virus more serious? Does it allow the virus to transmit more easily? Does it in any way interfere with diagnostics? Would it in any way interfere with vaccine effectiveness? None of these questions have been addressed yet, and we have no information to suggest that any of that is the case,” Ryan remarked.During his appearance in parliament earlier in the day, Hancock also revealed that London will be moved into the country’s highest coronavirus disease alert level tier from Wednesday, amid a surge of new cases in the UK capital.The UK began its mass vaccination program, using a vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech, this past Tuesday.

15-12-2020||World||US Attorney General William Barr to leave White House before Christmas, tweets Donald Trump||Attorney General William Barr, one of President Donald Trump’s staunchest allies, is departing amid lingering tension over the president’s baseless claims of election fraud and the investigation into President-elect Joe Biden’s son.Barr went Monday to the White House, where Trump said the attorney general submitted his letter of resignation. “As per letter, Bill will be leaving just before Christmas to spend the holidays with his family,” Trump tweeted.Trump has publicly expressed his anger about Barr’s statement to The Associated Press earlier this month that the Justice Department had found no widespread fraud that would change the outcome of the election. Trump has also been angry that the Justice Department did not publicly announce it was investigating Hunter Biden ahead of the election, despite department policy against such a pronouncement.Barr told the AP that U.S. attorneys and FBI agents have been working to follow up specific complaints and information they’ve received, but “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.”Barr’s resignation leaves Trump without a critical ally as he winds down his final weeks in office, and it throws into question open Justice Department investigations, especially the probe into Hunter Biden’s taxes.In his resignation letter, Barr said he updated Trump Monday on the department’s “review of voter fraud allegations in the 2020 election and how these allegations will continue to be pursued.” He added that his last day on the job would be Dec. 23.Trump said Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen, whom he labeled “an outstanding person,” will become acting attorney general. As the current second in command at the Justice Department, Rosen’s appointment is not likely to change much in the final weeks before the administration departs.Trump spent much of the day watching the Electoral College tally and calling allies but broke away to meet with Barr. His tweet about the Attorney General’s exit was a sober message from a president who is notoriously cold to his departing staff and quick to name-call and deride them once they say they are leaving.Trump has also has previously claimed he fired staffers who resigned to make himself appear more powerful, and others, like former attorney general Jeff Sessions, were mocked by the president for weeks before they left office.But despite Trump’s obvious disdain for those who publicly disagree with him, Barr had generally remained in the president’s good graces and has been one of the president’s most ardent allies. Before the election, he had repeatedly raised the notion that mail-in voting could be especially vulnerable to fraud during the coronavirus pandemic as Americans feared going to polls.But Trump has a low tolerance for criticism, especially public criticism, from his allies and often fires back in kind. The two had been at odds in the past few months and Barr was said to have been frustrated by Trump’s tweeting.Trump said on Fox News over the weekend that he was disappointed that the Hunter Biden investigation had not been disclosed. Hunter Biden himself announced it last week.“Bill Barr should have stepped up,” Trump said.One senior administration official not authorized to speak publicly and speaking to The AP on condition of anonymity said Barr had resigned of his own accord and described the meeting as amicable.Barr, who was serving in his second stint as attorney general, sought to paint himself as an independent leader who would not bow to political pressure. But Democrats have repeatedly accused Barr of acting more like the president’s personal attorney than the attorney general, and Barr had proved to be a largely reliable Trump ally and defender of presidential power.Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Republican leader of the judiciary committee, told reporters at the Capitol he was surprised by the news.“I think he did an incredibly good job trying to repair damage done to the Department of Justice, trying to be fair and faithful to the law. I think he’s got a lot to be proud of,” Graham said. “He fought for the president where he could, as every attorney general and administration should, but he also didn’t cross lines that he shouldn’t have crossed.” He said he was referring to disclosing the Biden investigation.Graham also praised Rosen as a “good man” who he said would “be an ethical leader and a steady hand” at the Justice Department.Democrats who had long criticized Barr did not lament his departure. “Good riddance,” tweeted House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who said the attorney general had “lied to cover for Trump, launched political investigations, subverted justice and the rule of law and violently cracked down on protestors.”House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who led an investigation of politicization of the department, said that “whomever Joe Biden chooses as the new Attorney General will have a tremendous amount of work to do to repair the integrity of the Department of Justice.”Before releasing special counsel Robert Mueller’s full report on the Russia investigation last year, Barr framed the results in a manner favorable to Trump even though Mueller pointedly said he couldn’t exonerate the president of obstruction of justice.He also appointed as special counsel the U.S. attorney who is conducting a criminal investigation into the origins of the FBI’s probe of the 2016 election that morphed into Mueller’s investigation of possible Trump-Russia cooperation, following Trump’s repeated calls to “investigate the investigators.”Barr also ordered Justice Department prosecutors to review the handling of the federal investigation into Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn and then sought to dismiss the criminal charges against Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump later pardoned Flynn.Barr’s break from Trump over election fraud wasn’t the first. Earlier this year, Barr told ABC News that the president’s tweets about Justice Department cases “make it impossible for me to do my job,” and tensions flared just a few months ago when the two were increasingly at odds over the pace of the Durham investigation.Trump had been increasingly critical about a lack of arrests and Barr was privately telling people he was frustrated by Trump’s public pronouncements about the case.Trump was also said to blame Barr for comments from FBI Director Chris Wray on election fraud and mail-in voting that didn’t jibe with the president’s alarmist rhetoric.___Associated Press writers Colleen Long, Eric Tucker, Jonathan Lemire, Mary Clare Jalonick and Zeke Miller contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-attorney-general-william-barr-to-leave-white-house-before-christmas-tweets-donald-trump/story-q5yEa8wmk92lSEJ2cJXHQM.html
15-12-2020||World||Hackers breach US agencies, Homeland Security a reported target||The US Department of Homeland Security was the third federal department to be targeted in a major cyberattack, US media reported Monday, a day after Washington revealed the hack which may have been coordinated by a foreign government.The Washington Post cited unnamed officials who said that the DHS -- which is in charge of protecting the country from attacks both online and off -- had been added to a growing list of targets in the attack, including the Treasury and Commerce departments.A statement from DHS Monday did not confirm the report, saying only that it was “aware of cyber breaches across the federal government and working closely with our partners in the public and private sector on the federal response.”Also Read: US government agencies hacked; Russia a possible culpritThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is attached to the DHS, on Sunday said it had ordered federal agencies to immediately stop using SolarWinds Orion IT products following reports that hackers had used a recent update to gain access to internal communications. “We urge all our partners -- in the public and private sectors -- to assess their exposure to this compromise and to secure their networks,” said CISA Acting Director Brandon Wales.SolarWinds over the weekend admitted that hackers had exploited a backdoor in an update of some of its software released between March and June.The hacks are part of a wider campaign that also hit major cybersecurity firm FireEye, which said its own defenses had been breached by sophisticated attackers who stole tools used to test customers’ computer systems.FireEye said it suspected the attack was state-sponsored, and warned it could have affected numerous high profile targets across the globe.“This campaign may have begun as early as Spring 2020 and is currently ongoing,” FireEye said in a blog post.Russia involved? The content the hackers have sought to steal -- and how successful they have been -- is not known at this time. “We believe this is nation-state activity at significant scale, aimed at both the government and private sector,” said IT giant Microsoft, which is also investigating, in a blog post. Also Read: US agencies hacked in monthslong global cyberspying campaignWhile Microsoft refrained from naming a country, several US media pointed the finger at the Russian group “APT29”, also known as “Cozy Bear.” According to the Washington Post, the group is part of Moscow’s intelligence services, and hacked servers at the State Department and the White House during the Obama administration.The Russian Embassy in the United States categorically denied the accusations in a statement on Facebook.Both the public and private sectors must be increasingly on guard against such hacks, warned Hank Schless, senior manager at Lookout, a California-based mobile security company. “Adversarial nation-states have recognized the value in targeting both sectors, which means neither is safe from the types of attacks that have government resources behind them,” he said.Matt Walmsley of Vectra, which provides cyberattack detection services from its base in California, agreed.“Security teams need to drastically reduce the overall risk of a breach by gaining instant visibility and understanding of who and what is accessing data or changing configurations, regardless of how they are doing it, and from where,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hackers-breach-us-agencies-homeland-security-a-reported-target/story-eTqYOct9N8NypUSwQXZUCN.html
15-12-2020||World||Indian-American among 3 astronauts selected for SpaceX Crew-3 Mission||The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and European Space Agency (ESA) have selected three astronauts to serve as crew members for NASA’s SpaceX Crew-3 mission to the International Space Station, which is expected to launch in the fall of 2021.According to the NASA, the trio will consist of its astronauts Raja Chari, an Indian-American US Air Force colonel, and Tom Marshburn, who will serve as commander and pilot, respectively, and ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer, who will serve as a mission specialist. A fourth crew member will be added at a later date, following a review by NASA and its international partners.Also Read: Indonesia asks SpaceX to study country as venue for launch siteThis will be the first spaceflight for Chari, who became a NASA astronaut in 2017. He was born in Milwaukee, but considers Cedar Falls, Iowa, his hometown. He is a colonel in the US Air Force and joins the mission with extensive experience as a test pilot. He has accumulated more than 2,500 hours of flight time in his career. Chari was selected earlier this month as a member of the Artemis Team and is now eligible for assignment to a future lunar mission.Marshburn is a Statesville, North Carolina, native who became an astronaut in 2004. Prior to serving in the astronaut corps, the medical doctor served as flight surgeon at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston and later became medical operations lead for the International Space Station. “The Crew-3 mission will be his third visit to the space station and his second long-duration mission. Marshburn previously served as a crew member of STS-127 in 2009 and Expedition 34/35, which concluded in 2013,” the NASA said. Maurer comes from Sankt Wendel, in the German state of Saarland. Like Chari, Maurer will be making his first trip to space with the Crew-3 mission. In 2016, Maurer spent 16 days on an undersea mission as part of a NASA’s Extreme Environment Mission Operations, or NEEMO, space analog.Also Read: Here’s how you can spot space station with 2 SpaceX Dragon capsules fly overheadWhen Chari, Marshburn, and Maurer arrive at the orbiting laboratory, they will become expedition crew members for the duration of their six-month stay. “The crew will have a slight overlap with the Crew-2 astronauts, who are expected to launch in the spring of 2021. This will not be the first commercial crew mission to overlap. The Crew-1 astronauts, who are currently on station, and the Crew-2 astronauts, also are expected to coincide in their sojourns for a short time. Increasing the total number of astronauts aboard the station is allowing the agency to boost the number of science investigations conducted in the unique microgravity environment.”This will be the third crew rotation mission of SpaceX’s human space transportation system and its fourth flight with astronauts, including the Demo-2 test flight, to the space station through NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The goal of the program is to provide safe, reliable, and cost-effective crew access to the space station and low-Earth orbit in partnership with American aerospace industry.Moreover, the station is a critical test bed for NASA to understand and overcome the challenges of long-duration spaceflight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-among-three-astronauts-selected-for-spacex-crew-3-mission/story-Sz5sl23PjlNK8wc55B94JJ.html
15-12-2020||World||US starts mass Covid-19 vaccination||A health care worker became on Monday the first to get a shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in New York, the city hit the hardest by the pandemic.“There’s light at the end of the tunnel ... I encourage everyone to take the vaccine,” said Sandra Lindsay, a critical care worker, after getting the first shot of the two-dose vaccine at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens, New York City. Many in the African American community are distrustful of vaccines due to a history of racially charged medical experiments.“First Vaccine Administered. Congratulations USA! Congratulations WORLD!” President Donald Trump tweeted. Earlier, he reversed a White House decision to vaccinate aides around him in the first lot. Reports said he may take the shot.Frontline health workers and residents of long-term nursing home facilities are prioritised for vaccination. The vaccine’s journey from Pfizer’s manufacturing facility in Michigan was followed breathlessly by news TV crews, for a nation starving for good news. Cameras recorded trucks carrying the vaccines emerging from the facility and cargo flights carrying them from a nearby airport for destinations.New York City, the hardest hit in the US, should be prepared for a full shutdown and start making plans to work remotely, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.London moved to Tier 3London will move into the toughest top tier of the three-level Covid-19 alert system from Wednesday as health secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday that there has been a “very sharp exponential” rise of cases.Hancock also revealed that a new variant of Covid-19 had been detected, which may have caused the spike in cases in London, Essex and Kent. The World Health Organization, he said, had been informed of the variant, which is unlikely to cause more serious disease than others.“We have identified a new variant of coronavirus, which may be associated with the fastest spread in the south-east of England,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-starts-mass-covid-19-vaccination/story-2D6HAFVzo7Yp8NPdye3TVK.html

15-12-2020||World||New UK law set to fine social media firms up to £18mn for illegal content||Fines up to £18 million or ten per cent of annual global turnover of tech firms, whichever is higher, will be slapped on tech firms that fail to remove and limit the spread of illegal content under new laws and block non-compliant services from being accessed in the UK.The new rules, intended to enforce a ‘new age of accountability’ for social media, includes the power to hold senior managers of the tech companies liable. They will not affect articles and comments on news websites, and there will be additional measures to protect free speech.The Department of Culture, Media and Sport said in statement that the most popular social media sites, with the largest audiences and high-risk features, will need to go further by setting and enforcing clear terms and conditions which explicitly state how they will handle content which is legal but could cause significant physical or psychological harm to adults.“This includes dangerous disinformation and misinformation about coronavirus vaccines, and will help bridge the gap between what companies say they do and what happens in practice”, it said, adding that the measures will be set out in detail by home secretary Priti Patel and culture secretary Oliver Dowden on Tuesday.Social media sites, websites, apps and other services which host user-generated content or allow people to talk to others online will need to remove and limit the spread of illegal content such as child sexual abuse, terrorist material and suicide content. Ofcom, the UK’s communications regulator, will have the power to fine companies failing in their duty of care.Dowden said: “I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free for all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech”.Patel said: “We are giving internet users the protection they deserve and are working with companies to tackle some of the abuses happening on the web. We will not allow child sexual abuse, terrorist material and other harmful content to fester on online platforms. Tech companies must put public safety first or face the consequences.”The new regulations will apply to any company in the world hosting user-generated content online accessible by people in the UK or enabling them to privately or publicly interact with others online.It includes social media, video sharing and instant messaging platforms, online forums, dating apps, commercial pornography websites, as well as online marketplaces, peer-to-peer services, consumer cloud storage sites and video games which allow online interaction. Search engines will also be subject to the new regulations.Online journalism from news publishers’ websites will be exempt, as will reader comments on such sites. Specific measures will be included in the legislation to make sure journalistic content is still protected when it is reshared on social media platforms, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-law-set-to-fine-social-media-firms-up-to-18mn-for-illegal-content/story-EorSboXrSn8juwcYlyLsdI.html
15-12-2020||World||A weapon to ‘win the war’: US hospitals get initial Covid-19 shots||The first Covid-19 shots were administered by US hospitals Monday, the initial step in a historic drive to immunize millions of people this week as the Pfizer Inc. vaccine is distributed nationwide.In New York, an early epicenter of the US crisis, critical-care nurse Sandra Lindsay received the first shot in the state at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens. Governor Andrew Cuomo joined the event via video from his office in Albany, thanking the nurse for her work throughout the pandemic.“I believe this is the weapon that will win the war,” said Cuomo, who had asked an advisory group to independently review the safety of Covid-19 vaccines authorized by the Food and Drug Administration.The arrival of the Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine offers a glimmer of hope amid a pandemic that has already seen almost 300,000 Americans die. About 200,000 people are testing positive for the virus every day in the nation’s worst surge to date.The government plans to distribute at least 2.9 million doses to US states during the week ahead. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendeded that the first shots go to health-care workers and those in long-term care facilities, including the nation’s hard-hit nursing homes.Added ShipmentsGustave Perna, an Army four-star general and the Operation Warp Speed chief operations officer, said in a news briefing that 55 of 145 shipments scheduled for Monday had been delivered by around noon Eastern time, and that the deliveries set for Tuesday are packed and ready to go.“There is not one part of this country that’s not being touched today through Wednesday,” Perna said.Also Read: There’s light at end of tunnel, says first NYC recipient of Covid vaccineAdditionally, Perna said, the operation will send out an added 581 shipments after Wednesday. So far, he said, there’s been no reason to tap into a reserve of 500,000 doses being held back for emergency reasons.The government will announce new weekly allocations each Friday, Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services Department secretary, said in the briefing. Moving forward, the Trump administration wants to “ensure that any picture we give of this progress is accurate,” he added.Long-Term CentersSome states will start vaccinating residents of long-term care centers this week, according to Azar, with shots in another 1,100 nursing homes starting next week through the federal pharmacy partnership. Many tasks have to be achieved, such as receiving consent from residents, before vaccinators can walk into nursing homes, he added.The plan is to have 20 million people immunized in the month of December, with their second dose coming in January, he said. An added 30 million people will get initial doses in January and, by the end of March, a total of 100 million individuals will have had at least one dose.New York isn’t alone in celebrating the arrival of the vaccine.A masked Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who recently recovered from Covid-19, signed for the FedEx vaccine shipment that arrived at the state laboratory loading dock in Denver on Monday.Nine-Month Wait“I’ve been waiting to do this signature for nine months,” Polis told the driver. The governor also pushed the button to open the rolling door. A staff member carted the white cardboard container into the lab, where Polis opened it with a box cutter and pushed a button on a wireless device to alert Pfizer the shipment arrived.In Fargo, North Dakota, the Sanford Medical Center received its shipment three hours earlier than expected on Monday, said spokeswoman Angela Dejene. The hospital plans to give its first shot in the afternoon.Atrium Health, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, also said on Twitter Monday that it had received its first shipment, and Katie Passaretti, the system’s medical director of infection prevention, was first to get a shot.“I feel perfectly fine,” she said on Twitter, “Again, just a moment of cold,Michigan Medicine also received its doses, the system said on Twitter, noting they arrived at 9 a.m. local time.CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. are set to start vaccinating residents of nursing homes and assisted-living facilities on Dec. 21, using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. They are partnering with the federal government in the effort.Walgreens expects to receive shipments of Pfizer’s vaccine over the weekend so it can start administering, Rina Shah, the company’s group vice president of pharmacy operations, said in an interview Monday.The CDC plans to document receipt and integrity of the vaccines as they are delivered, according to Kristen Nordlund, a spokeswoman for the agency. “In addition,” she added, “these visits will allow the government to gather important information on the early shipments so we can continually improve the process.”Moderna ShotAnother shot, from Moderna Inc., could be made available as soon as the end of this week. Food and Drug Administration advisers are set to review the company’s application on Thursday.Moncef Slaoui, the scientific head of Operation Warp Speed, said in Monday’s briefing that the data on the Moderna vaccine is “remarkably aligned” with the data seen on the Pfizer-BioNTech product.Once it’s authorized for emergency use, distribution of Moderna’s vaccine will be more flexible, with smaller package sizes. The goal will be for the first of about 6 million Moderna shots to be available this time next week, Perna said. And as with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the administration plans to hold back some of the shots for unknown contingencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-weapon-to-win-the-war-us-hospitals-get-initial-covid-19-shots/story-a7vk4oJW14om2rX75gFHCO.html

The World Health Organization, he said, had been informed of the variant, which is unlikely to cause more serious disease than others.He said: “We have identified a new variant of coronavirus, which may be associated with the fastest spread in the south-east of England. Initial analysis suggests that this variant is growing faster than the existing variants”.“We’ve currently identified over 1,000 cases with this variant, predominantly in the south of England, although cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas, and numbers are increasing rapidly”.Also Watch | USA starts Covid vaccination; London scare; Sputnik V new trial report A city under Tier 3 is subject to the tightest restrictions, including the closure of pubs, cafes and restaurants; inability to mix indoors, in private gardens or in most outdoor venues, except within a household or bubble.Indoor entertainment venues - such as bowling alleys and cinemas - must also stay closed, and people are advised not to travel to and from Tier 3 areas. The review of the alert system was due on Wednesday, but was advanced due to the spike in new cases.Hancock called or continued vigilance in what he called “the final stretch”, since “it is not over yet…there is not a moment to spare”, but noted that the mass vaccination programme has begun, besides increased testing.Besides Greater London, the new areas under Tier 3 are parts of Essex and Hertfordshire.London mayor Sadiq Khan said: “The surge in coronavirus cases across our capital is deeply concerning…If the Government does decide to introduce further restrictions in London this week, the economic impact on businesses could be catastrophic with hundreds of thousands of livelihoods at stake”.“2020 has been a dismal year for our once-thriving hospitality sector and world-famous cultural scene, which both contribute billions to our economy and attract millions of visitors.

15-12-2020||India||Minor girl delivers baby, brother among 4 booked for rape in Raj||Jaipur: Police on Monday booked four people, including the victim’s brother, for allegedly raping a minor girl in Rajasthan’s Nagaur district. The matter came to light after the girl went to a hospital in Ajmer, where she gave birth to a child on Sunday night. “The girl is 14 years old and studying in Class 10. She is unmarried. The girl and her family reached the Zanana Hospital, where the doctors, after safely delivering her baby, informed us that the mother is a minor,” said Narotam Singh, station house officer of the Padukalan police station. Singh added that the minor and her child were under police and medical supervision. Based on the girl’s statements, her brother and three other villagers were booked under the stringent Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act (Pocso). “When the doctors and female police personnel talked to the minor about what happened, she was hesitant in revealing anything. But we took her into confidence, after which she told us that her brother, who is also minor, a boy living in her neighbourhood, and two other relatives, had raped her multiple times,” Singh added. The SHO added that the condition of the victim and her child is stable, and their DNA samples have been taken for further investigation. Another police official familiar with the probe said the parents were initially lying to the police about involvement of the alleged accused.

15-12-2020||India||TMC rebel Adhikari may join BJP during Shah’s Bengal visit||Kolkata: Former cabinet minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislator Suvendu Adhikari is likely to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit to the poll-bound state later this week. Adhikari’s aides and BJP leaders said the decks were being cleared for his formal admission into the party. There has been strong speculation that he would switch over to the BJP since he challenged the TMC leadership last month and peace talks failed to bridge the differences. Shah will be in Bengal on December 19 and 20. He will address rallies in at least three districts, including East Midnapore where Adhikari, his father and two brothers represent two Lok Sabha constituencies and hold an assembly seat. They also run the civic body at Contai, their hometown. Adhikari was elected to the assembly from the Nandigram seat. “It has been decided so far that neither Shah nor party president J P Nadda will hand over the party flag to Adhikari in public to induct him into the BJP. This formality will be done by either Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh or some senior national leader,” a senior state BJP leader told HT on Tuesday. BJP’s national vice-president Mukul Roy, who left the TMC in 2018 and was instrumental in making many ruling party leaders switch camps, said: “Suvendu will join the BJP. It is only a matter of time.” The party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya called up Adhikari to wish him on his birthday. “It was a courtesy call. I wish him a long life,” Vijayvargiya told the media. Several old leaders of the state BJP, however, sounded skeptical and said they would speak on Adhikari only after he joins the party. “Suvendu had already made a deal with the BJP before we started the talks. Probably he has been promised the chief minister’s chair. He is extremely ambitious. But let him win the election first. We are ready,” TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy, who engaged in reconciliatory talks with Adhikari, told HT on Tuesday night. The 50-year-old rebel leader, who resigned from the cabinet last month and relinquished two administrative posts, is planning to visit Delhi on Thursday to talk to the BJP national leadership. His aides said he may resign from the assembly before joining the BJP. Adhikari avoided the media. TMC leaders said he did not contact the assembly speaker till 8 pm on Tuesday. Senior TMC leaders said in private that Adhikari was specifically unhappy with Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee and election strategist Prashant Kishor who was roped in by the chief minister after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Adhikari made significant remarks at a non-political programme on Tuesday morning. “Those who insulted me will face the same fate as Anil Basu, Benoy Konar and Laxman Seth when people cast their votes in a few months,” said Adhikari. The three CPI(M) leaders he mentioned faced electoral defeat and disciplinary action as well. “We are Indians first and Bengalis later…. We need governance that will be for the people, of the people and by the people. It should not be for the party, of the party and by the party,” said Adhikari at a programme held in Haldia to pay homage to noted freedom fighter Satish Samanta. Though Adhikari did not take names it was apparent that his target was the TMC as Mamata Banerjee and other leaders have recently started calling the BJP’s national leaders “outsiders” and accusing the latter of being ignorant about Bengal’s culture and heritage. “One must remember that the land agitation at Nandigram was a people’s movement and not that of an individual or any party…. I do not care about plum posts. Take a look. So many people have come here today although I have left the cabinet, ” Adhikari added. This statement was significant because Adhikari took the lead in steering the agitation against the acquisition of farmland which started after 14 villagers were killed in police firing at Nandigram on March 14, 2007. The land movement, which was held under the banner of Bhumi Uchhed Pratirodh Committee (BUPC), a platform against land acquisition that even the Maoists supported covertly, helped Banerjee overthrow the Left Front government. The chief minister, who addressed rallies at Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar in north Bengal on Tuesday, sent a signal to dissident leaders without naming Adhikari. “There is no place (in TMC) for those who seek opportunity in other camps after being in the government for a decade,” she said. Incidentally, Mihir Goswami, the TMC legislator from the Cooch Behar South constituency, joined the BJP in Delhi on November 27, the day Adhikari stepped down from the cabinet in which he held three departments, including transport. “Adhikari will announce himself when he will join the BJP. The TMC and Prashant Kishor will soon witness many more joining the saffron camp because of the policies being followed by the ruling party,” said Kanishka Panda, an Adhikari aide who was expelled from the TMC two days ago. He was the TMC’s general secretary in East Midnapore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-rebel-adhikari-may-join-bjp-during-shah-s-bengal-visit/story-C1jzYMT6GH0RGPdI2alX5M.html
15-12-2020||India||Pranab’s son, daughter at odds over his new memoir||NEW Delhi: Days after publishing house Rupa announced the planned launch next year of late former President Pranab Mukherjee’s final volume of memoirs, his son and former Lok Sabha member Abhijit Mukherjee has demanded that the publication be stopped until he approves it, triggering a war of words on Twitter with his younger sister Sharmishta Mukherjee , who supported the launch and mocked him for getting the title of the book wrong. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Mukherjee said the excerpts from the book that were released by the publisher were “motivated” and the former President would not have approved of them.Hindustan Times reached out to executives at the publishing house, but they declined to comment publicly on the matter for now. On condition of anonymity, one executive told Hindustan Times that President Mukherjee had approved not just the final draft of the manuscript, but also the cover design a day before he was admitted to hospital.Mukherjee was admitted in hospital on August 10 for a surgery to remove a clot in his brain . A former Congress politician who served as the 13th President of India from 2012 to 2017, he also tested positive for the coronavirus disease on being admitted to the hospital. Mukherjee died on August 31 at the age of 84.Rupa released some excerpts of The Presidential Years on Friday in which he blames Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the party’s devastating loss in the 2014 general elections. In the book, he also writes that Prime Minister Narendra Modi employed an autocratic style of governance during his first term in power.“While Dr Singh was preoccupied with saving the coalition, which took a toll on governance, Modi seemed to have employed a rather autocratic style of governance during his first term, as seen by the bitter relationship among the government, the legislature and the judiciary,” he wrote in the book, according to the released excerpts. “Only time will tell if there is a better understanding on such matters in the second term of this government.”Abhijit Mukherjee tweeted: “I , the Son of the author of the Memoir “ The Presidential Memoirs “ request you to kindly stop the publication of the memoir as well as motivated excerpts which is already floating in certain media platforms without my written consent,” He addressed publisher Kapish Mehra to say: “Since my father is no more, I being his son want to go through the contents of the final copy of the book before its publication as I believe , had my father been alive today, he too would have done the same.He added: “request you to immediately stop its publication without my written consent till I go through its contents ! I have already sent you a detailed letter in this regard which will reach you soon.’’His sister also took to Twitter to support the launch of the memoirs, oppose his demand to stop its publication and mock hem gently.“I, daughter of the author of the memoir ‘The Presidential Years’, request my brother @ABHIJIT_LS not to create any unnecessary hurdles in publication of the last book written by our father,” she wrote on Twitter. “He completed the manuscript before he fell sick.The final draft contains my dad’s hand written notes & comments that have been strictly adhered to. The views expressed by him are his own & no one should try to stop it from being published for any cheap publicity. That would be the greatest disservice to our departed father ,’’ she wrote. ``Btw bro, the title of the book is ‘The Presidential Years’, not ‘The Presidential Memoirs’,’’ she concluded.A former official of Rashtrapati Bhawan who interacted with both during his presidency said the siblings shared “a difficult relationship’’. When her brother dismissed women protestors against the December 2012 gangrape and murder of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student as “dented and painted’’ women, Sharmishta Mukherjee was critical of him. And while Sharmishta Mukherjee stayed with her father in Rashtrapati Bhawan, Abhijeet Mukherjee would only visit the presidential residence, said the official, who didn’t want to be named..The book, due for publication early next year, is part four of Mukherjee’s memoirs, the first of which was published in 2014, when he was still in Rashtrapati Bhawan. The executive quoted above said the former President had first signed an agreement with Rupa in 2013. The latest book contract was signed in 2018, he said, adding: “Mr Abhijit Mukherjee was nowhere in the picture.”.Another officialwho worked with the former President confirmed to Hindustan Times that Mukherjee had approved the latest volume’s publication, adding that Sharmishta Mukherjee, who is also a Congress member, was much more in the loop on the contents of the book than her brother. The Congress Party has not responded so far to the published excerpts of the memoirs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pranab-s-son-daughter-at-odds-over-his-new-memoir/story-GttIyQ1uc49DBCqWSqt93H.html
15-12-2020||India||Farmers misguided by Oppn, laws fulfil their demands: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday attacked opposition parties and farmers’ organisations spearheading protests against three new laws enacted by his government to open up trade in agriculture, saying farmers were being misled about the reforms.Modi expressed surprise at the protests triggered by the reforms his government introduced in September. Some opposition parties and farmers’ unions had all along demanded such measures, which couldn’t be implemented in the past, he said at Dhordo in Kutch, Gujarat. “The farmers are being misled about the agricultural reforms. They are being fooled into believing that others will occupy their lands,” Modi said in Hindi. “These reforms are exactly the same that farmers’ organisations and even the opposition have been asking over the years,” he added. A massive farmers’ protest was set off by three laws pushed through by the government in September that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules. Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices. Protesters decided to call off further negotiations on December 8 after a meeting with home minister Amit Shah, claiming a stalemate. Farmers, mainly from north Indian states, have massed at the entry points to the national capital.Reacting to Modi’s comments, farmers’ unions camping on Delhi’s borders accused the government of lacking any sympathy for the farming community.“We elected the PM and gave him the power to speak and yet he didn’t speak for us in the past 20 days,” said Yudhvir Singh Sehrawat, general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait), Modi was in Kutch to lay the foundation stone for the world’s largest hybrid renewable energy park, a desalination plant and a fully automated milk processing and packaging plant. Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani accompanied him.In his speech, the Prime Minister said: “Those in the opposition and misleading farmers today were all for these very reforms during their rule, but they could not take a decision. Today, when the country has taken a historical step, they are misleading the farmers.” He added, “The government of India is always committed to the welfare of the farmers and we will keep on reassuring the farmers and addressing their concerns.” Modi interacted with local farmers, including Sikh cultivators who have been living near the Indo-Pakistan border in Kutch since Independence. Some 5,000 Sikh families live in and around the Lakhpat region. He also met representatives of a local self-help group. The Gujarat chief minister was also present. Asking researchers to look at Kutch as a case study, the Prime Minister recalled the devastating 2001 earthquake in the desert district and said the people had overcome the disaster to transform iit into one of the country’s fastest developing regions.“Everyone rose from the destruction caused by the quake and see where they have brought Kutch,” he said, and referred to the renewable energy park he launched. It is one of the world’s biggest renewable energy farms with a capacity to generate up to 30,000 MW of power. “Gujarat was among the earliest to work on strengthening solar energy capacities. Today, Kutch has the world’s largest hybrid renewable energy park. It is almost as big as Singapore and Bahrain. It is built on 70,000 hectares of land, larger than many big cities in the country,” the Prime Minister said.He added that India featured in the top three among 144 countries in the Clean Energy Investment rankings. Modi said: “The country has shown a path to the entire world and is leading the fight against climate change.”Remembering Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 70th death anniversary, the Prime Minister said Patel’s statue, built in Kevadia in Gujarat’s Narmada district, was a source of inspiration for the people of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-misguided-by-oppn-laws-fulfil-their-demands-pm/story-4Eh1a5UupHnJVF1vzljAFO.html
15-12-2020||India||India, UK discuss 10-yr roadmap to boost ties||New Delhi: India and the UK on Tuesday agreed on key elements of a 10-year roadmap to enhance their relationship and pledged to take forward talks on a free trade agreement against the backdrop of Britain looking to enhance its trade ties amid its troubled exit from the European Union (EU). During talks between visiting UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab and his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar, the two sides decided to work on common challenges and shared opportunities across the Indo-Pacific. Raab said Britain’s upcoming integrated strategic review will contain an “Indo-Pacific tilt” and there is “no stronger partner” in the East than India. The British side accepted the Indian government’s invitation to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to be the chief guest at next year’s Republic Day celebrations. Jaishankar said Johnson’s presence will symbolise a new phase of the relationship. This will be the sixth time a British leader will be the chief guest at the celebrations, and the honour was last extended to UK prime minister John Major in 1993. Tuesday’s four-hour-long discussions between the foreign ministers focused on enhanced cooperation in five areas – connecting people, trade, defence and security, climate change and health – and the two sides also discussed the situation in Afghanistan, evolution of the Indo-Pacific, developments in the Middle East and challenges posed by terrorism and radicalism. “We agreed on key elements of a 10-year UK-India roadmap so that we can deliver a step change in ambition for the relationship between our two countries. We look forward to taking this forward in 2021, including through UK’s presidency of the G7 and presidency of the UN climate change conference,” Raab said. People familiar with developments said the India-China border standoff figured during discussions on the regional security situation. With the UK seeking to build stronger trade ties around the world amid its messy exit from the EU and difficulties in forging a post-Brexit trade deal, Raab said the end of the transition period will allow Britain to regain control of the ability to strike free trade agreements with the rest of the world, especially in the Indo-Pacific. “What we recognise is the possibilities for a deeper trading relationship [with India and] we see a very powerful strategic case. So I think we will want to nudge our trade negotiators along and see what we can achieve,” Raab said, and his remarks were endorsed by Jaishankar. Jaishankar added the trade ministers of the two sides have already had discussions on a trade deal and “there is a serious intent to take our trade relationship forward”. Raab said bilateral trade was growing at 11% before the Covid-19 pandemic and investments by the two sides supported more than 500,000 jobs in both countries. The two sides will work towards an “enhanced trade partnership” next year with the hope that it will be a “stepping stone towards a free trade agreement”, he said. Referring to the Indo-Pacific as a region with growth opportunities for several decades, Raab – the first foreign minister to make a bilateral visit to India in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic – said both countries have shared interests and challenges in this region, including maritime security, vulnerability of supply chains and climate change. The UK’s integrated strategic review will point to an “Indo-Pacific tilt”, he said, adding: “There will be no stronger partner as we look further to the east than India.” Jaishankar added: “The Indo-Pacific is a reality because...it is an articulation of globalisation, the fact that you can’t deal with different theatres in a watertight way. The kind of challenges the world faces today – climate change, maritime security, terrorism [and] the opportunity to increase connectivity – all these require a larger arena and more coordinated efforts.” Raab also highlighted the UK’s desire to build a stronger defence and security partnership with India to tackle shared concerns such as terrorism and maritime security, and to focus on new challenges such as making the telecommunications and 5G networks “more secure and resilient”. The two sides also discussed ways to hasten post-Covid-19 economic recovery, including innovation and facilitating the flow of talent, and the equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. Principal scientific advisor K VijayRaghavan, who coordinates India’s vaccine response, also participated in the meeting. The Serum Institute of India has partnered with global pharma giant AstraZeneca to produce the University of Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine for low-and-middle income countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-uk-discuss-10-yr-roadmap-to-boost-ties/story-MoFm01on3PyHcg5h2vS3sO.html
15-12-2020||India||Celebrating sunshine in a dimly lit world||On Human Rights day, every person is reminded of the basic rights, everyone is inherently entitled to as a human being irrespective of race, colour, religion, sex, language, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. This year, Vartika Nanda organised the Tinka Tinka India Awards- 2020 on Human Rights Day, awards aimed at the contribution of jail inmates and staff. She says, “Due to the pandemic, everything was virtual. This is the first time that inmates joined live and shared their thoughts in the presence of senior jail officials.”This year, the theme was the one thing that has hijacked imaginations all over the world, ‘Corona in Jail.’ Vartika says, “ There were 3 categories this year, namely Painting, Special Mention and Prison Administration. 7 inmates received awards in the Painting category while 6 were chosen for their special contribution to prison life. Prison staff was awarded too.”40-year-old Amitabh Bachchan incarcerated in District Jail, Firozabad was chosen for his extraordinary work as a Health Warrior. He has been sanitizing the jail since the onset of Covid-19. And on the other hand, 53-year-old Ajay Chauhan from District Jail Mainpuri was chosen for his extraordinary work in Prison Jail radio, helping inmates fight depression during the pandemic. Ashok Kumar, logged in Model Jail, Chandigarh made the maximum number of masks during Covid-19. Vartika says,”Their hard work and efforts need to be respected and brought to light and these inmates received a special mention through the Tinka Tinka awards.”The prison officials were given the honour for their performance in reformative and rehabilitative activities being run for the welfare of inmates.The award was dedicated to Late Raj Kumar Tripathi who lost his life while doing his duty as Deputy Superintendent in District Jail, Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh. Aniraj Tripathi, his son, says, “Tinka Tinka is a novel initiative to value the sacrifice of prison staff, an area which is usually ignored. My dad is a corona warrior in the real sense. In such professions, interaction with the public is more and that is when he contracted the virus.”In a time like this, when the world needs to come together, more than ever before, this initiative brings together the wholesome efforts carried out for the sake of humanity and is a tribute to inmates and the jail staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/celebrating-sunshine-in-a-dimly-lit-world/story-uPrCIR53FksrhFG845ocGK.html

He added two major major highway projects – Amritsar-Ajmer and Delhi-Amritsar-Katra - worth Rs 65,000 crores were also being planned.Also read: PM Modi to ‘keep assuring farmers’, blames Opposition for misleading themGadkari also stated that while the pandemic has adversely affected the MSME sector, the Government has undertaken the right policy interventions, including the change in MSME definition, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, Credit Linked Capital Subsidy Scheme and the MSME cluster development programme to make the sector self-reliant.“With the global realignment taking place, the MSMEs would play a great role in redefining their contribution to the Indian economy. The Government has plans to expand the contribution of the MSMEs from the current 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the GDP,” the minister further added.Underscoring the importance of aligning with Global Value Chains (GVCs), Gadkari added that as 80 per cent of global trade happens through the GVCs, and most enterprises involved in GVCs are medium enterprises, the government has taken several steps in this direction, including the adoption of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to strengthen the sector and also boost global exports.Gadkari also noted that reforms such as reduction of corporate tax rates, 100 per cent tax exemption to investors, and implementation of GST have positioned India as a competitive market in the world, particularly in terms of ease of paying taxes.The minister added that the government is committed to providing a favourable environment and a transparent policy framework for investors and that he is confident that India will become a major global investment destination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-rs-100-lakh-cr-worth-infrastructure-projects-underway-by-2024-25-gadkari/story-Q1kb0cEQHy2oUE83Vbz5VO.html

This decision follows a judgment pronounced by the top court two months ago where the Court noted that even if the shared household is a joint family property where the husband has no legal right or share, the same shall still be treated as a shared household for the wife to continue staying put.The present case threw a rather interesting clash between two special laws – Protection of Women from Domestic Violence (PWDV) Act, 2005, which seeks to protect wives facing domestic violence, and the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act 2007, created to protect senior citizens by providing a speedy and inexpensive remedy to secure their interests at an advanced stage of life.Also read: PM Oli races to get new anti-graft watchdog boss, heads for a showdown with PrachandaThe bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee analyzed both laws and found that Section 3 of the 2007 Act had an overriding effect over any other law. It was this argument that the aged parents of the husband used to obtain an eviction order against their daughter-in-law from their Bengaluru home. The Karnataka High Court had on September 17, 2019, upheld the order of eviction against the daughter-in-law who approached the Supreme Court in appeal.Coming to her rescue, the bench said, “Section 3 of the Senior Citizens Act, 2007 cannot be deployed to over-ride and nullify other protections in law particularly that of a woman’s right to a shared household under Section 17 of the PWDV Act 2005.”The bench observed that both pieces of legislation are intended to deal with salutary aspects of public welfare and interest. However, the definition of ‘shared household’ was exhaustive, the bench observed, quoting the October 2020 judgment passed by the top court while dealing with similar facts where the wife was sought to be evicted through a trial court decree by the aged in-laws who owned the house in question.Justice Chandrachud, writing the judgment for the bench, said, “The law protecting the interest of senior citizens is intended to ensure that they are not left destitute, or at the mercy of their children or relatives. Equally, the purpose of the PWDV Act 2005 cannot be ignored by a sleight of statutory interpretation. Both sets of legislations have to be harmoniously construed.”The bench protected the petitioner wife and ordered that neither the husband nor her in-laws would forcefully try to evict her from her shared household for one year till she avails her remedies under the PWDV Act.Also read: PM Modi to ‘keep assuring farmers’, blames Opposition for misleading themThe Court said that in similar situations where a wife obtains relief from a tribunal under the Senior Citizens Act, she shall be duty-bound to inform the Magistrate hearing her case under the PWDV Act.In the present case, as the appeal in divorce proceedings between the husband and wife is pending, the Court directed the restoration of electricity connection for non-payment of dues and asked the husband to continue paying the electricity charges. The residential house of the petitioner is situated at Hobli in Bengaluru North. The suit against the petitioner was instituted by her mother-in-law under the Senior Citizens Act in 2015. Prior to this, in December 2013, a trial court decreed divorce and in March 2014, the petitioner sought maintenance and even appealed before the High Court against the divorce decree which is still pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aged-parents-can-t-resort-to-senior-citizens-act-to-evict-daughter-in-law-sc/story-6GUuHvJW5aJzsYmnJvSZ4O.html

Sisodia said it is very important to inculcate the habit of reading stories in children from an early age. Stories help children develop a mindset and enhance their reading ability, he said at the launch of Katha’s new reading portal.“This is why we have used stories to improve the level of reading in children in Delhi’s government schools through schemes like ‘Chunauti’ and ‘Mission Buniyaad’. The Katha Institute has contributed immensely in these efforts,” Sisodia said.“With this new e-portal launch, it’s important to note that it won’t just be available in India, but will be accessible for children all over the world. With children finding themselves stuck inside the walls of their homes, it’s even more integral that they have access to fun and meaningful stories, especially during the ongoing Covid-19 crisis,” he said at the virtual event. Sisodia also added that the Delhi government has used storytelling in Happiness and Entrepreneurship curriculums. “We are able to convey positive messages to children and make them understand the challenges of the country and the world through these stories,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-deputy-chief-minister-manish-sisodia-launches-reading-portal-for-children/story-Ej0QVqwLq6CdtwH0jEFqOO.html

It has smashed the national unity to pieces, shamelessly inciting Hindus against Muslims & now desperately setting peace-loving Punjabi Hindus against their Sikh brethren esp #farmers. They’re pushing patriotic Punjab into communal flames” Badal alleged in a tweet.The SAD had quit the National Democratic Alliance over the issue of farm laws. SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal had also resigned as Union minister.Later in a statement, Badal alleged that the BJP has been “splitting the country into pieces by setting one community against another.” “So desperate is it for the power that it has no scruples about taking the communal polarisation route and setting the country on communal flames,” he alleged. “The BJP first set Hindus against Muslims. Now, it is determined to replay the same evil game and re-enact the same tragedy in Punjab also,” he alleged.“It is conspiring to set our peace-loving Hindu brethren in Punjab against their Sikh brethren with whom they have shared strong bonds of blood for centuries. The BJP wants to replace those bonds of blood with bloodshed,” he further alleged.He warned the BJP against any attempt to incite “brothers” against each other.The SAD chief accused the saffron party of resorting to “dangerous conspiracies to sabotage the hard-earned atmosphere of peace and communal harmony just for the realisation of petty political goals.” “The BJP leadership must realise that their party today has become the most powerful divisive force. It has been resorting to dividing the country and its people by spreading hatred in the name of religion,” he alleged.The Shiromani Akali Dal chief asked the BJP-led Centre to shun its “arrogant attitude”.“Those who framed (farm) laws were never involved in farming activities. The central government acts on what its officers say,” he added.Referring to the ongoing farmers’ agitation over the three farm laws, Badal said, “The whole country except the BJP gratefully acknowledges the debt which we owe to our patriotic farmers and soldiers.” “The BJP is provoking the people to deny that debt. It believes only in emotionally exploiting farmers’ sacrifices but remains so ungrateful to them that it is painting them as anti-national. “Today it is against farmers. Nobody knows what the BJP might say even about soldiers tomorrow if it suits them. The farmers are hurt and angry against the BJP,” he alleged.Badal said it is shocking and unbelievable that a party which claimed to take pride in India’s heritage is determined to “destroy” the foundations of that very heritage.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and elsewhere have been protesting near various border points of Delhi including Singhu and Tikri for over a fortnight demanding the Centre repeal three new farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-out-to-set-hindus-against-sikhs-in-punjab-sukhbir-badal/story-GSDeExx9JDH1cqqP3EbsbL.html

The youngster started her career as a child model. Now at 23, Digangana feels she has come a long way. “I have been very decisive individual. If I decide anything to do, I always give it a try and just don’t give up projects due to factors like age, lingo, run-time or be anything else. Life gives us a very few opportunities and I feel we as humans should give it our best shot always,” says the protagonist of the daily soap, ‘Ek Veer ki Ardas…Veera’ that gave her the first big break. Talking about her acting journey, Digangana said, “It has been a fulfilling stint where I did commercials, music albums, reality shows, daily soaps and films. I love acting and enjoy being in-front of the camera since childhood as I always wanted to be on TV, (laughs). For me seeing myself on TV was such a delight and then it also gave me instant recognition and upper hand among my age kids. I was 11 when my first major show as a child artiste, ‘Shakuntala,’ happened, followed by regional music albums and then more TV shows and films.”Digangana, who is busy with a number of interesting projects, said, “I’m busy with number of things but the most awaited one for me is, ‘The Battle of Bhima Koregaon. It’s a war drama film and I play the lead. I’m super excited as film is set for a 2021 release. Besides, Telugu films too have been keeping me busy and I enjoy acting irrespective of barriers like region, country or language.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-always-enjoy-being-in-front-of-camera/story-qFZrqs8mqlAdvEx8R5EscL.html
15-12-2020||India||29,000 cold chain points, 41,000 deep freezers among govt’s storage plans for Covid-19 vaccine||The Union ministry of health on Tuesday announced the Centre’s plans for cold storage chains as it prepares for a large-scale vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across the country. It includes 29,000 cold chain points, 240 walk-in coolers, 70 walk-in freezers, 45,000 ice-lined refrigerators, 41,000 deep freezers and 300 solar refrigerators which will be available for vaccine storage, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Tuesday.Bhushan said, during a press brief, that guidelines for estimation of electrical and non-electrical cold chain equipment and their strengthening have been issued to states by the Centre. The guidelines for management of cold chain at last cold chain points and session sites have also been issued, he said. “All these equipment have already been delivered to the states. Some other equipment is being supplied,” he said.Training modules for people handling the vaccinations like medical officers, vaccinator officers, alternative vaccinator officers, cold chain handlers, supervisors, data managers and ASHA coordinators have commenced both physically and via digital platforms. Moreover, the National and State Training of Trainers (ToTs) workshops have also been completed, he added.Bhushan also talked about adverse effects of the vaccine, especially in pregnant women and children. “Adverse events following immunisation is a critical issue. When we undertake a universal immunisation program, which has been done for decades, then some adverse effects are seen in children and pregnant women after vaccination,” he said.The health secretary advised states and Union territories to be prepared to handle such situations since these effects had already happened in the UK on the first day of their vaccination drive. He also said that 23 ministries and departments in the Centre and states have been identified and assigned roles like planning, implementation, social mobilisation, awareness generation, among others, for the vaccine roll-out.The announcement comes a few days after the Centre said that the vaccination drive was only a few months away. Union minister of state for health Ashwini Kumar Choubey said that initially only 100 people per day would get the shot but eventually everyone would be vaccinated. “We are going to start the process of sending necessary equipment for storage and handling of coronavirus vaccine to states. For now, only 100 people will be given the vaccine at a booth per day. Eventually, everyone will get the vaccine,” he said.The vaccine carriers, vaccine vials and ice packs are to be strictly kept out of direct sunlight as per the ‘Covid-19 Vaccine Operational Guidelines’. “There may not be vaccine vial monitors (VVM) and Date of Expiry on the label of Covid-19 vaccine, this should not discourage vaccinators from using the vaccine. At the end of the session, the vaccine carrier with all ice packs and unopened vaccine vials should be sent back to the distributing cold chain point,” the guidelines stated.Officials have said that 36 states and Union territories have already concluded meetings of State Steering Committees and State Task Force and 633 districts have concluded those of District Task Force.According to the guidelines issued to states recently, the Covid-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) system--a digitalised platform--will be used to track enlisted beneficiaries for the vaccination and anti-coronavirus vaccines on a real-time basis.The vaccine will first be offered to all healthcare and frontline workers, and the people above the age of 50. For the elderly, there may be subdivisions like people between the ages of 50 and 60 and those above 60, with the priority being given to the more vulnerable as per the availability of the vaccine. The vaccination of 300 million people has been planned in the first stage of the drive. India currently has 9,906,165 confirmed coronavirus infections and 143,709 deaths.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/29-000-cold-chain-points-41-000-deep-freezers-among-govt-s-storage-plans-for-covid-19-vaccine/story-OFXQG4fDwqOXGoYSh7iivM.html

15-12-2020||India||UK to become only country whose leaders have been chief guests at Republic Day on 6 occasions||UK prime minister Boris Johnson will be the sixth British leader to be chief guest at India’s Republic Day celebrations, and the honour was last extended to former prime minister John Major in 1993.The UK is also set to become the only country which has been accorded this honour six times. So far, the heads of state or government of only France and Britain have been the chief guests at the celebrations on five occasions. In 1956, UK chancellor of the exchequer Richard Austen Butler was the joint chief guest at the parade on January 26 along with Japan’s chief justice Kotaro Tanaka. Members of the British royal family were the chief guests in the 1950s and 1960s – Prince Philip in 1959, Queen Elizabeth in 1961 and Lord Louis Mountbatten in 1964. At the time, Mountbatten was the UK’s chief of defence staff.After a gap of almost three decades, prime minister John Major was the next British leader to be chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations in 1993.Also read: India, UK to forge 10-year roadmap for ties, push talks on trade dealThe chief guest for the Republic Day celebrations is chosen in keeping with India’s strategic, diplomatic and economic interests, as well as New Delhi’s relations with the concerned country. The decision on the chief guest is usually locked in by late November, though the process this year was affected by the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The head of state or government of India usually intends to announce the invite in advance to get their concurrence before a formal invitation is extended through diplomatic channels.Visiting UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab confirmed, during a joint media interaction with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar, on Tuesday that prime minister Johnson had accepted the Indian government’s invitation to be chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-to-become-only-country-whose-leaders-have-been-chief-guests-at-republic-day-on-6-occasions/story-CUxiNUC2WJ7lSnIdDz163J.html

15-12-2020||India||Govt for wider consultations before allowing postal ballots for NRIs||The government is yet to take a decision on allowing the use of postal ballots for eligible overseas Indians to cast their votes as the move will need wider consultations with all stakeholders before a final call is taken, sources said on Tuesday. They also said that the Election Commission’s proposal to amend election rules to allow the use of postal ballot by overseas Indians, whose names figure in electoral rolls in India, is still at a bureaucratic level and is yet to be discussed with the political executive. The EC has proposed to the government to extend the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System (ETPBS) facility, so far available to service voters, to eligible overseas Indian voters. In a letter to the legislative secretary in Law Ministry on November 27, the Commission said with the successful execution of ETPBS in case of service voters, it is now “confident” that the facility can also be extended to the overseas electors. “The Commission is technically and administratively ready to extend this facility in general elections to legislative assemblies of Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,” the poll panel said. Elections in these states are due sometime in April-June next year. EC said it has been receiving several representations from Indian diaspora residing abroad to facilitate voting through postal ballots since such overseas electors are not in a position to be present in their polling area as travelling to India for this purpose is a costly affair and otherwise also they cannot leave the country of their residence owing to specific compulsions of employment, education or other engagements. “Due to protocols associated with Covid-19, the problem further gets compounded,” the letter to the Law Ministry said. The Commission observed that Section 62 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 envisages the right to vote for every citizen registered in the electoral roll who is not subject to disqualification for voting. “Therefore, it is necessary to explore all avenues to enable exercise of a franchise by all eligible electors,” it said. As of now, overseas Indians are free to cast their votes in constituencies they are registered. Unofficial data with the EC shows that only 10,000-12,000 overseas voters have exercised their franchise because they do not want to spend foreign currency to come to India and vote. Under ETPBS, the postal ballot is sent electronically to a service voter. The service voter downloads it and uses a specific envelope to return it to the returning officer of his constituency. The postal ballot should reach the returning officer by 8.00 am on the day of the counting. Counting of votes begins with the counting of postal ballots at 8.00 am. Personnel of armed forces posted outside their constituencies in forward areas, personnel of central armed police forces posted outside their constituencies, state police personnel posted on poll duty and embassy staff are considered as service voters. The EC has suggested amending the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 to extend ETPBS for overseas electors. The rules were amended in October 2016 to allow service voters to use ETPBS. ETPBS has nearly halved the time in sending and receiving postal ballots from far-flung areas. The Conduct of Election Rules was also changed to allow those who are 80 years of age or above and those with disabilities to use the postal ballot to cast vote. The same facility was extended for Covid-19 patients. But this postal ballot facility is different from ETPBS. For overseas electors, EC has said the voter will have to intimate the returning officer that he or she wants to use the postal ballot. The returning officer will then electronically transmit the ballot paper to the voter by means specified by the EC. The Commission has requested the government to make necessary amendments at the earliest “which will go a long way in not only facilitating the exercise of the right of overseas electors but also further  boosting the image of the country internationally.” A bill to extend the facility of proxy voting to overseas Indians had lapsed following the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha in 2019. The bill had proposed that overseas Indians, who are entitled to vote in India, can appoint a proxy voter to cast the ballot on their behalf. An expert committee of the Election Commission, working on the issue, had in 2015 forwarded the legal framework to the Law Ministry to amend the electoral laws to allow the overseas Indians to use proxy voting. The bill said the necessary provision of coming to India to cast a ballot caused hardship for overseas electors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-for-wider-consultations-before-allowing-postal-ballots-for-nris/story-26Hq9c8sokQx3V996OY5kK.html
15-12-2020||India||Kolkata Municipal Corporation polls likely in March 2021, says official||Elections to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) may be held in March 2021 ahead of the crucial state assembly polls, top officials of the West Bengal State Election Commission said. “As per the Supreme Court’s directive, the state government has sent a communication to us saying that the KMC polls may be held within four weeks after the final electoral roll is adopted by the SEC,” said a senior official of the poll panel.While the summary revision for the electoral roll is going on, the final roll would be published by the Election Commission of India on January 15, 2021. It would take around a month after that for the SEC to adopt the final roll. Polls may be held four weeks after the SEC’s adoption. Elections to more than 107 civic bodies, including KMC, have been pending for over a year and these bodies are currently being run by administrators appointed by the Mamata Banerjee-administration. “The Trinamool Congress (TMC) knows very well that it won’t be able to win the municipal elections and hence was delaying it. But now on the orders of the SC it has to declare the dates,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of BJP’s Bengal unit. While the Calcutta High Court had observed that the pending elections should be held as soon as possible, the state needs to inform the Supreme Court this week about its stand on conducting civic polls. “As the scope of the case is related to KMC elections, we have no communication from the state government yet as to when polls for the other municipal bodies would be held,” said the SEC official. The TMC party, however, sounded confident about winning the civic polls and said that the party is not afraid of exams.“We have worked throughout the year and hence we are not afraid of any exams. Let the polls be held at any time of the year,” said Bratya Basu, state minister and TMC leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-municipal-corporation-polls-likely-in-march-2021-says-official/story-W2TVrrhuITOLNvpRf4R0xJ.html

The commerce and industry minister also expressed confidence in the capabilities of the business community as well as startups which can make India the top economy globally in the next 25-30 years.  “But the challenge is for us to accept. When we celebrate 100 years of Independence in 2047, can we all not resolve to be the number one economy in the world?,” Goyal said at a virtual conference organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce. Today the world is looking at India as a trusted partner in its quest for resilient global supply chains, he pointed out.  “If we don’t grab this opportunity today, posterity will never ever forgive us. It is our duty. Each one of us has to take this opportunity, make Aatmanirbhar Bharat our mantra, our inspiration, our goal,” Goyal said.  The minister observed that by being ‘aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant), India was not closing its engagement with the world, but on the contrary, expanding its participation globally. “We should import modern technology, equipment which can help us do the job better, produce to scale, better quality, better productivity standards, cost competitive manufacturing in India,” Goyal said.  By leveraging all this, India can become the “factory of the world, just like we are today recognised as the pharmacy of the world,” he added.  “We will all work as one, work as a team, industry and government have to partner to truly ensure that we reach our 5 trillion dollar economy target by 2025, 10 trillion dollar maybe in another seven-eight years after that,” the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/industry-government-have-to-partner-for-india-to-become-usd-5-trillion-economy-by-2025-goyal/story-mVPX0cHbbmUJTv7XRtKzdK.html

The second goal would be to increase the efficiency of the existing space on the roads, it said.There will be measured and planned spaces for vehicles, non-motorised vehicles, footpaths, and side-lanes. The footpaths will be widely mapped to an average of 10 feet for the convenience of pedestrians and will be redesigned and reconstructed as per a standard height for the convenience of the physically handicapped, it said.The project will also enhance greenery and address the issue of road dust.There will be separate spaces for the planting of trees on the sides of the footpaths, it said. The slope of the roads, as well as the drains, will be redesigned to tackle the problem of waterlogging on the roads.Rainwater harvesting structures will be built inside the drainage systems to store rainwater as groundwater, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-roads-to-be-redesigned-on-lines-of-european-cities-cm-kejriwal/story-E1poczHSSy1aqUH5XJS6bP.html

If our ideology is similar and if it would benefit the people, we are ready to set aside our ego and co-operate with each other,” Haasan told reporters on being asked if he would join hands with Rajinikanth.Haasan had previously hinted at the realignment of political alliances in Tamil Nadu ahead of the assembly elections next year while not ruling out a possible tie-up with actor Rajinikanth, who is set to float his party soon.The South-India origin actor launched his campaign for the 2021 Tamil Nadu assembly elections on December 13, embarking on his first phase of the campaign between December 13-16. During this four-day schedule, Haasan is expected to cover Madurai, Theni, Dindugul, Virudhunagar, Tirunelveli, Tuticorin and Kanniyakumari districts.Haasan had launched MNM in February 2018 and the party had faced last year’s Lok Sabha elections but could not return any MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-a-phone-call-away-kamal-haasan-on-joining-hands-with-rajinikanth/story-6a43reH2PdqNm1YYC5alYP.html
15-12-2020||India||PM Modi to ‘keep assuring farmers’, blames Opposition for misleading them||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday mounted a scathing attack on the Opposition parties and farmer organisations, asserting that there was a conspiracy being hatched “in and around Delhi” to confuse the agitating farmers.The PM said the opposition protesting against the very laws wanted to implement the same during their rule but could not.“(The agitating) farmers are being misled about the agriculture reforms. They are being fooled into believing that others will occupy their lands,” said the PM speaking in Hindi at Dhordo in Kutch in Gujarat after laying the foundation stone of the world’s largest hybrid renewable energy park, a desalination plant and a fully automated milk processing and packing plant.The Prime Minister went on, without naming any party, “Those in the opposition and misleading farmers today were all for these very reforms during their rule, but they could not take a decision. Today when the country has taken a historical step, they are misleading the farmers.” He added, “The Government of India is always committed to the welfare of the farmers and we will keep on reassuring the farmers and addressing their concerns.” On the sidelines of the function, Modi also held an interaction with the local farmers, including Sikh cultivators who have been staying near the Indo-Pakistan border in Kutch since Independence. Some 5,000 Sikh families live in and around the Lakhpat region. He also met representatives of a local self-help group. The Gujarat Chief Minister was also present. Asking researchers to look at Kutch as a case study, the Prime Minister recalled the devastating 2001 earthquake in the desert district and said the people there had converted tragedy into hope. PM Modi counted Kutch among the country’s fastest developing regions.“Everyone rose from the destruction caused by the quake and see where they have brought Kutch,” he said, and referred to the renewable energy park he launched. This is one of the world’s biggest renewable farms with capacity to generate up to 30,000 MW of power. “Gujarat was among the earliest to work on strengthening solar energy capacities. Today Kutch has the world’s largest hybrid renewable energy park. It is almost as big as Singapore and Bahrain. It is built on 70,000 hectare land, larger than many big cities in the country,” the Prime Minister said.He added that India featured in the top three among 144 countries in the Clean Energy Investment rankings. PM Modi said, “The country has shown a path to the entire world and is leading the fight against climate change.”Remembering Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 70th death anniversary, the Prime Minister said Patel’s statue in Kevadia in Narmada district was a source of inspiration for the people of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-keep-assuring-farmers-blames-opposition-for-misleading-them/story-6wDpUYsHNyDWfgRocBULaL.html

The farmers are squatting on the border to press for their demand to repeal the three farms laws.On Monday night, the protesting farmers had their food on the blocked national highway and they slept in tents and vehicles.Kisan Panchayat national president Rampal Chaudhary is also camping in Shahjahanpur demanding the withdrawal of the farm laws.  Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the legislations would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-farmers-continue-blockade-at-jaipur-delhi-highway/story-y1TTFazAlsaZ3EpfmGo8DI.html

15-12-2020||India||India, UK to forge 10-year roadmap for ties, push talks on trade deal||India and the UK on Tuesday agreed on key elements of a 10-year roadmap to enhance their relationship and pledged to fast track talks on a free trade agreement against the backdrop of Britain looking to enhance its trade ties amid its troubled exit from the European Union. During talks between visiting UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab and his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar, the two sides decided to work on common challenges and shared opportunities across the Indo-Pacific. Raab said Britain’s upcoming integrated strategic review will contain an “Indo-Pacific tilt” and there is “no stronger partner” in the east than India. The British side accepted the Indian government’s invitation to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to be the chief guest at next year’s Republic Day celebrations. Jaishankar said Johnson’s presence will symbolise a new phase of the relationship. This will be the sixth time a British leader will be the chief guest at the celebrations, and the honour was last extended to UK prime minister John Major in 1993. Tuesday’s four-hour long discussions between the foreign ministers focused on enhanced cooperation in five areas – connecting people, trade, defence and security, climate change and health – and the two sides also discussed the situation in Afghanistan, evolution of the Indo-Pacific, developments in the Middle East and challenges posed by terrorism and radicalism. “We agreed on key elements of a 10-year UK-India roadmap so that we can deliver a step change in ambition for the relationship between our two countries. We look forward to taking this forward in 2021, including through the UK’s presidency of the G7 and presidency of the UN climate change conference,” Raab said. The two sides had agreed to prioritise the finalisation of an “ambitious, 360-degree roadmap” for upgrading relations that will be adopted during Johnson’s visit in January, the external affairs ministry said. People familiar with developments said the India-China border standoff figured during discussions on the regional security situation. With the UK seeking to build stronger trade ties around the world amid its messy exit from the European Union (EU) and difficulties in forging a post-Brexit trade deal, Raab said the end of the transition period will allow Britain to regain control of the ability to strike free trade agreements with the rest of the world, especially in the Indo-Pacific. “What we recognise is the possibilities for a deeper trading relationship [with India and] we see a very powerful strategic case. So I think we will want to nudge our trade negotiators along and see what we can achieve,” Raab said, and his remarks were endorsed by Jaishankar. Both sides, “recognised the importance of fast tracking the discussions on a trade deal” and concluding a comprehensive migration and mobility partnership agreement to facilitate movement of students and professionals, the external affairs ministry said. Jaishankar added that the trade ministers of the two sides have already had discussions on a trade deal and “there is a serious intent to take our trade relationship forward”. Raab said bilateral trade was growing at 11% before the Covid-19 pandemic and investments by the two sides supported more than 500,000 jobs in both countries. The two sides will work towards an “enhanced trade partnership” next year with the hope that it will be a “stepping stone towards a free trade agreement”, he said. Referring to the Indo-Pacific as a region with growth opportunities for several decades, Raab – the first foreign minister to make a bilateral visit to India in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic – said both countries have shared interests and challenges in this region, including maritime security, vulnerability of supply chains and climate change. The UK’s integrated strategic review will point to an “Indo-Pacific tilt”, he said, adding: “There will be no stronger partner as we look further to the east than India.” Jaishankar added: “The Indo-Pacific is a reality because...it is an articulation of globalisation, the fact that you can’t deal with different theatres in a watertight way. The kind of challenges the world faces today – climate change, maritime security, terrorism [and] the opportunity to increase connectivity – all these require a larger arena and more coordinated efforts.” Raab highlighted the UK’s desire to build a stronger defence and security partnership with India to tackle shared concerns such as terrorism and maritime security, and to focus on new challenges such as making the telecommunications and 5G networks “more secure and resilient”. The two sides also discussed ways to hasten post-Covid-19 economic recovery, including innovation and facilitating the flow of talent, and the equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. Principal scientific advisor K VijayRaghavan, who coordinates India’s vaccine response, also participated in the meeting. The Serum Institute of India has partnered with global pharma giant AstraZeneca to produce the University of Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine for low-and-middle income countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-uk-to-forge-10-year-roadmap-for-ties-push-talks-on-trade-deal/story-c9Jb9Bwtkrv7VYJk1xEyYI.html

15-12-2020||India||Six Covid-19 vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials in India||Informing that the Drugs Controller General of India has granted clearance for the clinical trials of one more candidate vaccine from India, NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr VK Paul on Tuesday said six vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials in the country.“This week, the Drugs Controller General of India granted clearance for clinical trials for one more candidate vaccine from India. Genoa company, with the help of Government of India’s research agency Department of Biotechnology, has developed a vaccine,” Dr Paul said while addressing a press conference here.He said the technology used in this is the same as the Pfizer vaccine.“Unlike Pfizer vaccine or some others, this vaccine -- if it comes into existence -- will be maintainable at normal cold chain conditions, in a normal fridge. At this time, six vaccines are undergoing clinical trials in this nation,” Dr Paul said.The NITI Aayog member also expressed concern over Covid-19 spread amid the ongoing farmers’ protest at the borders of the national capital. “We should take precautions, messages have been sent to them (farmers) from the government. Democracy process should continue but we should also continue to follow Covid-19 guidelines,” he said.Lauding the states and Union Territories who recently brought down the spike in Covid-19 cases, Dr Paul said they are happy to note that Delhi has made progress.“We congratulate the Government of Delhi as well as other governments who have done so well in contributing towards such a significant control in recent times. There are states where we still have concerns. We request the government and citizens of Uttarakhand, Nagaland and Himachal Pradesh that every effort be made to bring the situation under control,” Paul said.Health and Family Welfare Ministry Secretary Rajesh Bhushan, addressing the press conference, said the number of cases per million population in India continues to be amongst the lowest in the world.“29,000 cold chain points, 240 walk-in coolers, 70 walk-in freezers, 45000 ice-lined refrigerators, 41,000 deep freezers and 300 solar refrigerators will be used. All these equipment have already reached state governments,” Bhushan said.He said the number of COVID-19 cases in India is at 7,178 per million population, whereas the global average for the same is at 9,000. He also expressed concern over the adverse effects of immunisation and suggested the states and Union Territories to prepare for the same.“Adverse events following immunisation is a critical issue. When we undertake a universal immunisation programme, which has been done for decades, then some adverse effects are seen in children and pregnant women after vaccination,” Bhushan said.“So, we can’t deny chances of an adverse event when Covid vaccination begins. In countries, where immunisation has already begun, especially in the UK, adverse events took place on the very first day. So, it is essential that states and UTs prepare for this too,” he added.This comes as the total number of Covid-19 cases in India reached 99,06,165 with 22,065 new cases and 254 new death, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said earlier today. So far, a total number of 1,43,709 people have died due to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-covid-19-vaccines-currently-undergoing-clinical-trials-in-india/story-I3Rq3DwmWNkFpuVMJK6XGM.html
15-12-2020||India||Govt says Covid-19 cases, deaths declining in India; cautions against any laxity||Covid-19 cases and deaths are declining in India which is very reassuring, the Centre said on Tuesday but cautioned against any laxity saying an overwhelming proportion of the country’s population is still “very very susceptible” to the virus and the situation may escalate unexpectedly.While there is a continuous increasing trend in Covid-19 cases and deaths globally, particularly in America and Europe and the situation in the world is becoming worrisome, in contrast the scene in India is satisfying as the cases and deaths are declining, Dr V K Paul, member (health) at NITI Aayog, told a press conference here.“Mortality is declining and it is well below 400 per day. Cases have come down to almost 22,000. This is the kind of number we all experienced in July. So that is very reassuring. As a nation, we seem to be now doing very well.“We are saving lives. But remember, this cannot be taken for granted. An overwhelming proportion of our population is still very very susceptible to the virus. And the situation can escalate unexpectedly,” Paul said while cautioning against any laxity.He further said the reassuring thing is that people are saying the R0 has come below one which means the pandemic is shrinking. “So we should be happy about that but cautiously happy,” he said.Noting Delhi has made progress, he said, “We congratulate the government of Delhi as also all the other governments who have done so well in contributing towards such a significant control (in cases) in recent times.” Paul, however, expressed concern over the Covid-19 situation in some states like Uttarakhand, Nagaland and Himachal Pradesh and stated all efforts to control the spread are being made in collaboration with these governments. Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that more than 15.55 crore tests have been conducted so far for detection of coronavirus infection in the country, and the cumulative positivity rate has come down to 6.37 while the average daily positivity rate during last week was 3.00 per cent.India’s Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is also among the lowest in the world. At present, India’s CFR is 1.45 per cent, whereas globally it is 2.26 per cent, Bhushan said. Speaking about the preparation for the Covid-19 vaccination drive, Bhushan said guidelines for estimation of electrical and non-electrical cold chain equipment and their strengthening have been issued to states. Guidelines for management of cold chain at last cold chain points and session sites have been issued.At least 29,000 cold chain points, 240 walk-in coolers, 70 walk-in freezers, 45,000 ice-lined refrigerators, 41,000 deep freezers and 300 solar refrigerators will be used for the Covid-19 vaccination drive.States have been asked to identify at least one adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) management centre in each block.“Adverse events following immunisation is a critical aspect. Even during universal immunisation programmes, which have been going on for decades, some adverse effects are seen in children and pregnant women after vaccination. “So, we can’t deny the possibility of an adverse event when the Covid-19 vaccination begins. The countries where inocolution has already started, especially in the UK, adverse events took place on the very first day. So, it is essential that states and union territories prepare for this too,” Bhushan said.Detailed instructions on infection prevention and control practices during vaccination and management of minor, severe, serious adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) have been issued to states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-says-covid-19-cases-deaths-declining-in-india-cautions-against-any-laxity/story-G4IZ9RTW4NQ5Webnt3PsrO.html
15-12-2020||India||Green buildings movement should become people’s movement: Vice President Naidu||Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday appealed to finance commissions and local bodies to encourage green buildings through various measures including tax incentives. He also wanted all states to create online portals to provide single-window clearance to green buildings. Virtually inaugurating the 12th GRIHA (Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment Summit) from Hyderabad, the vice president said India has the potential to lead the global green building movement and emphasised the need to promote green building concept by both the private sector and the government. Recognising that there is a lack of awareness among people about the green building concept, he also called for the launch of a mass media campaign on the advantages of building green homes. “Green buildings movement should become people’s movement,” the vice president said, according to an official statement. Quoting World Green Building Council data, Naidu said buildings and construction account for 39 per cent of energy-related CO2 emissions in the world and called for accelerating the process of total de-carbonisation of the built environment. Noting that the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan’ envisions making India self-reliant in all spheres, the vice president emphasised the need for sustainable development and wanted awareness to be increased among the people. Calling buildings as one of the major contributors of greenhouse gas emissions, Naidu said there is a need for concerted and coordinated efforts from all stakeholders to ensure that the buildings are environment-friendly and energy and resource-efficient. “The construction material we use today should be sustainable -- it should not in any way jeopardise the ability of future generations to meet their needs,” he added. He expressed happiness over several government and private bodies committing to build their future buildings greener. The vice president wanted every future building to go green mandatorily and said that this should apply to all kinds of building. Not only new buildings, the existing buildings too have to be retrofitted to make them environment-friendly, he felt. Observing that ancient civilisational values teach us to live in harmony with nature, he called for revisiting traditional and nature-friendly house designs refined over thousands of years by ancestors. “Unfortunately, our modern structures are such that no sparrow can come and make a nest in our house. This is not our culture,” he pointed out. Warning that climate change is real and impacting people, Naidu called for a balance between economic development and environmental protection. Economy and ecology can coexist if one respects nature, he said. He said that the current year has been a tumultuous one due to the Covid-19 pandemic and a number of natural calamities in the form of floods, droughts and other extreme weather events. Thus, there is an absolute need to “reorient our approach to development as the decisions we make today will have repercussions far beyond our own lifetimes”, he warned. Noting that least half of the country’s population will live in towns and cities by 2050, the vice president said that this will create a lot of pressure on housing sector and green solutions will have to be developed to meet the emerging needs. Noting that roof cooling should be an area of priority for all, Naidu said in India, over 60 per cent of roofs are made from metal, asbestos, and concrete -- thus trapping heat inside buildings and contributing to heat island effect in urban areas. Observing that cool roofs offer a simple and cost-effective solution that can lower indoor temperatures by 2 to 4 degrees Celsius as compared to traditional roofs, the vice president said that these can be very effective for low-income households and slums in urban areas. Stating that need for air conditioners is expected to rise substantially with improvement in living standards and rise in temperatures due to global warming, he said that cool roofs can reduce the heat stress in homes and offices and bring down the dependence on air conditioners. Simple techniques such as lime-based paint, reflective coatings or membranes can reflect the sunlight and reduce heat absorption, he suggested. Emphasising the need to utilise light and air that is naturally available, Naidu said that the Covid-19 pandemic has taught the importance of good air circulation in the buildings reducing the infection rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-buildings-movement-should-become-people-s-movement-vice-president-naidu/story-UDmdgRgswXTH9k9PaM1cII.html
15-12-2020||India||Pranab Mukherjee’s son does not want his book published. Daughter disagrees||Days after publishing house Rupa announced the launch next year of late President Pranab Mukherjee’s final volume of memoirs, a difference of opinion seems to have emerged between his children. His son and former Lok Sabha member Abhijit Mukherjee has demanded that the publication be stopped until he approves the final manuscript. His daughter and Congress spokesperson Sharmistha Mukherjee took to Twitter to declare that not only was the book approved by their father but that Abhijeet should refrain from “cheap publicity”.It all began on Tuesday afternoon when the former MP from Bengal addressed a series of tweets to the publisher of Rupa Books Kapish Mehra. Referring to the excerpts of the book that were released on Friday, Mukherjee said they were “motivated” and the former President would not have approved of them.Hindustan Times reached out to executives at the publishing house, but they declined to comment publicly on the matter for now. On condition of anonymity, one executive told Hindustan Times that President Mukherjee had approved not just the final draft of the manuscript, but also the cover design a day before he was admitted to hospital.Watch l Pranab Mukherjee’s son & daughter spar over former President’s memoir Mukherjee was admitted to hospital on August 10 for a surgery to remove a clot in his brain after he fell down at his Rajaji Marg residence in Delhi. A former Congress politician who served as the 13th President of India from 2012 to 2017, he also tested positive for at the same time. Mukherjee died on August 31 at the age of 84.Rupa had released some excerpts of The Presidential Years on Friday, in which he blames Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the party’s devastating loss in the 2014 general elections. In the book, he also writes that Prime Minister Narendra Modi employed an autocratic style of governance during his first term in power.“While Dr Singh was preoccupied with saving the coalition, which took a toll on governance, Modi seemed to have employed a rather autocratic style of governance during his first term, as seen by the bitter relationship among the government, the legislature and the judiciary,” he wrote in the book, according to the released excerpts. “Only time will tell if there is a better understanding on such matters in the second term of this government.”In his tweets on Tuesday, Abhijit Mukherjee addressed publisher Kapish Mehra to say: “Since my father is no more, I being his son want to go through the contents of the final copy of the book before its publication as I believe, had my father been alive today, he too would have done the same. He added “request you to immediately stop its publication without my written consent till I go through its contents ! I have already sent you a detailed letter in this regard which will reach you soon”.Even before Rupa had worked out how to respond to this, Pranab’s daughter countered her brother’s attempt to suppress the publication. “I, daughter of the author of the memoir ‘The Presidential Years’, request my brother @ABHIJIT_LS not to create any unnecessary hurdles in publication of the last book written by our father. He completed the manuscript before he fell sick. The final draft contains my dads’ hand written notes & comments that have been strictly adhered to. The views expressed by him are his own & no one should try to stop it from being published for any cheap publicity. That would be the greatest disservice to our departed father,” she wrote. “Btw bro, the title of the book is ‘The Presidential Years’, not ‘The Presidential Memoirs’,’’ she concluded.A former official of Rashtrapati Bhawan who interacted with both during his presidency said the siblings shared “a difficult relationship’’. In the past too, Sharmistha has not been afraid to criticise her brother when he dismissed women protesters of the December 2012 gangrape as “dented and painted’’. While Sharmishtha stayed with her father in the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Abhijit would visit, said the aide.The book, due for publication early next year, is part four of Mukherjee’s memoirs, the first of which was published in 2014, when he was still at the Rashtrapati Bhawan. The executive quoted above said the former President had first signed an agreement with Rupa in 2013. The latest book contract was signed in 2018, he said, adding: “Mr Abhijit Mukherjee was nowhere in the picture.”An official who worked with the former President confirmed to Hindustan Times that Mukherjee had approved the latest volume’s publication. He confirmed that Sharmishta was much more aware about the contents of the book than her brother, the official said. The Congress Party said that this issue had nothing to do with the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pranab-mukherjee-s-son-does-not-want-his-book-published-daughter-disagrees/story-qO4Ilf3oH3xUX5QGMzxhaP.html

He said he and Raab focused on five broad themes — connecting people, trade and prosperity, defense and security, climate change and health.The two sides also discussed the situation in Afghanistan, the evolution of the Indo-Pacific region and developments in the Middle East, Jaishankar said. “As democratic polities, market economies and pluralistic societies, we can, we should and we will make a difference to the realization of a rules-based global order,” he said.Raab, who arrived in India on Monday, said Britain wants to deepen its economic partnership with India. “We are committed to building a stronger defense and security partnership with India that will help us tackle shared issues related to terrorism and maritime security,” he said.He also said that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had accepted India’s Republic Day celebrations invitation on January 26.“As a key player in the Indo-Pacific region, India is an increasingly indispensable partner for the United Kingdom as we work to boost jobs and growth, confront shared threats to our security and protect our planet,” Johnson said in a statement released by his office.India and Britain have enjoyed a strategic partnership since 2004, marked by regular high-level exchanges and cooperation in diverse areas. According to official statistics, India’s trade with Britain in 2017 and 2018 was worth $14.5 billion.Raab’s three-day visit to India comes at a time when Britain is ramping up trade with leading economies and also holding complex negotiations with the European Union on reaching a post-Brexit trade deal.“The foreign secretary comes at a very important time because we are looking at a post-Covid world and also looking at a post-Brexit world from the perspective of the UK,” Jaishankar said.Raab will also meet with Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar and Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-foreign-secretary-holds-talks-with-indian-counterpart/story-aDHaIXUYwARNphPsti0PXN.html
15-12-2020||India||‘No proposal from BJP on ministers’: Nitish Kumar on cabinet expansion||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday said that he has not received any proposal for the induction of new ministers from the BJP, adding that the cabinet expansion would be discussed whenever the proposal comes from the senior ally in the NDA.“We have not received any proposal of inducting new ministers from the BJP so far. Whenever it comes, the matter would be discussed and then a reshuffle would be done,” CM Kumar said to reporters after supervising the expansion project of a new airport at Bihta.There has been a buzz in political circles that the cabinet expansion had got delayed because of internal factors within the coalition with the BJP becoming the senior partner on the back of more MLAs. The JD(U) having 43 MLAs is now a junior ally in the NDA coalition.The CM’s statement today has given credence to the perception that the two big allies in the NDA government would only go for the next reshuffle only after the number of new ministers from each of the alliance partners is decided and the distribution of the portfolios is thrashed out.However, many feel, the cabinet expansion exercise getting delayed would impact governance and decision making process in administrative set up as a large number of departments at present are being headed by a single minister. Sources said many of the ministers are only doing routine jobs, shying away from taking big decisions in anticipation of a cabinet expansion.Right now, the state cabinet has only 14 ministers, including the chief minister, with the scope of induction of 21-22 ministers. The maximum number of ministers allowed in the state cabinet is 36. In the previous NDA government, there were 33 ministers with the JD(U) having more ministers than the BJP based on the numerical strength of the two parties in the lower house.There are chances the JD(U), having four ministers, could increase its strength to maximum 14, while the BJP, having seven ministers, could increase its strength of ministers to 18-20. The possibility of two smaller allies, Hindustani Awam Morcha( Secular) and Vikassheel Insaan Party ( VIP) getting one more ministerial berths each would depend on whether the JD(U) and BJP are agreeable to the proposition. At present, VIP and HAM(S) have one minister from each side.Meanwhile, BJP’s state spokesperson Sanjay Singh Tiger said the cabinet expansion would take place at an opportune time emphasising that the CM had rightly inferred that the inductions of new ministers would be done through discussions among allies. “It is a prerogative of the CM to take a call on cabinet expansion. It is pertinent the exercise would be done at an opportune time through consultations among partners. There is no dispute or friction of any sort among the allies in the NDA,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-proposal-from-bjp-on-ministers-nitish-kumar-on-cabinet-expansion/story-4lYO8ansQT9rF97g4Ix9yM.html

During the drive, authorities will fine violators as much as Rs 10,000, which is compoundable to Rs 5,500 under the amended Motor Vehicle Act.As per the order by the court and government, affixation of HSRPs and colour-coded fuel stickers are mandatory in Delhi. Vehicles registered prior to April 1, 2019, must have the HSRPs and sticker installed while new vehicles registered after the date come equipped with both. However, vehicles that have already applied for HSRP and colour-coded stickers will not be fined on a condition to present the application slip, to be received after the registration. As of now, this is applicable to vehicles registered in Delhi only, other states are not included in this.What is HSRP number plate?HSRPs are chromium-based hologram plates made with a laser-branded permanent identification number, which cannot be copied.

Patel was a leader of the Congress party, a lawyer by profession and as the first home minister and deputy prime minister of India, he is credited largely with the unification of the princely states in India after independence from the British.Here’s a look at his life and how India remembers him:• Born in Nadiad, Gujarat on October 31, 1875, Patel finished his schooling in his native city in the year 1897, following which he decided to pursue a course in Law.• He achieved significant success as a defence lawyer and his interest grew in the field and in 1910, he sailed for Britain to continue his studies as a Barrister.• Upon completion of his studies in Britain, Patel returned to Indian in 1913 and continued practising law in Ahmedabad in Gujarat, where he got initiated into the then political system in 1917, as the sanitation commissioner.• Patel was a prominent presence in all the protests and satyagrahas against the British, during which his association with Mahatma Gandhi began to grow. In his entire political career, Patel accepted the leadership and ways of Gandhi during the independence struggle.• Patel spearheaded many protests during peak Swarajya or the self-rule movement. He also presided over the 46th session of Congress in 1931.• Post Independence, Patel was handed the home ministry and also became the first deputy PM of India. His efforts in strengthening the Union by integrating multiple tiny and large princely states earned him the title ‘Iron man of India’ and for which he is remembered till date.• He also contributed largely to restoring peace and order in regions that were ravaged by communal violence and mass migrations during the India Pakistan partition.• His birthday on October 31 is celebrated as National Unity day or Ekta Diwas to honour his contributions in unifying India.• To mark his significance during the independence struggle and his contributions to independent India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Statue of Unity, a colossal statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on October 31, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iron-man-of-india-remembering-sardar-vallabhbhai-patel-on-his-death-anniversary/story-cCeGuUEFQT89YPebFwvlWL.html
15-12-2020||India||International group to hold red-list assessment of grasshopper species in Nilgiri biosphere reserve||A specialist group of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) would conduct a first of its kind red-list assessment of grasshopper species in Nilgiri biosphere reserve in south India followed by other parts of the country. The assessment, to be done by IUCN’s Species Survival Commission (SSC), Grasshoppers Specialist Group, would study the ecosystem by taking grasshoppers as its indicators, and also steps for their conservation. Dhaneesh Bhaskar, vice-chair, IUCN’s SSC, Grasshoppers Specialist Group, said the assessment will help in understanding the condition of the grasshopper’s ecosystem. “The grasshoppers are primarily considered as agricultural pest which is not true as they live in all sorts of environments except those covered in snow. They are basically the indicators of the ecosystem and environment which means their survival status explains a lot about the environment they are living in,” said Bhaskar. Also read | New grasshopper species discovered after 116 years, named after 28-year-old Indian biologistHe said the project will be started from the Nilgiri biosphere reserve spread in three states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. “We have made a list of at least 30 species of grasshoppers which live in the forests of Nilgiri including the ones living on trees, ground and those which are semi-amphibious. We would study their present survival status and then chalk out actions for their conservation, if needed,” said Bhaskar. The project is funded by United Arab Emirates-based Mohammad Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, which works for the conservation of different species across the world. “The assessment project in Nilgiri biosphere reserve will be started in 2021 and will be completed in two years. Once we complete it in Nilgiri forests, we would extend it to the other parts of the country where grasshoppers are found,” said Bhaskar. Axel Hochkirch, chairman, IUCN SSC Invertebrate Conservation Committee and based in Trier University, Germany, who is also looking after the project, said the assessment will be “helpful in the conservation of grasshopper species”. Interacting over e-mail from Germany, he said, “Red list assessment is of fundamental importance for nature conservation as it helps to identify species with high extinction risk. Without this knowledge, it will not be possible to save species from conservation.” “For the IUCN red list of threatened species, which is the most widely accepted system for measuring extinction risk of species, we collect all information on the distribution, population, habitat preferences, threats and conservation activities. For many species, this information might not be readily available for which field studies are needed, like the one in Nilgiri,” said Hochkirch. He said that international body will follow the “Assess-Plan-Act principle” in the assessment. “The principle comprises assessing the conservation status of species and identifying major threats, planning necessary conservation action based on the red list assessments and implementing the conservation action,” said Hochkirch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-group-to-hold-red-list-assessment-of-grasshopper-species-in-nilgiri-biosphere-reserve/story-MoN6aUqQjs69h06uY2avEL.html

15-12-2020||India||Why it is challenging to end British-era revenue policing in Uttarakhand’s hilly areas||Uttarakhand is the only the state in the country where nearly 60 % of the area is still under revenue police, a system introduced by the British in 1861, in which revenue officials act as cops with the right to arrest an accused and investigate cases. The system was brought in when crime in the hilly areas was low. However, the state continued with the system even after it was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000. But now, many feel that revenue police has become obsolete. The issue of bringing all the areas under regular police has come up again after state home secretary Nitesh Jha said a three-member committee has been formed to look into this matter. Jha spoke about it while announcing a series of reforms for modernisation of the state police department in the next few years. The committee comprises senior retired IAS officers Madhukar Gupta and Indu Pandey, and recently retired director general of police Anil Raturi. Though Jha said that a decision on the issue would be taken soon, keeping in mind the committee suggestions, police officers and experts claim it won’t be easy to end the system.A senior police officer at the state police headquarters in Dehradun, while advocating the need to end the revenue police system, said, “The Britishers had introduced the system because there used to be hardly any crime in the hilly areas. The situation remained the same till about a decade ago. But now, there have been serious crimes there also...revenue police fails to crack them and then, those cases go to regular police,” said the officer who didn’t wish to be named. “If cases have eventually to be given to regular police only, why not end the revenue police completely? The regular police is all prepared to take over the areas presently under revenue police,” he said. Another senior police officer claimed it is more of an IAS vs IPS issue. “The state police has told the government that it is prepared to take over the areas under revenue police. But there is an IAS vs IPS factor also. The IAS lobby thinks that with the revenue police system, the control of more than half the state is with them and not the police. But there should be a uniform policing system in the state,” he said. Aloke B Lal, retired director general of police Uttarakhand, however, said that, “More than the IAS vs IPS factor, it’s the lack of political will to end the revenue police system.” “In my opinion, there should be one police system in the whole state. But there is a lack of political will. It’s because many think the revenue police is somewhat easy to bend but not the regular one,” said Lal. He added, “The issue has even gone before the Uttarakhand high court which also stated that it is unfortunate that a large part of the state is deprived of a regular policing system due to the revenue police. The whole state has to come under the modern police.” On the three-member committee, he said, “One of its members, retired DGP Raturi, has studied the issue in detail and would surely make the other two members agree to end the revenue police system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-it-is-challenging-to-end-british-era-revenue-policing-in-uttarakhand-s-hilly-areas/story-OXyXnf0r3ghHgznL6rigEN.html
15-12-2020||India||In IIT-Madras Covid spike, positive cases rise to 183||IIT-Madras, which has turned into a Covid-19 hotspot, added 79 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, taking the total number to cases to 183 in December. As many as 953 residents on campus have been tested. “With this testing has been completed,” said a spokesperson for the institution. “Next round of testing for everyone will be after ten days.”Until Monday, 104 people had tested positive - 87 are students, 16 staff from the mess and one resident. They were all being treated at King’s Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research. “We had X-ray and CT-scan of RT-PCR positive patients (as of Monday) and they are all mild and stable,” health secretary J Radhakrishnan told HT. Incidentally, the health secretary’s family members were also treated for Covid-19 at the King’s Institute and discharged in August. He shared this with the students and residents who are under quarantine at the campus to allay their fears. “We decided to test everyone which may increase numbers but it will prevent the spread,” Radhakrishnan said. We have once again alerted all collectors and education institutions to be careful in closed spaces like hostels and common mess which seem to be a source of spread to avoid an IIT-like situation. Two fever cases have also been reported in Anna University.”Sporadic cases were reported in early December which eventually led to a spike. The food is now being sent to their rooms. The institution has temporarily shut down its academic departments and research labs. Nine hostels on campus have reported positive cases and a high number of cases were predominantly reported from two hostel units named Krishna and Jamuna. A postdoctoral student who has been in the campus hostel since March was one of the hundreds of students who was tested on Monday and she was awaiting her results. “I’ve not gone to the mess because it is overcrowded as only one mess was open. I’ve been ordering from outside,” the student said, not wishing to be named. “A second mess was opened after December 9. Another reason is that day scholars were coming into the campus from outside so there are possibilities that they were exposed.”On Monday, the Covid-19 positive cases crossed 8 lakh in Tamil Nadu. The virus has so far infected 8,00,029 people and killed 11,909. A total of 7,78,081 people have been discharged. In a statement issued late Sunday, the institute said that it has been functioning on limited capacity with only 10% students in the hostels. “IIT Madras has been permitting research scholars who need to do experimental work to return to campus in a cautious manner - with a 14-day quarantine and testing of each returnee,” their statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-iit-madras-covid-spike-positive-cases-rise-to-183/story-ktfBaiauPlx0FvGdKUApVP.html

The incident occurred on Hyderabad-Kadapa national highway at Yerraguntla village of Sirivella block at around 5am. The deceased were between 8 and 15 years of age.Five of the injured, including two minor girls, who suffered multiple fractures and serious head injuries were shifted to government hospital Kurnool. The remaining injured, including six minors, are being treated at Nandyal government hospital, district collector G Veerapandian told reporters. He said a group of 40 Christians was walking on one side of the highway, singing carols as part of Christmas celebrations, when a lorry going from Hyderabad to Mydukuru (in Kadapa district) lost control and ran into them. “While three children died on the spot, the fourth one died within an hour of being admitted to Nandyal government hospital,” Veerapandian said. Even after the accident, the lorry driver did not stop the vehicle but the police, with the help of locals, gave him a chase and caught up with him at Bathaluru near Allagadda. Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy expressed shock over the accident and directed the district officials to ensure that all the injured get timely treatment. The collector said he had deputed his joint collector and Nandyala sub-collector to monitor the treatment and relief operations. Kurnool superintendent of police Fakeerappa Kagninelli said the Nandyal police were investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lorry-crushes-4-children-to-death-leaves-12-others-injured-in-andhra-s-kurnool/story-E2gPGsl3bidLOlgUdk1iIJ.html
15-12-2020||India||Supreme Court refuses to transfer judge in Kerala actor Dileep’s case||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to admit the Kerala government’s petition to transfer a judge in a trial court hearing the sexual assault case against cine star Dileep.A three-judge bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar found no ground to hold bias against the judge for his comments. “You have picked up one statement of the judge to allege bias. What circumstances were created for making such statements…much depends on that. Where is the question of bias?” asked the bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the prosecution, told the court that in January the chargesheet was filed and a month later the prosecution moved an application for altering the charges. Till date, no decision has come on it. Further, he claimed that a fair trial is not possible in the present court as the eighth accused, actor Dileep, alias P Gopalakrishnan, moved a petition to send the cloned copy of the seized memory card for a second examination by the central forensic sciences laboratory (CFSL) without supplying the same to the prosecution or victim. The copy of the CFSL report was not shared with the prosecution prior to the cross-examination, the petition stated.“The procedure adopted by the presiding judge is to favour the eighth accused,” Kumar said, adding that on October 14 the presiding judge commented that what is happening in the court is not prosecution but ‘prostitution’. Before that, the judge ordered the prosecution witnesses not to meet the special public prosecutor. The prosecution further stated that the trial judge had remained a “mute spectator” when the victim was “harassed and intimidated” by the lawyers of the accused during cross-examination.The Supreme Court was not impressed by the allegations leveled by the state. “You are complicating your own case and creating pressure on the judge. Don’t make such allegations of bias. Let the courts function and judges do their job. As it is there is so much pressure and media hype created in this case and these allegations (of bias) will unnecessarily discourage the judge,” observed the bench.The state was given the option either to substitute the special public prosecutor or approach the high court if the application seeking alteration of charges against the accused is not taken up. “If the prosecutor is not comfortable, put someone else in his place but don’t make a grievance of bias against the judge,” said the court as it dismissed the appeal by the state government.The order, however, clarified that the dismissal of the state’s appeal will not come in the way of the state to pursue its pending application before the trial judge or seek redressal against the adverse comments made by the presiding judge. The state informed the apex court that it will require some time to replace the prosecutor appearing in the case.According to the prosecution, the incident took place in February 2017. The victim, who has worked in several South Indian films, was abducted and allegedly molested inside her car. The accused had forced their way into the car on the night of February 17, 2017 and even filmed the entire incident to blackmail the actor. In all, there were ten accused of which police arrested seven persons. Actor Dileep was subsequently arrested and joined as the eighth accused. He was released on bail in October 2017 after being incarcerated for close to three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refuses-to-transfer-judge-in-kerala-actor-dileep-s-case/story-gZQAxzlOMKN3Fu2oemltIO.html
15-12-2020||India||PM Modi says farmers surrounding Delhi have been misguided; blames Opposition||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday blamed the opposition for the ongoing stir by thousands of farmers, who have been protesting the three new farm laws by camping near Delhi’s borders, saying they have been misled.“People who are sitting in the Opposition and misleading farmers today were in the favour of these farm reforms during their government. They could not make a decision during their government. Today when the nation has taken a historical step then these people are misleading farmers,” PM Modi said.PM Modi was addressing the public after laying the foundation stone for a desalination plant and a milk processing and packaging plant in Gujarat’s Kutch.मैं किसान भाई-बहनों से फिर कह रहा हूं कि उनकी हर शंका के समाधान के लिए सरकार 24 घंटे तैयार है।किसानों का हित पहले दिन से हमारी सरकार की प्राथमिकता रहा है।- पीएम @narendramodi #KutchWelcomesPMModi pic.twitter.com/Y0akSWoCMm“The country is asking why small farmers who produce grains and pulses should not get the freedom to sell crops. Agricultural reforms were in demand for years. Many farmers’ organisations have also demanded in advance that they should be given an option to sell food grains anywhere,” PM Modi said backing the clauses from the recently-cleared laws by the government.“Today those who are confusing the farmers by sitting in the opposition, have supported these reforms in their time. They just kept giving false comfort to the farmers. When the country has taken these steps, they are now confusing the farmers,” he said.ALSO WATCH | Farmers’ protest: Top ministers warn ‘some elements’ trying to take advantage PM Modi said that a conspiracy is going on to confuse the farmers. “They are being scared that after new agrarian reforms, others will occupy the land of the farmers. You tell me, if a dairyman contracts to take milk from you, does he take your animal?” he asked.Extending support to the farmers via his address, PM Modi said, “I am again telling farmer brothers and sisters that the government is ready 24 hours to solve their every doubt. The interest of farmers has been the priority of our government since day one.”Thousands of farmers hailing from Punjab and Haryana have been protesting in and around the national capital demanding the repeal of three farm laws, alleging that it will reduce their earnings and will give larger control to the corporations.As the protests entered the 20th day, there have been no signs of a resolution to the standoff between the farmers’ unions and the government. So far, the government side - represented by agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, food minister Piyush Goyal and minister of state for commerce and industries Som Prakash have engaged in five rounds of negotiations with 40 farmer unions without any resolution.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the many thousands of farmers protesting at Delhi borders have expressed apprehension that it will pave the way for eliminating the minimum support price (MSP) cushion and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agriculture-reforms-are-exactly-what-farmers-unions-oppn-have-been-asking-for-over-years-says-pm-modi/story-UcLzpoxv8cpM0N53j2yvvM.html
15-12-2020||India||TMC heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari may join BJP during Amit Shah’s Bengal visit||Former cabinet minister and heavyweight Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislator Suvendu Adhikari is all set to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit to the poll-bound state later this week. Adhikari’s aides and BJP leaders told HT that decks are being cleared for his formal joining. There were strong rumours that he would switch over to the saffron camp ever since he challenged the TMC leadership last month and peace talks failed to bridge the differences. Shah will be in Bengal on December 19 and 20. He will address rallies in at least three districts, including East Midnapore where Adhikari, his father and two brothers represent two Lok Sabha constituencies and an assembly seat. They also run the civic body at Contai, their hometown. Adhikari is elected from the Nandigram seat. “It has been decided so far that neither Shah nor party president J P Nadda will hand over the party flag to Adhikari in public to induct him into the BJP. This formality will be done by either Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh or some senior national leader,” a senior state BJP leader told HT on Tuesday afternoon. Ghosh did not comment on the record on this. The 50-year-old rebel TMC leader, who resigned from the cabinet last month and relinquished two administrative posts, is planning to visit Delhi on Thursday to talk to the BJP national leadership. Senior TMC leaders said in private that Adhikari is specifically unhappy with Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee and election strategist Prashant Kishor who was roped in by the chief minister after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Adhikari made significant remarks at a non-political programme on Tuesday morning. “Those who insulted me will face the same fate as Anil Basu, Benoy Konar and Laxman Seth when people cast their votes in a few months,” said Adhikari. The three CPI(M) leaders he mentioned faced electoral defeat and disciplinary action as well. “One must remember that the land agitation at Nandigram was a people’s movement and not that of an individual or any party,” Adhikari said at the programme held to pay homage to noted freedom fighter Satish Samanta. Also Read: Mamata Banerjee in north Bengal to boost party’s morale, counter BJPHis statement was significant because it was Adhikari who steered the agitation against acquisition of land which started after 14 villagers were killed in police firing at Nandigram on March 14, 2007. The land movement, which was held under the banner of Bhumi Uchhed Pratirodh Committee (BUPC), a platform against land acquisition that even the Maoists supported secretly, helped Banerjee overthrow the Left Front government. “Adhikari will announce himself when he will join the BJP.

In a series of tweets, Mukherjee said that the excerpts that were released were “motivated” and that the former President would not have approved.Hindustan Times reached out to the publishers but they have refused to comment for now. However, an official on condition of anonymity confirmed to Hindustan Times that President Pranab Mukherjee had approved not just the final draft of the manuscript but had also approved the cover a day before he was admitted to hospital.Rupa had released some excerpts of The Presidential Years on Friday in which he blames Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the party’s devastating loss in the 2014 general elections. The book also states his opinion that Prime Minister Narendra Modi employed an autocratic style of governance during his first term in power.“Since my father is no more, I being his son want to go through the contents of the final copy of the book before its publication as I believe, had my father been alive today, he too would have done the same,’’ Abhijit Mukherjee tweeted to publisher Kapish Mehra. He then added “request you to immediately stop its publication without my written consent till I go through its contents ! I have already sent you a detailed letter in this regard which will reach you soon.’’ @kapish_mehra @Rupa_Books I , the Son of the author of the Memoir " The Presidential Memoirs " request you to kindly stop the publication of the memoir as well as motivated excerpts which is already floating in certain media platforms without my written consent .1/3The book slated for publication early next year is part four of Pranab Mukherjee’s memoirs which first came out in 2014, when he was in Rashtrapati Bhawan. The official quoted above said that the former President had signed the first agreement with them in 2013 and the latest book contract was signed in 2018. “Mr Abhijit Mukherjee was nowhere in the picture,’’ said the official.Another official who worked with the former President confirmed to Hindustan Times that President Mukherjee had approved the latest volume’s publication. They also confirmed that his daughter Sharmishta Mukherjee, who is also a Congress member, was much more in the loop than her brother. Hindustan Times reached out to her for comment but she is yet to respond.“While Dr Singh was preoccupied with saving the coalition, which took a toll on governance, Modi seemed to have employed a rather autocratic style of governance during his first term, as seen by the bitter relationship among the government, the legislature and the judiciary,” Mukherjee wrote in the book, according to the released excerpts. “Only time will tell if there is a better understanding on such matters in the second term of this government.”The Congress Party has not responded to the details of the book or its disclosures till now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stop-the-memoir-pranab-mukherjee-s-son-to-publishers-of-father-s-book/story-CK61xfk5fg8Z7W6AqniTEO.html

Speaking to ANI Union Minister Giriraj Singh said that the door of the government is open for the farmers and will remain open.“In a democracy, the solution is only through dialogue. But have you not seen on TV? not seen on channels? derogatory and objectionable comments against Prime Minister. Red flags have come which have nothing to do with farmers. The opposition is behind it for political survival. Those political parties who were in the ICU want to grab the farmers’ movement, want to usurp it. That is why they are not talking for the rights of the farmers,” Singh said.Union Minister hit out on Punjab Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh for doing “politics in the name of farmers” and said, “I want to ask the Chief Minister of Punjab, are private companies in your state not making contracts with farmers to grow potatoes? Did they usurp their land? Why did not you oppose this? Today Nestle is not taking milk from farmers in same Punjab? Our government intention is that farmers get better prices and opportunities.”The Minister said that the central government is committed for the betterment of the farmers.“I want to say that the Government of India is for the farmers. After independence, no Prime Minister has given Rs 6,000 to the farmers except PM Modi. The Government of India is devoted to farmers. The door of the government is always open for the farmers,” he added.Farmers have been protesting on different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The Central government has held several rounds of talks with farmers’ organisations over the past few days in an effort to resolve the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-behind-farmers-protest-for-their-political-survival-alleges-union-minister-giriraj-singh/story-0QBzmRwaqPDInL9ZHMV7wL.html

15-12-2020||India||Worst employer of women under MGNREGS, UP aims a turnaround||Uttar Pradesh is the worst performer in employment of women under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in the country. This year during the Covid pandemic, the state managed to employ a whopping 1.11 crore people under the scheme, but this workforce was dominated by men. Now, the state has decided to introduce all-women worksites and women-specific jobs. The state generated only 32.52% of women person-days of the 30.55 crore person-days of work generated this year. On 28th position, UP ranks lowest in the country with only J&K and Lakshadweep ranking even lower on women’s employment index under the MGNREGS. Kerala, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu are the top ranking states offering women work under MGNREGA with 91.41%, 87.04%, and 84.88% women person-days respectively. During these times of pandemic, with focus on maximising employment generation under MGNREGS, UP registered a whopping 87% increase in person-days generated against the previous year. But women’s share remained unchanged in the last five years. “Yes, over the last five years, women’s participation in the MGNREGS has consistently been low and lower than the national average,” said Yogesh Kumar, additional commissioner, MGNREGS, UP. The national average this year has been 52% women person-days and the MGNREGS UP headquarters has started working to address the issue. “We have zeroed in on some significant factors and have also prepared remedial strategies to attain 50-55% women participation in 2021-22,” said Kumar. He said: “Socio-cultural set-up and physical intensive works are inhibiting factors behind the low participation. Women do not like to work in men dominated worksites and on physically gruelling jobs. So, we have decided to introduce all-women worksites and women-specific works--such as plantation, gardening, nutrition gardens, nurseries or organic cultivations.” Also Read: AAP will contest 2022 UP assembly elections: KejriwalThe department is also going to make nearly 30,000 women MGNREGS mates for recording attendance, measurements of work done, and encouraging women to work.

Now, all the citizen information boards (CIBs) on worksites will be made by women. Women will also be made para-vets (for animal care), bagwani mitras (horticulture assistants), and krishi mitras (agriculture assistants) under MGNREGS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worst-employer-of-women-under-mgnregs-up-aims-a-turnaround/story-AjlKArAwjveycdzGQTMioK.html

They were caught & handed over to the police,” said PDP president Mehbooba Mufti in a tweet, asking the police to initiate an inquiry. She also demanded stringent action against the arrested men.Police confirmed the two young men were arrested with a bottle of petrol during the rally and investigation has begun.On Monday, Manzoor Ahmad was hit when terrorists opened fire towards Haji Parvaiz’s house at Natipora in Srinagar.DGP Dilbag Singh told the media that Ahmad’s killing was a part of the attempts to disrupt the ongoing district development council (DDC) election process for which, he said, people were showing a lot of enthusiasm.“Very elaborate security arrangements have been made along the polling routes, and polling places but despite best of the arrangements, you can’t put 100% civil curfew where people are not allowed to move… So among the large scale movement of people, you have a hidden movement of an odd anti-national element coming to the city or any other place,” he said.Earlier, a candidate of Apni Party survived an attempt on his life at Kokernag in South Kashmir after he sustained two bullet injuries. Six phases of DDC polls have been completed and the last phase will be held on Saturday. Counting will be held across J&K on all 280 DDC seats on December 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-men-arrested-with-petrol-during-pdp-rally-in-kupwara/story-aLRPVJUUuZDXzVf11f5QkJ.html
15-12-2020||India||New equations, change of guard in BTC 17 years after its formation||Student leader-turned-politician Pramod Boro took charge as the chief executive member of Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) in Assam on Tuesday, three days after the declaration of results of election to the council that administers four districts in the state. The 45-year- old leader of the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL), who was heading All Bodo Students Union (ABSU) till few months back, was administered oath of office and secrecy by Assam chief secretary Jishnu Barua in the presence of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and other dignitaries in Kokrajhar. “Our government is here not for power, but to solve all issues pertaining to Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR). Let’s forget the past and look ahead to a peaceful and developed BTR where everyone has equal rights,” Boro said in his inaugural address after swearing in. It has been a sharp rise to power for Boro, who quit the ABSU and joined the UPPL in February this year. He was made the party’s president soon after. He steered the party to secure win in 12 of the total 40 seats and joined hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (10) and the Gana Surakha Party (1) to assume power in BTC. On Tuesday, along with Boro, four other executive members of the council -- one from UPPL, two from the BJP and one from GSP -- took oath. The UPPL and the BJP’s rise has come at the cost of Bodoland Peoples’ Party (BPF) and its president Hagrama Mohilary, who was in power in BTC for 17 years since its inception in 2003. The BPF secured 17 seats in the BTC polls, but it failed to cobble together a majority due to souring of relations with the BJP., though the two parties are partners in the state government. Mohilary, a rebel-turned-politician, had come to power in BTC after the second Bodo Accord, signed by Bodo Liberation Tigers (which Mohilary headed) with the Centre and state government in 2003. The accord had paved way for creation of the BTC, after the first one signed in 1993 with the aim of ending the movement for a separate Bodoland state had failed. And now, Boro came to power after the third Bodo Accord in January this year, which he had signed as president of ABSU along with leaders of four factions of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland and the United Bodo Peoples’ Organisation (UBPO). Unlike Mohilary, Boro had been not been associated with any rebel outfit. But his deputy Govinda Chandra Basumatary, the vice president of UPPL, has a violent past. The former head of NDFB (Progressive) was also a signatory to the third Bodo Accord. With assembly election in the state due in March-April next year, the BJP aims to further consolidate and increase its hold in BTC administered areas. In his address, CM Sonowal congratulated BJP workers for the win in BTC and indicated that the new tie-up with UPPL and GSP will continue in the assembly polls as well. Education and finance minister Himanta Biswa Saram announced setting up of 40 new colleges, 40 stadiums and a medical college in the area soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-equations-change-of-guard-in-btc-17-years-after-its-formation/story-2QsXJ8HpOo5iGMO3qVBDKI.html

It’s a signal||India has asked Canada to put off the foreign office consultations between top diplomats of the two countries, a move seen to indicate the downturn that political relations between the two countries have taken after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s comments on the farm protests in India, people familiar with the matter said.The foreign office consultations between Riva Ganguly Das, the foreign ministry’s secretary (East) and her Canadian counterpart expected to be held on Tuesday (December 15) have been postponed at India’s instance. New Delhi has told Ottawa that the date was inconvenient.ALSO WATCH | Kangana Ranaut vs Canada PM on Twitter over France cartoon controversy Foreign minister S Jaishankar had last week skipped the Ministerial Coordination Group of Covid-19 organised by Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to formulate strategies on the coronavirus pandemic for the same reason.India, which had participated in a previous meeting of the group, had cited “scheduling” issues to stay away from the December 7 meeting.PM Trudeau had waded into the farm protests in India during a video interaction to mark the 551st birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, describing the protests as “concerning” and asserting that “Canada will always be there to defend the right to peaceful protest”.PM Trudeau’s comment had come despite New Delhi, which expected the matter to be raised in Canada’s House of Commons, briefing Canada’s foreign ministry, Global Affairs Canada, about the necessity of the farm laws.Canada has about 1.6 million citizens of Indian origin, a large number of them from Punjab. A little less than half of them, about 7 lakh, are Sikhs.PM Trudeau’s remarks were aimed at this constituency, preparing for the possibility that he may have to face elections in the spring of 2021. The other two political parties - New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh and Conservative leader Erin O’Toole - have already expressed support. But PM Trudeau did not stop at letting his party court the Indian immigrants over the farm protests and took matters into his hand.An upset New Delhi promptly summoned the Canadian envoy over the “unwarranted” comments and served a demarche or formal diplomatic representation that said the “comments by the Canadian Prime Minister, some Cabinet Ministers and Members of Parliament on issues relating to Indian farmers constitute an unacceptable interference in our internal affairs”.India also complained to the Canadian envoy about other statements by the Canadian leadership that “encouraged gatherings of extremist activities in front of our high commission and consulates in Canada that raise issues of safety and security”.Indian officials, however, underlined that economic relations between the two countries would not be impacted by the strain in political ties that was often attributed to the Canadian leadership letting local political interests of his party gain precedence over diplomacy and economics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-drives-home-message-on-pm-trudeau-comment-puts-off-meeting-of-diplomats/story-sqdgeDRIhFkvh6vRCbK4gJ.html

The state government, which had requisitioned a few thousand beds in private hospitals to treat such patients, has started freeing them. These can now be used to treat non-Covid patients,” said a senior official of the state health department.The state government had requisitioned more than 3,400 beds in around 57 private hospitals across the state. In all, more than 13,500 beds in over 100 government and private hospitals were allotted to treat Covid-19 patients.While the number of active cases was 31,984 on October 15, it dropped to 29,314 on November 15. On December 14 (Monday), it was at 21,384.The rate of hospitalisation has also dropped during this period. While around 38% of the hospital beds were occupied on October 15, only around 21% of the beds were occupied on December 14.Till date, West Bengal has recorded 523,000 Covid-19 cases and 9,100 fatalities. The number of fresh cases reported daily in Kolkata and North 24 Parganas - the two districts which were registering the highest number cases – has also dropped.Kolkata recorded around 400 cases on December 14.

15-12-2020||India||Parties not in favour of Parliament session, says Centre; Opposition denies||The opposition parties on Tuesday alleged that they were not consulted by the government over its move to scrap the winter session, insisting that Parliament should meet to discuss the ongoing farmers’ protests over the three controversial agriculture laws. Senior Congress leader and former union minister Jairam Ramesh took to Twitter to claim that Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad was not consulted by the government on the issue. The remarks came in the wake of a letter written by parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi to Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on December 14 informing him that leaders of all political parties were in favour of doing away with the winter session of Parliament in view of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic situation. Hindustan Times was first to report on November 16 that the rising cases of covid-19 infections in Delhi have cast a shadow on the winter session, which normally begins in December, and the government is mulling to club it with the budget session that begins at the end of January. “Mr Pralhad Joshi is as usual departing from the truth,” Ramesh tweeted. When asked if his party had been consulted on the issue, Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien replied, “Consulted? Are you joking?” In the past few weeks, the opposition parties have stepped up their demand for holding the winter session in view of the ongoing farmers’ agitation over three new farm laws, saying the government should repeal these legislations and hold fresh discussions on reforms in the agricultural sector. Members of Parliament (MPs) of the Congress from Punjab have been on a sit-in protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar for the past several days, urging the government to immediately convene the Parliament to repeal the farm laws and discuss the farmers’ issue. Over the past few days, they have been joined by many other Congress leaders. In his reply to Chowdhury’s letter to him demanding immediate convening of the winter session to discuss the new farm laws, Joshi said that the leaders of all parties were not in favour of it due to the Covid-19 situation. “Winter months are very crucial for managing the pandemic because of recent spurt in cases during this period, particularly in Delhi. At present, we are in the middle of December and a Covid vaccine is expected very soon. In this regard, I have informally contacted floor leaders of various political parties and they have expressed their concerns about the ongoing pandemic and opined of doing away with winter session,” the parliamentary affairs minister said. He said the government was willing to have the next session of Parliament at the earliest. “It would be appropriate to have the budget session, 2021 in January, keeping in mind the unprecedented circumstances created by Covid-19 pandemic,” Joshi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parties-not-in-favour-of-parliament-session-says-centre-opposition-denies/story-OyDPSkuVGaOaRghxCocKcL.html

He further said, “Why do people from districts across Uttar Pradesh have to come to Delhi for healthcare, education and basic amenities? Why can’t they avail that in Uttar Pradesh? It is because all political parties in Uttar Pradesh have betrayed people. Each government has crossed the other one in terms of corruption. Uttar Pradesh politics lacks good intent. The AAP can change that… Give us a chance.” “If Sangam Vihar in Delhi can have Mohalla Clinics, so can Gomti Nagar in Lucknow… Uttar Pradesh can have a good public healthcare system, education system and development. They only need an honest government,” said Kejriwal. The announcement comes as the AAP registered its maiden win in the Goa zilla panchayat elections. The party opened its account with Hanzel Fernandes, who won the Benaulim seat in South Goa. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made big gains as it won 32 out of 49 seats in a clean sweep.The issues which the party would focus on in Uttar Pradesh shall be healthcare, education, water and power supply-related issues, unemployment and law and order, said Sanjay Singh, the AAP’s Rajya Sabha member and in charge of the Uttar Pradesh unit. He said, “Why can’t Uttar Pradesh see development on all these fronts? The AAP has been focusing on a politics of change in the country and today’s announcement is a major step in this regard.” Earlier this year, the party had said that it will be contesting 2022 assembly polls in Uttarakhand as well. The move is in line with its plan to spread beyond Delhi. Candidates of the party had earlier contested elections in states that include Punjab, Goa, Maharashtra and Haryana. Currently, the party has legislative assembly members in Delhi and Punjab, and one Lok Sabha member from Punjab. After defeat in the 2017 municipal elections in Delhi and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, in which it had unsuccessfully pitched candidates in all seven Lok Sabha segments in Delhi, the party had announced that it would focus only on Delhi for a while.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-will-contest-2022-up-assembly-elections-kejriwal/story-sekOLoWUzpgJ7unB7BDI4O.html

It had ordered that alternative medicine such as homoeopathy, Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and naturopathy be used to enhance immunity to resist the disease.The High Court order had prohibited AYUSH doctors from advertising or prescribing medicines as a cure for Covid-19, except those specifically mentioned in the Centre’s advisory on March 6, 2020.An appeal was filed in the top court by Dr AKB Sadbhavana Mission School of Homeo Pharmacy against the Kerala High Court order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/qualified-ayush-doctors-can-prescribe-immunity-boosters-for-covid-patients-sc/story-apjhgSxo8sdt4wSXRo7qnL.html

Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi communicated the decision to Chaudhary in a letter on Monday, according to news agency ANI.The minister said he had informally contacted floor leaders of political parties and they were in favour of skipping the winter session, which normally begins in November and ends in December. “Winter months are very crucial for managing the pandemic because of the recent spurt in cases during this period, particularly in Delhi. At present, we are in the middle of December and a Covid vaccine is expected very soon,” Joshi said, according to his letter put out by NDTV.“The government is willing to have the next session of Parliament at the earliest; it would be appropriate to have the Budget session 2021 in January 2021 keeping in mind the unprecedented circumstances created by Covid-19 pandemic,” he said, responding to Chaudhary’s 3 December letter.Chaudhary had asked for a short winter session to discuss issues such as the farmers’ agitation, preparation of Covid-19 vaccine, economic slowdown and the stand-off along the India-China border.As news of the government’s decision emerged, Congress leaders took swipes at the government on social media, linking the decision to the demand to repeal the three farm laws. They recalled that Parliament’s Monsoon session was held in September when the number of Covid cases was at its peak.To be sure, the plan to scrap the winter session had been proposed much before thousands of farmers started their agitation on the outskirts of Delhi against the laws that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules.Farmers insist the new laws favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices.The Hindustan Times had first reported the plan to scrap the winter session on November 16.The monsoon session, which started on September 14 when new daily cases in Delhi averaged 4,001,, was cut short by eight days after at least 50 people connected to Parliament tested positive. The plan to skip the winter session was drafted when the daily average stood at 6,670. On Monday, Delhi reported over 1,300 Covid cases, the lowest in over three-and-a-half months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-winter-session-of-parliament-due-to-covid-says-govt-to-cong-demand-to-discuss-farm-agitation/story-C7w6VIwgaYUgOPjqnkIpGP.html

These activities range from satellite constellation, small satellite launch vehicles, ground station, geospatial services, propulsion systems and application products, according to Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met representatives of eight space agencies to improve participation and seek suggestions for the newly created Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe), an independent body that will give authorisation, monitor, and also share government resources for space activities. ISRO chairperson and department of space secretary K Sivan briefed the PM about steps taken so far. He said actions have been taken to address the requirements and applications are being processed in fast track mode. “The event was mostly aimed at assessing what the space sector is currently doing and taking feedback about the recent changes in the space sector. The government is looking at implementation of the suggestions made today,” according to a person present at the meeting. “Two of the main suggestions of the industry were to expedite the construction of the new launch pad at Tuticorin and setting up a space fund to help the startups in the sector,” the person said, on condition of anonymity. One of the representatives also suggested setting up a space education centre on the lines of Unites States’ Kennedy Space Centre. “Setting up a good infrastructure like that will not only inspire students from all corners of the country to learn about space, it will also bring in space tourism. Currently, we take our students and those from all neighbouring countries to US. It costs about $500 just for the visit to Kennedy Space Centre, add to that the cost of flight, visa etc; it is very expensive. If a centre is set up in India, it will cost one-third and bring in tourism,” said Srimathy Kesan, founder and CEO of Space Kidz India. She was present at the meeting and one of the eight persons to present to the PM. Others industry representatives were Sunil Bharti Mittal from Bharti Enterprises, Jayant Patil from Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Srinath Ravichandran from Agnikul Cosmos Pvt Ltd, Pawan Kumar Chandana from Skyroot Aerospace Ltd, Colonel H S Shankar from Alpha Design Technologies Pvt.

15-12-2020||India||Indians among top nationalities considering a working holiday trip||A survey conducted by Booking.com has revealed that 68% Indian travellers have already considered booking a stay in order to work from a different destination. Indian travellers are second on the list after 69% travellers from Thailand to have considered a working trip. The survey revealed that 2021 could bring a significant rise in travellers looking to take longer trips that combine work and leisure due to the freedom of working from anywhere. The survey was conducted among a random sample of adults who travelled for business or leisure in the past 12 months, and must be planning to travel in the next 12 months after the travel restrictions are lifted. 20,934 respondents across 28 countries and territories, including about a thousand from India, polled in the online survey in July this year. The survey revealed that 63% Indian travellers would like to extend any business trips to also enjoy leisure time at the destination. “Working from home during the pandemic has allowed many to be released from the daily grind and commute to and from the office. And it now seems people may be reluctant to go back to their old routines. With the possibility of remote working becoming a long-term reality, it’s looking promising for those who are able to travel and set up their office anywhere – from a desk overlooking a serene lake setting to swapping your mountain screensaver for a real-life Himalayan backdrop. Bye-bye 9 to 5: work from wherever you want seems to be the new normal,” said the online travel agency’s spokesperson. Also Read: Google says 3 days a week in office, rest can be work from homeThe survey also said that travel platforms and places to stay will prioritise showcasing home office necessities and Wi-Fi speed in an attempt to attract this new wave of digital nomads.Booking.com also predicted that 2021 could bring a significant rise in travellers looking to take longer trips that combine work and leisure. Commenting on the findings of the research, Ritu Mehrotra, country manager, India, Sri Lanka and Maldives at Booking.com said, “Remote working is becoming a long term reality as health and safety is a top priority in the current environment. To break the monotony of working from home, travellers want to escape to a destination where they can easily blend leisure with business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-among-top-nationalities-considering-a-working-holiday-trip/story-SCid7A8vJE1K5zCdhgmL7K.html

The board will meet every three months to review the progress.It has officials from the ministry of AYUSH, home affairs, ministry of health and family welfare, Indian Medical Association and private players such as Dr Naresh Trehan, Dr Sangeeta Reddy and Ramdev.Also read | ‘Demand for Ayurvedic products went up globally during Covid-19’: PM ModiIndia, said officials, is poised to become an even larger player as the cost of treatment is lesser than in other countries, waiting time is lesser, presence of qualified doctors, personalised healthcare and easy medical visa process.“The ministry is also in talks to ensure that medical tourists will be able to obtain a visa within a day of their application,” said the above-mentioned official. “Those facing problems will be redirected to a new call centre being set up in the culture ministry to expedite their visa.”At present, India has 34 hospitals accredited by Joint Commission International, an international body that certifies healthcare organisations. National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers in India, however, has certified 578 hospitals. “The aim is to exponentially increase the number of internationally certified hospitals,” said the official. The list of these hospitals will be included in the Incredible India campaign and be made available on its website. The centres to be promoted will be identified by AYUSH ministry.“There are three buckets of strength that India has when it comes to medical value travel, one is the combined power of traditional medicine and modern medicine in India,” Trehan told Hindustan Times. “Traditional medicine, Ayurveda, can play an important role in treating gastrointestinal problems and allergies. Allopathy has established itself in treatments like bone enjoinment. Then there is herbal medicine, which is used for boosting immunity and stress reduction.”Trehan added that by using embassies abroad to spread awareness about the programme, India can become a hub for such treatments. “There have been scattered efforts by agencies and individual hospitals to promote such travel. What is missing is a consolidated effort and that is what the board is planning,” he said.The global medical tourism industry market is estimated to value $19.7 billion, with the Asia-Pacific region accounting for 40% of the share. India’s share was reported to be around 18% of the market in 2019, with nearly 4.75 million medical tourists travelling to the country in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-plans-push-for-ayurvedic-allopathic-tourism-in-country/story-sa2WOQFOgl1weEe2ZPYmoK.html

15-12-2020||India||Wolves prefer to stay away from human, shows telemetry study in Maharashtra||Dispelling the belief that wolves are one of the predator species lurking around human dominated zones, leading to conflict, preliminary results from a radio-collaring study of eight wolves in the Vidarbha and western Maharashtra grasslands showed the species tries to avoid human-dominated zones as much as possible.Bilal Habib and his team of researchers from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, and members of The Grasslands Trust, Pune, have been studying the land use pattern, movements, habitat selection, hunting and dispersal patterns of sub adults, and threats to the Indian grey wolf, since 2018.Attaching global positioning system (GPS) collars on eight individuals in December 2018 helped researchers assess their findings over a period of three years. “The most striking thing we came across was how wolves try to avoid high density human-use areas. The core areas of wolf use are without any human presence,” said Habib, adding that these species are not identifiable by any patterns on their body (unlike big cats), not seen during the day, and are very elusive. “Their subtle behaviour made it difficult for us to photograph them easily in camera traps. The idea is to conserve this last remaining breeding population of the Indian grey wolf in grasslands of the Deccan Plateau in Maharashtra. We need concrete policy for the conservation of this species, and ensure it does not go extinct,” added Habib.Also read | Buldhana’s Lonar Lake declared Ramsar site, second for Maharashtra within a yearThe Indian grey wolf is protected under schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. As a subspecies of the grey wolf, it is found across much of peninsular India inhabiting scrub, grasslands, arid and semi-arid areas in the subcontinent. The species is presently confined to parts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Karnataka. According to the International Wolf Centre (conservation body), there are approximately 400-1,100 wolves living in the Himalayan Region and 4,000-6,000 wolves in the peninsular region.Preliminary results of this three-year study showed that the land use pattern of adult pairs had considerable differences, even regionally, depending on the availability of food and water. One of the female sub-adults moved 80km away from her home territory, and established herself in a new area. “We also found that den sites play a crucial role in the lives of the wolves. Protecting land patches used as den sites would boost conservation efforts,” said Habib.The study involved three phases of collaring wolves across moist deciduous forests and grasslands of Ahmednagar, Solapur, Pune, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Chandrapur districts. While wolves of different ages and across large packs were collared to know more about their ecology, body measurements and blood samples were taken during radio-collaring for further studies before releasing them.Among threats, the study found that free ranging dogs and in some cases, leopards were competing with wolves for habitat dominance while cases of poisoning as retaliation to livestock killing were being reported across the grassland landscape.“The Deccan plateau (Maharashtra) is probably the last remaining connected breeding population for this species in the world. Despite having highest priority in protection in terms of law, these animals and their habitat remain neglected by policy makers. We need a strong government initiative to preserve their future,” said Mihir Godbole, founder member, The Grassland Trust, Pune, which recently released a video of the study findings.Final results of this study are expected by mid-2021, said Habib.According to a 2017 study by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) and WII, habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, retaliatory killing coupled with disease threats rendered Indian wolves prone to extinction. However, very little research has been done to understand more about the species, and the animal continues to be perceived to cause conflict by allegedly attacking and lifting livestock in human-dominated landscapes. Independent experts said animal behaviour depends upon numerous factors and perceptions. “The behaviour repertoire of any species evolves with situations and circumstances. Studies (like WII’s) need to be carried periodically and findings need to be validated repeatedly to understand results better,” said Dr VB Mathur, former director, WII, adding that most predator animals maintain a respectable distance from humans until provoked or confronted.Dr Mathur explained that the first average reaction of people to elephants would be to appreciate, bow, and pay regards to the animal as it is worshipped in the Indian culture. “However, a wolf or a snake evokes a different response. Thus, when we talk about threats to such species, it is because of preconceived human behaviour rather than the animal behaviour rendering them an additional threat. Combined with this, there is folklore, some of which may be true while some may not be. However, as far as the wolf is concerned, the image of this animal in the eyes of an average human is that of a hostile type,” he said, adding, “As a landscape species, the best strategy for the wolf would be to avoid human presence. At the same time, despite our threat perception, grasslands need to be conserved for their safety, and the perception of such habitats as wastelands needs to change.” THE INDIAN GREY WOLFIndian grey wolves resemble the domesticated dog breed (German shepherds or huskies) in appearance but have a large skull and teeth, which distinguish them from other closely related canines. According to taxonomic studies, there are 32 sub species of the grey wolf globally with the Tibetian and Indian wolf found across India. Indian wolves have yellowish-brown coat colour interspersed with black. Their coat colour is usually lighter during summers. Studies estimate that they can travel tirelessly at a rate of 8 km per hour and sprint at speeds of 55 to 70 km per hour. Their average length ranges from 103 to 145 cm, males are heavier (19-25 kg) than females (17-22 kg) while adults can be distinguished from juveniles by white markings above the eyes, on the chin and under the throat. Females have a gestation period of 62-63 days with a litter size of two to six individuals. The mating season is during October and November while the age of dispersal for a young adult is 18 months. “Across Maharashtra, the majority of the wolf population is found outside protected areas and highly dependent on livestock allowing the potential for conflict, especially the shepherd community, but in this case we found their hunting, dispersal, and habitat pattern assuming that human spaces were a threat to them,” said Habib.(Source: Wildlife Institute of India and Central Zoo Authority)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wolves-prefer-to-stay-away-from-human-shows-telemetry-study-in-maharashtra/story-W9X9RPJK4ePaWXCVRSk8mJ.html

He also said that the government is ready to accept all good suggestions from farmers about the three laws.Gadkari said he doesn’t think social activist Anna Hazare will join the farmers’ agitation.“I don’t think Anna Hazare ji will join. We have not done anything against the farmers. It is the right of farmers to sell their produce in mandi, to traders or anywhere else,” Gadkari told news agency ANI.He also said that dialogue is the only way to find a solution to protest by farmer unions and a break in talks can lead to miscommunication.“If there is no dialogue, it can lead to miscommunication, to controversy and sparring. If there is a dialogue then issues will be resolved, the whole thing will end, farmers will get justice, they will get relief. We are working in the interest of farmers,” Gadkari said.Hazare had on Monday written a letter to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar warning “resumption of a hunger strike” against the Centre fails to fulfil his demands including the implementation of the recommendations made by M S Swaminathan Commission.The anti-graft activist had sat on a fast in February last year over his demands. He called off the fast on February 5, 2019, after receiving a written assurance from then Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh that the Centre would form a high-powered committee to discuss the suggestions made by the Swaminathan Commission and other agriculture-related demands.Hazare had observed a fast on December 8 in support of the ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by farmer organisations demanding a repeal of the Centre’s three agri laws passed in September.Meanwhile, the Centre has expressed willingness to hold another round of talks with the farmers to sort out their issues. But the protesting farmers said they are ready for talks again but with certain conditions.The conditions set by the farmer organisations are: Talks cannot be about old proposals which farm unions have rejected; the government should draw up a new agenda and discussions must be focused on a repeal of the farm laws.The riders appear to put the onus on the government to draw up an agenda acceptable to the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-think-anna-hazare-will-join-farmers-stir-haven-t-done-anything-against-them-nitin-gadkari/story-8ilCx4aamKcET77NwxJm0I.html

The minimum temperature on Monday was 8.4 degrees Celsius while the maximum was 19.4 degrees C, 4 degrees below normal. “We are recording cold wave conditions in Delhi with minimum temperature falling over 4.5 degrees below normal at many stations,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), cold wave sets in when minimum temperature falls below 10 degrees with a departure of 4.5 degrees Celsius from normal.Delhi’s air quality index is 192 in moderate category. Most cities and towns in northwest India are recording poor to moderate air quality today. IMD has forecast a fall in minimum temperatures by 3-5 degrees Celsius over most parts of northwest India during the next four days. In central and east India minimum temperatures will fall by 2-4 degree Celsius thereafter. Dense fog is likely today in isolated pockets over Jammu division, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, northwest Rajasthan, northwest Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal & Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura today. Air quality early warning system for Delhi under the ministry of earth sciences said air quality has improved to moderate category because of relatively strong winds during the day and night, leading to better dispersal and ventilation. The wind direction is northwesterly with wind speed 6-15 kmph and mainly clear sky. The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from northwest direction of Delhi with wind speed 8-15 kmph, mainly clear sky and moderate fog in the morning today. In its severe weather bulletin, IMD has forecast cold wave conditions for Punjab, Haryana, north Rajasthan, Chandigarh on December 17 and 18. “What we are seeing now is that several parts of northwest India are experiencing severe cold day conditions. A cold wave may also impact these regions from December 17. While cold day conditions are associated with overcast sky which hasn’t allowed the day temperature to rise, even night temperatures are falling. An intense western disturbance has passed and winds have changed to north-westerly direction, bringing icy cold winds to the plains,” said Shrivastava. Under the influence of an easterly wave, scattered to fairly widespread rain/thundershowers very likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, Kerala and Lakshadweep area during December 16 to 18. Isolated heavy rain is also very likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal during the same period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mercury-dips-to-4-1-c-in-delhi-minimum-temperatures-to-drop-in-most-of-nw-india-imd/story-k4H2YPGfbhyaS7kEPRHtOP.html

Chandradhar Das passed away at his home at Baraibasti in Amraghat of Cachar district on Sunday night reportedly due to age-related problems. He was cremated by his family members the same day. Das had been declared a foreigner by a foreigners’ tribunal in January 2018 through an ex parte judgement after he failed to appear before it to prove his citizenship. He was later sent to central jail in Silchar in March, but was released in June after a public outcry against his detention. Das had come to India from erstwhile East Pakistan (later Bangladesh after 1971) in 1955. As per rules, anyone staying in Assam prior to 1971 is deemed an Indian citizen. The case against him didn’t get resolved as the refugee certificate issued to him in Tripura wasn’t verified by authorities there. Das’s status as a foreigner also resulted in his three children and grandchildren getting left out of the National Register of Citizens for Assam, which was updated for the first time since 1951 and published in August last year. Also Read: Drama continues after BTC polls results in Assam; lone Cong winner joins BJP The register, which sought to identify Indian citizens and weed out illegal foreigners, had excluded 1.9 million of the 33 million people who applied to get included in the list. Local reports quoting Das’s daughter Niyati said that the centurion’s last wish was to die as an Indian citizen. His hopes got raised after the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which proposed granting citizenship to Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis and Buddhists from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan was passed by parliament in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/104-yr-old-assam-man-declared-foreigner-dies-before-proving-citizenshi/story-8JJSumLVu9j4cA6LF6YqvO.html

The BJP has won the Bihar assembly polls, assembly by-polls across the country and local polls in states like Rajasthan, Assam and Goa, he noted.“The poor, rural regions and farmers form the spine of this country. These results would not have been possible without their support,” he said. He said the opposition, especially the Congress, has tried to corner the ruling party over four issues; the Covid-19 pandemic, economic problems due to overall global situation, migrant crisis and recent agri reforms.Elections results have shown that people, including farmers, stand with Modi because he is their true “well-wisher”, the BJP spokesperson said.Also Read: Anti-national elements leading farmers’ protest: Himachal BJP vice-presidentTaking a jibe at the Congress over reports that it has put up a tent to help protesting farmers at the Singhu border, he said the opposition party’s tent had blown away.“It cannot even elect its president,” he said, and took a swipe at its leader Rahul Gandhi, saying he considers rabi and kharif are “BJP workers”.

Dr Reddy’s recently began phase II and III clinical trials after getting requisite clearance.According to Deepak Sapra, CEO for API and pharmaceutical services at Dr Reddy’s, Sputnik V doses distributed in India will be a combination of Indian and Russian made vaccines.Separately, RDIF recently finalised a deal with Hetero Biopharma to manufacture 100 million doses a year in India starting 2021.“The Sputnik V vaccine efficacy against severe cases of coronavirus was 100%. Among the confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 20 severe cases were recorded in the placebo group, while no severe cases were recorded in the vaccine group,” the two developers of the Russian vaccine said in a statement.The research data is expected to be published by the Gamaleya Center team in an international peer-reviewed medical journal.More than 26,000 volunteers were vaccinated as part of double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase III post-registration clinical trials of Sputnik V in Russia. “No unexpected adverse events were identified as part of the research,” the statement said. The analysis of Sputnik V’s efficacy at the final control point was carried out on the basis of 78 confirmed cases, including 62 cases identified in the placebo group and 16 cases in the vaccine group.Besides India, phase III clinical trials of Sputnik V are underway in Belarus, the UAE, Venezuela and other countries.Russia’s health minister Mikhail Murashko said: “The new data on efficacy of the Gamaleya Center vaccine is extremely encouraging.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-v-over-91-effective-in-final-analysis-shows-data/story-wYUsNkAzgDPqGaNAt52o3O.html

15-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||It’s been known for some time that Covid-19 affects people (or at least some people) the way autoimmune disorders do. Dispatch 140 on August 25 wrote about this, the challenges it posed, as well as the possible lines of treatment that became available if one were to respond to Covid-19 the way one would to other autoimmune disorders. Two recent papers, both from researchers at the Yale School of Medicine, shed more light on this. I was pointed in the direction of one by my colleague Binayak Dasgupta, who has made it his mission in recent months to keep track of the latest research on Covid-19, and then correspond with the authors to understand more; he is my go-to person in the newsroom when I want to discuss the science of just about anything to do with the viral infection – from testing to trajectory to vaccines. The other showed up on my radar. Both papers are pre-prints on medRxiv, and not peer-reviewed.Also Read| A weapon to ‘win the war’: US hospitals get initial Covid-19 shotsThe first paper, titled “Diverse Functional Autoantibodies in patients with Covid-19”, is by Eric Y Wang, Tianyang Mao, Akiko Iwasaki, and others. Several autoimmune diseases are caused by autoantibodies, essentially antibodies that attack the host’s own organs and cells. These autoantibodies target self-antigens, proteins produced by the body as it goes about its normal activities or because of an infection. And when they target these, they also target the underlying cells, tissues or organs. The presence of autoantibodies, and the role played by them could explain why, in the case of some patients, Covid-19 targets several organs and systems (including the immune system), often with fatal consequences. This is what the researchers studied. Using a method called Rapid Extracellular Antigen Profiling, the researchers checked for autoantibodies in 194 Covid-19 patients. They found that “Covid-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities” when compared to uninfected people in the study, and that these autoantibodies “target a wide range of immune-related proteins”. They also found, using a mouse model (tests on mice) that “immune-targeting antibodies exacerbate disease severity” and that the presence of autoantibodies that target “tissue-associated antigens” have a correlation with the severity of the disease.Why is this important? One, it points (like all good studies do) to further avenues of research – in this case, the role of autoantibodies in the severity of Covid-19 infections. And two, it also points to possible therapies (or, at least, to the direction in which these may be found).Also Read: Covid-19 can have impact on heart too, say expertsThe second paper, titled “Post-infectious Inflammatory Disease in MIS-C features elevated cytotoxicity signatures and autoreactivity that correlates with severity”, is by Anjali Ramaswamy, Nina N Brodsky, Carrie L Lucas, and others. The researchers studied 15 children with MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children), an autoimmune disorder that can cause many body organs to become inflamed, and which is related to Covid-19. The researchers explain that the syndrome typically manifests itself in young people “who had a mild or asymptomatic Sars-CoV-2 infection roughly 4-6 weeks prior”. Screening for autoantibodies and using other techniques, the researchers concluded that a “prior Sars-Cov-2 infection causes lasting immune alterations that set the stage for development of an acute and life-threatening” inflammation in some older children.Understanding the autoimmune aspects of Covid-19 – and because of papers such as these two, we now know more about these than we previously did – can help identify and address MIS-C and other syndromes (initially, for instance, when the first cases of MIS-C emerged, doctors believed they were seeing manifestations of Kawasaki Disease). It also adds to what we know of long-Covid – which was among the first signs that, at least in some cases, Sars-CoV-2 has the same impact as autoimmune diseases.We may have come up with vaccines that effectively prevent Covid-19, but we are still learning about the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-4oCwl6lYpdielc7yTNfCbI.html
15-12-2020||India||Will resume talks, but with some riders: Farmer unions||The Union government and farm unions protesting a set of agricultural laws the latter claim will hurt their livelihood are likely to restart negotiations that ran aground last week, with both agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and a major platform of farm unions on Monday signalling their willingness to resume talks.Tomar told reporters in Delhi that the government was engaged in efforts to restart negotiations that broke down after five rounds last week. “When a date is fixed, we will let you know,” he saidHours later, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Committee (AIKSCC) — a joint platform of the protesting farmers camped on the outskirts of Delhi — said it was ready for talks again but with certain conditions. The farm groups, mostly from Punjab, which have been pressing for a complete repeal of the three laws, said they needed three principal assurances before returning to the negotiating table.One, talks cannot be about old proposals which farm unions have rejected. Two, the government should draw up a new agenda. Three, discussions must be focused on a repeal of the farm laws. The riders appear to put the onus on the government to draw up an agenda acceptable to the farmers. To be sure, the government has reiterated the farm laws will benefit farmers. On their part, the farmers have held firm on the demand for repealing the three laws, and on Monday observed a hunger strike across the country, blocking highways and hitting the streets in protest. “The government [is] repeatedly dishing out old rejected logic. Farmers are ready for talks, but the three Farm Acts and the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 have to be withdrawn,” said Avik Saha, the secretary of the AIKSCC. Kavitha Kuruganti, another leader of the AIKSCC, said farmers were not averse to talking again. “So, if the government sends the invite, the agenda laid out there will be the key to any future negotiations.” Earlier in the day, Tomar met a delegation of farmers from five states who pledged their support for the laws, and said that a meeting will “definitely happen”. “Our efforts to restart talks are on. Talks will happen. We are always open to discussions to solve farmers’ issues,” Tomar said. “The government has been talking to farm leaders over phone informally. When things work out, a formal invite is likely to be sent again with a revised agenda,” a person familiar with development told HT, requesting anonymity. A massive farmers’ protest was set off by three laws pushed by the government in September that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules. Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices. Protesters decided to call off further negotiations on December 8, after a meeting with home minister Amit Shah, claiming a stalemate. The government on December 9 sent a written proposal to amend some provisions of the laws for greater oversight on deregulated markets, sparing farmers penalties for stubble burning, which causes pollution and promising to keep providing farmers subsidised power instead of direct cash transfer, but farm union say they won’t call off their agitation until the laws are fully repealed. The willingness expressed by both sides to explore ways of meeting again comes amid hectic behind-the-scenes efforts to prepare a mutually agreeable agenda, the official quoted above said. “Why are thousands of farmers sitting out in the cold? Only to talk to the government. The government has ruled out a repeal of the laws. But we can still talk to see light at the end of the tunnel,” Saha said. “Withdrawal of three laws is necessary but not sufficient,” said Yogendra Yadav, a senior leader of the agitation, implying farmers also want legal guarantee of support prices. Analysts say economic reforms in mass sectors, such as labour and agriculture, will always be challenging because unlike financial reforms, these sectors are about livelihoods. “The government could suggest new institutions like a regulator for contract farming to gain confidence of farmers,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh , group chief economic adviser of the State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender. The developments came on a day farm groups across several states clashed with police and reiterated their opposition to the laws. Meanwhile, farm organisations from five states representing the All India Kisan Coordination Committee met Tomar for over two hours.This is the fourth group of farmers who have met the agriculture minister to show support to the reforms, which has come as shot in the arm of a government battling the massive agitation against its move to liberalise the farm sector. Tomar told the farm organisations that “intention and policy of the government are clear and farmers are already benefiting from the pro-farmer reforms which will help in increasing the income of farmers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-resume-talks-but-with-some-riders-farmer-unions/story-mP0rWh7tkMMiItK8FdQbSP.html
15-12-2020||India||Wedding halls, polling booths in Covid-19 vaccine plan||From polling booths to marriage halls, India’s health administrators are evaluating several options for sites where the Covid vaccine can be administered. They will need a few: the aim is to vaccinate 300 million Indians by the middle of the year. Private hospitals or nursing homes will also be tapped for inoculation but the government plans to tightly control the entire process — from storage and transport of the vaccine, to its administration. Each site will be designed to serve at least 100 recipients. Chosen sites will have to be spacious (with at least three rooms) and close to the homes or offices of the recipients. Vaccination drives will be held from 9am to 5pm in all sites. Also Read| A weapon to ‘win the war’: US hospitals get initial Covid-19 shots“We will have two types of sites. There will be fixed session sites and outreach sites. The sites will be identified looking at the of number of recipients in the locality and convenience of vaccine delivery and administration,” said an official involved in the planning who asked not to be named. For outreach sites, polling booths are emerging the preferred choice. “The bulk of the recipients are being identified from the voter list. So, it would be best to allocate sites for them in polling booths,” added the official.  Apart from polling stations—these are usually housed at schools, colleges, and community halls—health authorities are looking at other options that could serve as outreach sites. The centre’s guideline to the states, reviewed by HT, says: “Municipal offices, panchayat bhawans, marriage places (halls), cantonment hospitals/clinics, railway hospitals, encampment of the paramilitary forces, railways and other central PSU colonies etc. can be identified as outreach session sites if they fulfil all the pre-requisite conditions for arranging a session.” Dr Prantar Chakravarty, a public health expert based in Kolkata, said, “Setting vaccine camps in polling booths or hospitals is a good idea. But the government would do better if it allots specific slots to people—like they do in passport offices—instead of asking them to come anytime between 9am to 5pm. It can make the vaccination process more effective and help maintain social distance.”Also Read| There’s light at end of the tunnel, says first NYC recipient of Covid vaccineIndia used 1.03 million polling booths in the last general elections and officials involved in the vaccination plan said many of these will be used as vaccination sites. “Once the list of co-morbidities and old age are prepared, we would know exactly where all we require to put up vaccine sites,” said a second official involved in the planning who too asked not to be identified. “In case there are fewer than 100 recipients in an area, they will be clubbed with another area.” A site, according to the guidelines, will have at least three rooms. The first room would be used for identification of recipients and paperwork. The next will be for inoculation while the recipients will wait in a separate recovery room for half an hour after the jab — likely to monitor people for instant anaphylactic shocks or what is known as an adverse event following immunisation (AEFI).Meanwhile, the public and private health facilities will serve as fixed session sites. “All government health facilities at and above the level of Primary Health Centre/Urban Primary Health Centre can be utilized as sites. Private health facilities with more than 100 health care workers can also be session sites,” said the guidelines. While polling booths cover most difficult terrain and Maoist areas, outreach camps will not be held in those places due to security reasons, the officials said. The government will arrange mobile camps to cater to these areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wedding-halls-polling-booths-in-covid-19-vaccine-plan/story-E8hQRdJhrzg3TD3jz6FJIM.html

In a bulletin issued on Monday, the India Meteorological Department said minimum temperatures over most parts of northwest India are expected to fall by three to five notches during the next four days.Large parts of north India are already witnessing foggy conditions. However, no significant change has been forecast over most parts of central and east India during the next two-three days, but it can fall by up to four notches thereafter, the IMD said.“What we are seeing now is that several parts of northwest India are experiencing severe cold day conditions. But cold wave may also impact these regions from December 17. While cold day conditions are associated with overcast sky which hasn’t allowed the day temperature to rise, even night temperatures will start falling. An intense western disturbance has passed and winds have changed to north-westerly direction bringing icy cold winds to the plains,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre, said:“The cold day conditions in northern states were mainly due to fog, clouding and incursion of very cold air following a western disturbance. Minimum temperatures have also started dropping since there is no WD expected and the previous WD has left a lot of snow on the hills.”Meanwhile, several locations in Jammu and Kashmir, and Himachal Pradesh witnessed subzero minimum temperatures on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cold-winds-from-himalayas-bring-down-the-mercury/story-YkAMxKeuNRLYcmOVxEEv1N.html
15-12-2020||India||Hathras conspiracy: UP govt links Kerala journalist to SIMI||From a newspaper’s front page calling Osama Bin Laden a “martyr” to a fake identity card; from a distinction between a contributor and a journalist to details of cases registered against the Popular Front of India (PFI); from call details to a letter of vigilance inquiry, the Uttar Pradesh government has spared no effort to oppose the release of Siddique Kappan. Kappan, secretary of the Delhi unit of the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ), was arrested on October 5 while on his way to Hathras in Uttar Padesh after the September gangrape of a 19-year-old woman who died in hospital of injuries she suffered in the sexual assault. KUWJ subsequently approached the Supreme Court, calling Kappan’s arrest illegal and an attempt to silence the media. But the UP government, in its latest affidavit, has sought to highlight Kappan’s alleged association with the now-banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and the PFI, besides discrediting KUWJ. It has maintained that Kappan is not a journalist nor is KUWJ a credible organisation while citing Kappan’s alleged links with the (SIMI) and its alleged off-shoot, PFI. The latter is not a banned outfit under the law. Senior advocate Kapil SIbal, appearing for the KUWJ, submitted that they would want to rebut the allegations and need time to do it. “Since no immediate relief is likely, we would want time to file response to what the state has to say,” he told a bench, led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde. The UP government’s affidavit has contended that the Union filed its petition at the behest of SIMI and the PFI, for whom Kappan worked actively. The state said the Delhi unit of KUWJ was itself facing a vigilance inquiry over embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds following a Kerala high court order. It added that the Union’s Thrissur unit was also facing charges of grabbing the devaswom (religious trust) land of the Vadakkumnatha temple in Kerala. “It (KUWJ) does not represent all journalists. There is a separate association of journalists which is the mainstream association. Therefore, the present petition is not maintainable...,” it stated.  “Kappan and all other co-accused (three others who were arrested with him) are directly and closely associated with PFI members, who have been the executive members of the banned terrorist organisation SIMI,” it added. It accused the KUWJ of concealing the “true identity” of Kappan as it sought to pass him off as a journalist who was going to report in Hathras even though the newspaper, Thejas, he claimed to work for shut down in December 2018. While adding that most of the former editors of Thejas were the executive members of the PFI, the affidavit said that Kappan worked as a “contributor” and not as a full-time working journalist. Attaching with the affidavit a copy of the newspaper clipping, it said Thejas had such extreme views that its front-page story on November 30, 2011 carried a picture of Bin Laden, describing him as a “martyr.” The state accused Kappan of being a “mastermind” having links with various riots and working in tandem with the editors of Thejas to trigger religious discord in Kerala. “As per the investigations till date, most of the executive members of PFI who are ex-office bearers of terrorist organisation SIMI have been in close intimacy with Kappan... Documents (allegedly found from Kappan’s house) disclosed formation of PFI as a reincarnation of SIMI after being banned. Also, the motive and ideology of both PFI and SIMI are corroborative,” claimed the affidavit. Submitting that Kappan and the three co-accused were also being investigated for suspicious money transactions in their accounts, the affidavit contended that all four were going to Hathras on the instructions of Md Danish – an accused in the Delhi riots case of February, to provoke class and caste conflicts in UP. It added that Kappan was also not cooperating with the investigators and besides lying about his house in Delhi, he also is not sharing details of his social media accounts. The KUWJ has sought time to respond to this affidavit, following which the matter was posted for third week of January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-conspiracy-up-govt-links-kerala-journalist-to-simi/story-WvyA4EQzC2GAM4j4No59jN.html
15-12-2020||India||Supreme Court reopens murder case against BJP MLA, says UP probe ‘sham’||The Supreme Court on Monday reopened a murder investigation against a BJP MLA from Uttar Pradesh, terming the probe by the state police a “sham”. The court scrapped the clean chit given to MLA Sushil Singh and ordered a further investigation into the murder of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Ram Bihari Chaubey in 2015; it also decided to supervise the probe. The SC bench, headed by justice Rohinton F Nariman, ordered the constitution of a special investigation team (SIT) for the case, and appointed an Indian Police Service officer, Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj, to head the team. The judgment, authored by justice Navin Sinha, severely indicted the police for the manner in which the case was closed hurriedly after the Supreme Court took up the petition filed by the slain BSP leader’s son. Chaubey’s son, who also filed a petition before the Allahabad high court earlier, cited gaps in the investigations, adding the endeavour of the police was only to save Singh, an MLA from Saiyadraja (Chandauli). “The FIR was registered on December 4, 2015. Eight investigating officers have been changed. An investigation which had been kept pending since then was promptly closed on January 30, 2019 after this Court issued notice on September 7, 2018,” noted the bench. It added: “The investigation appears to be a sham, designed to conceal more than to investigate. We are constrained to record that the investigation and the closure report are extremely casual and perfunctory in nature. The investigation and closure report do not contain any material with regard to the nature of investigation against the other accused, including Respondent no.5 (Singh), for conspiracy to arrive at the conclusion for insufficiency of evidence against them.” The bench tore into the reports by the police seeking to shut the case against Singh on the ground that Chaubey’s sons had failed to give any substantial evidence against the MLA. “The police have the primary duty to investigate on receiving report of the commission of a cognizable offence. This is a statutory duty under the Code of Criminal Procedure, apart from being a constitutional obligation to ensure that peace is maintained in the society and the rule of law is upheld and applied. To say that further investigation was not possible as the informant (sons) had not supplied adequate materials to investigate, to our mind, is a preposterous statement, coming from the police,” said the court. It emphasised that although it is for police to investigate, if the police do not perform its statutory duty in accordance with law or is remiss in performance of its duty, the court can’t abdicate its duties. “A fair investigation is but a necessary concomitant of Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution of India and this Court has the bounden obligation to ensure adherence by the police,” added the bench.MLA Singh said the charges against him were politically motivated. “However, there is a SC order and we will cooperate with the investigators...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-reopens-murder-case-against-bjp-mla-says-up-probe-sham/story-qhIDTVGZFku1JDNhl5YsTP.html
15-12-2020||India||Supreme Court sends notice on PIL over forced sacramental confessions||The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice on a public interest litigation (PIL) that questioned the practice of sacramental confession before a priest as violative of an individual’s privacy and human dignity. The petition highlighted instances in the recent past where women in the church were sexually exploited or even raped by priests who blackmailed them, threatening to publicise their confessions. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued notice on the petition filed by three Christians from Ernakulam, Kerala; all three claim to be members of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, issued notice to the Centre, the Kerala government and the head of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church known as Catholicos with its headquarter at Devalokam, Kottayam, in Kerala. The three petitioners, Mathew T Mathachan, PJ Shaji, and CV Jose, said in their petition: “The compulsion to confess is a serious intrusion into the privacy of a person… This pernicious practice of forced, compulsory, and mandatory confession from every member (both men and women) is causing several other problems including sexual exploitation of women and blackmailing.” The petition claimed that even men are exploited, with money being extorted from husbands to keep their wives’ confessions secret. Reacting to the Supreme Court decision, spokesperson of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian church Father Johns Abraham Konatt said: “Confession is one of the seven sacraments of the church. There may be some cases of misuse but it is difficult to do away with the system. Only an ordained priest can deal with confessions and grant absolution.” He said sacramental confession forms a part of belief and remission of sin paramount to a believer. The church will file a reply as directed by the apex court soon, he added. Church reformists lauded the move. The demand to do away with sacramental confession gained ground after two cases surfaced in central Kerala in 2018 in which priests allegedly sexually exploited women, leveraging their confessions. After these cases kicked up a controversy, the National Commission for Women also favoured abolition of confessions. In one of the cases, a husband wrote to the church head alleging that five priests blackmailed and raped his wife using her confession. In response, the church disrobed all the priests and they were arrested later. The trial of the case is on. In 2018, a similar petition was filed in the Kerala high court by a church reformist, CS Chacko. He contended that imposing implied or expressed compulsion on a believer to confess a sin before the priest infringed upon the right to privacy. He said it was violation of Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) guaranteed by the Constitution. But the court dismissed the petition stating that the Constitution also mandates that a person has the right to join or leave a religion as per his choice and there is no compulsion on this. The present petition, while citing violation of Article 21, attacked the Malankara Orthodox Church’s constitution, which was written in 1934. The petition cited sections 7 and 8 of the constitution of the church that required all parish members -- men and women above the age of 21 years to undergo confession once a year in order to be a part of the parish assembly and to vote in its elections or be eligible to become part of the managing committee. Section 8 requires a confession register to be maintained in each parish. Members who flout these provisions risk losing their membership. In addition, the petition even questioned the practice of money collected by the parish under various heads, which, if not paid, can entail removal of the member from the parish register. Senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, appearing for the petitioners, submitted that the 1934 constitution was immune from any challenge before any civil court or high court in Kerala as per a decision of the apex court passed in KS Varghese v St Peter & St Paul Orthodox Church (2017) and that for this reason, both the police and state have adopted a hands-off approach, forcing the petitioners to approach the Supreme Court. The petition said, “When confession becomes the platform or medium through which rapes and sexual exploitation are carried out by predator priests, there is no reliable safety mechanism for victims who are physically and mentally scarred.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-sends-notice-on-pil-over-forced-sacramental-confessions/story-m3ayj4XLcVMnWqgNCR5yQI.html
15-12-2020||India||Willing to listen to farmers, best interests in mind: Govt||The Centre had the best interests of farmers in mind when it passed the three laws aimed at reforming trade in agriculture, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday, as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government pursued its outreach to protesting farmers. Singh added that the NDA government was always open to a dialogue with farm unions to allay their misgivings on the policy changes. Addressing the annual convention of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) on the 19th day of a protest by farmers against the legislation, Singh said the government is “always willing to listen to our farmer brothers”. Describing agriculture as the “mother sector for all others”, he said: “There is no question of taking retrograde steps against our agricultural sector ever. The recent reforms have been undertaken with the best interests of India’s farmers in mind.” Singh added, “We are, however, always willing to listen to our farmer brothers, allay their misgivings and provide them with assurances we can provide. Our government is always open to discussion and dialogue.”The recent laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers fear the reforms could pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at federally fixed minimum support prices (MSPs), erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of private buyers. Farmers have organised sit-in protests across the country and observed a hunger strike from 8 am to 5 pm on Monday.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, too, said the government was ready for a discussion with the farmers anytime. “The meeting will definitely happen. We are engaging with farmers,” he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Earlier in the day, Tomar met home minister Amit Shah and discussed ways to end the deadlock. Later, Tomar met a delegation of farmers led by the All India Kisan Coordination Committee, which extended support to the laws. This is the fourth group of farmers to extend support to the laws in two weeks.Union minister for law and justice Ravi Shankar Prasad said the government will sensitise people across the nation on how the laws will benefit farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/willing-to-listen-to-farmers-best-interests-in-mind-govt/story-mFjzFr8tYu5bfRTgMxarNO.html
15-12-2020||India||Farmers in several states join agitation, sit on hunger strike||Farmers across several states observed a one-day hunger strike on Monday, blocking roads, marching on streets, and shouting slogans to protest against three recently enacted agriculture laws that have sparked a fierce agitation on the outskirts of Delhi. A group of farmers tried to block the Delhi-Jaipur national highway at Shahjanpur on the Haryana-Rajasthan border, but were prevented by the police. At Ghazipur on the Delhi-Noida border, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Takait) faction blocked traffic for some time. The Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait) chief Rakesh Takait said the traffic was blocked to tell the administration that they could block the vehicular flow if they chose, but the unions later desisted to ensure people were not inconvenienced. “The hunger strike call given by farmer leaders was successful,” said Baldev Singh, a farmer leader at Singhu, situated at the border of Delhi and Haryana where a large number of farmers are gathered since November 27.In Punjab and Haryana, farmers shouted slogans outside the offices of district commissioners and took out protest marches. Haryana Police closed the Ambala-Patiala highway after protesters gathered at the Shambhu border point with adjoining Punjab. “We wanted to send out a strong message to the government that it is not just an agitation by Punjab farmers but across the nation,” said Shiv Kumar Kakka, one of the farm leaders who went on a nine-hour hunger strike at Singhu,The ruling Congress held protests in Punjab, with the state unit chief Sunil Jakhar participating in one near the Shambhu border. Shiromani Akali Dal workers protested in Amritsar. Farm groups held events in Ludhiana, Patiala, Sangrur, Barnala, Bathinda, Moga, Faridkot, Ferozepur and Tarn Taran.“Farmers held protests outside the offices of deputy commissioners at several places in Punjab,” Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said. This particular union didn’t participate in the strike, alleging they were not consulted before finalising the programme.In Haryana, farmers hit the streets before holding demonstrations outside the offices of deputy commissioners (DCs). Many employees associations backed the protests, which roiled Rohtak, Hisar, Bhiwani, Sonepat, Jhajjar, Jind, and Fatehabad.“Everybody should come forward to join this fight for the future of the farming community. We are happy with the support from different sections and sectors,” said Ratan Mann, Haryana BKU (Tikait) state president.In Uttar Pradesh, Samajwadi Party workers clashed with police at various places as they were prevented from heading towards collector offices in several districts. Clashes were reported from Lucknow, Hardoi, Agra, Gorakhpur, Etawah and some other districts. Protests were also reported from Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Bihar, Odisha, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Kerala. Superintendent of Police (Bhiwandi) Ram Moorthi Joshi said: “The protest is going on peacefully and we have deployed additional police force to ensure traffic on highway moves smoothly.”As night fell over the stretch of road that is now a protest ground in Singhu, people shouted slogans, held up placards and torches. “The message of the fast was that the nation’s ‘annadata’, food provider, was today sitting hungry,” said Harender Singh Lakhowal, a farm leader. Police enhanced security at Delhi’s border points. Containers, cemented barriers, barbed wires and additional police force were deployed at borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-in-several-states-join-agitation-sit-on-hunger-strike/story-McDUE2EkMNRE78O5oYpvcL.html
15-12-2020||India||5 of Tamil Nadu family found dead, suicide suspected||A family of five including a 37-year-old man, his wife, 30 and their three children were found hanging inside their house on Monday in Valavanur in Villupuram district, police said, adding the probable cause of death by suicide was financial stress. The children were two girls aged 8 and 6 and a boy aged 3. “Preliminary investigations reveal that the man had borrowed small amounts of money from several people to improve his business,” said Villupuram superintendent of police, S Radhakrishnan. But he was unable to repay as he did not have any income for the past nine months due to Covid-19.” Their bodies were sent to Government Villupuram Medical College Hospital for autopsy and last rites were performed on Monday evening. “Post-mortem examination does not reveal any criminal action. It was death by hanging. The children may have been sedated in their food because no marks or injuries were found on their bodies to show resistance,” the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-of-tamil-nadu-family-found-dead-suicide-suspected/story-gYIEzvy6Hgh4iOgY4IBOzO.html
15-12-2020||India||‘Ready to rest’: Kamal Nath; BJP calls it a retirement hint||Former chief minister and Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee president Kamal Nath on Monday said he had “no ambition or greed for any post”, and was ready to stay at home.Addressing party workers in Sausar town in his home district of Chhindwara, Nath said: “I am ready to take some rest... I have no ambitions or any greed for any post. I have achieved a lot already. I have achieved to an extent perhaps any others achieved so. I am ready to stay at home.” BJP leaders described Nath’s statement as a hint that he was planning retirement from active politics after losing the recent bypolls. Congress leaders, however, described it as a “general statement”. Reacting to his predecessor’s comments chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “I am not forcing anyone to retire from politics. It’s Congress’ internal matter.” “...His [Nath’s] government fell and lost the by-elections on 19 assembly constituency seats out of 28 due to his wrong policies, in November this year. Now, he didn’t have any option but to retire from politics,” BJP’s state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said. Congress MLA and former minister PC Sharma, on the other hand, said, “It was a general statement of Kamal Nath. He was asking the residents of his constituency whether they want to see him again or not, like a good politician do.” Nath later said that he was saying that he would go into retirement if the residents of Chhindwara wanted him to. His Congress government lost majority in the assembly in March this year when 22 MLAs resigned. Three more MLAs resigned in July and yet another quit in October. Later, all of them joined the BJP. The bypolls were held on 28 seats and the BJP won 19 of the seats to get majority in the state assembly with 126 seats against the Congress’ 96 in the 230-member assembly. The Congress won only nine seats in the bypolls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-rest-kamal-nath-bjp-calls-it-a-retirement-hint/story-CHVTNEsG8krcbnHO89OuTJ.html
15-12-2020||India||Centre to help study climate crisis impact on Himalayas||A Regional Climate Centre for the Third Pole or the Hindukush Himalayan region will be established to conduct cutting-edge climate research, assessments and applications to forecast impacts of climate change on the Himalayas.A similar Regional Climate Centre is based in China. But the Centre in India, which is likely to be located in Delhi, will advise Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar too. “We are in initial stages of work with the World Meteorological Organisation and cannot provide an exact timeline for by when this Centre will come up. But it will soon be set up because the impacts of climate change will be pronounced on the entire on the Himalayan region,” said M Mohapatra, director general of the India Meteorological Department at TROPMET 2020, a symposium on meteorology organised by the Indian Meteorological Society.IMD is likely to have 10 weather radars for the Himalayan region in India by early next year and also an airborne lidar observation to measure glacier volume periodically. It will also expand the weather observation network in coming months. On Monday, scientists from IMD and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology cautioned that the impact of climate change on the Himalayas will increase in the form of cloudbursts, extremely heavy rain, landslides, glacial lake outburst flood (GLOFs) etc.“It is highly recognised by scientific community the world over that mountains play a dominant role in ecosystem and socioeconomic activity specially in the climate change scenario… considering the size and role of Himalayas in our hydrology, meteorology, ecology and socioeconomic issues, India has decided to facilitate research in the third pole region. A lot of initiatives have already been taken up by MoES for augmentation of observational network with deployment of weather radars and numerical weather modelling systems,” Mohapatra said, adding that climate change-led disasters are becoming more pronounced in the non-Himalayan mountain ranges.“Disasters play a dominant role in deciding which socioeconomic activities can be conducted in the region. Now we also have various disasters in Western and Eastern Ghats. In recent years we have seen due to heavy monsoonal rainfall how disastrous landslides, which were generally realised in the Himalayas or the north-eastern states, have been realised in Karnataka and Kerala. Similar landslides have also been realised when a super cyclone crossed Odisha in 2018 and the Eastern Ghats were impacted by landslides. There have been specific changes in the mountain ecology due to climate change. Being a data sparse region the observational network in the mountains is limited compared to other parts of the country so we have the scope to improve,” he added.The Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH) experienced a temperature rise of about 1.3 degrees Celsius during 1951–2014 compared to India’s average temperature which has risen by around 0.7 degree C during 1901–2018, according to the “Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region,” a report published by the ministry of earth sciences earlier this year. Several areas of HKH have experienced a declining trend in snowfall and also retreat of glaciers in recent decades. In contrast, the high-elevation Karakoram Himalayas have experienced higher winter snowfall that has shielded the region from glacier shrinkage. By the end of the twenty-first century, the annual mean surface temperature over HKH is projected to increase by about 5.2 degrees C under a low action scenario, the report has projected.“Mountains are home to a quarter of world population. Rising temperatures are causing changes to the region, loss of critical mountain ecosystems is increasing the risk of downstream disasters. Weather dynamics due to tropical and extratropical systems sometimes leads to heavy rains over the Himalayas like the Kedarnath and Srinagar floods in the past. The Himalayan region is warming faster than the world average, melting of glaciers is a major concern, a changing climate could mean more devastating impacts on the very fragile biodiversity of the Himalayas. It could also impact availability of water, food, agriculture and health in the region,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences. The global mean temperature for January to October 2020 was around 1.2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, according to an assessment by WMO recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-help-study-climate-crisis-impact-on-himalayas/story-IouAHXBzH7K7gmR7g7LR3I.html
15-12-2020||India||Man missing in Tamil Nadu found in Nagaland, meets family after 8 years||A man from Tamil Nadu who was reported missing eight years ago after going on a pilgrimage was found wandering in a remote village in Nagaland and sent back home in Pudukkottai district. The person, identified as Kumaravel and aged around 50 years, reunited with his family on December 11 with the help of Nagaland police, Tamil Nadu police and the Nagaland Tamil Sangam.Kumaravel’s rescue story goes back to November 5 when he was found at Bongkolong village under Athibung subdivision in Nagaland’s Peren district. According to Peren police, the village authority reported that an unknown non-local person was found roaming in the village and his identity could not be established as he did not speak English, Hindi or any local dialect. Subsequently, police personnel went to the village and brought him to Athibung police station where they arranged an interpreter to communicate with him.After Peren police could establish his identity and address, official communication was made to Pudukkottai district police in Tamil Nadu and it was ascertained that Kumaravel was reported lost eight years ago. Upon acquiring his basic details, he was stated to have been moved to ‘House of Friendship’, an old age home in Dimapur (Nagaland), where he was lodged for a month till necessary arrangements were made to send him home.Pudukkottai police said that they were approached by the Nagaland police following which an enquiry with Kumaravel’s family was made. “The family had not registered any missing complaint but told us that he has been missing for eight years. We registered a missing complain only on November 22,” said a O P Murugesan, a police officer from the Pudukkottai station.Kumaresan is unmarried and his only family members are a younger brother and a sister, an officer from Pudukkottai police said. Also read: First Covid-19 vaccine administered in the US, tweets President Donald TrumpWith the coordination of the police of both the states, along with the Nagaland Tamil Sangam, Kumaravel finally reunited with his family after almost a decade. 50-year-old Kumaresan was accompanied by Tamil Sangam advisor, Kannan from Dimapur to Chennai on December 11, where a special team of the Pudukkottai district police received him and took him home.“The family was shocked when we told them that he was found in Nagaland. They had lost hopes because he used to leave home often. They were so happy to see him when we reunited them,” the police officer said. When contacted telephonically on Monday, Kannan informed that Kumaravel has reached home safely after a tearful reunion with his brothers and other family members at Chennai airport.“He (Kumaravel) is from a very modest background. We came to know that he went to Palani for pilgrimage eight years ago where he got lost,” Kannan said. Kumaravel stated to have narrated that he got on a train and travelled on and on as he did not know which station he was supposed to get down at until he reached Andhra Pradesh. He reportedly worked briefly at a house there before travelling on foot and hitching rides on trucks for months without knowing which direction he was headed to. Kannan said it could be during the nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic when Kumaravel probably walked for months and ended up in Nagaland.“He said he forgot day and night and lost track of time, travelling by foot and hitching rides trying to get home,” Kannan stated. While expressing sadness that a person had to go through such an ordeal mainly due to his inability to communicate with others in a common language. Kannan said the Tamil Sangam Dimapur was happy that Kumaravel was finally home with people who know and care for him.Meanwhile, Peren police in Nagaland expressed appreciation for Bongkolong villagers for promptly reporting the matter, and also acknowledged the ‘House of Friendship’ old age home in Dimapur for sheltering Kumaravel for about one month, and the Nagaland Tamil Sangam for generously sponsoring his flight ticket upon learning his family’s financial inability to make the required arrangements for his return.“We also appreciate the Tamil Nadu police for assisting the process and making all necessary arrangements to receive the individual and reuniting him with his family members,” a Peren police official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-missing-in-tamil-nadu-found-in-nagaland-meets-family-after-8-years/story-E60MGXtLylqj2P0jn0IwxL.html
15-12-2020||India||Shakti Bill for crime against women tabled in Maharashtra assembly||After close to a year of deliberations, the Maharashtra government on Monday tabled its Shakti bill with the provision of stricter punishments, including death penalty and fine up to ₹10 lakh for rape, acid attack and social media abuse against women and children. According to the bill, investigation and filing of charge sheet should be done in 15 days and trials should be completed in 30 days after filing a charge sheet. The bill, modelled on Andhra Pradesh’s Disha Act, is expected to be cleared in both houses on Tuesday. State home minister Anil Deshmukh tabled the Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 2020, and Maharashtra Exclusive Special Court (for certain offences against Women and Children under Shakti Law) in the legislative Assembly on Monday, the first day of the two-day winter session of the state legislature.The first has provision for amending existing sections in the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Criminal Procedure Code (CrPc) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act for stricter punishment and the second is for establishing special courts. The legislation, after being passed, will need approval of the Centre as amendments are suggested in central laws. The proposed amendments to CrPC have been sought to bring down the investigation period from two months to 15 days and the trial period from two months to 30 days. The appeal period has also been proposed to be reduced to 45 days from six months. The bill has the provision of death penalty and life imprisonment for rape and acid attack convicts. The amendment in sections 326, 354, 376 of the IPC, which deals with these crimes, has been proposed to be amended through the bill. The bill has also made provisions for reimbursement of plastic surgery and face reconstruction expenses. It also lays down the provision of punishment for failure to share dates with the investigating officer, relating to derogatory material against women and children on social media platforms, internet or mobile. The bill has proposed a separate judicial system to fast-track cases that come under the act’s purview with at least one special court in each district. The law will have provision for special public prosecutors and special police teams, which will have at least one woman officer, and will seek to establish institutions to provide services, including medical or psychiatric support and care, psychiatric counselling to victims, and facilitating legal and financial aid and rehabilitation.State home minister Anil Deshmukh said, “We have tried to make the law foolproof. We held deliberations at various levels and sought opinions from experts over the past year. The draft was first discussed in March, after which a sub-committee of ministers was appointed to ensure there were no flaws in the draft. After the bill is passed in both houses and ratified by the Governor, it will go for the assent of the President,” he said. Deshmukh said the time limit given for investigation and trial was sufficient. “In recent cases of crimes against women in Roha and Jalgaon, the charge sheets were filed in two weeks and forensic reports were obtained in just three-four days,” he said. The bill was prepared after more than 10 months of ground work, and was finalised by a high-level committee of the home department, with Deshmukh visiting Andhra Pradesh to study the Disha Act. Following this, a committee under Aswathi Dorje, posted as director of Maharashtra Police Academy (MPA), was set up to draw up a draft.

Similarly, another farmer Suresh from Shekhpura under Parwalia tehsil, sold his gram produce for Rs 4053 per quintal under auction against the MSP of Rs 5100 at the mandi the same day. However, both the farmers had no qualms in accepting the price as the produce was not of fair average quality (FAQ) and they sounded satisfied with the entire auction process as they were supposed to get the payment against the sale within 24 hours. For Ganeshram and Suresh or for that matter Hameer Singh Dangi, another farmer from Bhopal, the farmers’ agitation in Delhi against the central government’s three farm laws has hardly made any difference in their routine life and sale of their produce as of now. But there are doubts if the situation will remain the same in the time to come as is reflected in the low tax collection through Krishi Upaj Mandi tax and farmers numbers dwindling and also a good number of Mandi employees waiting for their salaries for the past more than two months due to low tax collection. The farm laws have made the traders jittery as the business is going down. Karond Krishi Upaj Mandi Traders Association president Harish Gyanchandani said, “The farm laws are nothing but the death knell for the mandis across the state. The reason being, a trader has to pay Mandi tax at 1.70% which was reduced to 0.50% for three months by the state government after their agitation in October, whereas traders dealing with farmers outside the mandis are not required to pay any tax. In this situation, why should a trader come to the mandi to buy agriculture produce? Instead, he will pass some of the amount, saved by not paying the tax, to the farmers to encourage the latter to sell their agriculture produce outside the Mandis.” Also, he added, the traders outside the mandis are not bound by any rules and regulation unlike the traders registered with the Mandis. Hence, farmers might not get adequate amount of money against sale of produce outside the mandi and also the payment is likely to be delayed. Agriculture Mandi Board Employees and Officers Association state president Angira Pandey said, “After the farms laws were enacted, at least 11 Mandis in the state, out of the total 259, registered zero transaction in the month of October and more than 36 mandis had their transactions reduced by more than 90%. Since the tax collection is low, only about 1500 of around 9000 employees engaged with the mandis have been able to get salaries in the past two months or so.” As per a document, the most affected mandis are at Sagar, Panna, Tiakamgarh, Rewa, Satna, Sahdol, Anuppur, Sidhi, Singrauli, Dindori, Chhindwara, Jabalpur, Shivpuri, Sheopur, Bhind, Guna, Mandsaur, Agar-Malwa, Shajapur, Dewas, Neemuch etc..In October, farmers in Madhya Pradesh harvest paddy and soyabean and sell through local mandis and other tradersDwivedi said, “In Mandis the traders are bound to make payment to the farmers within 24 hours. If a trader fails to pay the amount within 24 hours he has to pay additional amount at 1% interest rate within 48 hours and the this interest rate goes up to 5% on failure of payment on subsequent days. Also, till he clears the payment he is not entitled to take part in the auction. As there are transactions outsides there are hardly such restrictions on the traders.” Also Read: ‘Anti-Modi elements part of protests, not farmers’: Union minister Narendra TomarAway from the Mandi, Jitendra Thakur, a farmer who is a resident of Arwalia village and has about 8 acre of land in his family in Bhopal, speaks why farmers’ agitation in Delhi has not affected the farmers in Madhya Pradesh much. “Unlike Madhya Pradesh the Mandi system in Punjab and Haryana is very strong and there is interdependence between farmers and traders. For instance, if a farmer needs a good amount of money for medical treatment, marriages or any other occasion, he gets it from the traders at the mandis. Also, the farmers there don’t have to cover long distances to reach the mandis. That’s why they fear that the new laws will lead to closure of the mandis.”Also Read: ‘For our farmer brothers’: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind KejriwalThakur added, “If our interests like MSP etc are protected in the laws, we would like to save a good amount of money otherwise spent on transportation to mandis for the auction,” he said. Another farmer of the village, Lalaram said, farmers were ready to back the new laws if they turn out to be in their favour.“If transparency is there in the laws and our interest is protected we would welcome it. If there are people who can buy our produce at the time of sowing, then it will give guarantee for our income. But until there are provisions in the law, our interest can’t be protected.” However, a farmer from Dalouda in Mandsaur Jitendra Patidar said, “There are many discrepancies in the new laws. For instance, in Mandis there are checks at several points so that the farmers get payment from traders and the latter are able to do business only after getting licences, whereas, once the traders start buying produce outside the mandis, there is no such scrutiny and licence required for a trader to buy the produce.” Bharatiya Kisan Union state president Anil Yadav said that the farm laws will only benefit the corporate houses. “If the central government really wanted to protect the interest of the farmers why did it not include the provision of MSP in the laws and why the farmers are debarred from approaching the courts in case of any buyer backing out from the contract?,” he asked. Minister for farmers’ welfare and agriculture Kamal Patel said, the state government is committed to safeguarding the interest of farmers.“We have made it clear that Mandis and MSP both will continue to exist. Hence, there is no reason for the farmers or Mandi traders to be worried. The farm laws aim at ensuring enhancing the income of the farmers,” said Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/little-trade-in-mp-mandis-in-october-after-passing-of-farm-laws-traders-say/story-aveDzQYBkckLAYDzSdoERP.html
15-12-2020||Editorials||Why the winter session matters | HT Editorial||The pandemic has caused enormous disruption to lives and livelihoods, but among its other casualties has been the functioning of India’s most important democratic institution — the Parliament. This year will see no winter session, and the reason being offered is Covid-19. It is indeed true that holding the monsoon session was a difficult exercise, requiring an overhaul of logistics and seating arrangements. Despite precautions, dozens of parliamentarians and many more Parliament officials got infected. There is no debate on the fact that the pandemic is still here, caution is essential, and the health of India’s political leadership is important.But to suggest that this means Parliament itself cannot meet is disingenuous. The budget session this year was —rightly — prorogued earlier than scheduled because the pandemic had just hit India, a lockdown was in offing, and little was known about the disease. The monsoon session itself was truncated. Key legislations — including the farm bills, the opposition to which has moved to the sadak, streets, from the sadan, house, where it was not adequately discussed — were pushed through with the Opposition not getting the space and time to raise issues. And now India will only see Parliament meet for the budget session in 2021, where the focus will, understandably, be on the budget itself.But the need for elected representatives to meet in the sovereign house could not be greater. A farm movement has disrupted lives across north India; the management of the pandemic has been inconsistent with a varied track record across states; a framework for vaccine distribution is in the works; Centre-state relations remain fragile; the security situation is worrying with China continuing its aggression in Ladakh; and the economy, while recovering, is still not out of the woods. All of this merits open discussion and debate where the government offers its point of view and the Opposition critiques its performance and offers constructive suggestions. The fact that government is functioning with offices returning to a degree of normalcy, events are being held with leaders in attendance, a full election was fought in Bihar and bypolls were held across states shows that despite the pandemic, the Indian State has not gone dormant. Neither should Parliament. To show their commitment to citizens in these times of distress, India’s parliamentarians owe it to the country to get to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-the-winter-session-matters-ht-editorial/story-UbO9LkHJ4VAKkvyalfKVXL.html
15-12-2020||Editorials||Keep a close watch on inflation figures | HT Editorial||Retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), moderated from 7.6% in October to 6.9% in November. This is primarily a result of moderation in food prices, although the non-food component of the CPI has also come down. While the November numbers mark an end to rising inflation since August, headline inflation continues to be above Reserve Bank of India’s upper limit of 6% and is unlikely to come down in the near future. Rising crude oil prices along with higher tax component of petrol-diesel prices can generate additional tailwinds for inflation going forward. The fact that the current inflationary spike has come at a time when the economy needs every possible support to growth makes it a tricky situation for policymakers. RBI has kept the policy rate unchanged since May 2020 in view of rising inflation, even though the monetary policy stance has been kept accommodative. Some experts have pointed out that raising interest rates at this juncture will only end up attracting hot money from foreign markets which, while doing little to add the productive capacity in the economy, might hurt exports by forcing an appreciation of the rupee. A persistence of high inflation, especially in food items, might put a squeeze on household budgets and therefore mass demand. The Centre will present its budget in 45 days. It will need to project a nominal GDP growth rate for budgetary calculations. On this count, a higher inflation could actually be of help as it will boost revenues. Taxes, after all, are a fraction of nominal, not real incomes. The short point is, policy will have to be vigilant about inflation in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/keep-a-close-watch-on-inflation-figures-ht-editorial/story-QrFK8fNoVZJhq0S8YHCVYI.html
15-12-2020||Editorials||The life and legacy of a literary master | HT Editorial||John le Carre’s most famous Cold War spy, the dull and dreary George Smiley, was the exact opposite of Ian Fleming’s dashing spy, James Bond. But, the ordinariness of le Carre’s greatest character, Smiley, who he modelled on a colleague in MI5 where he worked running an espionage operation during the Cold War, caught the imagination of millions and established le Carre as a storyteller extraordinaire of the spy genre. Smiley took on an East German agent in le Carre’s debut novel, Call for the Dead, which was followed by A Murder of Quality. By then, le Carre had few, if any peers, in this particular world of thrillers. His literary legacy will endure. Many argue that Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is the greatest spy novel of all time. The masterpieces never stopped. The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and The Honourable Schoolboy have all passed into the realm of classics. The foundations for many of his great works was the battle between the lofty concept of western freedom — the practice of which was often murkier than proclaimed — and that of life behind the Iron Curtain.When the Cold War ended, many asked — what next for le Carre? But he refused to be corralled by his own legend. He took on other themes such as big pharma in The Constant Gardener, the arms industry in The Night Manager and terrorism in A Most Wanted Man. He never ceased to be astonished by how his books came to be regarded as authentic documentation of espionage during the Cold War. A remarkably reticent man, he once said of his craft, “Out of the secret world I once knew, I have tried to make a theatre for the larger worlds we inhabit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-life-and-legacy-of-a-literary-master-ht-editorial/story-epMOutsF6hEWdr24wzaLMP.html
