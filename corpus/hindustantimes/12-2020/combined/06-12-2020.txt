The MMRDA, however, stated that the variation will not affect the overall cost of the project expected to be operational by May 2021. According to the minutes of the meeting accessed by HT, package two of the corridor was awarded at ₹360 crore earlier and 90% of the work has been completed. This package stretches from New Ashok Nagar to Mahindra and Mahindra. However, owing to the extra work undertaken, MMRDA has approved a cost variation of 32% or ₹116.12 crore. The minutes reveal how the extra work was undertaken before the Maharashtra state assembly elections in 2019. For instance, the agency had built a metro car unit exhibition centre at the MMRDA grounds in the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) for ₹11.75 crore, with a train prototype that was unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi then. It also stated that MMRDA has approved a cost variation for package 3 by ₹79.79 crore. This package stretches from Mahindra and Mahindra to Dahisar East. Overall, 81% of the civil construction work along the corridor has been completed. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said the variation will not impact the projected cost of the metro line, which is ₹6,208 crore.Rajeev said, “It is a huge project with several components like land acquisition, system works, civil construction. So we will save costs in one of these components, which will compensate for the variation. There is no escalation in the overall project cost.”The commissioner also said that MMRDA is expecting the first prototype of the metro trains to be in Mumbai by the end of December, following which trial runs will be undertaken in January 2021. “Once the train arrives, we will have to undertake system integration works. We expect to start trial runs in January, which will go on for three months, post which, we will commence operations by the end of 2021.”Currently, Mumbai has only one operational metro line, the Mumbai Metro-1 (Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar), which was inaugurated in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mmrda-approves-cost-hike-for-two-packages-of-mumbai-metro-7-but-says-overall-cost-won-t-be-hit/story-lByBKUwtFs0VVvRfw2gK4O.html

The man, along with his mother, was booked for assaulting and causing hurt to traffic police personnel who intercepted their car, which entered closed/barricaded road, resulting in a traffic jam and inconvenience to the public. The court granted relief to the man to appear for Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exams scheduled on December 20 but asked his mother to surrender to the police within a week. On November 25, a single-judge bench of justice CV Bhadang, while hearing the bail application of the mother and son duo booked for deterring and assaulting a public servant from discharging their duty, was informed by advocate AM Sarogi that the incident had occurred in Pandharpur on October 22. He further submitted that as the sessions court had refused bail to the duo on the grounds that assaulting a public servant was a serious offence, they had approached the HC. According to the complaint filed by a woman constable attached to Pandharpur city police station on October 22, the duo was driving their vehicle on the road leading to tehsil office. As some repair work was undertaken on the road, it had been partially closed and barricaded. At around 12.45pm the woman constable (complainant) stopped the car and asked them to turn back as the road was closed on their route. However, they refused and an altercation ensued. It was also alleged that the barricade was removed as a result of which there was a traffic jam and caused inconvenience to the general public. Thereafter, the mother and son were taken to the police station where the mother disclosed that she was a retired police officer and understood the law. When the police personnel insisted on getting their details, the mother assaulted the woman constable, following which a case was registered. The man and his mother were charged under sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from the duty), 324 (causing hurt by dangerous weapons), 341 (wrongfully restraining a person from moving to a place or direction), 506 (criminal intimidation), 268 (public nuisance) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) among others. Sarogi informed the court that the man was 22-years old and would be appearing for UPSC exam on December 20 for recruitment into CAPF. Sarogi added that as the career of the man would be spoiled if he was kept behind bars, he should be granted temporary bail. Assistant public prosecutor YM Nakhwa, however, opposed the application and said the offence was serious and the co-accused mother was still at large. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “It is a matter of common experience that the incidents of road rage are on rise and of late, such incidents are not only restricted to private individuals using the road but even traffic personnel, who are assigned with the duty of regulating the traffic, are at a receiving end.” After granting temporary bail to the man on submitting a personal bond worth ₹15,000 and other conditions the judge ruled, “Looking at the nature of the role attributed to the applicant, as against the co-accused mother, and that the applicant has expressed remorse and regrets in the matter and in view of the circumstance that the applicant is required to appear for UPSC examination, I find that the applicant can be released on a temporary bail in order to enable him to prepare and appear UPSC examination, subject to conditions.” The court then directed the mother to surrender before the Pandharpur city police station within a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-temporary-bail-to-upsc-aspirant-asks-his-mother-to-surrender-for-road-rage/story-t7v60dL8W2hXrz3Cc4eiVJ.html

Surprise raids and extensive combing operations were carried out across the city, resulting in arrests of dozens of absconding offenders and law violators.During the special drive, 362 criminals who are on police records for serious crimes were checked; 22 externee (tadipar) criminals found living in the area from where they were externed were arrested.“Simultaneous combing operations were carried out at 189 locations, including some densely populated slum pockets where notorious criminals usually take shelter. The intense combing operations led to the arrest of 48 absconding and wanted criminals,” a senior police officer said.Operation All Out was supervised by commissioner of police Parambir Singh and was led by Vishwas Nangre Patil, joint commissioner of police (law and order), additional commissioners of police of all five regions, 13 deputy commissioners of police and assistant commissioners of police (ACPs) of over 40 divisions. Senior inspectors of all 95 police stations across Mumbai remained present in their respective jurisdictions and oversaw the execution of the operation. While speaking to HT, Singh said, “Operation All Out was organised to carry out a sudden crackdown on anti-social elements in the city. The surprise checks carried out on a massive scale will send a strong message across and prevent many future crimes.”During the operation, 851 hotels, lodges and musafirkhanas were checked and those found violating rules and regulations were penalised accordingly.Citywide nakabandis were also organised at 861 locations, and 7,562 vehicles were checked. Action was taken against those who found in violation of motor vehicle rules.After easing of lockdown restrictions, police reported a rise in drug-related crimes in the city. An organized and effective crackdown was needed and thus, the massive operation was launched against elements involved in the drug business,” said Patil.Under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 53 cases were registered during the crackdown, including 44 for consumption and possession of drugs such as MDMA and ganja.Foot patrolling was organised at 428 important locations including all crime probe spots, and 95 raids were conducted against illicit activities. During this, one illegal firearm and 11 sharp weapons (knife, swords, etc) were seized. Police executed 167 non-bailable warrants.“The special drive will act as a deterrent to keep criminals in check and will prevent future crimes. Visibility of maximum policemen out on the streets for action against anti-social elements also boosts the confidence of citizens in the police,” said Dilip Sawant, additional commissioner of police, north region.Another officer said that generally operations on such a high scale are only done before Ganeshotsav, Independence Day or Republic Day or if there is terror alert. “Such a crackdown will now be done regularly as this strengthens and enhances police control on anti-social elements and puts a check on crime,” said Chaitanya Siriprolu, Mumbai Police spokesperson and DCP (operation).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/operation-all-out-mumbai-police-conduct-raids-checks-to-crackdown-on-criminal-activity/story-VLzVgxcwLX0IJ3BlXeUU0J.html
06-12-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena to support farmers’ stir over laws||In a significant step by political parties that are in Opposition on national level, a delegation of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday met Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray over various contentious issues, including the “interference of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Centre into the rights of the state governments”. The SAD and the Shiv Sena have decided to join hands to support the ongoing farmers’ protests on the borders of New Delhi for the past 10 days, demanding the abolition of the newly introduced farm laws. National Opposition parties, including various regional outfits, have also given a call for Bharat Bandh on December 8.Leaders from key political parties that form the national Opposition are expected to meet in Delhi in the next couple of weeks to discuss the course of action.“We have held meetings with a few regional parties and are meeting leaders from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Telangana Rashtra Samithi, All India Trinamool Congress with the common intention of opposing the Centre’s intervention in the states’ rights. The Centre has been suppressing the rights of the states in state subjects, including law and order, agriculture, finances. In the garb of cybercrime, the Centre is intervening in law and order. By passing the farm laws, it intends to overtake the state’s powers of agriculture marketing. The goods and services tax (GST) regime has already shrunk the state’s resources. We want to collectively oppose this attempt,” by SAD vice-president and former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra, who led the delegation to Thackeray’s official bungalow, Varsha, said. The SAD leader also said the delegation could not meet Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar in Mumbai due to time constraint. “We have already met him in Delhi and will have another meeting in the national capital in the next two weeks. SAD is taking the lead to give a combative Opposition to the ruling BJP. The decision about the leadership of the front will be taken collectively,” he said. In a statement issued by his office, Thackeray said, “The SAD delegation discussed their stand on the ongoing protest. The farmers are the backbone of the country and we should give supreme priority to their issues and demands.” The SAD had quit the BJP-led NDA in September to protest against the Centre’s new farm laws, saying they were “anti-farmer”. The Shiv Sena snapped ties with the BJP last year after it formed the government in Maharashtra with the NCP and Congress. The two saffron parties fell apart over the issue of sharing the chief ministership after the Assembly polls last October. Pawar has recently spoken about the need for a combative front against the BJP. In an interview to Marathi newspaper Lokmat’s YouTube channel, Pawar said there are many parties that do not stand with the BJP’s policies that are not in the interest of the nation and are openly speaking against them. “West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been taking the BJP head on consistently. In such a scenario , other parties like the Congress and Left should come forward, keep the differences aside and join hands with leaders like Mamata. It could not happen because of the Covid-19 pandemic over the past few months, but I think it can happen during the forthcoming Parliament session (in February),” he said. Thackeray, during his virtual meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi and few other non-BJP-ruled CMs in August, had pressed for the need to come together to fight against the Centre to safeguard the federal structure. He had also said that they should not allow anybody to take away the rights of the states given to them by the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-to-support-farmers-stir-over-laws/story-zzUTHSa177F4n7iav8vAIO.html

06-12-2020||Gurugram||Serial killer sexually assaulted as a child, may have triggered spree: Police||The 22-year-old alleged serial killer, who was arrested in Gurugram three days ago, is a victim of child molestation. He was sexually assaulted by a male relative when he was six years old, the police said, adding that this may have triggered the killing spree in which at least 10 persons were killed in Gurugram, Delhi, and Bihar.The police said that he only targeted men and had no interest in women. He used to carry a set of knives to stab his targets and only targeted people from the lower middle class, who were in distress or expressed frustrations.The police said that it has been challenging to track and arrest Mohammad Razi (22), as all these three murder cases he was involved in were blind cases. There was no personal or professional enmity and there was no CCTV footage to help them identify the suspect.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that as Razi was smart enough to evade being identified but circumstantial evidence and secret informers helped them nab him.On November 26, Razi was searching for a target when he saw a man sitting near the sewer pipe in Sector 47 ground, near the state vigilance office. Razi sat near the man and started interacting with him.“He introduced himself as a needy person who had come all the way from Bihar in search of work and did a storytelling session, saying he was thrown out of the house due to financial issues and now, he is left with no money to make ends meet. He was carrying a whisky bottle, which he offered to the victim and after they consumed almost half the bottle, he started abusing him and stabbed him at least six times. He chopped his neck, packed the head in a paper and later in polythene, and walked to Kanhai village, which is four kilometres from the spot,” said Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime).The victim was identified as Rakesh Kumar of Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh. His identity was established from an Aadhaar card found near the body.Razi told the police he went to the residence of one Mohsin Khan, a construction contractor who had hired him for an ongoing project near Sohna Road. “He was fired from the job as he was found stealing construction material and iron rods from the site. He was carrying a grudge against Khan and planned to frame him. He went to Khan’s room but found his room locked. So, he left the head in front of his house to mislead the police and returned to Sector 47,” said Sangwan.Razi kept a close watch on police movement in Sector 47, when they were searching for the head in nearby bushes and “enjoyed every moment”, according to the police.He washed his knife and wiped his hands with a towel that he carried in his bag, along with a set of clothes. He kept changing locations and was confident that he would not be caught as he was not using a mobile phone.During questioning, Razi revealed that he has worked in Nepal, Rajasthan, Delhi, Gurugram and Uttar Pradesh, and wanted to travel across the country to kill people in all cities, the police said. “He wanted to become famous and wanted to be known as the most dangerous serial killer, and his target was 100 murders. He kept his lucky knife always with him and said he would take the decision of killing only after three drinks,” said Sangwan.Rao said he has worked in Kalanki, six kilometres from Kathmandu in Nepal, where he was working on an underpass project between 2018 and 2020, before he returned to his village. He is the eldest of five siblings in his family and has two younger brothers and sisters, each.“We are investigating to get more details of other cases with his involvement. A team will be sent to his home town and we are coordinating with our counterparts to know of similar cases reported in their areas,” he said.Razi was sent to 14 days in judicial custody after his remand ended on Saturday, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/serial-killer-sexually-assaulted-as-a-child-may-have-triggered-spree-police/story-T6dF5zATEm2BPNfIbDLvXI.html
06-12-2020||Gurugram||Faridabad Police introduces family officers to reach out to public||In order to bridge the gap between the police and the public, the Faridabad Police has introduced “family police officers” to interact with residents. This community outreach programme launched by OP Singh, commissioner of police, Faridabad, last week, aims not only to enhance the visibility of the police force but also bring them closer to the public, said officials. As a part of this programme, the police will deploy beat officers for families in residential areas with whom they will interact regularly. These officers will act as facilitators for the people for all police-related services and will also act as strategic consultants on personal safety issues, said the police. Singh said that these officers will serve as a bridge between the police and the public. Most of families in India have their own doctors, shopkeepers, charter accountants, grocers and so on. “They enjoy a certain level of trust and comfort with families. Likewise, these beat officers will provide support to families by acting as facilitators for police services and as consultants on personal safety matters,” he said. According to police, there are 24 police stations, 30 police posts in Faridabad with a total strength of 4,200 officers. Each residential area will have nearly 22 beat officers, including constables, head constables, sub-inspectors and others. The teams would patrol their jurisdiction and be in touch with residents, students, shopkeepers and senior citizens of their respective beat areas. “We will draw upon the strength of all the 24 police stations and 30 police posts in the district. Beat officers will work on three shifts and remain accessible to residents round the clock. The idea is to take policing out of police stations and make it accessible to residents,” Singh said, adding that 1,500 police personnel have already started patrolling the streets. Singh also said they are utilising the skills of the new recruits as they are well-educated. There are 687 beat officers deployed across the city who are regularly in touch with the families. Until third week of November, 687 beat officers visited 68,735 families, home-delivered 3,209 copies of challans and FIRs to the complainants, helped 4,297 people with different kinds of police verifications and solved 15,938 issues of residents. They have also held 6,022 street meetings, which were attended by 1,18,220 people. During these meetings, the police urged people to maintain caution in the cyber space, be aware of cyber frauds, fact-check rumours and take pride in being a lawful citizen. Functions of the family police officer The police officers introduce themselves to families and ask them to contact them for any safety-related issues or documentation-related services they need from their police stations. They utilise these interactive opportunities to make families aware about Covid-appropriate behaviour, cyber security, and ask them to keep a watch on suspicious elements and activities in the neighbourhood. “We must have a holistic approach towards safety. It is as much about the protectors as it is about those who are being protected. The two sides need to work in tandem to achieve the optimum level of safety,” said commissioner Singh. Besides comforting families with their visits, calls, help and accessibility, they also liaise with residents’ welfare associations for necessary safety measures, such as installing CCTV cameras, hiring security guards and resolving petty disputes locally. They also keep a check on the activities of previous offenders released on bail and nuisance creators living in or frequenting their beat areas. According to the police, this initiative has given the new recruits an opportunity to be recognised for their good work. As beat officers, they are also learning valuable skills, such as dealing with the public, communication and problem-solving abilities and internalising traits like empathy, accountability and efficiency .Singh said no extra manpower or budgetary allocation was used for this initiative. “In government, you stand a greater chance of success if you can somehow make do with the available budget and manpower. You need to focus on the task, follow-up diligently, get regular feedback and make realtime course correction if necessary,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faridabad-police-introduces-family-officers-to-reach-out-to-public/story-RvspS3y1SQ5dKuOpHCw12J.html
06-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG sets October 15 deadline to register for Streets for People Challenge||Under the Central government’s Streets for People Challenge, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has invited professionals and students in the fields of architecture, urban design, and planning to submit innovative designs for re-engineering two stretches in the city.The MCG has shortlisted a 600-metre stretch within Sadar Bazaar, between Jama Masjid and Post office, and a road within the market’s 50-metre radius that leads to two schools, Vedik High School and Senior Secondary Girls Government School on Jacobpura Road, for the competition, registrations of which closes on December 15.The designs should have the capability to be carried out in quick time, require minimal capital expenditure, while keeping parameters, such as the fair distribution of space, safety, comfort, and addressing of localised needs in mind, as per the criteria set.According to MCG officials, the initiative is being supervised by the ministry of housing and urban affairs in cities across the country. MCG officials said that they are also looking at the competition as an opportunity to create a database of professionals and students, who can help them in redesigning other stretches across the city in the future.“Streets for People Challenge is an initiative to make the roads walking friendly. The purpose of this challenge is to make the use of roads as public spaces that are safe and inclusive. As a part of this challenge, the MCG has invited innovative design ideas from citizens. Under this, in the first phase, a stretch in Sadar Bazar and two schools in its nearby area have been selected for the pilot project,” said Jaspreet Kaur, additional commissioner, MCG.Kaur said that the winning entries in the competition will be awarded cash prizes and certificates by the MCG and will also have an opportunity to discuss, develop and implement their ideas with the officials.Participants can register themselves at https://tinyurl.com/S4PGurugram. They further said that the cash prizes — Rs 15,000, Rs 10,000 and Rs 7,000 for the first to third places, respectively — would be awarded for the two stretches separately.MCG officials said that there is no restriction on the total number of participants in a team. However, at least one person needs to be a resident of Gurugram. They further said that the participants would be judged on the originality of their design plan, ability to address localised issues, inclusivity and the ease of implementation, among other categories.For the redesigning of stretches near the two schools, MCG officials said that they are specifically looking for designs that will create safe access to them and act as a design benchmark, which be replicated near other schools in the city. They are looking for participants to design stretches keeping public and non-motorised transport modes in mind, so as to include necessary speed calming measures, proper illumination, signage, and demarcated areas, such as vending zones.The design should demarcate adequate space for footpaths, crossings, ramps, seating areas and green belts. It also has to factor and identify the primary users of the stretch, their pattern of movement, and ways they can be safeguarded, keeping in mind ways to utilise recycled products and increasing environmental sustainability.Following the closure of registration, the last date of submitting designs is January 3, 2021, and the results would be announced five days later, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-sets-october-15-deadline-to-register-for-streets-for-people-challenge/story-7WDiFYFMkEX2i0tGBrAl6N.html
06-12-2020||Gurugram||Haryana agriculture minister asks farmers to include SYL Canal issue among their demands||Raking up the issue of Satluj-Yamuna Link(SYL) Canal, JP Dalal, Haryana’s agriculture and farmers’ welfare minister, on Sunday appealed to individuals and organisations supporting or participating in the ongoing farmers’ agitation to include the construction of the canal among their list of demands. He said that irrigation water was the biggest issue confronting the farmers. Dalal asked farmer leaders to include this demand during their negotiation with Central government representatives. “SYL canal should be constructed for the farmers of Haryana since irrigation is a pressing problem. The issue has been pending since the past 40 years. We won the case in the Supreme Court too. I appeal to different farm leaders and their supporters across party lines to ensure that the provision for the construction of SYL canal is also inserted in the charter of demands,” said Dalal. Punjab and Haryana have been locked in a dispute over the sharing of the Ravi-Beas waters for decades. While Haryana wants its share, as was decided when the state was carved out of Punjab, along with Himachal Pradesh 50 years ago, successive Punjab governments have refused to share water. The 212km-long SYL canal was to carry Haryana’s share of water to its dry and arid southern part. While 121km of the canal was supposed to run through Punjab, the remaining 91km was meant to irrigate Haryana. While the latter completed the work in June 1980, Punjab is yet to complete its share of the canal. Dalal said that while the farmers’ agitation had started from the neighbouring state of Punjab, many people from Haryana have also extended support to the protests. “Nowadays, some khap leaders, former chief ministers and independent MLAs from our state have extended support. Every individual’s sentiments are attached to farmers. I am also with the farmers. However, for farmers in Haryana, the biggest issue is water for irrigation. Every other issue is secondary. Farmers need water for irrigation first and foremost,” said Dalal. He said that the situation of farmers in some districts in South Haryana was dire with the water table going down and the underground water resources getting depleted. “In some village in Loharu, where I come from, even drinking water level has been depleted. Farmers don’t get water for irrigation. How will there be any crops without water?” asked Dalal. Outlining the various measures undertaken by the state government for the welfare of farmers, Dalal said that opponents were incorrectly propagating that the government was going to end the mandi system. “Everyone is doing politics at their end. We, however, are the sons of farmers and will continue to take decisions in the interest of farmers,” said Dalal. In response to a question about former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda seeking his resignation over his comments alluding to foreign funding of the agitation, Dalal said that people could seek his resignation if it would benefit the interests of farmers. “You can seek my resignation if you want. I will prioritise the interests of farmers of Haryana first,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-agriculture-minister-asks-farmers-to-include-syl-canal-issue-among-their-demands/story-XEFFquJ4oRTFwTCUr7lm8N.html
06-12-2020||Gurugram||Three booked for looting ₹80,000 from a scrap dealer’s shop||The police on Saturday booked three unidentified people for posing as policemen, threatening a 27-year-old scrap dealer and snatching ₹80,000 from his shop before fleeing the spot. According to the police, the victim, Amarjit Singh, a resident of Bhora Kalan village in Pataudi who runs a scrap shop in Bilapur, was woken up around 3am on Saturday by three men. They introduced themselves as policemen from crime investigation unit. The men told him that a person named Sumit had given a tip-off that he had kept drugs and weapons in his shop and that they wanted to search the premises. “I told them I don’t know any Sumit but they started throwing away things. They threw my mattress on which I was sleeping and started checking the bags and trunks. They opened the locker, which had ₹70,000, and picked my brother’s wallet which had nearly ₹10,000 cash in it,” he said. After spending nearly five minutes, they collected money and asked him to reach the police station, before fleeing from the spot, said the police. Singh said before he could ask them for more information, they fled from the spot. Later, he informed the police control room. Subhash Boken, Gurugram police spokesperson, said that a team from Bilaspur police station reached the spot and checked CCTV footage from the area. “Three men in a white Swift car had come and robbed the scrap dealer. They told victim that they were from crime unit but they in fact did not belong to the police. The car used in the crime had fake registration number. We suspect the men to be local goons,” he said. The police has taken the CCTV footage recording and probe has been launched, said the police. A case under sections 420 (cheating), 379 (theft) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code(IPC) was registered at Bilaspur police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-booked-for-looting-80-000-from-a-scrap-dealer-s-shop/story-Fcg78Wcw8381l4oNmOMiIN.html
06-12-2020||Gurugram||Citizens wage virtual battle to seek resolution of issues at Bandwari landfill||Citizens, activists and green campaigners took to social media in a “tweet storm” on Sunday, voicing their opposition to environmental law violations at the Bandhwari landfill site in Gurugram.The virtual protest was organised by members of the city-based Aravalli Bachao volunteer group, in collaboration with the India chapter of Fridays for Future, an international climate strike movement started by Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg.Using tags #AravalliBachao and #RemoveBandhwariLandfill, residents of Gurugram and Delhi-NCR voiced a series of demands to the state government and district authorities on Sunday.Residents sought action against urban local bodies in Gurugram and Faridabad, which, activists allege, have continued to allow unscientific dumping of solid municipal waste at the landfill site despite adverse consequences for health and ecology.Citizens also demanded that the contract signed between the MCG and Ecogreen Energy, for integrated waste management in the city, be cancelled in lieu of repeated violations of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, by the latter. These violations, they pointed out, have also been upheld by the National Green Tribunal, which had fined Ecogreen Energy Rs 25 lakh in August 2018. A few months later, the MCG had fined Ecogreen Energy Rs 6.4 crore for violations of its contract.According to a December 2018 order of the MCG, 43 notices were served to the company between November 2017 and September 2018 by zonal officers regarding poor waste collection. An audit by MCG also revealed that only 35% of the company’s door-to-door collection targets were being met. “As a result, we have levied this fine,” Ravinder Yadav, nodal officer, MCG, had said at that time.More recently, on November 18, the MCG House passed a resolution to rescind the contract with Ecogreen Energy, with mayor Madhu Azad saying that the company had failed to establish decentralised waste management in the city, or set up the proposed waste-to-energy plant. At the time, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh had confirmed to the press that the MCG House’s letter would be forwarded to the Haryana government for action. Additionally, citizens have also asked that environmental clearance (EC) for a proposed waste-to-energy plant at the landfill site, which was granted by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change’s (MoEFCC) expert appraisal committee in November 2019 be revoked.“We ask the ministry of environment to withdraw the environment clearance given for the waste-to-energy plant at Bandhwari on the basis of the faulty EIA (environmental impact assessment) submitted by the municipal corporation,” said Neelam Ahluwalia, founder of the Aravali Bachao group.In a written statement circulated to reporters, representatives of the Aravalli Bachao group stated, “Thirty-plus lakh tonnes of legacy waste at Bandhwari must be treated according to bioremediation method followed in Indore. Indore has successfully recovered a dump site where 15 lakh tonnes of legacy waste was biomined, segregated and processed. The same needs to be done at Bandhwari. The National Green Tribunal has also been repeatedly asking for this to be done.”Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said, “We are aware of these concerns. Work on a solution for Bandhwari is underway, in keeping with the instructions of the National Green Tribunal. We are also preparing to prosecute Ecogreen, as well as government agencies responsible, in the environmental court in Faridabad quite soon.”Hindustan Times earlier reported, in December 2019, that the MCG withheld crucial information from the Centre while seeking the aforementioned environmental clearances. However, the NGT, in February this year, upheld the Centre’s move to clear the project, paving the way for a waste-to-energy plant in the area, which experts maintain is part of a sensitive wildlife corridor between Asola Bhatti in Delhi and Sariska in Rajasthan.Deputy commissioner Amit Khatri and municipal commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday. Sanjeev Sharma, official spokesperson for Ecogreen Energy, also did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/citizens-wage-virtual-battle-to-seek-resolution-of-issues-at-bandwari-landfill/story-n4PfERIu2JNUUPJcf2irdJ.html
06-12-2020||Kolkata||Saradha chit fund owner’s letter from jail accuses Bengal politicians of accepting crores||A letter, purportedly written by Sudipta Sen, owner of the blacklisted Saradha chit fund company, alleging that crores of rupees were given by him to leaders of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), CPI(M) and Congress has evoked mixed reactions in Bengal politics. Sen is lodged in a correctional home (jail) in Kolkata and waiting for trial. The letter says that Sen is pained to see that those who took the money are “now joining the BJP.” The amounts mentioned range from Rs 2 crore to Rs 9 crore per head. According to the letter, Sen wants the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the matter. The most significant part of the two-page letter is that the only TMC leader named in it has recently become a cause for concern for the ruling party. HT is not disclosing his name as he could not be contacted for reaction. The other four leaders said they would file a defamation suit against Sen for making fake allegations with the sole intention of maligning their image. Also read: Satellite imagery shows China setting up border villages between India, BhutanThe letter, dated December 1 and addressed to the Prime Minister and the chief minister, was mysteriously leaked to the media on Saturday along with a forwarding letter purportedly sent by an official of the Kolkata’s Presidency Correctional Home, where Sen is lodged, to the state correctional department. The hand-written letter, the veracity of which could not be verified by HT and on which no government official has commented, says that five well-known politicians were among many from the four parties who took crores of rupees from Sen. The letter is written on a printed form marked Prisoner’s Petition (Permitted under Jail code Rule 615)Sen, a prime accused in the scam, was arrested by the state police in 2013. The Enforcement Directorate is also conducting a parallel probe into the operations of the Saradha Group of which Sen was the director. “I don’t know what Sudipta Sen has written and why he has done so. A man who is about to face trial does not have the right to bring allegations against other people while he is in jail,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said at a rally in Midnapore on Sunday.Columnist and political commentator Suvashis Maitra said, “It would not be proper to comment on the content of the letter. What intrigues me is how it got leaked. A lot of letters are being leaked these days.” Sen wrote a similar open letter in 2013. It was a seven-page handwritten note in which he said that he was used as a pawn by politicians and influential people who wanted his money and resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/saradha-chit-fund-owner-s-letter-from-jail-accuses-bengal-politicians-of-accepting-crores/story-1lwZaAs0iNxZHdM4tKD3IJ.html

The victim’s family has filed a police complaint alleging the gang was demanding ₹50,000. The victim, Ajay, from Badaun, used to live at his cousin Omendra Pal’s place in Kakrala village in Noida Phase II. Omendra said that Ajay had shifted to Noida last year in search of a job. “He was involved in some odd jobs for a few months. On October 25, he went missing from home. We launched a search and also informed our relatives but could not find him. Two days later, we filed a missing complaint at the Phase II police station,” he said.He said that the police scanned Ajay’s mobile phone’s call details and found that he had allegedly spoken to one Pintu Saini, a resident of Rajasthan, in the past few days. “I contacted Pintu. He said that Ajay has joined a male escort service. I asked him to facilitate a phone call with Ajay but he refused. The suspect demanded ₹50,000 for the safe release of my brother,” Omendra alleged. He claimed that he has phone call recordings of this conversation with Pintu. The family suspects the victim is at risk and demanded the police swiftly recover him.Anita Chauhan, SHO, Phase II police station, said that based on the complaint a case was registered against the suspect under Section 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder) of IPC on December 5 after primary investigation. “We sent a team to Rajasthan which questioned Pintu. During interrogation, we found that he had sent some photos of random girls to Ajay’s mobile phone and extracted money on the pretext of facilitating his friendship with the girls. But we did not find Ajay at his place,” she said. She said that the victim’s family revealed that Ajay had allegedly sold his mobile phone to someone a few days before he went missing. “We have put his mobile number on surveillance. However, his SIM card has not been in use since then,” she said. Chauhan said the police teams are investigating the matter from all angles and trying to locate the victim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-19-year-old-man-abducted-by-escort-gang-fir-filed/story-96lvvFPEhvV5nZbKN9MmqK.html
06-12-2020||Noida||Noida authority allots plots for 3 new police stations, police dept not happy with locations||NOIDA: The Noida authority has allotted land for three new police stations, which are to be constructed to improve policing in the city. The new police stations will come up in sectors 94A, 115 and 126, authority officials said.However, the Gautam Budh Nagar police are not happy with locations of the land for two police stations. According to the authority officials, the authority faces paucity of land and it has decided to change the nature of the green land in Sector 94A into institutional use to ready land for police stations. “We have approved a proposal to change the green belt land use into institutional usage so that we can provide the land for the police stations,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority. In August 2018, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced construction of nine new police stations in GB Nagar district -- three in Noida and six in Greater Noida. Last month, the Yamuna Expressway authority had identified land for six police stations in Greater Noida. The Noida authority has allotted one acre land each for new police stations. According to the officials, the authority has allotted a plot between cremation ground and cow shelter in Sector 94A, one plot meant for some facility purpose in Sector 115 and third one in Sector 126 for the construction of police stations. The GB Nagar police said that the plots should have been allotted in the residential areas. “We suggested that the location for the police station just next to the cremation ground will not be appropriate and it will be better suited in any residential area. Also, the Sector 94A plot is on one end of the city. And the plot in Sector 126 should have been in or near any residential area so that the police help could be provided promptly,” said Love Kumar, additional commissioner of police, GB Nagar. The authority officials said that they have provided the best available plots to the police department. “We have allotted the best available plots for the new police stations. And now we will send a report to the UP government for the required approvals in this regard,” said Maheshwari. At present, there are 22 police stations in GB Nagar. As per official data, the district has 3,869 police personnel — 42 inspectors, 459 sub-inspectors, 972 head constables and 2,396 constables. The police officials said with the new commissionerate system, an additional 1,600 personnel will be posted in GB Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-allots-plots-for-3-new-police-stations-police-dept-not-happy-with-locations/story-zZ7T456QhwuKN8bK6B6HkN.html
06-12-2020||Noida||Noida air quality ‘severe’ for third day in row||Noida: The air quality of Noida and Ghaziabad continued to be under ‘severe’ category for the third consecutive day on Sunday. However, Greater Noida’s air saw some improvement and turned ‘very poor’ against ‘severe’ category for the past two days. Weather analysts expect air quality of Noida to enter into the upper range of ‘very poor’ on Monday. According to the air quality index (AQI) of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), on Sunday, out of 117 cities across the nation, only five cities -- Noida, Ghaziabad, Baghpat, Bulandshahr (all in UP) and Rohtak in Haryana -- remained under ‘severe’ category. Also, Ghaziabad continued being the most polluted city of country with an AQI of 428 against 434 a day earlier, even as the Centre’s pollution monitoring agency SAFAR stated that the intrusion of smoke from stubble burning in the region was negligible on Sunday. Though Noida’s air quality improved slightly on Sunday, it remained in the ‘severe’ zone, with the AQI value of 402 against 414 a day earlier. However, Greater Noida’s air quality improved from ‘severe’ to ‘very-poor’ with Sunday seeing an AQI of 396 (‘very-poor’) against 408 a day earlier. AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the wind speed was slightly better on Sunday and will continue being good over the next two days with the directions now changing. “The wind speed reached 8kmph on Sunday against 4-5kmph a day earlier. The wind speed is likely to increase over the next two days and may reach 12-15kmph. The directions have changed to north-westerly by Sunday evening, but it will have better speed thus better ventilation,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. The fine particles or PM2.5 pollutants also remained four to five times the safe standards. PM2.5 for past 24 hours in Noida was recorded at 259.43 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³) against 279.54 µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 255.12 µg/m³ against 269.54 a day earlier, while for Ghaziabad it was 309.43 µg/m³ against 312.8 a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 µg/m³. According to SAFAR, AQI is likely to recover slightly on Monday. “Stubble fires count from SAFAR multi-satellite products is around 167 and the PM2.5 % share is negligible. Surface winds are forecasted to increase and air quality is likely to improve marginally by tomorrow but within the Very Poor category owing to slightly better ventilation condition. AQI is likely to further improve on 8th and 9th December due to better ventilation,” said the SAFAR statement on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-air-quality-severe-for-third-day-in-row/story-d7bDGe13P3zSGe6XKO8G7K.html
06-12-2020||Noida||Out of 84 Covid-19 deaths in GB Nagar, 49 reported from Bisrakh block||NOIDA: Bisrakh block in Gautam Budh Nagar has registered the maximum share of deaths due to Covid-19 in the district so far. According to a Covid-19 death analysis done by the district health department, out of 84 patients who died of Covid-19, 49 were from Bisrakh that consists of areas from both Noida and Greater Noida. The other three blocks in the district -- Dadri, Dankaur and Jewar -- reported 15, 12 and two deaths, respectively. The remaining six deaths were reported from some non-notified areas, health officials said.According to the analysis, out of 84 patients who died due to the infection, as many as 50 patients (nearly 60%) fell in the age group of over 60 years. “None of the patients, between the age group of 0 to 20 years, succumbed to the viral infection. Among those 50 patients above 60 years of age, as many as 39 were having co-morbidities. Of 84 Covid-19 deaths, 23 infected patients were found without any co-morbidity,” the analysis said. Giving the details of co-morbidity status of the Covid-19 death cases, GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri, said that so far 61 patients with co-morbidity have lost their lives due to Covid-19. “Among the Covid-19 victims, as many as 32 patients had hypertension, while diabetes and cardiac problems were found in 29 and 15 patients, respectively. Among others, co-morbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, bronchitis and asthma were also found during the death audit,” he said. The CMO further said that male patients accounted for 76% of the total deaths in the district. “So far, only 20 female patients in the district have lost their lives due to Covid-19. Also, only 19 out of 84 deaths were from the rural areas. This indicates that the rate of infection is exceptionally high in the urban areas,” he said. Ohri also said that among 13 Covid-dedicated facilities, from where deaths have been reported, while Sharda hospital reported 29 deaths, the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) reported 27 deaths. “As many as five deaths were reported from Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College in Meerut, while three private hospitals have reported four deaths each,” he said.When contacted, Ajit Kumar, joint registrar of Sharda University Medical College, said that the recent trend of Covid-19 cases in the district clearly indicates that people have become more aware about maintaining their safety and sanitization. “The panicking phase is over now. Even our doctors and paramedics are no more afraid of the treatment of infected patients, realizing that it’s not an incorrigible disease. If the people remains conscious in following the standard protocol, the spread of the virus will certainly be checked soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/out-of-84-covid-19-deaths-in-gb-nagar-49-reported-from-bisrakh-block/story-R7mhTCBUaOw86hho6oQjNL.html
06-12-2020||Noida||Farmers protest bare- chested, try to enter Delhi from Noida||Noida: A group of farmers on Sunday protested bare chested, braving the cold conditions, in Noida and tried to march to Delhi via Kalindi Kunj from Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal, as part of the ongoing protests at the national Capital’s borders against three newly passed farm bills. They were, however, stopped at some distance from the border by the police who had placed several layers of barricades. The farmers then tried to take the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway but were stopped and returned to the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal, where they are continuing their protest. The Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lok Shakti) members had held a mahapanchayat Sunday afternoon before deciding to march to Delhi. The farmers said they have extended support for the nationwide strike called for on December 8.BKU Lok Shakti national president Thakur Swaraj Singh Bhati said that there was heavy deployment of armed police personnel on the route. “We had informed the police in advance about our march to Delhi. We had planned to take the Kalindi Kunj route but they had placed mobile metal barriers at different places as well layers of personnel. The farmers protested bare chest to demonstrate their plight. But the police did not allow us to advance. We tried to march towards the DND Flyway and faced similar barriers and a battery of police personnel, armed with batons. They said that there is no permission to march to Delhi,” he said. The farmers wanted to enter Delhi and protest at Jantar Mantar, Ramlila Maidan or Kisan Ghat, Bhati added. Dr SK Giri, general secretary and a spokesperson of BKU Lok Shakti, also protested bare-chested against the bills. He said that India is an agrarian country as around 90 crore people are engaged in farming. “The new farm policies will facilitate big corporate who would buy produce from farmers and store them in their big cold storages. They will then sell them at high prices, which will lead to inflation. The country is undergoing a serious financial crisis. The government must listen to the farmers’ genuine demands and withdraw the farm bills,” Giri said. He added that if their demands are not met soon, the farmers will bring in some buffaloes in a day or two and play a flute in front of the bovines as a symbolic protest to the “deaf” government. Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Zone 1, said that the police pacified the protesters and they later returned to Dalit Prerna Sthal. He said that the protest remained peaceful and no unwanted incident was reported. Meanwhile, traffic coming from Greater Noida to Noida remained affected on Film City road for about one hour (2-3pm) due to the protest. Ashutosh Singh, Noida traffic inspector, said that the protest was restricted between gate numbers 4 and 5. “We facilitated the traffic in one lane, and for some time, halted the traffic completely. We had also placed barricades at the Noida side of the Kalindi Kunj bridge. However, the protest could not reach Kalindi Kunj as they were stopped near the Film City flyover,” he said. The roads at Chilla Border continue to remain closed as BKU-Bhanu members have camped there in protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-protest-bare-chested-try-to-enter-delhi-from-noida/story-1LDzNhZN5NBJRC5MzdetuK.html

06-12-2020||Noida||Farmers use traffic signal’s power to charge mobile phones as they make UP Gate their ‘home’||Farmer Jaspal Singh arrived at the UP Gate protest site from Bijnor airing his grievances against the Centre’s recently enacted farm laws. By Sunday afternoon, however, he had another problem: his mobile phone was soon running out of charge.Someone directed him to the nearest traffic signal below the UP Gate flyover, which had been switched off ever since the police blocked the road in view of the protest. There, they had improvised a few plug points from the signal’s power controller. They now had round-the-clock power enough to charge mobile phones. While initially these protesters found it difficult to charge their phones, over the last week they have found different ways to charge them.A voluntary organisation on Saturday evening also placed another mobile phone charging system drawing electricity from the traffic controller. “This charges faster than our electricity switch board. It also has different plug-ins for different types of mobile phones,” Singh said. Also powering the phones are tractors. “New models of tractors come with mobile phone charging points, while the batteries of older models have to be connected a DC to AC converter,” said Satbit Jangethi from Jangethi village in Meerut. “Many youngsters who came to UP Gate area have charging units in their cars.” The UP Gate protest was on its ninth day on Sunday. Farmers call it the “Kisan Kranti Dwar” after the many protests that had been held there. In 2018, they had clashed with police as they marched to the Capital over loan waivers, power supply and unpaid dues, among others. For added measure, they also called in painters who painted the flyover pillars with the “new name”.“We have also put-up banners with pictures of our founder leader Baba Mahendra Singh Tikait. The UP Gate area seems like home,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). To keep the farmers hooked to the agitation, a group of youngsters arrived on Sunday and setup a temporary library from which they offered books to protesting farmers to read and return free of cost. “We have brought books with about 100 different titles and these include books about farm laws, Munshi Premchand and Bhagat Singh among others. Anyone willing to read is given a chair where he can sit comfortably and read at length. The books are low priced and if anyone wants to purchase, we are offering books at nominal price of ₹5 to ₹10,” said Runi (single name), a youngster from Baraut in Baghpat who setup the temporary library below the UP Gate flyover on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-use-traffic-signal-s-power-to-charge-mobile-phones-as-they-make-up-gate-their-home/story-rQUmTkb3pbDIcKQwbTyxLM.html
06-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Govt schools told to use sports fund to boost infrastructure||Deputy director of physical education, Sunil Kumar, has directed heads of government schools to utilise sports funds collected from students in 2019-20 to boost sports infrastructure. Earlier, the heads of high and senior secondary schools, used to deposit 85% sports fund to the district education office (secondary) who used it to organise district-level games. However, no events were held this year amid the Covid pandemic.The move by the authorities will help many government schools to purchase sports items and set up facilities for various games. As per school authorities, Rs 180 from students of Classes 9 and 10, and Rs 240 from Classes 11 and 12 (Rs 20 per month), is collected annually as sports fund. However, private schools have been directed to submit the 85% sports fund to the district education office (secondary) for 2019-20.There are over 1000 private schools in the district and heads of the institutions are unhappy with these instructions. The principals said that due to Covid outbreak in March, and subsequent lockdown, several students have dropped out, and due to financial crisis, parents have been unable to pay the school fees. J P Bhatt, spokesperson of joint action front, associated schools, Punjab, said, “The department should have directed private and government schools in the same way. Due to the pandemic, many parents have refused to deposit the fee, as they have lost their jobs and faced financial loss in business. Schools are facing problems staying afloat.” President of PSEB affiliated schools, Punjab, Rajinder Sharma, said, “In this time of crisis, the authorities should have directed private school authorities to keep the sports fund . Due to lockdown and coronavirus outspread, schools got closed in March, and parents have not submitted the fee.

Waiting patiently in line are dozens of farmers with plate in hand for the Sunday breakfast.Alu-poori, kheer, vegetarian biryani and other meals are freely available round-the-clock to protesters and visitors. Villages in western UP keep supply flowing to the makeshift kitchen replete with tables for cutting vegetables and buckets of water for washing. “Our ‘pakodis’ have become famous during these past 10 days.” said Deepak Malik, a farmer from Modinagar while stoking the wood fired stove. “We have about 41 35-litre cans of edible oil. Kheer is prepared from milk sent by nearby villagers. We have exhausted about 70 gunny bags of potatoes and nearly 100 gunny bags of fresh cauliflower.” He said that at least one tractor-trolley arrives from Modinagar with fresh supplies and a similar supply chain is maintained for other kitchens around UP Gate that have come up since the protest began last Saturday. “We even get LPG cylinders for our kitchens to run 24x7. There is no dearth of food here and it is coming in from other districts as well. We serve about 700 to 800 people daily. Many villages have setup kitchens and contracted food preparations to Halwais back home. They send freshly cooked food to the protest site through tractor-trolleys and pickup-vans,” said Sudesh Chaudhary, a farmer from Razpur in Ghaziabad district. But how do farmers manage to get their supply going when many industries claim their businesses were suffering because of the protest and transporters refusing to ply troubled section.“Transportation is not an issue. A tractor-trolley with Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) flag moves uninterrupted at toll plazas and highways,” said Shankar Singh Yadav, a farmer and district president of the BKU from Sambhal which is about 150km from the UP Gate protest site. “In our villages, we collect donations as money or food items like cans of oil, bags of rice, pulses and other items, for the protest.”“We have two tractor-trolleys coming in from Sambhal and likely to reach here by Sunday evening. Such protests are like a mela (fair) and tyohaar (festival) for farmers and we enjoy every bit of it despite the odds,” he said while adding that well-off farmers and villages falling under the sugarcane belt of western UP contribute more on daily basis. Mohammad Ikram, a small farmer from Badarkha village in Garhmukteshwar, said that their group has also brought in tractor-trolleys along with “Karigars” (caterers), utensils and food items. “We offer food to everyone coming to the site. When donations from our village finishes, we go for another round of collection. So, food supply is never an issue with farmers. When we feed entire country, we can also sustain ourselves and our protest,” Ikram said, also a BKU member. At the other protest site over the UP Gate flyover on NH 9, members of the Sikh community have also chipped in langars. “We can sustain ourselves for months. So the government should remember that the protests will continue and take call on our demands,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the BKU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/donations-keep-up-gate-kitchen-fire-burning-for-all/story-TQi2l6lspnjB8pjGo6eS8O.html
06-12-2020||Chandigarh||Mattewara industrial park: NGOs accuse Punjab govt of hiding project details||Alleging that the state government is deliberately hiding details regarding the proposed industrial park near Mattewara forest, members of different NGOs have sought extension in the period to submit objections/suggestions regarding land use amendments for the project. On November 21, the department of town and country planning had sought objections in 30 days, stating that the layout plan has been uploaded on its website, and will also be put on display at the GLADA office. The objections have to be submitted with the office of chief town planner, Punjab. However, in a complaint forwarded to the CTP, NGOs including Naroa Punjab Manch, RBS Roots, Vigilant Citizens Forum, Ecosikh and Ludhiana Cares Ladies Society said that the department has failed to do so. The members said that a period of 30 days should be given to the residents to file objections after the layout plan has been uploaded.Amandeep Singh Bains from RBS Roots, said, “The government is trying to get away with this formality of inviting objections and is trying to fool residents. We have been looking for the layout plan, but no department is providing any information in this regard. We will not allow the government to set up an industrial park in the Mattewara area and destroy its ecosystem and wildlife. The government has already failed to deal with Buddha Nullah pollution, which is polluting the Sutlej river. Now, another industrial park is being set up on the banks of the river, which is not acceptable. We will also file a complaint with the chief minister’s office in this regard.”The NGOs rued that the government is hiding details regarding the project and no information is being shared even under RTI Act. The NGOs have been opposing the proposed project from day one.Jaskirat Singh from Naroa Punjab Manch said,”We had also visited the GLADA office and have been checking their website repeatedly. Some of the members had also sought information under RTI, but no information has been provided. We will not allow the government to fool the public, and if required, we will also move National Green Tribunal (NGT) .” Despite several attempts, GLADA chief administrator PS Gill was not available for comments District town planner Harpreet Kaur said that as per the advertisement through which objections have been invited, a sketch or layout plan does not have to be displayed .The state government has proposed to establish an industrial park on around 960 acres of government and panchayat land in Haidar Nagar, Sekhowal, Salempur, Sailkiana and Machian Kalan among other villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mattewara-industrial-park-ngos-accuse-punjab-govt-of-hiding-project-details/story-VUkF012Klx4XovlV3lzf7I.html
06-12-2020||Noida||Protesting farmers at UP Gate mull strategy for Bharat bandh call||Ghaziabad: Even as leaders of farmers’ organisations have given a call for a bharat bandh (nationwide strike) on December 8, ahead of another round of talks with the Centre scheduled for December 9, leaders of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) camping at UP Gate are yet to figure out the course of action for the day. Their leaders said that it is for the first time that the BKU will be a part of the pan India strike.Farmers have been protesting at UP Gate since November 28 and cordoned off the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway on National Highway 9 on December 3. Since then, BKU leaders such as Rakesh Tikait have been attending discussions with the government, along with other farmer leaders. As the December 5 talks failed to yield a breakthrough, the farmers are now focussing on the nationwide strike but are yet to figure out a strategy for the same. “It is for the first time that we will be part of a bharat bandh. However, we are in a fix as we don’t want the people to suffer. Our protests in the past have included dharnas (sit-ins) on roads or marches, or our members and supporters going in for mass arrests. But this will be the first time that we will be a part of bharat bandh and it is a call given by the association of farmers,” said Pandit Raj Pal Sharma, national general secretary of the BKU. The union leaders added that they are not in favour of blocking roads or disrupting rail and road traffic, as generally happens during a bandh call given by political parties. “Instead, we will make appeals to different organisations to support farmers, who are called ‘ann daata’ (food provider). We will tell people to support us and try to repay us. Our bandh call will not be like those by political parties,” said Rajbir Singh Jadaun, state president of the BKU. Others said that BKU supporters, during the bandh, will not go to markets and forcibly down the shutters of shops or close down markets. “Our people will do whatever little they can do. We are keeping in mind that people should not suffer. The common people are supporting us and we do not wish to lose their support by troubling them. We are also keeping eyes on outsiders at our protest site so that they do not create any mischief,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the BKU. Some of the BKU leaders said on condition of anonymity that they were not in favour of blocking the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway at NH-9 at UP-Gate, but other farmers’ groups decided to go ahead with the decision. They added that they will not resort to blocking the other operational side – Delhi to Ghaziabad – of the highway.Tikait said that they will figure out measures which are to be taken up during the strike.“The farmers’ associations will decide upon the course of action. We are holding ground and will continue our protest till the farm bills are rolled back. Our demands such as a new law for minimum support price and resolution of our other issues, like hefty electricity charges and pending sugarcane payments, also need resolution,” he added. When contacted, officials of the district administration said that they are aware of the impending nationwide strike and have made arrangements for the day. “Our arrangements are already in place for the bharat bandh call and we are in touch with protesting farmers. We will ensure that there is no disruption and protests are held peacefully,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/protesting-farmers-at-up-gate-mull-strategy-for-bharat-bandh-call/story-zaPWTpQUzRr1zopXUTEf0H.html
06-12-2020||Chandigarh||Tied at playoff, Kochhar and Lahiri’s duel moves to Monday||Like the previous two editions of the Jeev Milkha Singh Invitational presented by TAKE Sports, the third edition too witnessed a high voltage play off. The duel between Former Asia number one Anirban Lahiri and local favourite Karandeep Kochhar was extended to Monday, a first in PGTI history, due to fading light. So, the third extra hole of the playoff resumes tomorrow morning. After Kochhar and Lahiri ended the regulation 72 holes with matching totals of 11-under-277, the game was pushed into the playoff with both tied after the second hole when fading light led to the postponement.Kochhar, who began the week with a four-over-76, made a grand comeback with four-under-68 while Lahiri stayed the course with a three-under-69.At the end of regulation play, Kochhar incurred a one-stroke penalty for accidentally causing the ball to move on the 17th hole. There some confusion over a penalty as the chief referee gave a decision in favour of Kochhar, which was later reversed. Kochhar even registered a verbal protest on the issue. The Chandigarh lad, playing on his home course, thus joined seven-time international winner Lahiri in a playoff to decide the winner.In regulation play, Kochhar, the winner of PGTI’s last event at the same venue in November, was on the button with his short game as he collected birdies with 10 to 20 feet conversions on the fourth, eighth and 11th. Kochhar also chipped in for birdie on the 15th and landed his bunker shots within six and four feet for birdies on the second and 16th hole. On the 17th, his ball landed in the right rough before he accidentally caused it to move, thus resulting in a double bogey.Lahiri on the other hand was not having it easy on the front-nine as he dropped two bogeys in exchange for a birdie. But Lahiri’s round was back on track with tap-in birdies on the 13th and 16th and a 15-feet birdie conversion on the 15th. The two-time winner on the European Tour then picked up another birdie on the 17th thanks to a good drive.Lahiri, who started the day tied third, two off the lead, sank a tricky 12-footer to birdie at the first playoff hole even as Kochhar fired a magnificent approach for a tap-in birdie there.With both players in a deadlock and light fading, the match was then extended.“My chipping, putting and wedge play was top-class today. It was great to fight my way back into the tournament after a poor start in round one. I feel I got better each day. I was obviously disappointed about the one-shot penalty I had to incur. But I’ve put it behind me and am looking forward to finishing it well tomorrow,” said Kochhar. “I just had no momentum going on the front-nine today. I was trying to be patient and finally hit my stride from the 13th but was still unable to apply pressure on Karandeep. I’m happy to see how Karandeep has recovered so well after his slow start in the tournament. I’m now looking forward to the contest with him tomorrow,” said Lahiri. Gurugram golfer Manu Gandas produced the day’s best score of 66 to take joint third place with Patna’s Aman Raj (70) at 10-under-278.Chandigarh’s Akshay Sharma, the leader in the second and third rounds, ended the week tied fifth at eight-under-280 after his last round of 74. Gurugram’s Veer Ahlawat (72) also claimed tied fifth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tied-at-playoff-kochhar-and-lahiri-s-duel-moves-to-monday/story-rUaG0JjAq5TonfaEzcc29I.html

06-12-2020||Kolkata||‘Will implement new citizenship law in Bengal’: BJP’s Vijayvargiya, Mukul Roy||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will start campaigning from January for implementation of the new citizenship law in poll-bound West Bengal, the party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and national vice-president Mukul Roy announced at a public meeting in Kolkata on Sunday afternoon. The issue is bound to increase political tension in the state as chief minister Mamata Banerjee is opposed to the law and has declared that she will never enforce it. Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is also leader of the party in the Lok Sabha, said, “What stopped the BJP from enforcing the law earlier? Since it is ready to go ahead now it should start with Assam.”The Citizenship (Amendment) Act offers citizenship to non-Muslims who entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before December 31, 2014. Opponents of the law, among whom Banerjee is a prominent face, insist that it is discriminatory and unconstitutional as it leaves out Muslims and links citizenship to faith in a secular country.Accusing Banerjee of appeasing Muslims, Vijayvargiya said at a BJP programme at Mayo Road in Kolkata that his party will hit the streets next month to campaign for the implementation of the law. Also read: BJP-ally RLP supports Bharat Bandh call, threatens to exit coalition“The chief minister calls the Prime Minister outsider. She calls the Union home minister outsider. But to her, the Rohingya refugees, who are spreading terror, and the infiltrators from Bangladesh are not outsiders. Are you (Mamata Banerjee) their aunt?” said Vijayvargiya. “Mamata Ji is opposed to giving citizenship to Hindus who came to India as refugees. Why should we allow that? Do Hindu refugees not have the right to live as citizens with equal status?” he said. Mukul Roy made it clear that the issue would be raised by the BJP during campaign for the crucial assembly elections due in six months. “We will go to the people. Citizenship is an important issue. The TMC cannot read the writing on the wall. That is immaturity in politics. We will win the election with more than 200 (of 294) seats. If we cannot win more than 200 seats all this hard work will mean nothing,” said Roy.The TMC leadership said it will resist all attempts by the BJP to enforce the law in the state. “Mamata Banerjee made her stand clear long ago. We are opposed to the law and we will resist the BJP,” said TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy. CPI(M) lawmaker and leader of the Left parties in the state assembly Sujan Chakraborty said, “We are aware of the BJP’s plans but I will not react right now.”The CPI(M)’s central and state leadership are opposed to the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/will-implement-new-citizenship-law-in-bengal-bjp-s-vijayvargiya-mukul-roy/story-jGJ78XKz3Zo5sO4cA5iKxJ.html
06-12-2020||City||Real estate firm director arrested from Mumbai in cheating case||New Delhi: Police on Sunday said they had arrested a woman director of a real estate company for allegedly duping more than 100 investors to the tune of over R20 crore in the name of providing them residential flats in Raj Nagar Extension in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad. The woman is the wife of a retired officer of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), who is also a director of the company. Police said the man is absconding and is an accused in many cheating cases.Joint commissioner of police (economic offences wing) OP Mishra said several complaints were received by the economic offences wing (EOW) and other police stations in Delhi. The complainants had alleged that they had booked residential flats in the housing project proposed in Raj Nagar Extension by the company. The homebuyers invested money in the project but the firm never delivered the flats and stopped construction without giving any reason, said Mishra.“Later, the investors learnt that the alleged persons had never taken permission for the construction of the housing project from Ghaziabad authority. Subsequently, the authority cancelled the lease of the project. The alleged persons diverted and misappropriated the funds. They shut their offices and went into hiding. Accordingly, many cases were registered and investigated by the EOW,” said Mishra.The investigating team collected intelligence about the absconding suspects. Investigators learnt that the hideout of one of the suspects was in Mumbai. They carried out searches in Mumbai and finally arrested the woman director from Andheri West in Mumbai last week. She was brought to Delhi and her two days police custody was secured from a city court.“Two other directors of the company were arrested earlier from Delhi-NCR while the woman’s husband is yet to be caught,” added the joint CP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/real-estate-firm-director-arrested-from-mumbai-in-cheating-case/story-bMwF0e0CItf6EC2Udx9N7H.html

Of the remaining drains, five are being tapped for sewage treatment completely, while two were tapped to overflow into Yamuna. One drain (drain no 14) had no flow at all, the study found. Due to the discharge of partially treated/untreated sewage and industrial effluents containing phosphorus, foaming has been observed in parts of the river Yamuna, CPCB said in its report.In the past, CPCB had observed that froth formation and increase in ammonia levels in the Yamuna is because of discharge of untreated sewage, non-operation of existing sewage treatment plants, and improper functioning of effluent treatment plants(ETPs) installed by the industries and the common effluent treatment plants(CETPs) located on the banks of the Yamuna. The pollution control board has now directed the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to submit a timebound action plan to ensure compliance of norms by STPs and ETPs and ordered that no untreated sewage should be discharged into drains.The CPCB has also directed Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to take action against non-complying CETPs.In a letter to the DPCC, the CPCB said the state pollution control board has submitted a status report on India e-track portal, mentioning that there were 10 CETPs in Delhi, which are not complying with the prescribed standards as on October 31.A similar letter was also sent to the DJB, where the CPCB said 22 drains were discharging into river Yamuna on a monthly basis. It said the DJB needs to ensure that no untreated domestic wastewater is discharged into any of the 22 stormwater drains or any other water drain.The DPCC and DJB refused to comment on the matter.“This shows a lack of will power to ensure environment protection. The CPCB’s is not a new finding. We have known all these for years. These drains may also end up contaminating areas en route as well on the fringes of the river,” said Shashank Shekhar, assistant professor, department of geology, Delhi University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/14-of-delhi-s-22-main-drains-emptying-untreated-sewage-into-the-yamuna-finds-cpcb/story-xRpN3zsPBoY1xIVVZblvxJ.html

A four cornered battle will now be fought between the AAP, Shiromani Akali Dal ( Badal), Congress and BJP.Warning that the polls this time will not be a cakewalk for other parties, AAP president and member of Parliament (MP) Bhagwant Mann said, “We will be contesting elections in all wards on the party symbol. At present, we are supporting the farmers’ agitation and after that our focus will be on the civic body elections in the state.”Claiming that the Congress was ready for the elections, local MLA and cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said, “The people of Mohali have seen development in the past few years and we are hopeful of winning the elections with a clean majority.”The last five-year term of the civic body ended on April 26 this year. In the 2015 elections, 27 councillors including 10 from the Azad group, 14 from Congress and two independent councillors elected Kulwant Singh (then an independent) as mayor, but later in August 2017, he joined SAD.Among the voters, around 25,000 belong to the scheduled caste (SC) category.

06-12-2020||Chandigarh||Infant’s kidneys a gift of life to teenaged boy at PGIMER||Before she passed, a month old infant gave the gift of life – her kidneys – to a teenage boy battling end stage kidney disease at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) following a delicate and complicated medical procedure.Born on October 28, the infant had brain anomalies that made survival difficult. She was brought to PGIMER on November 25, where she suffered a cardiac arrest on Saturday. “The brave heart parents of a little angel Ababat Kaur Sandhu, who lived for only 39 days, immortalised her with their magnanimous decision of organ donation that kindled ‘hope for life’ for one renal failure terminally ill patient here at PGIMER today,” read a release issued by the institute.As the baby’s parents, Sukhbir Singh Sandhu and Supreet Kaur from Amritsar did not want their daughter’s death to go in vain, doctors quickly performed the rare and intricate operation to remove the infant’s kidneys after she suffered the cardiac arrest and use them to save another life, the release added.Giving details, Prof Ashish Sharma, head, department of renal transplant surgery, PGIMER, shared, “Retrieving organs from children for transplant is rare, it is even more uncommon from such young babies with congenital anomalies.”On the challenges, Dr Sharma said, “the donor was not even 40 days old so retrieval was also not a routine procedure and demanded extreme deftness and skill to accomplish it successfully. Then, the best matched recipient was an adult so both the kidneys were transplanted onto one recipient considering the age factor.” The infant’s father, Sukhbir Singh Sandhu , an agriculture development officer in Punjab, said, “It’s something no family should have to go through. We said ‘yes’ to organ donation because somewhere in our hearts we felt that our daughter’s short mortal journey had a ‘purpose’. She came to this world, only to give life to someone else in so much pain.”“We have done it so that our daughter relives through others. We hope our child’s story will inspire families who find themselves in the same position,” said Supreet Kaur, a science teacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/infant-s-kidneys-a-gift-of-life-to-teenaged-boy-at-pgimer/story-XkTybrznCVjxNL4ayXHPlJ.html
06-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra reports 4,757 new Covid-19 cases, 40 deaths||The state on Sunday reported fewer than 5,000 Covid-19 cases for a second straight day with 4,757 infections pushing the tally to 1,852,266. The toll went up to 47,734 with the addition of 40 deaths.On Sunday, Mumbai recorded 786 infections, taking the tally to 286,053, while 13 more deaths took the toll to 10,896 (after reconciliation of figures). Following Mumbai, Pune reported 622 cases (248 in rural parts, 263 in city and 111 in Pimpri-Chinchwad) and three deaths. Nagpur clocked 490 cases and five deaths, while Nashik reported 395 cases and one death. The state’s cumulative case fatality rate (CFR) stood at 2.58%. According to a recent presentation made to the state cabinet by the public health department, Maharashtra’s growth rate (the pace at which cases are increasing) and the CFR have seen a significant drop. According to data accessed by HT, the state had registered a CFR of around 4.38% on April 30, following which it was 3.10% on August 31 and was 2.58%, as of December 1. However, it continued to be higher than the national average of 1.45%. According to a daily report by the state’s medical education and drugs department of December 6, Maharashtra is preceded only by Punjab, which has a CFR of 3.16%. Gujarat, which had a higher CFR of around 2.42% in early October, saw it drop to 1.87% as of December 6. The growth rate has also come down from 7.28% on April 30 to 0.31%, as of December 1. The doubling rate has also increased from 5.4 days on March 31 to 36.31 days on August 31 and then to 225 days as of December 1. The recovery rate has also gone up from 12.91% on March 31 to 72% on August 31 and 92.49% as of December 1. While the state was wary of a spike in cases post-Diwali, the trends have made state officials hopeful of not experiencing a rise, however, they have a word of caution as they expect a gradual rise from December-end. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, on Sunday said, “In many European countries, cases stabilised for around two-and-a-half months, post which, they saw a surge. If we go by that logic, cases started declining in Maharashtra from October and we might see a surge in January. However, it is right that recent trends do not pose a risk of a second wave, but we cannot be complacent and lower our guard.” Of the 35 districts, the positivity rate in 14 districts is higher than the state average of 16%. Districts like Palghar, Raigad and Nashik have registered a positivity rate of more than 25%, data revealed. Maharashtra has till date tested 11,273,704 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-reports-4-757-new-covid-19-cases-40-deaths/story-VVUZ58OFeCQaQRiSuQovtN.html

06-12-2020||Delhi||Three months on, only 11 south Delhi restaurants apply for al fresco dining licences||It has been nearly three months since the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) approved a policy allowing al fresco dining at restaurants, and the response to scheme has been lukewarm with only 11 restaurant owners applying for licences. Traders attributed the low response to dull business due to pandemic. However, municipal officials are hopeful that more restaurateurs will come forward for licences.According to civic authorities, 11 restaurant owners have sought the SDMC’s consent for open-air dining, which would be granted soon. “Of these 11 applications, three have been granted permission to serve food in the open area which includes terrace, balcony and lawn abutting the licensed eating house. The food must be cooked in closed kitchens and only serving of food would be allowed in the open air. Liquor will only be allowed at licensed terraces/lawns and the restaurant owners will have to install view cutters and high parapet grilles to ensure that there is no inconvenience to other passersby,” a senior official of the civic body said, requesting anonymity.He, however, added that the low response might have been due to the coronavirus pandemic and the situation would improve in a few months. According to traders’ estimates, there are nearly 2,000 restaurants and eateries in south Delhi of which over 100 have open spaces that can be used for al fresco dining.To avail of the benefit of the policy, traders will have to pay a licence fee to the civic body -- ₹100 per square foot for normal restaurants and ₹200 per square foot for star-rated (4 stars and above) restaurants and hotels. This fee will be renewed every year.A restauranteur and a managing committee member of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), Sandeep Goyle said the industry is going through a phase of turmoil due to the pandemic and, ,hence the low response to the open-air dining policy. He said another reason is the fee structure. “They are charging a fee for the entire year, which sums up in lakhs for many restaurants. But seeing less the crowd is these days, we have appealed to the civic body to charge the licence fee to a pro rata basis which means that the civic body should take the fee for the remaining four months of the financial year (December-March) instead of the entire year. If this is adopted, then the number of applications will certainly go up,” he said.Joy Singh, the owner of Raasta Bar and Restaurant in Hauz Khas Village, is one of the 11 applicants. He said his licence is yet to come but he has begun preparations to create the infrastructure required for open-air food serving. “Even after you get the permission, you have to spend money in creating required infrastructure such as the installation of high parapet walls and other measures. Not everyone wishes to bear these extra expenses during the pandemic when the business is dull. We are hopeful that business would pick up towards Christmas and New Year,” Singh said.Anuj Pawra, the owner of Moonshine cafe and bar in Hauz Khas Village, said that he has applied for the licence late last month and i awaiting approval. “I am looking forward to starting the services from December 15. I’m hopeful of a good response as the threat of virus spread is low in open spaces,” Pawra said.He said lack of awareness is also another reason for fewer applicants. “Many restaurant owners still don’t know that the SDMC has allowed al fresco dining. They should create awareness and make the process hassle-free,” Pawra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-months-on-only-11-south-delhi-restaurants-apply-for-al-fresco-dining-licences/story-h9f1y2YK52cckSIejtlbjN.html

06-12-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Power privatisation should not come as a shock||The Punjab and Haryana high court early this week stayed the Chandigarh administration’s move to privatise the power department while acting on the plea of the UT Powermen Union, a worker’s collective that challenged the move. The administration is going for 100% privatisation of distribution and supply functions of the electricity wing of the UT’s engineering department. It took the decision on May 12 after directions from the Centre. An empowered committee has been constituted to oversee and implement the process. The administration has assured the Centre that the process will be completed by the end of this year. As many as 17 firms, including Adani Transmission Limited, Tata Power Company Limited, GMR Generation Asset Limited, NTPC Electricity Supply Limited and Sterlite Power, have expressed interest after the administration on November 9 invited bids for privatisation, which primarily involves the distribution of electricity supply. Authorities say private ownership will improve the efficiency of the power distribution system in the city which has a relatively low demand of around 400MW. The argument against privatisation, however, is that the current system is economically efficient with transmission and distribution losses less than the target of 15% fixed by the power ministry. Consumers also fear that private players taking over would mean hefty electricity bills. The power department at present serves 2.3 lakh consumers in the city. As of now, the administration will be filing a review petition against the high court order. “We will first file a review in the HC, failing which we will move the Supreme Court,” UT adviser Manoj Parida has said. Should UT power department be privatised?Is privatisation necessary, especially when the power department has surplus revenues?

The CCTV footage of the murder surfaced on social media on Sunday and a woman friend of the victim is seen trying to help him after chasing away the attackers. The firing was also caught on camera, though the faces of the attackers, the victim and his friend are not clearly visible.As many as seven bullets were fired and five of them hit the 25-year-old man, identified as Bharat Solanki alias Yuvin, killing him on the spot. Solanki had a criminal background and was involved in three or four criminal cases, including extortion and robbery, said deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pramod Kumar Mishra.DCP Mishra said Solanki was with his woman friend and they had gone to a grocery shop in Sector 24 on Friday evening. Around 7pm, Solanki came out of the shop and headed to his car with the purchased goods. The woman remained in the shop, the DCP said.Just then, the assailants, who were lying in wait, opened fire at him. The CCTV footage shows Solanki talking to someone sitting in a white car, while one of the assailants walked up to Solanki and fired a couple of shots at him. As Solanki fell on the road, another assailant, seen wearing a cap, pumped around five more bullets into him.“Hearing the gunshots, the woman came out of the shop and rushed to help Solanki. Seeing her, the assailants fled just as she started chasing them. We are questioning her and have not given (her) a clean chit in the case so far,” said DCP Mishra.The CCTV footage shows that the man wearing a cap was firing when the woman bumped into him. She is seen crouching to avoid being shot. Soon as the assailants fled, the person in the white car also sped away and the woman rushed to help Solanki.According to the DCP, the motive behind the murder and the identity of the assailants are yet to be ascertained. He said a case of murder was registered at the Begampur police station and personal enmity and love affair angles were being probed. Solanki was associated with a gang, a few members of which are in jail.“Gang rivalry could also be the reason behind Solanki’s murder. All possible motives are being probed,” Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-shot-dead-in-sector-24-rohini-video-footage-of-killing-surfaces-on-social-media/story-nGwKV0rJdVDvg26lrwY0LI.html
06-12-2020||Delhi||‘Ek baari mai kar do’: South Delhi civic body councillor caught asking Rs 10 lakh bribe on tape||South Delhi councillor Manoj Mehlawat, arrested by the CBI for allegedly taking Rs 10 lakh bribe from a builder, was caught on tape telling the complainant that “ab hamari source of income salary nahi hai...aise hi hoga (now salary is not my source of income...it will be like this only”, the agency has claimed. The BJP has suspended Mehlawat from its primary membership after his arrest last week. The Councillor’s remarks were caught on tape during a covert verification exercise by the CBI into the allegations against him. The builder had approached the CBI alleging that Mehlawat had repeatedly called him on phone demanding Rs 10 lakh as bribe to allow the construction of a house in the posh Vasant Kunj area without any hindrance. The councillor threatened the builder that he could not only demolish the ongoing construction project but also not allow him to “lay a single brick” in future. After receiving the complaint, the CBI, as a standard operating procedure, provided the complainant with a digital tape recorder and an independent witness to verify the allegations. During the conversation caught on tape, Mehlawat allegedly asked for full payment of bribe to allow the construction work to go on. “Main toh kehta hoon bhai ek baari mai kar do...baar baar se achcha hai...Hume bhi kisi ka kuch karna hota hai bhai...Ab hamari source of income salary nahi hai...aise hi hoga (I am saying pay in one go...it is better than installments...We also have to take care of others...Now our source of income is not salary...it will happen like this),” the councillor had allegedly told the builder at his office in Kaveri Apartments in Vasant Kunj. The conversation was caught on tape and corroborated by the independent witness. It is now part of the FIR. The CBI made public its FIR on Sunday evening nearly three days after Mehlawat was nabbed by the agency while taking the bribe as against the Supreme Court directive to make the FIR public within 24 hours as far as possible. Mehlawat became councillor of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation from Vasant Kunj in 2017 elections. According to media reports, there were serious complaints against him from local leaders but he became a prominent face in the local unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ek-baari-mai-kar-do-south-delhi-civic-body-councillor-caught-asking-rs-10-lakh-bribe-on-tape/story-rMoXuSieqgPZJdQkatrxGL.html
06-12-2020||Delhi||With drum and cymbals, women make a musical protest at Chilla border||As the male members of their families have been camping at Chilla border and protesting against the three new farm laws since Tuesday, seven women from Charoli village in Uttar Pradesh’s Jewar arrived at the protest venue on Sunday morning, carrying with them carrying traditional musical instruments such as dhol (drums) and manjiras (cymbals).Throughout Sunday, seven women, aged between 60 and 75 years, registered their protest through songs in their local dialect and demanded that the three farm laws be scrapped. The women said they would stay put at the venue until their demands are met by the government. The women said apart from participating in the protests, they will also assist with cooking meals for farmers who have been camping at Chilla border, which is completely closed to vehicular traffic since Saturday. “My husband, two sons and grandsons have been protesting here for the past six days. We thought that they would return after a day or two. But as the government has not accepted the demands of farmers, even after five rounds of meetings, we decided to come here and support our men. There was no point sitting idle at home while the men in our families fight this battle while braving the chill,” said Veerwat Devi,75.When the women arrived around 11am, the male protesters greeted them and informed everyone about their arrival through loudspeakers. Without wasting time, the women sat on the road, took out their musical instruments and began singing songs that, they said, they composed themselves. Soon, many male protesters too joined in.“This fight is not only of our men -- they do not produce crops alone. If we contribute to farming in our villages, why can’t we be a part of the agitation? If the situation demands it, even the younger women and children of our villages will join the protest. We can remain hungry for days and are ready to die here if the government will not scrap the laws,” said Rajni Devi, who was playing the dhol.After finishing their first round of singing, the women went to the makeshift community kitchen, enquired about lunch preparations and offered help.“We will cook dinner tonight for everyone. Our protest will now continue till the government meets our demands,” said Ratan Kaur, 75, the eldest among the seven.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-drum-and-cymbals-women-make-a-musical-protest-at-chilla-border/story-xrKnzlUYcQRllD2LL7xpEK.html

While a group of farmers booed the TV news crew away, farmer leaders from Punjab took over the mic -- effectively ending these men’s active participation there.“We mentioned Shaheen Bagh in the hope that it would inspire farmers to carry on their protests until the government gave in to their demands. The farmers cheered us, but we didn’t expect to attract unnecessary attention from the media,” said Ghulam Rabbani, who lives in Okhla and runs a publishing business. About 20 men from various places in Delhi had arrived at the Singhu Border in four cars. “We brought along blankets and some food items. We didn’t face any problems until we reached there,” said Sibghatullah, who lives in Okhla and has a construction business. “I may not be a farmer, but my background is farming and I understand a farmer’s pain. That is why we decided to extend our support to them,” said Sibghatullah. Mohammad Zafaruddin Bakrati, who lives in Batla House and runs a monthly news magazine, said he was among those who addressed the farmers. “The farmers welcomed us without caring about our identity. It is Sunday and we decided to use the off day to extend our solidarity,” said Bakrati.Farmers at the gathering said it didn’t matter to them where the supporters were coming from. “We are respecting people from all places and all religions and setting an example. I felt sad to see the address by them being interrupted. Isn’t Shaheen Bagh in India?” said Sukwinder Singh, a resident of Sabhra village in Tarn Taran and joint secretary of Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan Committee (Punjab).While the men took a back seat following the interruption, the farmers continued to receive donations from people arriving from Delhi. One such donation was two multi-charging stations for mobile phones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/shaheen-bagh-echo-in-singhu-as-group-from-okhla-and-jamia-nagar-visits-farmers-with-donations/story-fspSEkoRxZxBGhNWNWcc3L.html

The farmers want these laws to be repealed. If the prime minister wants to help the farmers, he should implement the measures suggested in the Swaminathan Commission’s Report.”8 दिसम्बर को देश के किसानों की आवाज पर @RLPINDIAorg भारत बंद का समर्थन करती है ! कृषि बिलो व किसान आंदोलन को लेकर मीडिया के साथ आज हुई चर्चा के अंश आपके साथ साझा कर रहा हुं !#भारत_बंद #किसान_आंदोलन_दिल्ली pic.twitter.com/lCLRCcrPU5He also called the newly passed bills ‘black laws’ and said that after December 8 RLP officials will hold a meeting to decide whether they want to continue extending their support to the NDA-led government.Beniwal said, “We fully support the farmer groups’ call for Bharat Bandh. I also urge the RLP workers to peacefully participate in the Bandh and extend their support to farmers.’The Rashtriya Loktantrik Party had earlier requested the Centre to alleviate the concerns regarding the newly passed farm bills. The political party from Rajasthan was formed by Hanuman Beniwal, MP from Nagaur, in 2018. He was formerly a BJP leader.Beniwal on November 30 asked home minister Amit Shah to reconsider the newly passed laws or else RLP will have to rethink its ties with the BJP. He said, “Today, I have written to Shah that if the laws aren’t withdrawn, then we will reconsider our alliance with NDA.”He also said that he would not hesitate towards marching to Delhi. He further added, “We are with the farmers and if required will march to Delhi. The PM and Shah should hold dialogue with farmers, and provide space to hold a dharna in the capital. If any kind of ill-treatment is done with the farmers, then the farmers of the entire country will be on streets to gherao Delhi.”Earlier, the Shiromani Akali Dal quit the NDA-coalition over the passage of the farm bills. SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal had resigned from her union ministry post ending the two-decade-long relationship between the BJP and SAD.The farmers have called for a Bharat Bandh on December 8 demanding that the government repeal the bills - Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/bjp-ally-rlp-supports-bharat-bandh-call-threatens-to-exit-coalition/story-Dc2zFofSDPocZHLIScoVmL.html

We will ride our tractors into the national capital and will do farming on the lawns of India Gate.”Tikait said the farmers will allot each lawn to different ministers and members of Parliament.“We will allot each lawn near India Gate to different MPs and ministers and put up a board specifying which lawn belongs to whom. We will give the government a chance to get a first-hand experience of how we cultivate the produce so that they understand our plight...The government should not underestimate farmers.”Urging farmers not to use “objectionable language” and avoid “political references” in their speeches, Tikait said, “We should not let anyone take political advantage from our movement. Limit your speeches and talks to topics related to the movement.”On Sunday, the crowd was thin at the Ghazipur border with several farmers returning to their villages in UP and Uttarakhand to check on their fields. Chandra Pal Singh, a farmer from Bhojpur village in Ghaziabad, said, “Many of our brothers have left to check on their fields back home and they will return before December 8 to participate in the Bharat Bandh call given by farmers. We will assemble here in large numbers before December 8.”The Ghazipur protest site got visitors from neighbouring Noida and Ghaziabad on Sunday. Dharmendra Singh, a Railway Protection Force personnel from Meerut, said, “I took two days off to come here and extend my solidarity to the protesting farmers. All of us are directly or indirectly connected to farmers and we cannot survive without them.

In a statement issued here, Thakur, citing a report of Union health ministry, said Himachal’s seven districts were on the top of the list of most affected 19 districts of the country. “Shimla district has the highest growth rate of 15.3% in Covid cases and things are spiraling out of control,” he said, adding that sub-divisional headquarters Rohru and Rampur besides Sanjauli and Pandali of Kotkhai have been declared as containment zone.“The corona situation in Theog assembly constituency also remains worrying,” he said, adding that the death rate has also gone up across the state with 208 people succumbing to the virus in last 22 days.The ex-MLA from Jubbal-Kotkhai constituency said the situation in the state’s health institutions was going from bad to worst. “There is a huge shortage of oxygen cylinders. The government should give priority to the health of people over the PRI polls,” he said.“Amid this situation, there will be nominal participation of people in the polls and it would just be a formality. According to the World Health Organisation, Covid-19 infections are likely to spread more and PRI polls in such a situation would be disastrous,” he said.Thakur said the vaccine is expected in the next six months and the government can conduct the elections after it arrives. “If there is any constitutional hurdle in deferring the elections, the state government should take up the matter and resolve it before the central government,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-leader-wants-hp-govt-to-defer-panchayati-raj-institution-polls-amid-covid-surge/story-57gKPD8JHOpOvJfQzzBimN.html

The Committee sought a fresh medical fitness certificate for the mother from a government hospital and a decision on with whom to keep the toddler is expected in a few days, the official said.Meanwhile, a person claiming to be the toddler’s biological father has approached the authorities, the official said, adding they will match his DNA report. A DNA test last month confirmed the woman is the toddler’s biological mother.The toddler may be placed with the Children’s Aid Society at Mankhurd here as per provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, before the issue is resolved, the official said.As per the Centre’s model guidelines for foster care, a foster family can adopt a child after five years of care, if the child has no biological family claiming her.“We have been informed that the director, who is married and has a son, is not looking to adopt the toddler,” the official said. However, seeing the mothers condition, he became apprehensive and requested that the child be in foster care for a little longer till she is fine, the official added.The NGO founder has informed the Committee that the woman may develop ‘severe reactive depression’ if kept away from her son for long, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/biological-mother-demands-custody-of-child-under-filmmaker-s-care/story-HoVmG9QX3JM0CtoHE0GSqO.html

06-12-2020||Chandigarh||Deol hopeful that discussions between Centre, farmers will be fruitful||Actor-turned-politician Sunny Deol on Sunday said that he supports the government’s farm bills as he believes that these were introduced to bring reforms in the agriculture sector. Expressing hope that a solution will be reached soon, Deol asked other political parties and groups to allow the agitating farmers’ unions and the government to hold discussions peacefully. Deol posted a statement on Twitter where he said, “I request the entire world that this matter remains between our farmers and the government. Do not interfere, because they will find a way after holding discussions. I know that many people want to take advantage of it and create problems. They are not thinking of the farmers and may have their own agenda.”Deol, through his statement, also chose to distance himself from actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu’s comments made on November 30. Deep Sidhu had canvassed for Sunny Deol during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Deol said, “Deep Sidhu, who was with me during the election has not been with me for a long time and whatever he is speaking, he is saying on his own. I am in no way related to his activities. I stand with my party and farmers and will always be with farmers. Our government always thinks of the betterment of farmers and I am sure that the government will ensure the right outcome after holding talks with farmers.”Sidhu, who has actively participated in the protests, faced criticism from several sections for allegedly raising pro-Khalistan slogans.During the protests, Sidhu while speaking with a Haryana police official had said, “Ye inquilab hai. Ye revolution hai. If they don’t understand the seriousness of this matter, it will define the political structure and the geopolitics of India as well as South Asia.”He further said, “It is going to be very sad for them. If you take away farmers’ land, then what do they have left? Only debt?”The video of this conversation went viral and AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh on November 30 termed Sidhu as pro-Khalistani. Singh had said, “The man who is standing in this picture (with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sunny Deol and another man) is raising slogans of ‘Khalistan zindabad’ during farmers’ protests. Now, it is clear that BJP is making attempts to defame farmers’ agitation with the help of its own people. The PM should clarify what relationship he has with the man who is demanding Khalistan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/deol-hopeful-that-discussions-between-centre-farmers-will-be-fruitful/story-7KJaiMEfND88biahPlTsyJ.html

The activists have stated that any kind of construction will hamper the purpose of public gardens and squeeze into the open green areas. The state government’s Urban Development department issued a notification on Friday, December 5, approving uniform land and building development rules for local civic bodies in Maharashtra under its “Ease of doing business” plan. Under these rules, covered under the Permissible in Proposed Reservations Garden, the state has mentioned that in addition to the main use of a garden, construction of an open swimming pool and allied constructions, including a water tank, rain water harvesting system, gardener/watchman’s quarter, small restaurant or food stalls to the extent of 20 square metres may be permitted. Total FSI used for such constructions shall not exceed 4% of the garden area. Currently only 10 per cent of construction is allowed under existing development control rules. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had passed an order in 2015 restricting construction inside gardens. Now, new rules have given permission to develop open swimming pools and allied constructions, including a water tank and rain-water harvesting system. PMC’s garden department chief Ashok Ghorpade said, “The decision may squeeze the open space of the garden as food stalls or small restaurants will occupy some area and it will encourage people to come for eating. There are eateries outside the garden. There is no need to allow food stalls inside the garden. It will create an unnecessary nuisance to other people who regularly come to the garden for health purposes. At the same time PMC is providing separate swimming-pool facilities to people under public amenities. There is no need for swimming pools in garden space.” Kill the purpose of garden Sarang Yadwadkar, city-based environmentalist, said, “Corporations can develop swimming pools, and food stalls in amenity spaces. But here, they are pushing into garden areas. That means they don’t want to use amenity space for these social causes. They want to lease out amenity space to private players and push these amenities in garden areas. It will create a cement concrete structure in the garden and spoil the clean and green purpose of the garden. Gardens are the lungs of the city. We should take care of it.” Civic activist Sudhir Kulkarni said, “In the case of the Sambhaji garden, NGT had pulled up PMC on issue more than 10 per cent RCC construction in the garden area and ordered excessive construction to be cleared and RCC construction to be restrained. Unified rules are creating obstacles for gardens.” NGT order on construction in Sambhaji garden For development in the Sambhaji garden, PMC had allowed 15 per cent construction in garden premises. However, residents had filed a litigation in NGT against construction in the Sambhaji garden in 2015 NGT gave directives to stop construction and demolish constructions in the Sambhaji garden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/environment-activists-decry-new-dc-rules-allowing-construction-in-garden-spaces/story-Nz7XIwC11QvT9faSgxqpHL.html

Now the government is facing problems because of that haste,” Pawar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Lending his support to the protesting farmers’ unions from Punjab, the NCP chief said he fears that farmers from all over the country will support them if the situation is not resolved quickly. Pawar also highlighted that protesting farmers in Haryana and Punjab are the main cultivators of paddy and wheat, both of which are essential foodgrains.The monsoon session witnessed heated arguments between the ruling NDA and the opposition parties in both houses. The bills - Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill - were passed in the Lok Sabha due to BJP’s majority in the Lower House but its passage in the Rajya Sabha witnessed a lot of chaos.On September 22, Aam Aadmi Party’s Sanjay Singh, Derek O’Brien and Dola Sen (Trinamool Congress); Congress’ Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain, and Ripun Borah; and KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem of the Communist Party of India (M) were suspended for a week for unruly behaviour.These MPs had protested against the passage of these bills inside the well of the House and were suspended for behaving in an unruly manner.

Volunteers are currently under observation for any medical symptoms, according to hospital authorities. The vaccine was also one of the first in the world to be registered as a measure against Covid-19 disease and had gained world attention after the Russian president Vladimir Putin claimed its safety. The hospital is one of the first in the state to administer the vaccine for its phase two trials.The hospital had administered the dose to 17 volunteers who came to the hospital over the past three days. Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, said, “This is the phase two trial of the vaccine and is probably the first in the country to administer it to volunteers. We will keep observing the volunteers for the next few days and report it to the sponsors.” Although the vaccine has been manufactured by the Russian Ministry of Health, it is being manufactured and distributed in India by Hyderabad-headquartered Dr Reddy’s Laboratories.Another doctor at Noble Hospital, said, “We have got a protocol for administering the vaccine which has certain conditions, including the age of the volunteer which needs to be above 18 years of age. The volunteers need to be healthy which means they should not have any comorbidities. Also, we will only collect the samples from the volunteers for antibodies and Covid-19 testing which would be tested by Dr Reddy’s, who are the sponsors for this vaccination. Two doses of the vaccine would be given and we have 17 volunteers with us who were administered the vaccine in the past three days after we scrutinised the candidates.”The volunteers were selected randomly and now will be followed up for the next few days. The volunteers have been given an online form to fill in if they notice any symptoms. The doctors also said that the volunteers would be followed up telephonically for flu-like symptoms. The doctors said, “The storage temperature of the vaccine is minus 20 degrees Celsius till it is injected. It has to be thawed and liquified before it is injected. This is the second vaccine undergoing trials in Pune.”IMA expresses concernsThe Indian Medical Association (IMA) has expressed concern over the fact that even if the vaccine comes out in December and is approved by the ICMR, the inoculation or the administering of the vaccine would be only possible in the next 2-3 months. The IMA listed several problems in the country, including the need to maintain a cold chain throughout from the manufacturing site to the vaccination centre and that any disruption in the cold chain would make the vaccine ineffective. The mRNA vaccines need to maintain the temperature around minus 25 degrees to minus 70 degrees in some of the vaccine types.In India, the additional conditions would be of transport vehicles with the facilities to maintain the required temperature and currently the government does not have such facilities and may require outsourcing it, which will take quite some time, as per the IMA. The government hospitals, primary health centres and sub-centres will have to install refrigeration cold stores maintaining such low temperature levels. At present in India there are not many such facilities and the state government is planning to install it and it will take a minimum of 2-3 months for that, said IMA.“The additional challenges would be providing 24x7 electricity to deep freezing machinery. To inoculate 130 crore of the Indian population, government staff will not be sufficient and the government may need to employ additional staff or will have to outsource it to private hospitals. Considering all these points, we feel that even if the vaccine is available in December 2020, the inoculation drive may not begin for the next 2 to 3 months,” said officials of the IMA.The IMA in its letter states that the government may take a decision to provide the vaccine at select metros, but again it will create discontent in the masses especially from rural India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-hospital-starts-sputnik-v-phase-two-trials-volunteers-under-observation/story-59HtxkigsXs07KpVfSw2mK.html

The body of the deceased, a farmer, was found at a tin-shed located at Varale village of Khed taluka on December 1. The Pune police said that the murder took place around midnight on November 30. The arrested have been identified as Avinash Baban Rathod, who drives an excavator for a living and is a resident of Mohkhed village of Jintur in Parbhani and Wasim Jabbar of Balan Bazar in Munger district of Bihar. Their accomplice, a native of Bihar, is on the run. The deceased has been identified as Bhikaji Vinayak Panmand (58) of Khed. Panmand had hired Rathod for killing the second wife of his son Ajit Panmand (30) for he was against the relationship as his son has a first wife and two children with her, according to the police. The Satara-based second wife has recently delivered a baby with Ajit, police said. “They had taken Rs 1,34,000 from the deceased under the pretext of killing the woman, but they did not kill her. They probably had no intention of killing her. They took the contract money and bought illegal weapons from Uttar Pradesh. The farmer was pressuring them to either return the money or finish the job. The hired killers called him to the shed, where he was later found dead. They did ask him to bring Rs 3 lakh more, and may had an altercation and killed him there,” said Krishna Prakash, commissioner of Pimpri-Chinchwad police. “Ajit has been married for five years and around the same time, he claims to have started the affair. He told his family that he went to Alandi and married the second time. However, his family learned about it two years ago and it has been a constant source of tension in their family,” said senior inspector Arvind Pawar of Mahalunge police outpost in Chakan police station jurisdiction. While the two men from Bihar held the farmer’s arms, Rathod strangled him with a cloth belt which came apart during the act after which the hired man strangled him to death with his hands, according to the police. The police had initially registered an accidental death report as there were no clear signs or motive for the murder. However, upon investigation, they found a cheap mobile phone in his name which was used only to contact Rathod, according to Prakash. A case under Sections 302 (murder), 201 (criminal conspiracy), 120(b) (destruction of evidence) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections of Arms Act was registered at Chakan police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/two-contract-killers-murder-pune-man-who-hired-them-for-killing-his-son-s-second-wife/story-HSWgKG6YCNo2VrGE0zkG0O.html

Pune has reported only a slight rise in the number of fresh Covid-19 positive cases over the past few weeks as compared to the previous month. It has been 21 days since the country celebrated Diwali (November 14) which is also the incubation period for the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection. There were speculations of witnessing a second wave post the festive season due to the lifting of the lockdown restrictions and social interactions. Prior to Diwali (November 14), the district reported 400-500 Covid-19 cases on a daily basis. This has currently has gone up to 900 Covid-19 cases in 24 hours.Although the civic administration had prepared for the worst case scenario, the city has reported only a slight rise in the number of daily cases and with a stable recovery rate, the number of active cases have also not gone up. As per the state health department, as of November 13, the recovery rate of the district had been 93.3% while as of December 4, the recovery rate has reduced to about 92.4 per cent. On November 13, there were 15,904 active cases in the district while as of December 4, there are 19,553 active cases in the district. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who chairs Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “It is a good thing that the city has not reported a spike in Covid-19 cases as witnessed in Delhi. It must be because of the discipline that the people observed, but it is a positive thing and we need to maintain this plateau for the next 15 days. If we are able to do that, then, we would be in a much better position to combat the pandemic. Currently, wearing a mask is the only preventive measure.” Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, head of department of microbiology at BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, said, “It is the nature of the virus that only the less aggressive strain or the mutation of the virus passes on from one host to another as the virus does not want to kill the host, but to stay as long as possible in it. This is the reason why we are not reporting many deaths as we did in the months of July and August.”Glimmer of hopePune district is reporting only a slight rise in the number of cases post the festive season.Recovery rate: As per the state health department, as of 13 November, the recovery rate of the district was 93.3%.

06-12-2020||Pune||Graduates’ constituency result rings alarm bell for Pune BJP unit||The defeat of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supported candidate during Pune graduates’ and teachers’ constituency may prompt ghar-wapsi of many Congress and NCP workers who had joined BJP during 2017 civic elections when BJP emerged victorious. The victory of Maha Vikas Aghadi candidates Arun Lad (NCP) and Jayant Asgaonkar (Congress) has elated the mood in local units of both parties as they expect the outcome will have a positive impact on municipal corporation elections. The Pune graduates’ constituency was once dominated by BJP with leaders like Prakash Javadekar and Chandrakant Patil representing it. The party was hoping that positive outcome in recent graduates’ and teachers’ constituency polls will help it retain control over the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) polls scheduled in February 2022. The BJP currently has a strong presence of 98 corporators in the 162-member civic body. According to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) city unit president and MLA Chetan Tupe, though there were five MLC elections, they were conducted in most districts in the state and mainly four regions which include western Maharashtra, Vidharbha, Marathwada and North Maharashtra. “We can consider it as a trial run. Everywhere the voters have given us a clear mandate. At the same time, these results would definitely make an impact on the civic body elections,” said Tupe while stressing that many of the Congress and NCP leaders who had left before 2017, will return home.The Congress has 11 corporators while NCP and Shiv Sena has 40 and 10 corporators respectively in the PMC. The three parties have already hinted that they are likely to fight polls together. BJP city unit president Jagdish Mulik said there won’t be any impact on the municipal election. Mulik said, “MLC election and local self-government elections are different. Winning one election does not mean that voters are with the Maha Vikas Aghadi. Success is not permanent. Even in graduate constituency, Pune city had given a lead to the BJP candidate. I don’t think that any of our members are willing to join the Maha Vikas Aghadi.” Mulik said, “It is true that we tried to register a maximum number of voters for the graduate constituency. But most of the names do not appear in the final voter list.” BJP leader Ujwal Keskar said, “In every election, some people use to join other parties. Those who are sure of not getting ticket from particular party, try to join other party. Some people might go but it would not affect the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/graduates-constituency-result-rings-alarm-bell-for-bjp-for-pune-civic-body-polls/story-D2fAzs6u3UmjmBj5qeNIcM.html

They continued their sit-in demonstrations on Sunday against the three farm laws enacted by the government after the fifth round of talks between their leaders and Union ministers failed to break the impasse.Farmers worry these laws will eliminate the safety net of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with mandis that ensure earning. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their crop. The government is holding talks with farmers, who have called for a Bharat Bandh on December 8 and threatened to occupy toll plazas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-protest-delhi-traffic-police-suggests-alternate-routes-for-commuters/story-TrkrIYzNI7oxd5fZpLlMAM.html

06-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘very poor’, may improve over next 2 days: IMD||Delhi’s air quality was recorded in the upper end of the “very poor category” on Sunday and is likely to improve over the next two days due to a predicted increase in the wind speed, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The air quality had turned severe on Saturday with slow wind speed allowing the accumulation of locally-generated pollutants, according to the weather bureau.Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) was 394 at 9am on Sunday. The 24-hour average was 404 on Saturday, which falls in the severe category. It was 382 on Friday, 341 on Thursday, 373 on Wednesday, 367 on Tuesday, 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday. Air pollution in the neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad (AQI 430), Greater Noida (404) and Noida (404) continued to remain in the severe zone.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.The minimum temperature was 11.4 degrees Celsius on Sunday and the maximum is likely to settle around 28 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.VK Soni, the head of IMD’s environment research centre, said the wind speed remained slow allowing the accumulation of pollutants generated locally. “Easterly winds carrying moisture also led to the formation of secondary particulate matter. All these factors together pushed the air quality in the ‘severe’ zone,” he said, according to news agency PTI.However, Soni said, the air quality is likely to be in the “poor category” by Monday due to an expected increase in the wind speed. According to IMD, the maximum wind speed is likely to be 8kmph on Sunday and 15kmph on Monday. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-very-poor-may-improve-over-next-2-days-imd/story-PU3ftiNxKHu9JgJAdp1W5N.html

06-12-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand drone force readies for Covid-19 vaccination in remote areas||Amid reports of the Covid-19 vaccination drive likely to start in coming weeks, Uttarakhand’s Drone Application and Research Centre (DARC) under Information Technology Development Agency (ITDA) is gearing up for possible application of drones to supply the vaccine doses in remote areas of the state.The state government has already set up a task force at state, district and block level to implement and monitor the vaccination process once it starts.The government machinery is now working more actively in this regard after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that the vaccine for Covid-19 would be launched in next few weeks.Citing the steps taken by the state government, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had said that the biggest challenge in the vaccination process would be storage and logistics. Considering it, the use of drones by the DARC, which is the country’s first such body, could be significant.The state has been already using drones to detect forest fires, poaching, for policing and also in disaster management.DARC conducted trials to carry vaccines by drone.Amit Sinha, inspector general, Uttarakhand police and director of ITDA said, “The drones can be definitely used to carry the Covid-19 vaccines in areas which are difficult to reach or take more time. We have already conducted a successful test a few weeks back.”“Under the test, we had flown a fixed wing drone carrying a vaccine of a disease in an ice-box from the DARC in Dehradun to Mussoorie. It reached the desired point in Mussoorie in about half an hour covering 14km and then returned after dropping the package. In about one hour it covered about 30 km,” said Sinha.Also Read: Tourists violating Covid-19 preventive norms in Nainital to be finedHe also informed that the agency had also successfully tested a drone to carry blood samples of a patient from Dehradun to a village in Tehri Garhwal.“The agency is fully ready to use drones in the vaccination process with its expertise. If needed it would also associate with the private individual drone users and developers who are associated with the agency in development of the unmanned aerial vehicles here,” said Sinha. The ITDA at present has about 12 drones including Quadcopters and fixed-wing vehicles, Sinha added. “The Quadcopters can fly for less time while the fixed wing ones can fly for more time and cover longer distances. The fixed ones are used for carrying vaccines or medicines as per requirement. We can develop more fixed-wing drones at the centre if needed. Have already been supplying (drones) to the state disaster management department for various uses,” said Sinha. The state health department which is the forefront force handling the ongoing pandemic and would also monitor the vaccination process, said it is yet to take a decision on the use of drones for Covid-19 vaccine delivery.“As of now, as initial preparation for the vaccination process, we have formed the task force at various levels. On the use of drones, we haven’t taken any decision but can mull it once the vaccination process starts,” said Amit Negi, state health secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-drone-force-readies-for-covid-19-vaccination-in-remote-areas/story-X0dmfRydgYc4AyAQfbpzsM.html

06-12-2020||Mumbai||Congress slams Pawar’s statement on Rahul||A Maharashtra Congress leader on Saturday urged the constituents of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition to stop commenting on the Congress leadership if they want a “stable” government in the state.State Congress working president and Women and Child Minister Yashomati Thakur’s remarks came days after Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar’s comments on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.“Everybody should follow the basic rules of coalition. Being a working president of MPCC, I must appeal to colleagues of MVA that if you want stable government in Maharashtra then stop commenting on leadership of Congress (sic),” Thakur tweeted.“Our leadership is very strong and stable. Formation of MVA is a result of our strong belief in democratic values,” she added.In an interview to a local daily, Pawar had said that Rahul Gandhi’s leadership has a “few problems” and lacks consistency. The Sena, NCP and Congress are partners in the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government. They had joined hands after the Assembly elections held last year.Clarifying Pawar’s remarks, NCP and Sena leaders said that the comments had no connection with the stability of the three-party state government. NCP spokesperson Umesh Patil said, “Pawarsaheb’s statement must be taken positively, looking at his age and experience. [Yashomati] Thakur’s comment on the stability of the government is unnecessary. There is good coordination within the MVA.” Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the statement must be viewed as “directions”. “Whatever Sharad Pawar might have said about Rahul Gandhi, it has nothing to do with the stability of Maha Vikas Aghadi. I have always stood behind Rahul Gandhi, when his leadership was being damaged. Sharad Pawar is a tall leader in politics. The opposition parties in the country consider Pawarsaheb their leader. When an experienced leader like him says something, it must be viewed as directions...,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/congress-slams-pawar-s-statement-on-rahul/story-HOY0RFyUbKZmKp6EEBlNnM.html
06-12-2020||Kolkata||CID names BJP’s Mukul Roy as accused in TMC MLA Murder case||The West Bengal Criminal Investigation Department has named senior BJP leader Mukul Roy as a co-accused in a 2019 murder case.In its second supplementary chargesheet, filed in a local court in Nadia on Saturday, the CID has charged Roy under sections 302 (murder) and 120b (party to criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.An FIR was registered against the top BJP leader and three others in February 2019, a day after Trinamool Congress MLA Satyajit Biswas from Krishnagunj in Nadia district was shot dead by unidentified assailants. Roy, a former veteran of the ruling TMC in Bengal, had joined the BJP in November 2017. BJP Lok Sabha MP from the district’s Ranaghat constituency Jagannath Sarkar was also named in the police complaint. Roy, however, dismissed the charges and said, “There are at least 45 cases pending against me. I do not believe in the politics of violence and never indulge in such kinds of things. I challenge chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is also the police minister to say it in public that I have such kind of taste,” news agency PTI quoted Roy as saying.BJP’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya called the chargesheet a “conspiracy of CM Mamata Banerjee”. “Mamta Banerjee’s conspiracy continues. The false murder chargesheet against Mukul Roy shows how she is trying to suppress the opposition by her conspiracy,” Vijayvargiya said. “The matter is under investigation and in the court. The law will take its own course,” said a senior TMC leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cid-names-bjp-s-mukul-roy-as-accused-in-tmc-mla-murder-case/story-TO7mHvE6sH2dn7mIcRoojJ.html

06-12-2020||Chandigarh||Jeev Milkha Singh Invitational 2020 golf tourney: Chandigarh’s Akshay Sharma continues as leader||The overnight leader, Chandigarh’s Akshay Sharma, capitalised on his familiarity with his home conditions once again as he managed to pull himself out of trouble on Day 3 to continue as the frontrunner in the title race for the Jeev Milkha Singh Invitational 2020 Presented by TAKE Sports held at Chandigarh Golf Club on Saturday.Akshay, 30, played one-under-71 but managed to stay at the top of the leaderboard after the end of the third round of the Rs 1.5-crore event. His three-day tally is 10-under-206.Noida’s Amardeep Malik, who was overnight tied second, also returned a 71 on Saturday to be placed second at nine-under-207.Pre-tournament favourite Anirban Lahiri (70) gained two spots to occupy tied third at eight-under-208 along with Patna’s Aman Raj (68) and Gurugram’s Veer Ahlawat (72). While Aman gained seven spots in round three, Veer dropped one spot.Another Chandigarh golfer, Karandeep Kochhar, produced the round’s best score for the second day in succession as he shot a 67 to rise 12 positions to sixth place at seven-under-209.Akshay Sharma (67-68-71) found himself in a hole when he dropped early bogeys on the first and fourth, not being able to strike it accurately due to the wind. However, he got in his stride with a 20-feet birdie conversion from just off the green on the 10th.“The weather conditions were the toughest today, especially when I started. It was extremely windy, so club selection was difficult, and that resulted in bogeys for me early on. On the front-nine I found only four greens in regulation and just couldn’t hit it close enough,” said Sharma. “I’m generally one-under on the first four holes, but being two-over this time, there was some pressure on me. The pressure only released with the 20-feet birdie conversion on the 10th. I knew I could get a few more birdies thereafter, so I was in good rhythm from there on,” he added.Amardeep Malik (68-68-71), another two-time winner on PGTI, came up with an eagle, three birdies and four bogeys during his 71 to keep himself in the hunt. He struck a fabulous approach on the par-5 13th to set up a five feet eagle conversion. He also closed the day in style with a birdie chip-in on the 18th from behind the green.The highlight of Veer Ahlawat’s round was his massive tee shot on the par-5 13th that landed just short of 400 yards.Anirban Lahiri (70-68-70) continued to make his gradual progression up the leaderboard with his 70 which featured three birdies and a bogey. He also recovered well from the bushes to make par on the 16th.“It was another good day of ball-striking, but the toughest day for me on the greens. I missed so many putts inside 10 feet and also missed a couple of three-footers,” said Lahiri. “However, I feel I didn’t hit too many bad putts. I made a lot of good strokes, but had a few bad breaks today. I feel as long as I’m stroking it well on the greens and doing what I need to do, I should have nothing to complain about,” he added. Among the other prominent names, SSP Chawrasia (70) was tied 21st at one-under-215, Gaganjeet Bhullar (74) was tied 36th at two-over-218 and Jyoti Randhawa (73) was tied 42nd at three-over-219.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jeev-milkha-singh-invitational-2020-golf-tourney-chandigarh-s-akshay-sharma-continues-as-leader/story-t46WW9XeUx6eNF3DTA4DUO.html

06-12-2020||Chandigarh||Schizophrenia cases in emergency went up during lockdown, reveals PGIMER study||There was an increase in the proportion of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in emergency settings during the lockdown, a study conducted by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, has revealed. Schizophrenia is a type of mental illness characterised by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self, and behaviour.For the purpose of the study, records of all patients attending Psychiatry Emergency Services from January 1 to July 25, 2020 were retrieved. Comparisons were made between the patient profile before the imposition of the nationwide lockdown from January 1, 2020 to March 23, 2020 (83 days) and after the imposition of the lockdown from March 24, 2020, to July 25, 2020 (123 days). A longer duration was considered for the lockdown period to ensure an equal sample size in both groups.Reduction in proportion of patients diagnosed with delirium The study found that during the pre-lockdown period, delirium (an acute state of confusion due to underlying physical illnesses) was the most common psychiatric diagnosis in emergency settings. Previous studies from the same centre had also found delirium to be the most common psychiatric diagnosis in such settings. However, when the diagnostic profile of patients attending emergency services during the lockdown period was evaluated, it was seen that there was a significant reduction in the proportion of patients diagnosed with delirium. “This significant reduction, possibly reflects, reduction in the number of patients with severe physical illnesses, attending the emergency services, as delirium is usually seen in the background of a physical decompensation,” the study states.Many patients experience a relapseThe study suggests that there was an increase in the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, availing the emergency services, during the lockdown period. This finding suggests that, in the absence of routine regular services, possibly many patients with schizophrenia experienced a relapse of symptoms and presented to the emergency services.“There could be many reasons for relapse, such as difficulty in procuring, purchasing the medication, an increase in the level of stress, and an adverse household environment,” the study evaluated.The Psychiatry Emergency Services caters to patients attending medical, surgical, trauma, as well as paediatric services. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, patients referred from the out-patient services for urgent care, other hospitals, as well as those coming by self-referrals were seen in the emergency services. During the lockdown period, after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, mostly only those patients requiring emergency care, referred from other hospitals, or those who attended on their own, or those initially seen in the telepsychiatry services and considered to require emergency care were attended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/schizophrenia-cases-in-emergency-went-up-during-lockdown-reveals-pgimer-study/story-pJPKcI5nSu4P6zNorGzYyL.html

06-12-2020||City||Waterfront project in Thane: 5 bodies get notice for CRZ violations||A legal notice has been issued to five state government bodies for failing to address alleged coastal regulation zone (CRZ) violations for a waterfront development and beautification project by Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC). The five bodies are the principal secretary of the state environment department; State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA); Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA); the mangrove cell of the forest department; and TMC.Thane resident and environmentalist Rohit Joshi has alleged in a petition that there is large scale dumping of debris and reclamation in mangroves and creek areas, all falling under CRZ-1 (with highest protection). Issued through Joshi’s counsel on Thursday, a legal notice called for the CRZ clearance by state bodies to be revoked within seven days and restoration work be completed within three weeks at all sites. The notice highlighted four locations and specific dates where CRZ violations were observed recently. It further read that if damage to the creek ecology of Thane continued, the matter would be taken to court again.Covering an area of 72.2 hectares, TMC’s waterfront beautification project extends up to 10.58km, covering eight areas — Kopri-Mithbunder, Gaikmukh, Kavesar-Waghbil, Saket-Balkum, Nagla bunder, Kolshet, Parsik-Retibunder, and Kalwa-Shastrinagar. Beautification works include the development of promenades, playgrounds, jogging, walking and cycling tracks, open gymnasiums, and food courts. The project was first proposed in 2010 and construction began in 2017. Joshi had previously filed a petition before Bombay high court (HC) against the project but the HC had rejected his submissions and approved the project in September 2019.Over the past four years, clearances from the SEIAA, MCZMA, mangrove cell, and the Maharashtra Maritime Board were issued to TMC. This included the CRZ clearance issued on July 8, 2019, which specified, “No mangroves should be cut or destroyed for the project activities. TMC to ensure that dumping of the debris in mangrove and creek is not allowed.”“It is an absolute mockery of CRZ laws as debris are dumped on mangroves and on the creek despite a specific prohibition to do so in the clearance itself,” said Zaman Ali, Joshi’s legal counsel. According to Thursday’s notice, a survey of all eight sites showed environmental violations on February 24, April 17, October 6 and 7, and November 11 and 30 at Gaimukh and Nagla bunder; at Kolhet on October 28; Saket-Balkum on November 30; and Kopri-Mithbunder on December 2. “Each of these locations have large mounds of debris choking the high tide flow from the creek, destroying ecologically sensitive mangrove trees, and ruining the biodiversity of natural areas. Development work in low lying areas including near the creek has resulted in submergence during heavy rains causing great risk to life and property,” said Joshi.The notice has directed action be taken for the alleged violations under Environment Protection Act, 1986 and Forest Conservation Act, 1980, within seven days from the date of receipt of the notice. “Any non-compliance will entail serious legal consequences before the HC,” reads the notice.The mangrove cell said they had not received the notice, but would direct their officers to validate the findings and submit a report. “Large mangrove patches fall under the jurisdiction of the revenue department or TMC. They need to be handed over to us for better security,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).TMC officials did not deny the allegations but said the areas were being protected. “Wherever debris has been dumped, it is being removed within days of the complaint. We are working with the local police to identify violators and unidentified persons have also been booked. The project has all clearances in place,” said Manisha Pradhan, chief of TMC pollution control department.An executive engineer of the TMC’s waterfront development project said, “We have managed to keep away encroachments from these areas for the last four years. Satellite images can verify this. Those filing notices today never raised their voice against environment violations back then.”9.43 HA WIPED OUT DUE TO DEBRIS DUMPING FROM WATERFRONT DEVELOPMENT AREAA comparative study by Thane based group Muse Foundation of the Kolshet creek area found green cover reduction of 9.43 ha due to debris dumping, encroachment, dumping of plastic and hazardous waste. Their study used satellite images dating from April 2010 to April 2020. “Massive CRZ violations are being ignored by authorities. They are being undertaken by the local planning body, which makes it even more unacceptable,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/waterfront-project-in-thane-5-bodies-get-notice-for-crz-violations/story-5Cs6qCwJZ2737iMlHoX0rM.html
06-12-2020||City||Winter’s here, but Mumbai records highest December day temperature in 4 years||Cooler conditions prevailed over coastal areas including Mumbai and cold winds swept interior parts of the state on Saturday morning as the weather bureau said Maharashtra was under the grip of the winter season. Cooler conditions also caused city’s air quality to deteriorate and it was in the ‘poor category’ on Saturday.The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and city, recorded a drop in the night temperature on Saturday to 18.4 degrees Celsius (1.4 degree Celsius below normal), the lowest temperature so far this season. It is expected to hover below the 20 degree Celsius mark for the next two days, the weather bureau said.However, the city recorded the highest December day temperature over the past four years. The maximum temperature in the suburbs was 35.5 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees Celsius above normal. The highest maximum temperature last year was 35.1 degrees Celsius in December. The highest for the decade, however, was recorded on December 1, 2015 at 36.5 degrees Celsius. The all-time high December maximum was recorded on December 4, 1987 at 39.8 degrees Celsius.South Mumbai recorded the maximum temperature at 34 degrees Celsius on Saturday, which was 1 degree Celsius above normal.Even moisture levels showed a marginal decline from previous days as the suburbs and south Mumbai recorded 78% and 85% humidity on Saturday morning.In other parts of the state, especially interior Maharashtra along Marathwada and Vidarbha, temperatures were much lower. Parbhani recorded the lowest temperature at 8.8 degrees Celsius, followed by Gondia at 10.5 degrees Celsius.“The drop in minimum temperature indicates winter season is very much underway in Maharashtra as the wind pattern (northerly to northeasterly early morning and easterly during the day) is drawing cool and dry winds over interior and coastal areas of the state. The minimum temperature is likely to remain below the normal mark,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, India Meteorological Department. “There has been large diurnal variation between maximum and minimum temperatures over the last few days, which can affect health. As per our models, a similar trend will be observed over the next couple of days,” he said. Meanwhile, the pollutant-measuring indicator showed a spike on Saturday as the air quality index (AQI) entered the poor category for the first time this month. According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), it was 225 (poor) for PM2.5 pollutant. The AQI was 99 (satisfactory) on November 30, worsened to 118 (moderate) by Tuesday and kept increasing to 176 (moderate) by Friday. Bandra Kurla Complex (316) recording a very poor AQI. Colaba (276), Mazgaon (269), Chembur (283), Andheri (218), and Malad (300), all recorded poor air.

The farmers are undeterred by the recent study by the Centre of Science and Environment regarding adulteration and have only got busier with the increased demand. The prices of honey have recorded an increase of ₹50 from what it was at this time last year. Farm-grown honey is available at a price of ₹145 per kg at this time while last year it was available at ₹95 (unbranded). Simranjeet Singh, former President of Progressive Honey Bee Keepers Association who supplies honey to some major brands in the country said that adulteration is more with corn syrup imported from China which is being done by some brands at the processing stage. No farmer indulges in adulteration as it damages their reputation, he said.“The government should first look into adulteration of imported corn syrup in honey. There is a huge increase in demand as more people are buying honey for boosting immunity amid the threat of contracting Covid-19,” he added. Simranjeet is the young scion of a large extended family — 50 members are into beekeeping across the state. There are over 1,000 bee boxes that Simranjeet’s honey factory has placed across Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and even Rajasthan. According to Hardeep Singh, a Doraha-based honey farmer, who owns 500 bee boxes, the honey produced at the farms is the purest. “Demand from other countries is also huge in these times but exports are now very limited,” he said.As per estimates, Punjab has around 20,000 bee farmers who are engaged with the production of 16,500 metric tonnes of honey annually in the state||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-s-honey-farmers-rubbish-adulteration-claims-say-profits-have-only-increased-in-covid-times/story-7R5VkZ3igdPTUg26jAgN8J.html

06-12-2020||City||J&K DDC polls: Harwan ballot likely to seal summer capital’s fate||Harwan, the picturesque hamlet on the outskirts of the summer capital, may emerge as the decider for Srinagar district in the ongoing district development council (DDC) elections in Jammu and Kashmir.Of the total 14 rural constituencies in the district, six segments fall in the Harwan area, nestled between snow-covered mountains, cold streams and Mughal Gardens, around 19km from the city’s centre Lal Chowk.All the 14 constituencies of the district went to polls in the first two phases of the DDC elections, polling 33.76 % and 33.78% in phases I and II respectively.“Harwan will decide in whose kitty Srinagar will go. If any political entity manages to get Harwan’s six seats, it will be in a strong position to control the capital,” said Ali Mohammad Rather, an Independent candidate adopted by People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) in Theed constituency of Harwan.The first round of polling in Harwan was held on November 28.The DDC elections are happening for the first time in J&K after the special status of the erstwhile state under Article 370 was revoked in August last year and the region bifurcated into two union territories.Local mainstream rivals NC and PDP along with other four smaller parties have formed People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration(PAGD), demanding restoration of Article 370 and have been asking votes to “save the identity” of the erstwhile state. The fight is between PAGD, newly floated Apni Party by former PDP leader Altaf Bukhari and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“Harwan may play a significant role but the other eight seats are scattered and are equally important. Actually, Sonwar constituency covers nine of the 14 Srinagar seats,” said Ehsan Pardesi, NC’s Sonwar in-charge and vice president of party’s youth wing.The 14 DDC seats of Srinagar can be broadly divided into four areas — Harwan (6), Kohmoh (3) which together make Sonwar assembly constituency, Nowgam Lasjan (3) and Qamarwari Panzinara (2). Four different political parties are in the sway here.Traditionally, Harwan, part of the Sonwar assembly constituency, has been a stronghold of National Conference (NC). However, in the last assembly polls in 2014, the constituency went to People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Mohammad Ashraf Mir, who defeated former J&K chief minister and NC vice-president Omar Abdullah. A major portion of Srinagar’s Gujjar-Bakerwal communities reside in these areas.Mir, however, left PDP and is now part of the newly floated Apni Party led by former PDP leader Altaf Bukhari.“This time Harwan is not with NC. Our party is the emerging factor. Even BJP is strong,” said Ashraf Mir, who is the provincial president of Apni Party now.In Lasjan, the PAGD have fielded candidates supportive of Javaid Mustafa Mir belonging to the People’s Movement. Khonmoh is a mixed bag with pockets of support for the BJP’s Aijaz Hussain. Panzinara is close to Pattan area of north Kashmir’s Baramulla district and is considered by PAGD a stronghold of People’s Conference led by Sajad Lone.“Competition is tough at some places while we are poised to win a couple of seats in Nowgam,” said BJP spokesperson Altaf Thakur.Mohammad Shafi Dar, a local from the Gandtal seat, said the tussle is between alliance candidates and independents in the Harwan belt as people were more concerned for local development. “BJP is not very popular here. Coming together of the Gupkar Alliance is considered good but its constituents face a trust deficit. Independents may give a tough fight to the alliance,” said Dar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-ddc-polls-harwan-ballot-likely-to-seal-summer-capital-s-fate/story-ldCzwEYWohIgVViQ2DRFML.html

Joshi, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate, was defeated by Congress’s Abhijit Wanjari in the MLC polls by more than 18,000 votes. However, Joshi refused to resign and said he would complete his term as mayor. This is the first time when a BJP and erstwhile Jan Sangh nominee has lost this seat since it was first introduced in the 1960s. Nagpur civic body is ruled by the BJP and Joshi was elected as mayor one year ago. “The party has given me the mayor’s responsibility and I am fulfilling it. I have been asked to work for 13 months and will do so,” said Joshi. Joshi, a close aide of former chief minister and incumbent Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, was elected as the city mayor on November 22, 2019. The mayor’s term ends after two-and-a-half-years. The tenure was curtailed due to the Assembly elections and the BJP had decided to equally split the tenure between Joshi and senior party corporator Dayashankar Tiwari. Joshi, a four-time corporator, said his term was till December 22. The leader of the Opposition, Tanaji Wanve said Joshi has lost the confidence of the common man. “The mayor’s post is a prestigious one. The occupant should have the confidence of citizens. Therefore, Joshi should resign on moral grounds,” said senior corporator and Congress leader Praful Gudadhe. On the other hand, BJP city president Pravin Datke said Joshi will complete whatever term the party had assigned him as mayor. Congress corporator Sanjay Mahakalkar said, “The mayor’s defeat in the graduates’ constituency election means that people are unhappy with BJP’s rule in NMC. Most of the votes in this election were from the city. The BJP has four out of the city’s six MLAs including Fadnavis. Union minister Nitin Gadkari is also from the city. Therefore, the result is a clear indication that people will teach BJP a lesson in the next municipal elections slated in January 2022.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-allies-demand-resignation-of-nagpur-mayor-sandip-joshi-on-moral-grounds/story-hE5vLemtWZpxCo0oKz5njP.html

Due to the farmers’ agitation in Delhi, over nine Volvo buses (three of Punbus and six of PRTC) operating from Ludhiana to Delhi ISBT and Ludhiana to Gurgaon have been suspended. Basant Singh, 65, said, “I have been trying to find a bus for Malerkotla for the last half an hour. But, due to the protest, we are stuck at the bus stand. My wife has knee problems and cannot stand for long hours. It is sheer harassment for the public and protests must be held outside central government offices.”Another passenger, Sunita Rani, who wanted to take a bus to Chandigarh with her two-year-old son, said, “I was not aware of the strike and reached the bus stand at noon. There was a chaos outside and took 10 minutes to cross the road. After inquiring, I found out that the service will resume after 1pm. I thought about taking a bus from outside, but private operators were charging double.” District president of Punbus Contractual Employees’ Union, Shamsher Singh, said, “If the central government does not accept the farmers’ plea in the next meeting, then the joint action committee of Punjab Roadways and Punbus will launch an agitation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farm-bills-ludhiana-passengers-left-in-the-lurch-as-punjab-roadways-staff-stage-strike/story-LRdTJR2pP1J9C8JdkJ5AaP.html

People have the right to know about the veracity of allegations about their representatives to maintain faith in the system,” he said.He claimed that various such allegations were levelled against some top leaders of the ruling party, some of whom have served as ministers, but the same were never probed.‘Farm laws flawed to core, farmers deserve better’ Congress on Saturday held a protest in Jammu to express solidarity with the ongoing farmers’ agitation. The protest led by former ministers Raman Bhalla and Yogesh Sawhney was organised by District Congress Committee Jammu (Urban).Hitting out at the Prime Minister for his remarks that farm reforms have opened doors of new opportunities for farmers, Bhalla said that insistence in support of the laws shows that the government is “drunk with power” and is rigid even in reconsidering the laws.“Farmers are the heart and soul of India, and attacking them is the gravest mistake the BJP has made. Congress will not stand by it. The laws are flawed to the core and our farmers deserve better,” said Sawhney.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/roshni-scam-cong-for-probe-into-alleged-land-deals-by-senior-bjp-leaders/story-DOtEWMbTqvv3Asl8VF7iHL.html

06-12-2020||Mumbai||Thane rural areas moving towards Covid-free; only 7% active cases prevalent||The rural areas in Thane district have become 90 per cent Covid free with only seven per cent active cases, claimed the Zilla Parishad (ZP). The ZP is looking forward to becoming Covid-free soon.Gram Panchayats situated in areas like Bhiwandi, Ambernath, Kalyan, Murbad and Shahapur had seen a slight increase in cases a few months ago. However, 89 per cent have recovered from these areas.The ZP came up with a new initiative wherein areas with positive cases were declared containment zones and a health camp was setup in these zones for 14 days. They conducted regular check-ups of villagers and ensured that those with symptoms were treated at the earliest. This helped break the chain.From September, a decline was noticed in the number of positive cases. “We have a team of medical officers, ASHA workers, Anganwadi sevika and teachers who conduct health camps in areas where a positive case is found. They are trained for the same and have played a big role in containing the virus. From among 431 gram panchayats, 376 did not have any new Covid case in the last 28 days. Currently, there are 1,212 active cases in the rural areas that constitute to only seven per cent of the total positive cases recorded till now,” said Manish Renge, district health officer, Thane ZP.Rural areas within Thane have recorded 18,270 positive cases till now. From among these, 565 deaths have taken place and 16,493 have recovered. There are 1,212 active cases within the rural areas of the district. However, efforts to curb new cases are also undertaken.Jithesh Vishe, deputy sarpanch, Vehlonde village, said, “If anyone from outside the village is visiting, the villagers have to first inform the gram panchayat and ensure the person has a test done before they arrive. As we have explained the impact and spread of the virus, our villagers are also very careful and ensure that there are hardly any visitors. It is with the support of the locals that we have managed without a single Covid positive case in our gram panchayat. Despite no cases, we strictly continue to follow social distancing and sanitation norms in the village.”In July, the ZP had asked villages that did do not have a single case in 28 days to hoist a green flag in the gram panchayat. In the first week of October, there were 209 villages in Thane rural areas that hoisted green flags. Special efforts were taken to remove the fear in the minds of the residents regarding Covid. They conducted awareness and efforts were taken to trace, track and test as many as possible across Thane rural.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-rural-areas-moving-towards-covid-free-only-7-active-cases-prevalent/story-XnvSwEr5L8sCjzvoCmNPlN.html

While one of the accused was convicted for aggravated penetrative sexual assault on the child, his friend was sentenced for abetting the act. Public prosecutor Rashmi Tendulkar argued that both the men had common intention behind the crime. As per prosecution, the girl was playing in the common passage in the building in November 2018. The duo reached the spot. They made her to sit on a sofa and sexually assaulted her. As claimed by the prosecution, the main accused’s friend kept a watch to ensure nobody saw them. A while later, the girl’s mother saw her with the men after seeing them with the men. When she asked the child what were the accused doing with her, the girl narrated the incident to her mother. The mother also noticed injuries on her body. The girl’s family then approached the RAK Marg police station in Sewri and filed a complaint against the duo. The key accused was arrested on November 23, 2018, while his friend was arrested on November 21, 2018. Since their arrest, the two have been in jail, as the court has been refusing to grant them bail. The accused had pleaded that they were falsely implicated in the case because of the disputes in the society. However, the court rejected the arguments made by the defence and relied on the statement of the girl, who also identified the accused in the court. The court also relied on medical evidence before sentencing the duo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-get-20-years-in-jail-for-sexually-assaulting-neighbour-s-3-year-old-daughter-in-mumbai/story-9W3lHKmDm74EoRKbjnoZ2K.html
06-12-2020||Mumbai||Women prisoners in Thane and Kalyan jail battle depression as they cannot meet kin||A 38-year-old mother of two, an undertrial lodged in Kalyan’s Adharwadi Jail for a kidnapping case, used to meet her children regularly till March this year.For more than nine months since the lockdown was implemented, she lost touch with her children. Her 70-year-old mother who used to take care of her children lost her job as a housemaid. The woman was depressed and worried about her two children and contacted NGOs, who managed to get in touch with her children only to find they could barely manage two square meals.Like her, many others lodged in women’s prison in Adharwadi and Thane Central Jail have lost touch with their families or children in this lockdown. As per the protocol, no one is allowed in or out of the jail in order to control the pandemic in the prison.Based on a request made by Prayas to be ADG Prisons, the prison department started video calling facility for prisoners to talk to their families and their children including their children living in shelter homes. Many mothers in prison have spoken to their children through this facility.Social workers and criminologists working with the inmates claimed that women, children and the undertrials lodged in Thane and Kalyan prisons are the most affected in the lockdown as their outdoor contact is completely lost. NGOs are not allowed inside. Thus, those children staying in the prison who earlier had many games and activities planned now have nothing to do.As per the record, Adharwadi Jail in Kalyan has 120 women prisoners while Thane Central Jail has 80. Children up to the age of six are allowed to stay with their mothers. Accordingly, Kalyan prison has 15 children and eight stay with their mother in Thane Jail.Senior social worker of Prayas, a field action project of TISS, Reena Jaiswar, who works for Kalyan jail inmates said, “We are responsible for the prisoners’ children and take care of their activities. Since the past few years, as per the rules, we have started taking out those children for two hours for classes (Anganwadi) or any activity near the jail premises. In those two hours, if they see a car or an auto rickshaw on the road, they are happy. Since the lockdown, there is no activity for these children. They also miss the Anganwadi food that they loved.”Now, these children don’t have games, education, fun activities and television to pass their time. With no one allowed inside the prisons anymore, Jaiswar said, “The state should have come up with a few helplines or a system to interact with the inmates and their children, and help them with their problems. These people are completely out of touch with whatever is happening in the outside world. NGOs are providing things from the outside that are necessary for them to survive, like Vitamin C tablets and winter clothes, though attention should also be given to the mental health of the inmates and their children in these times.” Talking about the 38-year-old woman, Jaiswar informed that the woman was an accessory in the case as she had helped the prime accused to get married to a minor girl. Her husband left her with her two children aged 10 and 11 a few years ago. After she was arrested, her old 70-year-old mother worked as a maid to take care of them.Jaiswar said, “The grandmother had no job during the lockdown. She borrowed money from a few relatives. The woman had not seen her children and was worried. We came to know in May and went to their house when we saw they did not have anything left to eat. We arranged food grains and other essentials including immunity booster for the children and grandmother, and made them speak with their mother. Till now, we have been providing them with all the essentials. But the children are now insisting on meeting their mother.”Her trial was about to get over in March but it got delayed in the lockdown.Thane jail superintendent Harshad Ahirrao said, “For almost four to five months of the lockdown, we could not do anything for the children as we ourselves were short staffed. But, since the past two months, we have taken volunteers from women prison cells who can teach different subjects or activities to them. Some of these women are educated. A few are uneducated but they know how to keep the children engaged. So, accordingly, they have arranged different sessions for the children daily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/women-prisoners-in-thane-and-kalyan-jail-battle-depression-as-they-cannot-meet-kin/story-dQQbz5gYuRG7w3GtS3qT1O.html

No arrest has been made yet.According to police sources, Khar police on Friday registered a first information report (FIR) against chef Kelvin Cheung and his father Chi Ping Cheung under sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code based on the complaint of Ranjit Bindra, a resident of Pali Hill in Bandra and co-owner of Bastian.As per the police complaint, Cheung had been working at Bindra’s office for a long time as chef. “While working in the Bandra restaurant, Cheung offered Bindra to invest in his plans to invest in popular restaurant franchises in Chicago and Los Angeles with the help of his father. In 2015, the complainant had invested USD 200,000 in multiple transactions,” said Gajanan Kabdule, senior inspector of Khar police station.Police sources said that the money was transferred through a hospitality firm.Cheung suddenly quit his association with the restaurant last year by saying that his father passed away. Since then, the complainant’s discussion with Cheung regarding the investments abroad did not go well. Later, Cheung also allegedly started ignoring Bindra. Bindra followed up the matter, but in vain, a police officer said.“Recently, Bindra learnt that Cheung has returned to India. He hoped to get his money back, and hence approached police and registered a complaint,” said Kabdule.The police are verifying all the allegations and are investigating the case, he said.Cheung said, “I have not received any details about the case from Bastian or the police, so I can’t comment on the same. I can state that I wasn’t part of any deal with Bastian regarding their investment deal. I haven’t signed any contracts with them and I haven’t received any payments from them as alleged by them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-chef-kelvin-cheung-booked-for-duping-bastian-co-owner-of-200k/story-lwaZjJOJsCtcaBtP1e4XpO.html

06-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Marginal difference in FYJC second admission list cut-offs||Cut-offs across prominent colleges in the city remained high in the second merit list for admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC). The state education department declared the second merit list on Saturday morning. Of around 1.58 lakh students who had applied, a total of 76,231 students were allotted seats in the second round. Of them, 20,371 were allotted the college of their first preference. After the first admission round, nearly 2.42 lakh seats across colleges in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) were vacant. While cut offs saw a marginal dip in some of the top colleges, they remained the same in others. For science stream, prominent colleges such as Ramnivas Ruia College and DG Ruparel College in Matunga, Sathaye College in Vile Parle and PACE Junior College in Andheri closed their second lists above 90%. At KC College in Churchgate the cut-off for science saw a marginal increase as it increased from 89.4% in the first list to 90% in the second list. Similarly, prominent colleges for commerce steam such as RA Podar College in Matunga and NM College in Vile Parle closed second list at 94.2% and 95.2%, respectively. Mulund’s VG Vaze College closed its list at 93.6% with no change in the cut-off from the first list. “We had already completed a substantial number of admissions in the first list itself. Cut-offs were expected to be high with high scorers this year,” said Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal of VG Vaze college. The highest cut-off for arts stream was recorded at St Xavier’s College in Fort at 94.6% followed by Ramnivas Ruia College in Matunga at 94%. The cut-off increased from 92.6% in the first list to 92.8% in the second for Jai Hind College in Churchgate. “Since students are allowed to change their preferences in every round, it is possible that students with higher scores might have applied in the second round, leading to an increase in cut-offs,” said an official from the education department. On September 9, in line with the Supreme Court’s interim stay on Socially and Educationally Backward Class (SEBC) quota in jobs and education, the state education department stayed the admission process for FYJC until further orders. With this, the second merit list for admissions which was originally scheduled to be released on September 10 was stalled, leaving over 2.42 lakh students in the lurch in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) alone. While the state government has revealed that admissions to all courses will now take place without the 12% SEBC quota, it has also clarified through its recent government resolution (GR) that admissions confirmed under SEBC quota during the first round, which took place before September 9, will remain intact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-marginal-difference-in-fyjc-second-admission-list-cut-offs/story-1iho0C9FwjLF3MBCz1Jw1M.html

The airline, while admitting that the employee had tested positive, said it will investigate the matter further. The 44-year-old woman employee had undergone an RT-PCR test on November 12, the report for which was received before the scheduled flight from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport. The crew member’s report and her schedule for Friday, November 13, accessed by HT, per showed that the employee even operated on the same sector and returned to her base station (Delhi) [via the return flight]. Although the 44-year-old was quarantined from the next day, the airline allowed her to operate the entire day on November 13. India is already facing issues with Dubai and Hong Kong after passengers from India tested Covid-19 positive after landing there. An Air India Express spokesperson said, “The said flight was a Delhi-Madurai flight, for which a pre-flight RT-PCR test is not mandatory. The head crew member was to operate the international sector the next day and hence had taken the test. However, she was quarantined from November 14 onwards and no other fellow crew members when tested were found infected. We will, however, surely investigate the matter.” The spokesperson, however, did not confirm if the infected employee was symptomatic or not. Meanwhile, airline sources alleged that officials tried to manipulate the employee’s report data in the scheduling system. “The system no longer showed that this senior employee had undergone the RT-PCR test on November 12, which meant that there would have been no (of the conducted test) on-record proof, if the test report wasn’t accessed. Tampering already logged in data is illegal.” A top official with one of the leading airlines said, “It’s true that a crew member can operate few domestic flights until his/her test reports are awaited. This is done in order to avoid a situation of crew shortage for airlines. But, it is completely unacceptable that an airline got the crew member tested only two days before her international flight (as per the statement by the airline, the crew had to operate an international flight on November 14) and also goes ahead, allowing her to operate flights even when she is confirmed to be Covid-19 positive.” Vipul Saxena, aviation expert, said “This is a blatant violation of safety norms and Covid-19 protocol and the head of flight safety must be made responsible. Crew schedule planning definitely has a provision for such a last-moment change. A detailed inquiry must be initiated to check the symptoms of the head crew member and also whether she was forced to take the flight.” Earlier, the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) had suspended Air India Express flights between India and Dubai on October 2, which was withdrawn the same evening. The suspension notice was issued after a passenger on a Jaipur-Dubai flight was found to be Covid-19 positive. Air India Express had submitted an apology to DCAA before getting the notice and the airline and the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) had to hold discussions with Dubai authorities, following which the suspension order was lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-india-express-crew-member-flew-despite-testing-positive/story-HSs8zxkVQanigpjyKRhxzO.html
06-12-2020||Kolkata||CAA likely to be implemented from January, says Kailash Vijayvargiya||Senior BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya on Saturday said that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is likely to be implemented from January next year as the Centre and the saffron party are keen to grant citizenship to the large refugee population in West Bengal.The BJP national general secretary accused the TMC government of not being sympathetic to the cause of the refugees.“We are hopeful that the process of granting citizenship to refugees under the CAA will begin from January next year,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the party’s ‘Aar Noy Anyay’ (no more injustice) campaign in North 24 Parganas district.“The Centre has passed the CAA with the honest intention of granting citizenship to persecuted refugees coming to our country from neighbouring nations,” he added.Reacting to Vijayvargiya’s comment, senior TMC leader and state minister Firhad Hakim said that the BJP is trying to fool the people of West Bengal.“What does the BJP mean by citizenship? If the Matuas are not citizens, how come they voted in assembly and parliamentary polls year after year? The BJP should stop fooling the people of West Bengal,” he said.The Matuas, originally hailing from East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh), started migrating to West Bengal in the 1950s, mostly due to religious persecution.The community, with an estimated population of 30 lakh in the state, influences results in at least four Lok Sabha seats and 30-40 assembly constituencies in Nadia, North and South 24 Parganas districts.A section of state BJP leadership is apprehensive that the delay and confusion over CAA implementation might turn refugee voters, especially the Matua community, against BJP in the 2021 assembly elections due in April-May next year.The community had voted hands down in favour of the BJP during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, party sources said.The CAA seeks to grant citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi refugees who have come to India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on or before December 31, 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/caa-likely-to-be-implemented-from-january-says-kailash-vijayvargiya/story-JIt5fX0VmV3tkUyoGUu7PI.html
06-12-2020||Chandigarh||Fake loan scam rocks Ludhiana civic body||The Ludhiana municipal corporation has been rocked by an alleged fake loan scam after it emerged that employees’ fake salary slips and identity cards were being used to procure bank loans. The scam, which has sent alarm bells ringing among the civic body’s top brass, came to light after bank officials approached the corporation to report that around 60 employees had defaulted on loan payments, amounting to lakhs. However, it was later found that at least half of the defaulters were not MC employees but had managed to procure the loans on the basis of fake government documents. It is yet to be confirmed whether the remaining employees in the defaulters’ list had themselves applied for loans or there documents had been misused by somebody else.

Navdeep Romana, the school principal, said, “The school has 40 classrooms and requires more space to accommodate students so that social distancing norms can be followed.”Government Senior Secondary School, Indirapuri, has 84 students studying in Class 12. Of this, 70 have received their parents’ consent to appear for the exam. The school has sufficient rooms to accommodate students by following the social distancing norms.Jaswinder Singh, the school principal, said, “We will conduct the exams as per instructions, but how will students whose parents have not given their consent appear ? We are waiting for directions so that every student can appear for the exam.”District education officer, elementary, Rajinder Kaur, who is handling the additional charge of DEO, secondary, held a virtual meeting with the school principals at 5pm on Saturday.“I have directed the principals to conduct offline exams for students whose parents have given written consent.

06-12-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi’s positivity rate below 5% for third day on the trot||With over 81,000 samples tested, Delhi reported 3,419 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday, leading to a daily positivity rate of 4.2% – the lowest in 209 days, or since May 10.The number of RT-PCR tests, considered by experts to be the gold standard of Covid-19 testing, however, dropped from 40,191 on Friday to 35,352 on Saturday – a reduction of 12%. Overall samples tested also dropped from Friday’s 85,003 to 81,473 on Saturday. Friday’s test count was the highest daily testing figure recorded in Delhi till date.Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, tests are significantly better than rapid antigen tests at detecting positive cases – the latter has a higher tendency to give false negative. As a result, the higher the share of RT-PCR tests in overall testing, the more accurate the positivity rate is.The positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total samples tested – has now remained below 5% for the third consecutive day. On Friday, with 4,067 new cases, the positivity rate was 4.78%, while on Thursday, it was 4.96%.According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, the spread of the infection in a region that is testing “adequately” is considered to be under control if the positivity rate holds steady at 5% or below for two weeks.This is the first time since the Delhi government started releasing testing data in March that the positivity rate has remained below 5% for three consecutive days.“Let us see for how long the rate stays below 5%; if it holds for at least a week, then the situation would be comfortable. Delhi has been carrying out aggressive testing and contact tracing because of which the positivity rate has reduced from over 15% (it was 15.26% on November 7),” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Friday.The positivity rate has been seeing a near steady decline from the last week of November, as per the daily health bulletin released the Delhi government.“The decreasing number of cases and positivity rate is a good sign – they show that we have scaled down from the peak after the festive season. We have to wait to see what the next sero-survey report says, but I think at least 40% to 50% of Delhi residents must have been exposed to the infection after the November peak. With so many already exposed, Delhi should not see such a high peak again,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences. On Saturday, Delhi added 77 more deaths due to the infection, tipping the city’s total toll beyond 9,500. So far, 9,574 people have died of the infection since the first case was reported on March 2. The number of deaths being reported daily has dropped to an average of 82 per day over the last seven days as compared to an average of 104 the week before and 107 the week before that. However, with fewer cases being reported, the seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – has crossed 2% for the first time since August beginning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/positivity-rate-below-5-for-third-day-on-the-trot/story-bAWCUj6ekrhUAlrEfQFq0N.html
06-12-2020||Delhi||Chilla border completely shut as farmers block Delhi to Noida carriageway as well||Chila border (Delhi-Noida Link Road) was completely blocked by farmers on Saturday morning, bringing traffic to a standstill and forcing the police to increase the deployment in the area. Senior police officers said as the road leads to multiple hospitals in east Delhi as well as Noida, they have requested protesters to open a passage for emergency vehicles. Other borders points that are completely shut, as on Saturday, are Singhu and Tikri borders, where farmers have been camping since November 27 to protest the Centre’s new farm laws.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said until Friday, only one carriageway (from Noida to Delhi) was blocked by protesters while the other one (from Delhi to Noida) was open to traffic. “On Saturday morning, farmer groups blocked that carriageway as well, leaving no scope for traffic movement,” he said.Joint commissioner of police (eastern range) Alok Kumar said they are negotiating with farmer leaders at Chilla border to open one carriageway or at least give a passage for emergency vehicles. “Once before, too, they had shut the Chilla border completely, but we had convinced them to open one carriageway. Our talks are in progress,” he said.The DCP also said since the number of farmers have also increased at Chila border from Saturday, the police have accordingly stepped up deployment. “Adequate presence of paramilitary and police personnel along with teams of the rapid action force in riot gear was maintained at the border point throughout the day,” he said.Satish Tomar, IT in-charge of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, who is camping at Chilla border, said more farmers were on their way to Chilla border on Saturday when they were detained by police in Jewar. “In protest, we blocked the other carriageway also at Chilla border. The farmers were released by evening and they have reached Chilla. But we are continuing with the blockade of the Chilla border completely. If they try to remove us forcefully, we will march to Jantar Mantar,” Tomar said.Apart from Chilla border, the traffic situation at the other Delhi border points remained the same as on Friday. A senior police officer said that on Thursday, the situation was bad as the closure of the border had happened suddenly and during office hours. “On Friday, people got used to the diversions and on Saturday, because the traffic volume was low, the situation was much better. However, because main routes at the Gazipur border (on NH-24) also remained closed to traffic from Gaziabad to Delhi, people were advised to avoid NH-24 and use Apsara, Bhopra or DND Flyway instead to reach Delhi. Since these alternative routes are narrow as compared to the main roads, they witnessed slow-moving traffic,” the officer said, requesting anonymity.Delhi Police kept making regular updates on social media to keep commuters informed about the diversions and closures.The movement of the vehicles on Anand Vihar-Ghazipur road and other routes by which motorists were entering Delhi from Ghaziabad also saw slow-moving traffic on Saturday. The traffic remained diverted on other routes such as the DND Flyway, Kalindi Kunj, Dallupura, Khoda, New Ashok Nagar, and Kondli borders.The other border points fully closed since Wednesday are Jharoda, Lampur, Auchandi, Safiabad, Piao Maniyari, and Saboli. Badusarai border remained open only to light motor vehicles such as cars and two-wheelers, while Jhatikara border was open only to two-wheelers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chilla-border-completely-shut-as-farmers-block-delhi-to-noida-carriageway-as-well/story-hlRraLqIQ6J2XLbM7oEGhO.html
06-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air slips back into severe zone as wind changes direction||Delhi’s air quality slipped into the ‘severe’ zone on Saturday, as winds changed direction and slowed down considerably making dispersion of pollutants difficult. The air quality is likely to remain in the lower end of ‘severe’ to the upper end of ‘very poor’ zone over the next two days, government agencies forecast. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin, the AQI was 404 on Saturday. It was 382 in the ‘very poor’ zone on Friday. The last time air quality was in the ‘severe’ category was on November 25, with an AQI reading of 413. On a scale of 0-500, an AQI value between 301-400 is considered ‘very poor’ while 401-500 is ‘severe’.According to scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), with stubble burning incidents being negligible at present, local accumulated pollutants have not been able to disperse because of unfavourable meteorological conditions.V K Soni of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said that winds at present are blowing from the east, which have increased the moisture content in the air. “High moisture content and calm winds trap pollutants close to the ground resulting in an increase in the PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations. The air quality is likely to improve slightly on Sunday and may remain in the upper end of the ‘very poor’ zone,” said Soni.IMD scientists said that the average wind speed on Saturday was less than 5 kmph. Also, at Safdarjung Observatory, the official marker for city weather, shallow fog was observed in the early morning hours with visibility being 600 metres.“While there was an increase in the night temperature, the air quality deteriorated because of winds being calm. Whenever there is a change in wind direction, it impacts the air quality. From December 7-10, air quality may improve considerably, as northwesterly winds will return to Delhi. Also, the wind speed is likely to remain around 12-15kmph at that time,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.On Saturday, the minimum temperature was 11 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal. The maximum settled at 27.8 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal.The System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the union ministry’s air quality forecasting wing, said the share of stubble burning to the city’s PM 2.5 levels was just 1%. “The air quality is likely to improve slightly to the ‘very poor’ zone on Sunday. However, significant improvement may take place only from December 7 onwards,” the SAFAR bulletin stated.According to experts, every year after peak pollution in November, which is mostly attributed to contribution from stubble burning, bad air episodes are seen towards December-end and early January. This is mainly because as compared to November, meteorological conditions are even more unfavourable during this time while the baseline pollution (local emission from Delhi and neighbouring regions) stays the same. This includes local waste burning, industrial fumes, vehicular emissions and dust suspension, among others. D Saha, former head of CPCB’s air lab, said that during December-January, with colder days and calm winds, the meteorological conditions are tougher and slows down dispersion. “Also, at this time because of the geographical position of Delhi, dust and other emissions from the Indo-Gangetic plains settle here. Enforcement agencies need to ensure that local emissions are minimised to prevent the peaks in pollution,” said Saha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/city-s-air-slips-back-into-severe-zone-as-wind-changes-direction/story-VFmQoJQyB3JnznvRsoiLNI.html
06-12-2020||Delhi||Govt plans one-time scheme to waive dues on road tax payment||The state transport department has moved a proposal to offer a one-time waiver of penalty on non-payment of road tax for public service vehicles such as private buses, taxis, Gramin Sewas and RTVs, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Saturday. “The proposal has already been sent to the finance department for its approval. This penalty-waiver scheme is being brought in because businesses of a lot of private bus operators and taxi drivers came to a complete standstill during the lockdown months and even after unlocking of the economy many of them could not resume operations owing to the city’s Covid-19 situation,” Gahlot said. The minister said the scheme will bring a much needed relief to the transporter of Delhi who have to pay an annual road tax, non-payment of which attracts steep fines. The scheme does not apply to private cars and two-wheelers as they pay a one time road tax while purchasing the vehicle and do not have to pay the tax annually. It was only on November 3 when private buses were allowed to operate in the city with the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA) allowed inter-state bus movement. On the same day, all the three inter-state bus terminals (ISBTs) located at Kashmere Gate, Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan were opened for public use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-government-moots-one-time-waiver-of-penalty-on-non-payment-of-road-tax-for-private-transporters/story-DoS7IttJo3zrwPsEDG8wVN.html
06-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers camping at Burari move to join protests at Ghazipur||Davinder Singh, 27, a farmer from Pooranpur in Uttar Pradesh, has been keeping a track of protests that erupted in Punjab after the Centre passed the new farm laws two months ago. Active on social media platforms, Singh received numerous messages that farmers from different parts of the country were marching to Delhi to demand a repeal of the laws. On November 27, Singh, and four other farmers, finally joined the protests.“We packed some woollen wear, a few essentials, clothes, and drove from Pooranpur to Burari. Our friends from the village later brought in the ration, mattresses, tarpaulin sheets, bamboo sticks, gas cylinders, stove, utensils, and other items in trucks and tractors. The supplies are enough for us to last at least six months,” Singh said.However, nearly a week after setting things up at the Nirankari ground at Burari – the government’s designated spot for farmer protests -- Singh and his friends had to move again. “We thought our issues would be addressed here. We waited for the government to come to meet us and listen to our concerns, but no one came. This is why we decided to pack all our essentials and drive to Ghazipur to participate in the road blockade,” he said.Every evening, he draws a yellow tarpaulin sheet from his truck over the red cycle track on Ghazipur flyover and ties it to the railing on the road. Singh and his friends then sleep below this canopy on some mattresses, with blankets being their only protection against Delhi’s harsh winters. Every morning, the tarpaulin sheet is folded back and the poles used to erect them go back to resting against the railing. Singh, a first-time protester, said it is challenging to live on the road and to deal with the possibility of moving from one place to another with all their belongings. “If the talks with the government are inconclusive today, we will move further inside the city. We are aware that it means moving with our belongings once again. But there is no other option,” said Rambir Singh, 63, another farmer from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh who reached Delhi on November 30. He too was among those who had camped at Burari Ground. (QUOTE WILL BE UPDATED) Several protesters, who have travelled from different states, said that apart from the bigger issues of non availability of toilets, water, and having to sleep in the open, there are smaller problems that people fail to notice. “For instance, if we have to cook something or make tea, we have to take out food portions from our polythene packets and then put them back in the vehicles,” said Davinder. “This is no way to live.”Although Singh was not stopped on his journey from Pooranpur to Burari, others weren’t that lucky. Tajinder Singh, a member of the Trai Kisan Sangathan, said that they had left with all the protest paraphernalia including banners and poles, food, clothes, blankets, and other essentials on November 26 from Uddham Singh Nagar in tractors and vehicles. But were stopped at Rampur. The group had to camp there for two days before moving on again.“After continuing our journey from Rampur on November 28, we learnt midway that protesters had gathered at Burari so we went there. We waited there for the government to address the issues of farmers but nothing happened. So, three days later, around 500 farmers from Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh left the grounds and came here to Ghazipur,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-camping-at-burari-move-to-join-protests-at-ghazipur/story-1WxTwEda0v7FTN8cSD1kFO.html
06-12-2020||Mumbai||Students create guidebook to make public spaces safe amid Covid-19 pandemic||While the country is in unlock mode, citizens are still hesitant to access public spaces for fear of getting infected. To provide stakeholders with a ready reckoner to better basic infrastructure at public spaces, two urban planning students have created a guidebook for decision-makers to keep public places free of Covid-19. The guidebook Back to the City provides simple interventions for urban spaces like streets, parks, public transport, markets, malls, schools and offices. It has been designed under the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and CEPT University under the BMZ (Germany’s Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development) funded project Sustainable Urban Development - Smart Cities. Nisarg Shah, who is currently pursuing a Bachelors in Urban Design from CEPT University, said, “The handbook has been designed in such a way that the illustrations can be understood by people who cannot read. These pamphlets can be posted in public spaces so that people are constantly reminded to maintain social distancing norms. At the end of each suggestion, the guidebook also states which authority is responsible to implement it.” For instance, the streets guidebook states that the government and private entities must come together to create more awareness about social distancing norms through street art. It also suggests that the government must create health checkpoints at major crossings in the city and improve them with public health facilities. Shah, along with Smrithi Prasad designed the handbook as part of their internship at GIZ. “We will also be presenting the handbook to the National Institute of Urban Affairs next week,” Shah said. Prasad, who completed her Masters in Urban Design from CEPT, said, “We are currently in Unlock 5, but we have seen that there has been overcrowding at many places. Plus, many people fear accessing public spaces because the norms might not be followed.” Prasad said that they are focusing on publishing these guidebooks on various digital platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-create-guidebook-to-make-public-spaces-face-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-RzMpREeVeO7DoAuBYw8BfM.html

The Lahore rally would be the last nail in the coffin of the selected government.”Rehman remarks come a day after Imran Khan ruled out the possibility of the government granting permission to the PDM for holding anti-government rallies and warned that police cases will be lodged against organisers.In an interview to a private news channel, the premier had said the government has decided against allowing the Opposition to hold the public gathering, Geo News reported. “We will file FIRs against everyone -- from the kursi wala to the sound system handlers but will not stop them [Opposition leaders] from going there,” he said.Meanwhile, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz senior leader Rana Sanaullah said people will express solidarity with the PDM at the Minar-e-Pakistan. He also said that the final decision about en masse resignation from national and provincial assemblies will be taken by the leadership of the Opposition’s 11-party alliance - PDM.“I was first accused of owning property worth two billion rupees in Australia. A fake case was lodged against me. Drug peddlers were brought from Faisalabad to testify against me, but the government did not find any witness against me despite all the pressure,” said Sanaullah.Underscoring the need for dialogues, Sanaullah said that if the Imran Khan-led government had held negotiations with the Opposition, the country’s current situation would have been different, reported ARY News.He also said that his party will comply with the PDM leadership’s decision.

However, an unsigned note circulated as part of the messaging campaign said, “There are elements within the protesters who are using these protests to support terrorist activities and secessionist movements like Khalistan and Kashmir.” Pro-Khalistan groups such as Sikhs for Justice and Shiromani Akali Dal-Amritsar Canada have also joined the agitators in Canada.The note also said, “While the entire nation has sympathy for the farmers and their cause, the use of this platform to fuel secessionist voices will not be tolerated by the people of India.”In a rebuke to Canada’s ruling dispensation, which echoed the statement and demarche from the external affairs ministry in New Delhi, the note stated, “The prime minister and senior ministers from the Canadian government and other leaders have spoken on the issue, given the compulsions of their domestic politics.”It pointed out that discussions between representatives of protesting farmers and the Indian government are still being held. It also noted that the impact of these reforms could include seeing “India’s agriculture and food processing industries transformed”.The note is part of the Ottawa-based high commission’s “intense outreach” to political and diaspora leaders in Canada, according to an Indian official.It also pointed out that Canada is “one of the most strident critics” of India’s minimum support price (MSP) regime, and other agricultural policies at the World Trade Organization (WTO). “In this context, the recent comments by the Canadian leadership are at odds with Canada’s aggressive posture at the WTO towards India’s agricultural support to its farmers,” it asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-s-missions-in-canada-launch-outreach-campaign-on-farmers-protest/story-DabhnbMeqo78G7PiSnnwGO.html

Around 700 who were unable to find places to stay with friends or family during the operation were looked after in Frankfurt’s convention center.Even 75 years after the end of World War II, such finds are relatively common in Germany, testament to the ferocity of the conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-experts-defuse-wwii-era-bomb-found-in-frankfurt/story-BzYa5zAsNtgwHUNoOcW2mL.html

However, the deputy inspector general (DIG) of police said the police were investigating all aspects, the paper reported.Incident involving forced conversion of minority non-Muslim girls and subsequent marriage with Muslim men frequently surface in Pakistan.Last month, a young Christian girl, Arzoo Raja, was reportedly abducted, forced to convert and marry a 44-year-old Muslim man in Karachi. Her parents filed a case which is still in the court.Christians constitute around 2 per cent of the population in Muslim-dominated Pakistan. Karachi, Lahore and Faisalabad have a large Christian population. There are many Christian villages in the Punjab heartland, while there is also a sizable population in the deeply conservative north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, particularly in Peshawar city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/christian-woman-killed-in-pak-for-rejecting-marriage-proposal-report/story-FT55wZIxHt4osoHqgFkcgL.html
06-12-2020||World||Will the US ever have a national Covid-19 testing strategy?||As the coronavirus epidemic worsens, US health experts hope Joe Biden’s administration will put in place something Donald Trump’s has not — a comprehensive national testing strategy.Such a strategy, they say, could systematically check more people for infections and spot surges before they take off. The health experts say it would be an improvement from the current practice, which has professional athletes and students at elite universities getting routine tests while many other Americans stand in line for hours — if they get tested at all.“We have had no strategy for this virus. Our strategy has been no strategy,” said Dr. Michael Mina, a Harvard University researcher focused on use of testing to track disease.Some experts say the lack of such a system is one reason for the current national explosion in cases, hospitalizations and deaths.“If we’d had a more robust approach and testing was scaled up as one of the tools, I think much of this third surge would would have been avoidable,” said Dr. Grant Colfax, director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health.There are differing opinions on what such a strategy should look like, but many experts say rapid and at-home tests should be used so Americans can check themselves and stay away from others if they test positive.The president-elect has endorsed that strategy, called for making testing free for all Americans, and said government experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies should be empowered to coordinate the entire effort.“The reality is we’re not testing enough today,” Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, co-chair of Biden’s coronavirus advisory board, told The Associated Press this week.His transition team so far has not gone into further detail.Testing was one of the first — and most enduring — stumbles in the federal government’s response to the coronavirus epidemic that hit the nation early this year.In February, the CDC distributed test kits to public health laboratories that initially were faulty. US officials worked with companies to expand testing, but shortages of chemicals, materials and protective equipment meant fewer tests were available than what experts said was necessary.Worse, some experts say, states and cities competed against each other to buy limited testing services and materials, and with little guidance or training on how to best use the tests.In April, President Donald Trump declared governors were responsible for testing. Amid complaints about shortages and delays, the federal government began sourcing and shipping key testing supplies to states, beginning with swabs.In the latest phase, Trump officials are sending more than 100 million rapid, point-of-care tests to states. The government said the first shipments went out in early October.Such tests are considered key to slowing spread, but states have distributed them differently. For example, Alaska is sending tests to oil drilling sites, Colorado to local public health agencies for testing homeless populations, and Mississippi to veterans’ homes.There’s also no federal standard for reporting test data. Some states report the number of tests administered, while others tally the number of people tested. Some have counted types of tests that others don’t, which can skew results because some tests are better at diagnosing active infections than others.Administration officials say they are proud of the current state of testing. Last month, Vice President Mike Pence celebrated that 170 million tests have been completed, and that an expanding array of tests are available.But the focus should be less on numbers and more on action, said Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the University of Nebraska College of Public Health.“It shouldn’t be anybody who needs a test can get a test,” Khan said. “It should be anybody who has a positive test immediately gets isolated” and the people they were in contact with checked and placed in quarantine.He was echoed by Nunez-Smith, the Biden coronavirus adviser.“Testing is only useful when we can act on the test,” said Nunez-Smith, a Yale health equity researcher.Trump himself has voiced a lack of enthusiasm for comprehensive testing. In a June tweet, the president called testing a double-edged sword that is good to have but “makes us look bad.” And Dr. Scott Atlas — a top pandemic adviser to Trump before he resigned Monday — argued against testing people who aren’t experiencing symptoms.But some regard such thinking as an attempt to spin a leadership failure into something else.“The executive branch has seen test results – case counts – as a report card on its performance,” said Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington evolutionary biologist who studies emerging infectious diseases.The nation may be weeks away from coronavirus vaccines becoming available, but that won’t erase the need for testing, said the Rockefeller Foundation’s Eileen O’Connor.“We’re not going to get everybody vaccinated right away. And we still don’t know how long that immunity will last,” she said. So testing will still be needed to monitor where the infection is active and to see if infections are occurring in vaccinated people.What should be done moving forward?In July, the Rockefeller Foundation called for making cheap tests widely available to better identify people who are infected and don’t know it. That would involve developing and making cheap antigen tests, which provide quick results but are less reliable than genetic tests. Foundation officials hoped the government would push companies to manufacture tests the same way it has pushed vaccine makers to mass produce experimental vaccines.Some Harvard researchers believe that testing half the population each week would be possible by mailing those tests to millions of US households.Participation would be voluntary, and positive results would have to be confirmed with genetic tests — the home tests are not considered as sensitive as more established lab-based testing. Even so, it could dramatically expand the amount of infection monitoring going on across the nation, its proponents say.During an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health said Americans should have easy tests they can do in their own homes.“We don’t have that,” he said. “We should have that.”Versions of such an approach have been tried in some places, including Slovakia and Minnesota. But some experts note there is little precedent for screening tens of millions of people with cheap, rapid tests—which would generate a significant portion of false results. It’s also unclear whether people who test themselves at home will follow instructions to quarantine.Nearly all experts agree that more data and coordination is needed.“Having every state do its own thing without guidance from the federal level — from CDC in particular — I think has really hampered us,” said Scott Becker, the chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. “It is a federal response as much as it is a state response, but it’s a shared responsibility. We need to work together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-the-us-ever-have-a-national-covid-19-testing-strategy/story-9bnTPxAhrFQQoiOPJ5hyZJ.html

The government also looked into partnerships with two other Chinese drug manufacturers, Sinopharm and CanSino Biologics.Penny Lukito, head of the Food and Drug Control Agency, estimated that the Sinovac vaccine would obtain emergency use authorization from the agency by the third or fourth week of January, after the agency evaluates interim results from the third-stage clinical trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-2-million-doses-of-china-made-covid-19-vaccine-arrives-in-indonesia/story-xHSaQC8YHS18eAPH6xI1qL.html
06-12-2020||World||Three years after US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, its status remains contentious. Here’s why||It has been three years since US President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and ordered to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city, upending decades of the country’s foreign policy in favour of the Jewish nation. US State Secretary Mike Pompeo on Sunday said that the decision strengthened the diplomacy efforts and partnership between the two countries, calling it the “greatest hope for peace.”  Three years ago, @realDonaldTrump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s rightful capital and ordered @usembassyjlm to move from Tel Aviv. This simple recognition of reality strengthened our diplomacy efforts, our partnerships, and still today reflects our greatest hope for peace.The Trump administration has been aggressive about its foreign policy for Israel, by taking several decisions that have been seen as against Palestinian interests. The United States recognised Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a disputed region occupied by Israel since 1967, and announced a reversal of its decades-long policy on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, calling the occupation not necessarily a violation of international law. “Basing policy on reality, we recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and we recognised Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights,” Pompeo told a Senate committee in 2019.Also Read | India urges Israel, Palestine to re-engage in direct talks to advance goal of two-state solutionEarlier this year, Trump also unveiled the long-awaited Middle East peace plan to resolve Israel-Palestine conflict, proposing an independent Palestinian state and promising to keep Jerusalem as Israel’s “undivided capital.” The Secretary General of the Arab League called the plan “a great waste of legitimate rights” of Palestinians, adding that the organisation is open to any serious effort to achieve peace.India has repeatedly called for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, urging both parties to resolve issues through direct negotiations. After the Middle East peace plan was unveiled, the Ministry of External Affairs called on the parties to engage with each other and find an acceptable two-State solution for peaceful coexistence.Why the status of Jerusalem remains contentious?Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to Jerusalem, a city considered holy to the Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state they hope for, while Israel regards the whole of Jerusalem as its capital. In 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem, West Bank and Gaza Strip, which was followed by years of armed conflicts. UN Security Council Resolution 242 called for a withdrawal of Israeli troops “from territories occupied in the recent conflict”, recognising the right of “every state in the area to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries.” Since then, the Palestinians have been fighting for an independent state comprising the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. After US’ recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to adopt a resolution, asking nations not to establish diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. The delegates warned that the US’ decision risked igniting a “religious war across the already turbulent Middle East and even beyond.” As many as 128 countries, including India, voted in favour of adopting the resolution, with only nine countries voting against it. It also demanded that countries comply with all relevant Security Council resolutions and work to reverse the “negative trends” imperilling a two-State resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-years-after-us-recognition-of-jerusalem-as-israel-s-capital-its-status-remains-contentious-here-s-why/story-7wit0tSiDwgFkekT4PnHIP.html

Friday’s incident, which occurred at about 5 p.m. (0900 GMT) in a mine shut for more than two months as the company dismantled underground equipment, is being investigated, it added.China on Sunday ordered local authorities to “resolutely take decisive measures to effectively stop major accidents in coal mines from happening,” according to a statement published on the website of the Ministry of Emergency Management.Officials from the State Council also urged the Chongqing government to launch a comprehensive safe production check on all coal mines, and eliminate outdated production capacity in an orderly and safe manner, the statement said. China’s mines are among the world’s deadliest, with 16 deaths reported in late September after high levels of carbon monoxide trapped miners at the Songzao coal mine in Chongqing.Diaoshuidong, built in 1975 and run since 1998 as a private enterprise, is a high-gas mine with annual capacity of 120,000 tonnes of coal, Xinhua said.In 2013, three people were killed and two injured in a hydrogen sulphide poisoning incident at the mine, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/23-dead-in-coal-mine-accident-in-china-s-chongqing/story-LwaDQnYEzfz5YirWOS2WgO.html

We plan to have all the ancillary materials the syringes, the needles, the swabs,” Slaoui said.“I think the plans are there and I feel confident that once we will explain it, everything in detail. I hope the new transition team will understand that things are well planned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-meet-us-vaccine-advisor-moncef-slaoui-this-week/story-7oSf0Bfcb4i1oQr79uIbxI.html
06-12-2020||World||China dismisses ‘Wolf Warrior diplomacy’ charge as akin to ‘China threat’ theory||China has sought to dismiss the use of the term “Wolf Warrior diplomacy”, which is used to describe confrontational rhetoric by its diplomats to ward off criticism on a host of issues, calling it yet another version of “China threat theory” being floated by Beijing’s critics.Obviously, the “Wolf Warrior diplomacy” is actually another version of the “China threat” theory and another “discourse trap,” whose purpose is to prevent China from fighting back, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said in the first official reaction to the widely-used phrase among international diplomats and media to highlight Beijing’s aggressive posturing.Chinese diplomats were once known for their low-key approach in dealing with complex domestic and global issues. But their style changed in recent years as Beijing battled increasing global adversity on issues like coronavirus, which became a pandemic after emerging from Wuhan, allegations of mass internment camps in Xinjiang and imposition of national security law in Hong Kong.Critics also say the change in style is fuelled by the pursuance of aggressive nationalism by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. Le said that as a responsible major country, China has always been a defender of the international order, a contributor to global governance and a provider of international public goods.It was a time when there seemed to be less inordinate criticism from the West. But the world and Chinese diplomats have changed, a write up in the CPC’s aggressive tabloid Global Times said.“In some Westerners’ eyes, Chinese diplomats are now engaged in ‘Wolf Warrior’ style diplomacy, named after a 2015 Chinese patriotic action film and its 2017 sequel. The change seemingly has made the West feel challenged,” it said.The term was coined from the 2017 Hollywood Rambo style Chinese action film “Wolf Warrior 2”.Le, a former Ambassador to India, dismissed such labels as misunderstanding China’s diplomacy, stressing that China has always been a country of etiquette, valuing harmony, and never taking the initiative to provoke others, nor running to the door of another’s house to pick a quarrel. “China has no choice but to stand up in defence of our national interests and dignity, as others have come to our door and meddle in our internal affairs and abuse us,” Le was quoted as saying by the official media here while addressing a think-tank forum on Saturday.Le said the allegation by some people that China has made enemies all around the world with aggressive diplomacy is not true.“We have always made friends and forged good relationships. It is precisely certain big countries which have pressured other countries to take sides with ‘my way or no way’ choice. But even under such circumstance, China’s ‘circle of friends’ is not getting smaller but bigger”, he said. “Many developing countries and friendly people have resisted the pressure and continued to cooperate with China and spoken out in support of China on international occasions,” he said. This week, outgoing US National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe has said China poses the greatest threat to America and the rest of the free world since World War II.“The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the US and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically,” Ratcliffe wrote in an op-ed published on Thursday in The Wall Street Journal.“Many of China’s major public initiatives and prominent companies offer only a layer of camouflage to the activities of the Chinese Communist Party. I call its approach of economic espionage ‘rob, replicate and replace,’“ Ratcliffe said.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying dismissed the allegations as a further move to spread “false information, political viruses and lies” in hopes of damaging China’s reputation and China-US relations.“It offered nothing new but repeated the lies and rumours aimed at smearing China and playing up the China threat by any means,” Hua said at a daily briefing on Friday. “It’s another hodgepodge of lies being produced by the relevant departments of the US government for some time,” she said.Last month, another Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian while rebutting joint statement by Five Eyes countries criticising China’s top legislature to disqualify four pro-democracy lawmakers of Hong Kong, said: “No matter how many ‘eyes’ you have, be careful not to be poked and get blind by harming China’s sovereignty, security and development interests.” The Five Eyes is an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US.Commenting on the aggressive style of diplomacy of by Chinese diplomats, Wang Xiangwei, a Beijing based columnist of the South China Morning Post, published from Hong Kong said Beijing should be cautious not to enter US trap. “Indeed, as the Chinese foreign ministry and official media consistently paint Washington’s moves and rhetoric as irrational, reckless and bordering on unhinged, that gives Beijing the reason to refrain from doing the same to the US”, he wrote in one his columns recently.“There is also a growing suspicion that Washington is laying a trap and deliberately provoking Beijing to react irrationally for the sake of its domestic politics”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-dismisses-wolf-warrior-diplomacy-charge-as-akin-to-china-threat-theory/story-Jth3oZelGqm0grMyOwP5zM.html
06-12-2020||World||Family of children’s author Roald Dahl apologise for his anti-Semitic remarks||The family of Roald Dahl, late author of children’s classics such as “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”, has apologised for anti-Semitic remarks he made, saying the comments were “incomprehensible to us”.The British author, who died in 1990 aged 74, remains popular with young readers around the world and several of his books such as “The BFG”, “Matilda”, “Fantastic Mr Fox” and most recently “The Witches”, have been turned into movies and stage shows.However, controversy has occasionally flared up over anti-Semitic comments, particularly those made in a 1983 interview with Britain’s New Statesman magazine.“There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity, maybe it’s a kind of lack of generosity towards non-Jews,” he said, adding that “even a stinker like Hitler didn’t just pick on them for no reason”.In a statement on the official website of the organisations that manage his legacy, copyrights and trademarks and a museum dedicated to him, the Dahl family apologised for what they said was the lasting and understandable hurt his remarks had caused.“Those prejudiced remarks are incomprehensible to us and stand in marked contrast to the man we knew and to the values at the heart of Roald Dahl’s stories, which have positively impacted young people for generations,” they said.“We hope that, just as he did at his best, at his absolute worst, Roald Dahl can help remind us of the lasting impact of words.”The director Steven Spielberg was asked about Dahl’s anti-Semitic comments in 2016, when he was at the Cannes film festival promoting his adaptation of The BFG.Spielberg said he had been unaware of the comments when he took on the project, adding the book was about embracing differences and that was the value he had sought to impart in telling the story.Other high-profile adaptations of Dahl’s works have included two big-budget movie versions of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Fantastic Mr Fox, and a stage musical version of Matilda that has been a hit in London and on Broadway.A new movie version of Dahl’s The Witches, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Anne Hathaway as the Grand High Witch, was recently released on HBO Max by studio Warner Brothers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/family-of-children-s-author-roald-dahl-apologise-for-his-anti-semitic-remarks/story-F9yphSitfEKvsOObYrohLJ.html
06-12-2020||World||Presidential inauguration planners rethink how to party in age of virus||Public health guidance to avoid big parties in the age of coronavirus is about to collide with what is typically one of America’s biggest celebrations of all: the swearing-in of a new president.While lots of details are still to be worked out, this January 20 is sure to be more subdued than prior inauguration days.A giant parade down Pennsylvania Avenue? Not likely.Fancy balls? They may morph into virtual events.The traditional luncheon where lawmakers offer best wishes to the new president? It might not include food this year.What about the swearing-in itself? The inaugural platform on the Capitol’s West Front is going up just like always, but it probably won’t be as crowded.“I think you’re going to see something that’s closer to what the convention was like than a typical inauguration,” President-elect Joe Biden said Friday, referring to the all-virtual event that marked his nomination last summer. “First and foremost, in my objective, is to keep America safe but still allow people to celebrate — to celebrate and see one another celebrate.”For their convention, Democrats pulled together a made-for-TV mashup of homemade videos, speeches from classrooms and living rooms, and music played from afar, narrated by celebrity hosts.Biden’s swearing-in itself will not be virtual. But guests should be prepared to socially distance and wear a mask. Lawmakers are also considering requiring a Covid-19 test for anyone on the platform near the president-elect, said Paige Waltz, a spokesperson for the joint congressional committee charged with overseeing the event.The VIP platform can hold 1,600 people. Lawmakers also generally distribute tickets for positions nearby. While no hard decisions have been made, the committee is looking at cutting the numbers on both accounts.“My guess is there will still be a platform ceremony,” Biden said. “But I don’t know exactly how it’s all going to work out. The key is keeping people safe. I can’t do a super version of the president’s announcement in the Rose Garden.”That was an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s Rose Garden introduction of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, where hundreds of people crammed together, many without masks. It turned out to be a superspreader of the virus.Biden’s play-it-safe approach to the coronavirus during his campaign offers clues about what to expect in terms of inaugural modifications.He said Friday that a “gigantic inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue” was unlikely, although a big reviewing stand is being constructed in front of the White House.No decisions have been made on whether the official inaugural balls should go forward. Some advocacy groups already are going virtual with their galas, including the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization.“Our goal is to democratize the inauguration party experience by holding a virtual event integrating our 3 million-plus members and supporters into the day’s events and breaking the traditional bubble of a Washington insider experience,” said Lucas Acosta, a spokesperson for the group.The celebrity component of this year’s celebration has yet to be determined, but one source close to the inauguration suggested looking for hints in the lineup of celebrities who campaigned for Biden, including Lady Gaga, John Legend, and Jon Bon Jovi.Work to build the inaugural platform at the Capitol and the White House reviewing stand began before the November 3 election, as is traditional. New this year: Congressional planners have invited lawmakers to record video messages for the president-elect and vice president-elect that can be played on Jumbotrons before the swearing-in.After the ceremony, the president and vice president have traditionally attended a luncheon in National Statuary Hall that includes speeches, gifts and toasts. The event began in 1953, when President Dwight Eisenhower, his wife, Mamie, and 50 guests dined on creamed chicken, baked ham and potato puffs in the Old Senate Chamber.This year’s format and venue are up in the air. One congressional aide familiar with the planning said it’s likely that food will be out altogether. Rather, the event would revolve around the speeches lawmakers make wishing the new administration well.Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who heads the congressional inaugural committee, has been careful not to refute Trump’s baseless claims that he won the election. But Waltz said the congressional inaugural committee staff nonetheless is ready to work with Biden’s Presidential Inaugural Committee.That committee oversees inaugural events held away from the Capitol, including the parade and balls. Tony Allen, president of Delaware State University, serves as CEO.“This year’s inauguration will look different amid the pandemic, but we will honor the American inaugural traditions and engage Americans across the country while keeping everybody healthy and safe,” Allen said.Plans for protests are underway, too.A few groups have submitted requests for protest permits with the National Park Service. The Answer Coalition, made up of antiwar and civil rights organizations, plans a demonstration demanding “urgent action to save the environment, end war and prioritize money to meet people’s needs.” Let America Hear Us Roar For Trump is seeking a permit to “support our President.”As for Trump, it’s unclear whether he’ll show up for the inauguration. He recently told reporters: “I know the answer, but I just don’t want to say it yet.”Biden, asked if Trump should attend, said it’s important for the United States to show that competing party leaders can stand together, shake hands and move on. “It is totally his decision, and it’s of no personal consequence to me. But I do think it is for the country,” he told CNN.Even though plans are still taking shape, Biden’s inaugural committee is already raising money for such events as balls and concerts. The law allows unlimited contributions to the committee, but Biden will limit contributions from individuals to $500,000 and from corporations to $1 million. The committee won’t accept contributions from lobbyists or the fossil fuels industry.That’s according to an inaugural official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the work of the committee.The contribution limits for Biden are far lower than those for Trump’s inaugural four years ago. He raised a record $107 million for his inauguration and accepted massive checks, including $5 million from Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson.The inauguration is normally an economic boon for the Washington region, with visitors typically required to book several days in a hotel and at premium rates to get a reservation. This year, there are more options than usual — a sign the inauguration is less of a draw.“Given the pandemic, it’s good news that we’re hearing of some hotels being full already. But for the most part, there is still capacity in the city,” said Elliott L. Ferguson, president and CEO of Destination DC, the district’s marketing organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/presidential-inauguration-planners-rethink-how-to-party-in-age-of-virus/story-H6aEmrXqEZvnCs8rX7vigK.html
06-12-2020||World||Venezuela’s last democratic institution poised to fall to Nicolas Maduro||President Nicolas Maduro is poised to regain control of Venezuela’s National Assembly on Sunday, in a vote that’s being boycotted by the main opposition parties.His almost inevitable landslide will cement his grip on the last major institution in the country that has democratic legitimacy.A win for Maduro will further weaken the position of opposition leader Juan Guaido. He is recognized as the legitimate ruler of Venezuela by the US and dozens of its allies, but that’s based on his status as head of congress, which he is about to lose.Guaido and his allies are boycotting the election, citing the absence of international monitors, while a minority segment of the opposition is taking part.Turnout is expected to be between 25% and 36%, according to Venezuelan pollsters. In the last congressional vote held in 2015, participation was 76%.Polls are open from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m., with results expected Sunday evening.Fewer people will turn out this time because the election is not perceived as credible, said Luis Vicente Leon, director of Caracas firm Datanalisis.“This electoral event will have neither massive opposition witnesses, nor credible audit, nor trusted automated voting systems, which makes it difficult to be sure of its real results,” Leon said.The government is trying to boost turnout through cash payments and food handouts. Maduro even promised to grant “special prizes” to the 100 communities with the highest participation rates.With no real opponents and widespread apathy, the government could win between 190 and 230 of the 277 seats, according to Caracas-based political risk firm ORC Consultores. The new assembly will take over on January 5.Maduro will likely try to use control of the National Assembly to try to bypass US sanctions and attract some foreign investment, especially through oil ventures, according to ORC director Oswaldo Ramirez. The assembly has to approve such investments.Although the main opposition parties won’t participate, some of them will still appear on the ballot. That’s because the top court -- packed with Maduro loyalists -- suspended and replaced the boards of those parties to hand them over to government allies in an attempt to boost the election’s appearance of legitimacy.The economy is suffering through its seventh straight year of contraction, with food shortages and annual inflation of 6,600%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/venezuela-s-last-democratic-institution-poised-to-fall-to-nicolas-maduro/story-pNDe1ffReh6oZCvCFEe27J.html
06-12-2020||World||Covid-19: What is a placebo? Why is it used in vaccine trials?||After Haryana health minister Anil Vij, who had participated in a vaccine trial, tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), it triggered a lot of questions around the efficacy of the vaccine candidate Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech. The company later issued a clarification, saying the trial volunteers receive the two vaccine doses 28 days apart and the efficacy of the vaccine can be determined 14 days after the second dose is administered.The Biotech firm further added that the phase 3 trial is a double-blinded study where half of the participants receive the vaccine and the other half receive a placebo. A double-blinded study means neither the participant nor the investigator knows whether the person was administered a vaccine or a placebo. What is a placebo?According to the dictionary definition, a placebo is a medicine or procedure prescribed for the psychological benefit to the patient rather than for any physiological effect. It is a substance or treatment which is designed to have no therapeutic value, including inert injections, pills, or any other kind of fake treatment. Also Read | Pfizer seeks emergency use nod in India, UK rolls out inoculation planWhy is it used in vaccine trials?The researchers compare the results of the vaccine with those obtained from the placebo and the placebo-controlled trials are widely regarded as a standard method for testing the efficacy of new treatments. The aim of administering a placebo in trial volunteers is to observe how many people in each group naturally contract the virus and fall ill.In the United States, if the number of inoculated volunteers contracting Covid-19 is at least 50 per cent lower than the number in the placebo group, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can grant the emergency use authorisation. The drug regulator requires a longer period of study to grant permanent approval to the vaccine candidates.The United Kingdom has authorised Pfizer’s vaccine for emergency use and the company is now awaiting emergency use authorisation from the FDA for its roll-out in the US. The biotech firm had announced that the final efficacy analysis of its vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, undergoing Phase 3 trial met all of the study’s primary efficacy endpoints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-what-is-a-placebo-why-is-it-used-in-vaccine-trials/story-BPExFDcqzLbmzjuThqNolN.html
06-12-2020||World||Henrietta Lacks and her contribution to Covid-19 vaccine||Everywhere in the world the scientific community is racing against time to save humanity from the ongoing pandemic. Scientists and frontline workers are being hailed for their selfless service, but one individual who awaits her due is Henrietta Lacks — a black tobacco farmer who died at 31 from an aggressive form of cancer. Her cells, says American Virologist Angela Rasmussen, were used to study the effect of SARS-CoV on humans, providing inputs for the development of a vaccine. Who is Henrietta Lacks and why is she important?Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951 at the age of just 31. At the time, many hospitals in the US practised segregating black patients from white patients, which reduced her options for seeking treatment. She ended up at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, in a ward located down the hall from George Gey, a researcher who had been attempting to grow human cells in his lab for decades. Her doctor sent some of her cells to Gey without her consent, changing the course of medicine forever.Lacks’s cell had the ability to divide and replicate indefinitely, whereas normal human cells are able to do that around 50 times, making it easier for researchers to grow the culture of identical cells quickly. Soon scientists all over the world started using her cell lines for furthering their research. They were used to carry out research for the first polio vaccine, for in-vitro fertilization, for cancer, and most recently for studying the effects of SARS-CoV replication in the human body. Scientists began to dub the cell line cultivated from her as HeLa, in her honour, but for the longest time, her own family was not aware of her contribution.What are the ethical issues behind HeLa cells?Journalist Rebecca Skloot was the first one to connect the dots and trace her DNA 50 years later, raising questions on ethics and racial injustice. HeLa cells brought in enormous profits for biotech companies but none of that ever benefited her family and her community. As Covid-19 wreaks havoc on America’s racial minorities, scientists are being forced to confront the historically unequal treatment meted out to blacks and other minorities. Cells are also derived from elective abortions, one such cell line actively used in vaccine research in the past is the HEK-293, a human embryo that was selectively aborted in the Netherlands, much to the dismay of the Catholic leaders in North America. This group urged the US Food and Drug Administration to instead provide incentives for Covid-19 vaccines that do not use fetal cell lines. The HeLa cells, however, spell out a different set of questions and possibilities. While asking the scientific community to not disregard the many contributions blacks have made over the years, also brings up the prospect of ‘restorative justice’, according to Yolonda Wilson, a bioethicist at Howard University in Washington. Lacks’s descendants who recently marked her 100th anniversary of her birth in August have expressed similar hopes. Once vaccination commences in full swing, a chance to correct a historical wrong will present itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-henrietta-lacks-and-what-s-her-connection-to-the-covid-19-vaccine/story-neC7CB4lUabGiFgJVbbp2L.html
06-12-2020||World||Queen Elizabeth, 94, to be among first to receive Covid-19 vaccine in UK||Queen Elizabeth, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, are expected to be among the first to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, whose first consignment has arrived in the UK and is set to be administered first to those above the age of 80 from Tuesday.Anti-vaccine claims on social media and elsewhere are among major obstacles faced by the UK’s health officials planning the biggest mass vaccination programme in the country’s history. Leading figures such as Queen Elizabeth taking the vaccine is expected to help overcome anxieties. The initial batch received from Belgium has 800,000 doses. The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which is enough to vaccinate 20mn people with two does, 21 days apart. It has also reached agreement for early access to over 300mn doses of other vaccines, when approved by regulators.Reports in the British press on Sunday said Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip may “let it be known” that they have had the vaccine that would be initially rolled out in 50 hospitals that have facilities for freezing the consignment at a temperature between 70 and 80 degrees Celsius.Due to their age, the Queen and Prince Philip are in the first group identified for vaccination. Frontline health staff, people over the age of 80 and care home workers will be the first to get the vaccine that was approved by the UK’s regulator on December 2.Terming Tuesday’s rollout of the vaccine as a “historic moment”, health secretary Matt Hancock said: “I urge everybody to play their part to suppress this virus and follow the local restrictions to protect the National Health Service while they carry out this crucial work”.Since the completion of the Brexit process on December 31 may lead to transport bottlenecks on the border, particularly if a deal is not agreed with the European Union by then, UK officials are considering deploying Air Force aircraft to bring the vaccine from Belgium from January 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-94-to-be-among-first-to-receive-covid-19-vaccine/story-ll4QSI4DOeM8xh2rcTyeML.html

Khyber Teaching Hospital spokesperson, Farhad Khan, said that six patients had died overnight due to lack of oxygen supply. “Of the six, five were admitted in the Covid-19 ward, whereas one other was admitted at a different ward,” he told the media.The spokesperson said that more oxygen was required during the winter season. The hospital had the capacity to keep 10,000 litres of oxygen which was maintained on a daily basis and it also had backup cylinders. He claimed that the situation was “under control” now and details were being acquired about the reasons behind the delay in supply.Khan said that the oxygen supply was sourced from a company in Rawalpindi and that supplies ran out after demand rose and also because of a rise in Covid-19 patients. Pakistan is experiencing its second wave of Covid-19 cases and experts have warned that this wave is more widespread than the earlier one. The country’s coronavirus positivity ratio again climbed to 7.59% on Saturday, with the highest positivity ratio observed in Abbottabad at 17.57%, according to the data released by the National Command and Operation Centre. The ratio had decreased to around 7.2% earlier.After Abbottabad, the second highest positivity ratio was observed in Rawalpindi at 15.26%, followed by Karachi at 14.31% and Hyderabad at 12.13%. In most cities, business and office hours have been reduced and public events have been curtailed.Prime Minister Imran Khan has appealed to the public to follow restrictions. He has also hinted that if the current trend continues, the government would be forced to go for total lockdown as against the current practice of partial or “smart” lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-patients-die-in-pakistan-as-oxygen-supply-runs-out/story-FvJUZdxePMLlRMxO6FcOVL.html
06-12-2020||World||Saudi prince strongly criticises Israel at Bahrain summit||A prominent Saudi prince harshly criticized Israel on Sunday at a Bahrain security summit that was remotely attended by Israel’s foreign minister.Prince Turki al-Faisal, who led Saudi intelligence for more than two decades and served as ambassador to the US and Britain, warned that any normalisation deals needed to help the Palestinians obtain their own independent state.He described Israel as a “Western colonising” power. He said Israel has “incarcerated (Palestinians) in concentration camps under the flimsiest of security accusations— young and old, women and men, who are rotting there without recourse to justice. They are demolishing homes as they wish and they assassinate whomever they want.” Although the prince does not hold any official position, his stance is seen as closely mirroring that of King Salman. In contrast, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has signalled greater willingness to quietly engage with Israel to counter common rival, Iran, and boost foreign investment in the kingdom.Prince Turki’s comments come as neighbouring Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates recently moved to normalise relations and establish ties with Israel.Saudi Arabia has insisted that any normalisation between it and Israel can only happen alongside a lasting peace deal involving a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, who spoke immediately after Prince Turki, said: “I would like to express my regret on the comments of the Saudi representative.” “I don’t believe that they reflect the spirit and the changes taking place in the Middle East,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-prince-strongly-criticises-israel-at-bahrain-summit/story-zOZsGxxAiN6psbVTYWI4AM.html
06-12-2020||World||UK prepares for ‘historic moment’ of vaccination against Covid-19||The first 50 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals are gearing up for what the UK government has described as the “biggest immunisation programme in history” as the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against Covid-19 arrived at “secure locations” in the country from neighbouring Belgium this weekend.Frontline healthcare staff, people over the age of 80 and care home workers will be among the first to get the vaccine as part of Phase 1 of the programme from Tuesday, which was approved for rollout by the UK’s independent regulator earlier this week. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had declared the jab, which claims to offer up to 95 per cent protection against Covid-19, is safe for human use against the novel coronavirus after “rigorous” checks.“This coming week will be an historic moment as we begin vaccination against Covid-19,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.“I urge everybody to play their part to suppress this virus and follow the local restrictions to protect the NHS while they carry out this crucial work,” he said.The minister added that the government is doing everything it could to overcome “significant challenges” to ensure care home residents are vaccinated as soon as possible after they were also cleared for Phase 1 by the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), as those at the highest risk of death from the deadly virus.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that NHS staff are working through the weekend for the first vaccinations to take place from Tuesday across 50 shortlisted hubs in the first wave. More hospitals will start vaccinating over the coming weeks and months as the programme ramps up.Patients aged 80 and above who are already attending hospital as an outpatient, and those who are being discharged home after a hospital stay, will be among the first to receive the “life-saving jab”. Hospitals will also begin inviting over 80s in for a jab and work with care home providers to book their staff in to vaccination clinics. Some media reports indicate that Queen Elizabeth II, 94, and her 99-year-old husband, Prince Philip, are likely to be among this group.Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers and all those vaccinated will need a booster jab 21 days later.“Despite the huge complexities, hospitals will kickstart the first phase of the largest scale vaccination campaign in our country’s history from Tuesday. The first tranche of vaccine deliveries will be landing at hospitals by Monday in readiness,” said Professor Stephen Powis, NHS National Medical Director.“The NHS has a strong record of delivering large scale vaccination programmes – from the flu jab, HPV vaccine and lifesaving MMR jabs – hardworking staff will once again rise to the challenge to protect the most vulnerable people from this awful disease,” he said. General practitioners (GPs) and other primary care staff are also being put on standby to start delivering the jab, with a number of them ready from December 14 and more in other parts of the country joining in a phased basis during the coming weeks and months. Vaccination centres treating large numbers of patients in sporting venues and conference centres will subsequently join the drive when further supplies of vaccine come on stream, the DHSC said.The vaccine is typically delivered by a simple injection in the shoulder but there is a complex and difficult logistical challenge to deliver from the manufacturers Pfizer to patients. It needs to be stored at -70C before being thawed out and can only be moved four times within that cold chain before being used. Defrosting the vaccine takes a few hours and then additional time is required to prepare the vaccine for administering.The DHSC said that NHS staff have been working over the weekend to prepare the sites and accept deliveries.Each box needs to be opened and unpacked manually, and temperature data has to be downloaded from each box.Tracking data covering every box’s journey from Belgium is also being downloaded to check that the vials have been kept well below freezing.There are five packs of 975 doses per box and only sites with the necessary MHRA licence can split the vaccine packs. Once all checks are complete, the vaccine will be made available to order by authorised sites in the state-funded NHS.The distribution of the vaccine across the UK is being undertaken by Public Health England and the NHS in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland through systems specially adapted from those used successfully for the national immunisation programmes, the government said.Around 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK from next week. In all, the government has ordered a total of 40 million doses – enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each, 21 days apart.Meanwhile, the UK recorded a further 397 deaths from the deadly virus, taking the country’s death toll to 61,014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-prepares-for-historic-moment-of-vaccination-against-covid-19/story-xxN7R3YFyRuBhl3ZEijd7L.html
06-12-2020||World||US Navy official says ‘uneasy deterrence’ reached with Iran||The top US Navy official in the Mideast said Sunday that America has reached an “uneasy deterrence” with Iran after months of regional attacks and seizures at sea, even as tensions remain high between Washington and Tehran over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program.Vice Adm. Sam Paparo, who oversees the Navy’s 5th Fleet based in Bahrain, struck an academic tone in comments to the annual Manama Dialogue hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He described having a “healthy respect” for both Iran’s regular navy and the naval forces of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.“We have achieved an uneasy deterrence. That uneasy deterrence is exacerbated by world events and by events along the way,” the vice admiral said. “But I have found Iranian activity at sea to be cautious and circumspect and respectful, to not risk unnecessary miscalculation or escalation at sea.”Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.While Iran has not directly seized or targeted a tanker in recent months, a mine recently struck an oil tanker off Saudi Arabia and a cargo ship near Yemen came under assault. Suspicion immediately fell on Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels for being behind both attacks. The Houthis have not commented on either attack.Paparo, a former Navy fighter pilot who most recently served as director of operations at the US military’s Central Command, offered a different stance than his immediate predecessor, Vice Adm. James Malloy. In one of his last comments to journalists in August, Malloy referred to Iran as “reckless and provocative” and always trying in dramatic naval drills to “lower the denominator until they’re sure that they can look like they’ve won something.”Malloy’s tenure saw oil tankers seized by Iran and a series of limpet mine explosions targeting tankers that the Navy blamed on Iran. Tehran denied being involved, though Revolutionary Guard members were filmed taking an unexploded mine away from one tanker.By contrast, the several months that Paparo’s been in charge have not seen any major crises.The US Navy routinely has tense encounters with the Revolutionary Guard, whose speed boats race alongside American warships in the Persian Gulf and sometimes conduct live-fire drills with machine guns and missile launches in their presence.The Guard typically patrols the shallower waters of the Persian Gulf and its narrow mouth, the Strait of Hormuz. Iran’s regular navy largely operates in the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. While previous commanders have made a point to differentiate between the professionalism of the two, Paparo dismissed it as an “old idea” that included a lingering belief that the service was still loyal to Iran’s former shah, who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.“Forty-one years into the revolution, I think we can dispense with that notion,” the vice admiral said. “I sincerely doubt there’s a difference among them.”Paparo also said he did not believe the 5th Fleet’s mission would be affected by the Navy potentially reconstituting a 1st Fleet responsible for the Indian Ocean.Still, Paparo’s remarks carried a clear warning, quoting former US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis at one point.“Be polite, be professional and have a plan to kill everyone in the room,” he said. “That’s how we conduct ourselves at sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-official-says-uneasy-deterrence-reached-with-iran/story-rWNZ7IMrHHZPIFEINR4CEN.html
06-12-2020||World||Mysterious injuries suffered by US diplomats in China, Cuba likely caused by microwave energy: Study||The mysterious head injuries suffered by US diplomatic staff and their families in China and Cuba are consistent with the use of directed microwave energy, according to an assessment published by the National Academy of Sciences. In late 2016, US Embassy staff in Havana, Cuba, began to report the development of an unusual set of symptoms and some of the cases began with the sudden onset of loud noise.A year later, a US diplomat in Guangzhou, China, started experiencing unexplained symptoms, including headache and memory problems. The doctors concluded that the diplomat, Mark Lenzi, suffered a serious brain injury but MRI findings didn’t reveal the cause. The US State Department requested the National Academy of Sciences to assess the cause.“The committee felt that these acute symptoms were more consistent with a directed radio frequency (RF) energy attack, and explored possible related mechanisms,” the report said, referring to cases involved in so-called sonic attacks.Also Read | US raises concerns over CCP’s threat to American national securityThe researchers said that the chronic symptoms that were reported are often seen in patients after head trauma, as a result of chemical exposure, infectious diseases, or stress in a hostile environment. The committee did not find any evidence for usual forms of traumatic injury. While it did evaluate possible chemical and infectious causes as well as psychosocial causes, the overall analysis showed that they were not the likely cause.The committee said that there are several studies on the health effects of pulsed RF sources, but there are insufficient data in the open literature on potential RF exposure/dosage characteristics and biological effects possible for the cases involved. The report has not concluded that the use of directed microwave energy was deliberate, however, it cautioned that such action could be used for nefarious purposes. “The mere consideration of such a scenario raises grave concerns about a world with disinhibited malevolent actors and new tools for causing harm to others, as if the U.S. government does not have its hands full already with naturally occurring threats,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mysterious-injuries-suffered-by-us-diplomats-in-china-cuba-likely-caused-by-microwave-energy-study/story-TabYjh6B37FUpI6Huw27zN.html

I urge both sides to accelerate their peace efforts to end the country’s long war,” he said in another tweet.Meanwhile, the US State Department in its official statement has welcomed the formation and the first Leadership Committee meeting of the Afghanistan High Council for National Reconciliation on Saturday.“This inclusive body is chaired by Dr Abdullah Abdullah while afghan leaders across the political spectrum have unified to make decisions and mobilize support for a just and lasting peace. All sides of the conflict should come together and chart a path to peace,” said the statement.It further said, “As an authoritative body on peace, the High Council and its Leadership Committee will provide counsel and guidance to the Islamic Republic negotiating team with the Taliban on the terms of an agreement on a political roadmap, power-sharing, and a permanent ceasefire to end the country’s long war.”According to a report by TOLO News, the Afghan political leaders attended the first meeting of the High Council for National Reconciliation but some political figures, including Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Salahuddin Rabbani--the head of Jamiat-e-Islami party and Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, did not participate in the event.“The meeting could have been more complete. There are other personalities in our country who have contributed to peace. They have their own analytical analysis of peace and have public standing. They have the ability to represent, so we hope that they are also invited,” Tolo News quoted former President Hamid Karzai as saying at the reconciliation council’s meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-taliban-discuss-peace-process-release-of-remaining-prisoners/story-JNVlqxrRrLBpE8sCyatIhL.html
06-12-2020||World||US raises concerns over CCP’s threat to American national security||Raising concerns over the Chinese Communist Party’s threat to American national security, the US State Department on Saturday (local time) have listed over 80 Chinese companies mentioned in the US stock exchange in which US retail investors have been investing unknowingly in Chinese companies involved in both civilian and military production.According to an official statement issued by the State Department, “The Chinese Communist Party’s threat to American national security extends into our financial markets and impacts American investors. Many major stock and bond indices developed by index providers like MSCI and FTSE include malign People’s Republic of China (PRC) companies, listed on the Department of Commerce Entity List and/or the Department of Defense List of Communist Chinese military companies. The money flowing into these index funds - often passively, by US retail investors - supports Chinese companies involved in both civilian and military production.”It further said that some of these companies produce technologies for the “surveillance of civilians and repression of human rights”, as is the case of “Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang, China”, as well as in other repressive regimes, such as Iran and Venezuela.Some of the companies named in the list include -- China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, Aviation Industry Corporation of China, China State Shipbuilding Corporation,Huawei Technologies, China Spacesat, AVIC International Holdings Ltd., Xi’an ChenXi Aviation Technology Corp., Ltd.“As of June 2020, at least 22 of the 31 parent-level PRC military companies had affiliates’ securities included on a major securities index, including at least 68 distinct affiliate-level securities issuers; at least 13 PRC firms on the Entity List had affiliates or parent companies included in the MSCI or FTSE stock indices; and the MSCI emerging market index included 230 A-shares Chinese stocks incorporated on the mainland, quoted in renminbi, and listed on Chinese Communist Party-controlled Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges,” said the State Department.This list comes amid the worsening of relations between the US and China.On Friday, the US terminated five programmes that were disguised as “cultural exchanges,” with China as they are “fully funded and operated by the PRC government as soft power propaganda tools”.On December 3, the US government had issued an order to block cotton imports from a Xinjiang governmental organisation in China due to the ongoing human rights abuses of Uyghurs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-raises-concerns-over-ccp-s-threat-to-american-national-security/story-XGC5TBxiBFc3wK7fIyezeJ.html

He gave no further details.Democracy activists say conditions have worsened in the former British colony after China imposed security legislation on the financial hub in June, making anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or colluding with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison.China, which promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, denies curbing rights and freedoms, but authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have moved swiftly to quash dissent after anti-government protests erupted last year and engulfed the city. Local media reported that at least five accounts worth hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars belonging to Hui and his family, all of whom are now in Britain, had been inaccessible since Saturday. Hui contacted the banks and was told there were “remarks” placed on his accounts, but the staff refused to provide further information, Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reported.“We do not comment on the details of individual accounts,” a Hang Seng Bank spokesman told Reuters by email. HSBC and BOC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Hui said on Thursday he had fled after facing criminal charges and would seek exile in Britain.One of the pro-democracy activists arrested last month and charged with disturbing legislature proceedings, Hui arrived in Copenhagen last week on an official invitation from Danish lawmakers.Hong Kong’s Security Bureau issued a statement on Friday that, while not naming Hui, said “running away by jumping bail and using various excuses such as so-called ‘exile’ to avoid one’s responsibility is a shameful, hypocritical and cowardly act of recoil.”Hui was one of several opposition lawmakers who quit Hong Kong’s Legislative Council last month in protest at the dismissal of four colleagues in what they called another push by Beijing to suppress democracy in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-hong-kong-lawmaker-ted-hui-says-accounts-frozen-after-he-sought-exile/story-5Xy30Qcy3tLchPX5pwzJPI.html

06-12-2020||World||Australia Lacks Strategy to Deal With China, Labor’s Wong Says||Australia lacks an overarching approach to handling a “much more assertive” China, and needs a plan for economic diversification and liaising with Asian allies to handle the emerging superpower, opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong said.“The strategy should be working out how we deal with the effects for Australia and the region of a China which demonstrably is taking a very different stance,” Wong told ABC’s ‘Insiders’ program. “The government really does need to stop focusing on splashy headlines and work out what is it doing.”Australia is the world’s most China-dependent developed economy and finalized a free-trade agreement with Beijing in 2015. Ties have been fraught since 2018, when Canberra barred Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network, and went into freefall earlier this year when the prime minister called for an independent probe into the origins of the pandemic, leading to trade reprisals.On Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison sought an apology from China after a diplomat in Beijing tweeted an image purporting to show an Australian soldier holding a knife to an Afghan child’s throat. That related to an investigation that uncovered alleged war crimes by Australian troops in Afghanistan.“The relationship is obviously in a very difficult and challenging place,” Wong said Sunday. “Going forward, I think we should assume that a more assertive, at times more aggressive China, is here to stay.”Despite the criticism, the opposition Labor party has sought to maintain a bipartisan response to China’s actions, with Wong saying it’s important for Australia to “remain unified in our condemnation.”Debate has simmered on whether Morrison was correct to respond so quickly -- and in person -- to the tweet. A visibly angry prime minister called a press conference 45 minutes after it was posted. Morrison reportedly only spoke with his foreign minister beforehand; Wong said he didn’t get in contact with Labor.“In diplomacy you always have to think carefully about how you calibrate your response,” she said. “It is a big call to go directly, escalate directly to the national leader, and I hope that Scott Morrison thought very carefully about that decision. I hope that he took advice.”Olympic BoycottChina refused to apologise; instead the Foreign Ministry’s top spokeswoman shot back, asking whether Morrison lacks “a sense of right and wrong.”Asked whether Australia should boycott the Winter Olympics in China in 2022, Wong said the opposition’s view -- and she understood this to be government’s too -- is that the event is an opportunity to focus on China and a legitimate time for questions of human rights.“China talked about the importance of human rights this week in the tweet,” Wong said. “Equally, I assume that they will therefore recognize the right of other nations and other communities to raise the issue of human rights in the context of the Olympics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-lacks-strategy-to-deal-with-china-labor-s-wong-says/story-NJilwSFPriQx3394m8ivIJ.html
06-12-2020||World||Joe Biden’s transition tests the US-UK‘special relationship’||Presidential transitions, even when they are less fraught than this one, prompt more apprehension among America’s allies than among its enemies. This is especially true of the British.The British government is exerting itself to show the incoming Joe Biden administration that the UK remains a useful ally. Last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed to a remarkably generous supplementary funding deal for Britain’s armed forces, worth $22 billion over four years. Clearly, he hopes the new US commander in chief will regard this as a commitment to maintain the country’s military capability, always a cornerstone of transatlantic relations.British officials burn midnight oil to divine the likely course of the Biden administration. A former British ambassador in Washington tells me: “The question is always, ‘Do we know the people who will be around the president? And will they like us?’”Johnson and his advisers know that Biden has no predisposition to like the Prime Minister — as President Donald Trump did, seeing a minor clone of himself, a fellow china-breaker.In the wake of Brexit, Britain will urgently need a new trade deal with Washington to replace the US-European Union(EU) arrangements. Yet the Biden administration will be in no hurry to negotiate, especially until it becomes plain whether the precarious 1998 Irish Good Friday peace agreement is threatened by cavalier UK conduct over border trade, as some of us fear that it will be.When spring blossoms, Britain’s Prime Minister will almost certainly visit the new US president. Tired old phrases about a “special relationship” will be dusted off and written into British headlines. In Washington, such fantasies evoke mild amusement. Few Americans will notice that Johnson is in town.This British government, like its predecessors, has to learn the hard lesson that US presidents spend much less time thinking about them than they do thinking about the occupant of the White House. Henry Kissinger has wittily described the follies of British prime ministers in meeting US chief executives. “Harold Wilson,” he wrote of the  British leader, “greeted President Nixon with the avuncular goodwill of the head of an ancient family that has seen better times.”Kissinger wrote pityingly of the British yearning to claim a special relationship with the US This should be indulged, he said, because “we do not suffer in the world from such an excess of friends that we should discourage those who feel that they have a special friendship for us.” The US, he urged, should never wantonly trample on British sensitivities. It should merely pursue “special relationships” with all its allies.Britain and the US have many values and interests in common. But successive British leaders diminish themselves when they parade delusions about their nation’s importance. Though I am not an intimate in the corridors of power, I have trafficked with six prime ministers, and urged all save Margaret Thatcher — I would not have dared — in vain to adopt realistic attitudes toward Anglo-American relations.A few days before Theresa May entered 10 Downing Street in July 2016, by chance I was her neighbour at a dinner party. We chatted mostly about nothings, but toward the end of the evening, I said that, as a historian, I would venture to offer one fragment of advice.When she took office, I said, she would visit Washington and receive all the courtesies in which Americans excel. However, she should never delude herself that relations between our countries involve sentiment. They are governed, instead, by the same criteria that dictate every nation’s foreign policy: perceptions of self-interest. Britain must never fall out with the US, but our leaders should forsake expectations of favours.May said nothing in response, and I did not expect her to. But soon after Trump became president, she visited Washington and offered him a state visit to Britain — an almost unheard-of invitation at the outset of an administration.For various reasons, the visit was put off until July 2019. When the president eventually arrived, the British pulled out the stops to entertain him, organizing a spectacular demonstration of the Special Air Service’s antiterrorist prowess, together with the Royal Family’s inimitable road show.It all proved wasted effort. Trump has treated Britain no worse than any other nation, but also no better. Just before General James Mattis resigned as US defense secretary in February 2019, he spoke privately to a senior British officer whom he warned: “However many state visits you fix, this president does not do allies.”None of the above — nor, indeed, what follows — is a complaint about American behavior. Again and again in the postwar era, our two nations have worked together in ways that have benefited world peace. But British governments would enjoy happier lives, and expose themselves to fewer humiliations, if they acknowledged the UK’s relatively modest place in today’s world, together with the fact that many other folks are competing for the ears and smiles of Washington.The US and British militaries have always cooperated closely, with mutual respect. So much has been written about the quarrels between generals in World War II that it is sometimes forgotten how amazingly well relationships worked at the operational level. Intelligence is the field where Britain has the most to offer the US, a tradition unbroken since the World War II era of Bletchley Park’s legendary code-breakers. GCHQ, the British cyberwar center outside Cheltenham, is a world-class operation, which America’s National Security Agency values immensely.Trump threatened to break the intelligence partnership unless Britain withdrew contracts from the Chinese Huawei corporation, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government complied. Its own security experts believe the US was correct on this issue.The same was true back in November 1956, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s rage about the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, following Gamal Abdel Nasser’s nationalization of the Suez Canal, forced a humiliating retreat. “Suez,” as the British still refer to the crisis, was a ghastly mistake, which exasperated Americans by deflecting world attention away from the savage, almost simultaneous Soviet suppression of the Budapest uprising. Nonetheless, Anglo-American solidarity through the decades of the Cold War was a critical factor in holding together the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance and checking Soviet adventurism. British governments suffered moments of private alarm that the US might unleash nuclear weapons, first in Korea, then during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. But the public front of the alliance remained unbroken.John F. Kennedy was the last US president to have close friendships with leading British figures, notably the UK ambassador in Washington, David Ormsby-Gore, and the journalist Henry Brandon. There was also mutual affection between Kennedy and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. It fell to the latter to smooth his countrymen’s ruffled feathers after Secretary of State Dean Acheson asserted in 1962 that the British had lost an empire but “not yet found a role,” a remark that stung to the quick, because so true.The transatlantic relationship survived turbulence in the mid-1960s, when President Lyndon Johnson put Wilson on the barbecue, figuratively speaking, to persuade him to send even a token troop contingent to Vietnam. Wilson’s refusal was perhaps the wisest act of his premiership, but prompted US secretary of state Dean Rusk to poke a British journalist in the chest at a Georgetown cocktail party and growl: “When the Russians invade Sussex, don’t expect us to come and help you!”The decade of Margaret Thatcher, of course, was the sole period of the last half-century when a British leader has commanded the highest respect and attention in the US Ronald Reagan admired her prodigiously. Yet their relationship is often misunderstood. His administration repeatedly acted in ways that dismayed and even affronted her, as in 1983 when it occupied Grenada, a former British colony, without consulting London.    Even during the UK’s war against Argentina in the Falklands a year earlier, the most serious early crisis of Thatcher’s premiership, US Secretary of State Alexander Haig and UN ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick strongly opposed endangering US interests in South America to save the moth-eaten imperial lion, as they saw Thatcher’s nation.Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger alone, and importantly, supported Britain and ensured critical military and intelligence aid. In the last weeks of the war, Reagan enraged the Prime Minister by telephoning to urge her not to impose absolute defeat, and thus humiliation, on the Argentine military junta.Thatcher exploded, and the transcript of their conversation delights posterity. “This is democracy and our islands,” she told him. Having lost valuable British ships and invaluable servicemen’s lives to return to the Falklands, she utterly rejected a diplomatic settlement. At one point in her harangue, Reagan held up the phone in the Oval Office so that others might hear the Prime Minister, saying, “Isn’t she marvelous?”Several wars later, during and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Prime Minister Tony Blair expended immense political capital to support President George W. Bush all the way to Baghdad, which has cost his historic reputation dearly. Blair’s backing reflected yet another British Prime Minister fantasizing that he could buy favoUrs in Washington.Although the British committed a division to the Iraq operation, American histories scarcely mention that participation. Moreover, Blair deluded himself that backing the invasion would enable him to secure a tougher US stance toward Israel, in pursuit of Middle East peace.   A year after the war, a very senior official of the British Foreign Office said to me ruefully: “You know, we stuck out our necks a long way for the US over Iraq. Yet now we have a dozen outstanding bilateral issues with Washington on aircraft landing rights, F-35 technology access codes and suchlike, and we are getting absolutely no payback.”The reality, of course, as all nations are obliged to recognize, is that the many elements of US administrations operate almost independent of each other, often little influenced by the White House. Prime Minister David Cameron sought to persuade President Barack Obama to give BP a helping hand amid the colossal cash penalties inflicted by US courts following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (which were far in excess of those imposed on similarly negligent U.S. oil companies). He got nowhere.Kissinger has written, in terms relevant to this day, that the British way of retaining great-power status “was to be so integral a part of American decision-making that the idea of not consulting them seemed a violation of the natural order of things.”It remains the ambition of every British Prime Minister to make our country sufficiently useful to merit consultative status in Washington during international crises, though this becomes more difficult as the focus of US foreign policy shifts toward Asia. The British are unwilling to acknowledge that their armed forces’ lack of mass makes them ever-less-credible fighting partners. The Royal Air Force has fewer front-line planes than a US Marine air wing; the British Army and Royal Navy are likewise shrunken. The principal value of UK support of US foreign warmaking is to provide political cover.Britain’s brilliant ambassador in Washington in the early 1990s, Robin Renwick, has written: “The UK needs to understand the perspective in which it is viewed in Washington. There is a clear recognition that, from every perspective except military, Germany is a far more important force in Europe, and will be still more so post-Brexit.”After Biden’s inauguration, Boris Johnson’s government will face a familiar problem: As the British people display ever less confidence in their Prime Minister, there is no reason for America’s president to feel any more enthusiasm for him.    Nonetheless, a working relationship between the two nations, rooted in common security concerns and ancestry, should remain serviceable to both. Our soldiers are unlikely again to land together on the beaches of Normandy, as they did in 1944. But it will be a sadness, indeed, should we not remain on the same side of history’s barricades through tough decades ahead.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Hastings is a Bloomberg columnist.

From midnight on Sunday, up to 100 people will be able to attend public gatherings such as weddings, with density rules of one person per two square metres remaining in place, while 50% of office workers will be able to return to workplaces by Jan. 11, up from 25% now, the state’s premier said. “Today we can take some big steps, not to normal, but to a Covid-safe summer (but) we all need to remain vigilant and we all need to play our part,” Premier Daniel Andrews told a news conference. Masks will remain mandatory at indoor venues and on public and ride-share transport, he said. Public health concerns eased after two travellers who returned from Germany, bypassing quarantine in Sydney to travel straight to Melbourne, returned negative Covid-19 tests.All passengers on the Saturday afternoon domestic flight between the two cities and some airport staff must remain in self-quarantine until the results from a second test arrive on Monday, a health official said. Australia recorded 7 new cases overnight, all returned travellers. The country has all but stamped out the coronavirus through strict quarantine measures, particularly in Victoria, the second-most populous state, which in early August logged as many as 700 daily infections.This comes as a Reuters tally of global infections rose above 65.58 million people, while more than 1.5 million people have died, and as the United States continues to set single-day records for new infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-victoria-eases-restrictions-for-covid-safe-summer/story-nsB7KwoNnV9phkvl0Y9kON.html
06-12-2020||World||Trump challenges vote results while urging turnout in Georgia||President Donald Trump is pressing his grievances over losing the presidential election, using a weekend rally to spread baseless allegations of misconduct in last month’s voting in Georgia and beyond even as he pushed supporters to turn out for a pair of Republican Senate candidates in a runoff election in January.“Let them steal Georgia again, you’ll never be able to look yourself in the mirror,” Trump told rallygoers.Trump’s 100-minute rally before thousands of largely maskless supporters came not long after he was rebuffed by Georgia’s Republican governor in his astounding call for a special legislative session to give him the state’s electoral votes, even though President-elect Joe Biden won the majority of the vote.The Jan. 5 Senate runoffs in Georgia will determine the balance of power in Washington after Biden takes office. Republicans in the state are worried that Trump is stoking so much suspicion about Georgia elections that voters will think the system is rigged and decide to sit out the two races.The latest futile attempt to subvert the presidential election results continued Trump’s unprecedented campaign to undermine confidence in the democratic process, but overshadowed his stated purpose in traveling to Georgia — boosting Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.Republicans need one victory to maintain their Senate majority. Democrats need a Georgia sweep to force a 50-50 Senate and position Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tiebreaking vote. Party officials had hoped the president would dedicate his energy to imploring supporters to vote in the runoff, when Perdue and Loeffler try to hold off Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively.Trump did echo Republican rhetoric that the races amounted to “the most important congressional runoff, probably in American history.” That is only true because he lost.But after Air Force One landed, it quickly became apparent that Trump was intent on airing his own complaints and stoking baseless doubts about the conduct of last month’s vote, rather than boosting his party.“I want to stay on presidential,” Trumps said minutes into his speech. “But I got to get to these two.” He praised the GOP lawmakers, Perdue for his support for military spending and Loeffler for pushing for early coronavirus relief spending. But he quickly pivoted back to his own defeat.Trump pulled out a piece of paper and read a list of his electoral achievements, including falsely asserting he won Georgia and the White House. Biden carried the state by 12,670 votes and won a record 81 million votes nationally. Trump continued to reiterate his unsubstantiated claims of fraud, despite his own administration assessing the election to have been conducted without any major issues.Chants of “Fight for Trump” drowned out the two senators as they briefly spoke to the crowd.Hours before the event, Trump asked Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in a phone call to order the legislative session; the governor refused, according to a senior government official in Georgia with knowledge of the call who was not authorized to discuss the private conversation and spoke on the condition of anonymity. A person close to the White House who was briefed on the matter verified that account of the call.Kemp, in a tweet, said Trump also asked him to order an audit of signatures on absentee ballot envelopes in his state, a step Kemp is not empowered to take because he has no authority to interfere in the electoral process on Trump’s behalf.Trump, though, vented his frustrations with Kemp on Twitter and at the rally.“Your people are refusing to do what you ask,” he complained in a tweet, as if speaking with Kemp. “What are they hiding? At least immediately ask for a Special Session of the Legislature. That you can easily, and immediately, do.”At the rally, he took aim once again at Kemp, saying he could assure him victory “if he knew what the hell he was doing.”Trump’s personal contact with the governor demonstrated he is intent on amplifying his conspiratorial and debunked theories of electoral fraud even as Georgia Republicans want him to turn his focus to the runoff and encourage their supporters to get out and vote.In his tweet, Kemp said: “As I told the President this morning, I’ve publicly called for a signature audit three times to restore confidence in our election process and to ensure that only legal votes are counted in Georgia.”While the governor does not have the authority to order a signature audit, an audit was initiated by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and it triggered a full hand recount that confirmed Biden’s victory in Georgia. The race has been certified for Biden and affirmed by the state’s Republican election officials as a fairly conducted and counted vote, with none of the systemic errors Trump alleges.But after two pro-Trump lawyers this past week questioned whether voting again is even worth it — in echoes of the president’s baseless accusations of widespread voter fraud — even Vice President Mike Pence betrayed concerns that the Republican coalition could crack under the force of Trump’s grievances.“I know we’ve all got our doubts about the last election, and I hear some of you saying, ‘Just don’t vote,’” Pence said Friday while campaigning with Perdue in Savannah. “If you don’t vote, they win.”Few Republicans in Washington or Georgia believe wide swaths of the electorate in this newfound battleground would opt out of voting because of Trump’s false claims or his denigration of the Georgia governor and secretary of state for certifying Biden’s victory in the state.The risk for the GOP is that it wouldn’t take much of a drop-off to matter if the runoffs are as close as the presidential contest: Biden won Georgia by about 12,500 votes out of 5 million cast. There’s enough noise to explain why Pence felt the need to confront the matter head on after two Trump loyalists floated the idea of the president’s supporters bailing on Perdue and Loeffler.Trump’s false claims have resonated with voters such as Barry Mann, a 61-year-old business owner who came to hear Pence in Savannah. Mann hasn’t decided whether he’ll vote for his senators a second time.“I think there’s some issues with our election and more investigation needs to be done,” Mann said, adding that he doesn’t think Perdue and Loeffler have done enough to support Trump’s efforts to overturn the results. “I want to see what happens between now and January,” Mann said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-challenges-vote-results-while-urging-turnout-in-georgia/story-3sdL6GFwJeC1rMVp8XOdnJ.html

Even with a vaccine, if states do not act to bring current surges under control, the death toll could reach 770,000 by April 1,” according to IHME.The steady decline in Covid-19 infection rates around the world are expected to start in February and continue into March and subsequent months, IHME stated further.Earlier this week, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) committee voted to give healthcare workers and nursing home residents the first of the Covid-19 vaccines once the doses are rolled out, within three weeks.US President Donald Trump said at the Saturday rally in Valdosta, Georgia that coronavirus vaccines will be made available in the US next week, Sputnik reported.The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US has surpassed 14.5 million. More than 281,000 people have died from the coronavirus infection in the US, which has the highest Covid-19 death toll and the largest number of confirmed cases of all the countries in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-deaths-could-surpass-500-000-says-ihme/story-XSkVir4aPeXreLwn0FX5LN.html

All gatherings of more than 50 people will be banned, and restaurants will continue to be prohibited from serving customers after 9 p.m. and can do only takeouts and deliveries. In addition, no spectators will be allowed into sporting events.“The situation in the greater Seoul area is serious,” Chung said at a Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures meeting in Seoul City Hall. “The 2.5 level will be maintained for the next three weeks until the end of the year.”South Korea confirmed 631 cases on Sunday, the highest in nine months, while total deaths rose by five to 545, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The greater Seoul area -- which covers the capital, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province -- is home to almost half of South Korea’s population, and Chung acknowledged the disruption that the latest move would cause.‘Psychological Stress’“The measure would bring both economic and psychological stress to small business owners,“ the prime minister said. “But we must curb the infection numbers now, if we want to have our ordinary lives back as early as possible.”The uptick in cases comes after the social-distancing level greater Seoul was raised to 2 from 1.5 just two weeks ago, limiting restaurant hours and gatherings. In a meeting last Sunday, Chung announced additional restrictions on top of the level 2 measures, including a halt on some businesses.The Seoul municipal government also imposed a de facto curfew for two weeks from Dec. 5, shuttering most shops at 9 p.m. and cutting back public transportation operations by 30%.The central government will discuss whether to add more measures after monitoring the current spread of the virus. A shift to level 3 would result in a suspension on gatherings of more than 10 and all sporting events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-clamps-down-as-virus-cases-surge-to-nine-month-high/story-Xy8JaFdQYMuFOfCfThS08K.html
06-12-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine update: Pfizer seeks emergency use nod in India, UK rolls out inoculation plan||After getting the nod for emergency use in the UK and Bahrain, Pfizer Inc has applied for emergency use authorisation in India. The United Kingdom is getting ready for emergency rollouts of the Pfizer vaccine and is now in the final stages of planning before the vaccination drive starts on December 14. Elsewhere in China, a million people have already been vaccinated as the country soldiers on with its vaccination drive.Experts all over the world have begun to question China’s hurry in vaccinating its citizens when it claims to have contained Covid-19’s viral spread within its borders.Here’s an update on what has been happening on the vaccine front:1. Pfizer has sought emergency use authorisation for its vaccine from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) said PTI. In its application the firm has also asked for a waiver on clinical trials in India. Five other vaccines are currently in advanced phases of clinical trials in India. The Pfizer vaccine’s one major drawback is that it has to be stored at minus 70 degree Celsius, a temperature which most Indian cold storages cannot reach.2. The UK will soon become the first western country to deploy a Covid-19 vaccine after regulators approved the Pfizer-BioNTech shot on Wednesday, according to Reuters. It plans to begin inoculations during the week of December 14. The government has bought 40 million doses, enough to inoculate 20 million people on the two-dose regimen. Following stringent quality checks, the vaccine will be first distributed to 50 hospital hubs around the country, followed by doctor-run vaccination centres. The shots will be administered in order of priority, with the first vaccines going to those in care homes, including healthcare workers, and people over 80 years old. NHS England has announced that vaccines are scheduled to arrive at hospitals Monday with the first vaccinations starting Tuesday. Once the vaccine becomes more widely available, smaller sites like local pharmacies will also be involved in administering the doses. 3. Provincial governments all across China have started placing orders for the experimental, indigenous vaccine. More than 1 million people have already been vaccinated after the provincial governments approved the experimental vaccine for emergency use, reported the Associated Press. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be kept frozen, the Chinese ones can be stored in temperatures as low as 2 to 8 degree Celsius.4. As India starts to roll out inoculation drives all over the country, Uttarakhand’s topography presents a challenge. The Uttarakhand Drone Application and Research Centre (DARC) under Information Technology Development Agency (ITDA) is preparing to deploy drones for the supply of vaccine doses in remote areas. Amit Sinha, inspector general of Uttarakhand police and director of ITDA, has said that one such drone has been used for a test run, and it has flown from Dehradun to Mussoorie and successfully delivered a generic vaccine in an icebox. ITDA at present has about 12 drones including Quadcopters and fixed-wing vehicles.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-pfizer-seeks-emergency-use-nod-in-india-uk-rolls-out-inoculation-plan/story-9J8ivhCf444WYrKTmmNv6L.html
06-12-2020||World||Chinese court tells Dutch collector to return Buddha statue||A Chinese court has ordered a Dutch art collector to hand over a Buddha statue in the latest twist in a 3-year-old legal battle with villagers who say it was stolen from a temple.Residents of Yangchun, a village in the southeastern province of Fujian, say the statue is a 1,000-year-old relic that holds the mummified remains of a monk and disappeared in 1995. The collector says he bought the object in Hong Kong in 1996 but denied it was the stolen statue.The ruling Communist Party is stepping up efforts to retrieve Chinese art and artifacts that are believed to be stolen and in foreign hands.The Sanming Intermediate People’s Court on Friday ordered the collector, Oscar van Overeem, to return the statue within 30 days, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.Two committees representing villagers sued in a Dutch court in 2017, but judges ruled the following year they didn’t count as legal entities that could make a claim.Friday’s ruling found the temple and its relics were collectively owned by the villages of Yangchun and Dongpu, giving residents the right as a group to demand the statue’s return, according to Xinhua.The villagers say the missing statue contains the remains of Zhang Gong Zhushi, or Patriarch Zhang Gong, who became famous for helping to treat diseases during the Song Dynasty.Villagers say they traced the missing statue to the Dutch collector after it appeared in an exhibition in Hungary in 2015, according to Xinhua.After negotiations with the collector broke down, they filed suit, citing Dutch law that prohibits ownership of a body of a person whose identity is known.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-tells-dutch-collector-to-return-buddha-statue/story-1vbFIKcMyvTV5bHfIJ0bWM.html

This is a message about multi-lateral partnerships and the freedom of passage.”China has said its intentions in the region are peaceful.But Japan has grown particularly concerned about a rise in Chinese naval activity around the disputed islands in the East China Sea that Tokyo calls the Senkaku, while Beijing refers to them the Diaoyu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-france-us-plan-their-first-joint-military-drills-in-may/story-ht1Ghp6WltYwtDVKW11HKJ.html
06-12-2020||World||Why French protests pivoted to police power and abuse||Thousands of people have taken to French streets over the past three years to express anger over rising social and economic inequalities. The outrage is now centered on tougher new security laws and police abuses. Large demonstrations were held in major cities across the country at the end of November.1. What triggered the most recent protests?An article in a draft security bill would ban posting or broadcasting videos or photos of police with intent to cause them “physical or psychological harm.” Violators could face up to a year in prison. Critics say that provision, known as Article 24, would inhibit the publication of images by journalists and citizens, removing a key tool in holding police to account and exposing abuses. Jean-Louis Debre, ex-president of the Constitutional Council, called Article 24 “absurd” considering that legislative tools already exist to fight against the propagation of hatred online. Adding fuel to the protests was the release of footage showing police officers beating a Black music producer at the entrance of his Paris studio.2. How did the government respond?Three police officers were charged on November 30, with two of them placed in custody while the investigation continues. In a Facebook and Twitter statement, President Emmanuel Macron said the videos brought “shame on us” and condemned violence both by and against the police. Then the parliament majority announced it would completely rewrite Article 24. The government plans a “major survey” in January to gauge racism and discrimination in French society. It also plans a national platform to report incidences of discrimination.3. What’s the point of the legislation?The number of officers wounded on duty and targeted by violence has doubled over the past 15 years; in recent protests alone, 98 officers were injured, according to the government. It wants to do more to protect them. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin often cites the 2016 fatal stabbing of a police officer and his partner in front of their toddler by a jihadist as an example of the dangers faced by law enforcers. Macron is also renewing his focus on law-and-order as he reaches out to traditional conservative voters ahead of presidential elections in 2022. It was a group of lawmakers within Macron’s own party that pushed for the legislation, but during the first reading in parliament, 10 deputies from the president’s party voted against it and 30 abstained. The bill still passed by a large majority.4. What happens now?Macron’s government has tried to hold the line in the face of criticism from civil society and protesters. Authorities acknowledge shortcomings, but insist systemic violence doesn’t exist within the police force. Other provisions in the draft security legislation that have caused alarm would expand the powers of the police by giving them access to security cameras and grants them the right to deploy drones equipped with facial recognition technology to monitor public demonstrations. Opponents say that the freedom of assembly and data privacy is at risk. Another piece of legislation, the so-called separatism law, aims to fight organizations and individuals that threaten the unity and secular values of the French Republic. But groups like Human Rights Watch have expressed concern that actions the government says are intended to counter radical Islam could fuel Islamophobia.5. Have protests increased under Macron?According to the Ministry of the Interior, protests under Macron haven’t attracted as many people as under other presidents. Macron swept to power in May 2017 with a promise to radically reshape the country. That was bound to cause upset in a nation where citizens are known for taking to the streets to express their anger. After Macron took office, one of the largest trade unions demonstrated against his planned overhaul of labour laws. The following year brought the Yellow Vest protests triggered by a planned tax rise on fuel. Protests at times turned violent. In December 2019, strikes and protests brought Paris to a standstill as Macron sought to push through his pension reform. Some rallies demanding racial justice followed the killing of American George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-french-protests-pivoted-to-police-power-and-abuse/story-Tcokog9K759oYEJjMTwSUK.html
06-12-2020||World||Covid-19 could push number of people living in extreme poverty to over 1 billion by 2030: UN||An additional 207 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 due to the severe long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic, bringing the total number of the world’s extremely poor to more than a billion, a new study from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has found. The study assesses the impact of different Covid-19 recovery scenarios on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), evaluating the multidimensional effects of the pandemic over the next decade. The study is part of a long-standing partnership between the UNDP and the Pardee Center for International Futures at the University of Denver. “Severe long-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic could push an additional 207 million people into extreme poverty on top of the current pandemic trajectory, bringing the total to over 1 billion by 2030,” noted the study. The ‘Baseline COVID’ scenario, based on current mortality rates and the most recent growth projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), would result in 44 million more people living in extreme poverty by 2030 compared to the development trajectory the world was on before the pandemic. Under a ‘High Damage’ scenario, where the recovery is protracted, Covid-19 is likely to push an additional 207 million people into extreme poverty by 2030, and increase the female poverty headcount by an additional 102 million compared to that baseline, says the report. The ‘High Damage’ scenario anticipates that 80 per cent of the Covid-induced economic crisis would persist in 10 years’ time due to loss in productivity, preventing a full recovery to the growth trajectory seen before the pandemic. However, the study also finds that a focused set of SDG investments over the next decade in social protection/welfare programmes, governance, digitalisation, and a green economy could not only prevent the rise of extreme poverty, but actually exceed the development trajectory the world was on before the pandemic. “This ambitious, yet feasible ‘SDG Push’ scenario would lift an additional 146 million people out of extreme poverty, narrow the gender poverty gap, and reduce the female poverty headcount by 74 million, even taking into account the current impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic,” UNDP said. UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said as this new poverty research highlights, the Covid-19 pandemic is a tipping point, and the choices leaders take now could take the world in very different directions. “We have an opportunity to invest in a decade of action that not only helps people to recover from Covid-19, but that re-sets the development path of people and planet towards a more fair, resilient and green future,” he said. The concerted SDG interventions suggested by the study combine behavioural changes through nudges for both governments and citizens, such as improved effectiveness and efficiency in governance and changes in consumption patterns of food, energy and water. The proposed interventions also focus on global collaboration for climate action, additional investments in Covid-19 recovery, and the need for improved broadband access and technology innovation, UNDP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-push-number-of-people-living-in-extreme-poverty-to-over-1-billion-by-2030-un/story-lvdk2haxDPuf1w7954Fk0H.html
06-12-2020||World||China prepares large-scale rollout of Covid-19 vaccines||Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country’s 1.4 billion people.Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said Thursday during a U.N. meeting, as Britain issued approval for emergency use of Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine candidate and providers scrambled to set up distribution.China’s fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there. However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries.One developer, China National Pharmaceutical Group, known as Sinopharm, said in November it applied for final market approval for use of its vaccine in China. Others have been approved for emergency use on health workers and other people deemed at high risk of infection.“We must be prepared for large-scale production,” said Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, who has overseen much of the country’s response, during a visit Wednesday to developers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.Sun visited one of Sinopharm’s Beijing subsidiary companies; another producer, Sinovac, and a research lab under the National Medical Products Administration, a regulatory agency that approves medical products for public use.The government has yet to say how many people it plans to vaccinate. Sun said plans call for vaccinating border personnel and other high-risk populations this month.The companies are using more traditional techniques than Western developers.They say unlike Pfizer’s vaccine, which must be kept frozen at temperatures as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), theirs can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46F). The Chinese producers have yet to say how they might be distributed.More than 1 million people in China have received experimental vaccines under emergency use approval. Health experts question why China is using them on such a vast scale now that the outbreak is largely under control within its borders.Health officials previously said China will be able to manufacture 610 million doses by the end of this year and ramp up to 1 billion doses next year.The government of Jiangsu province, where the major city of Nanjing is located, issued a procurement notice for vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm on Wednesday for emergency use vaccinations.Click here for complete coverage of coronavirus pandemicAuthorities in Sichuan province in the west, which has about 85 million people, announced Monday they were already buying vaccines. An official newspaper in Anhui province, southeast of Beijing, said a local residential committee issued a notice asking whether residents want a vaccine.The Sichuan and Anhui announcements said the vaccine, given in two shots, would cost a total of 400 yuan ($60).Vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm were approved for emergency use in July.In October, Zhejiang province south of Shanghai offered the public vaccination under emergency use authorization. It said people considered high-risk would get priority.In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people had received its vaccine.In September, Sinovac’s CEO said about 3,000 of its employees had taken their vaccine. He said the company provided tens of thousands of doses to the Beijing city government.Developers have yet to disclose how effective their vaccines are and possible side effects.Sinopharm has clinical trials under way in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina with nearly 60,000 volunteers. It has built two facilities in China capable of producing 200 million doses per year.Sinovac has trials in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. Its most recent publicized data, a study in the science journal the Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who had recovered from COVID-19. The company projects it will be able to produce a few hundred million doses of the vaccine by February or March of next year.Another producer, CanSino, is testing in Russia, Pakistan and Mexico and pursuing partnerships in Latin American countries. Its vaccine, which has been used on an emergency basis with the Chinese military, uses a harmless adenovirus to carry genes into human cells to generate an immune response.A fourth company, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biologic Pharmacy Co., is conducting final stage trials across China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-prepares-large-scale-rollout-of-covid-19-vaccines/story-LcsfnLuMuylehFE3h3kBWP.html

That team includes Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp and Draper.Blue Origin has vied for lucrative government contracts in recent years and is competing with rival billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Dynetics, owned by Leidos Holdings Inc, to win a contract to build NASA’s next human lunar landing system to ferry humans to the moon in the next decade.In April, NASA awarded a lunar lander development contract to Blue Origin’s team worth $579 million, as well as two other companies: SpaceX which received $135 million to help develop its Starship system and Leidos-owned Dynetics which won $253 million.NASA is poised to pick two of the three companies “in early March” 2021 to continue building their lander prototypes for crewed missions to the moon beginning in 2024, an agency spokeswoman has said.But slim funds for the landing systems made available to NASA by Congress, as well as uncertainty over the incoming Biden administration’s views on space exploration, have threatened to delay NASA’s decision to advance the lunar lander contracts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-says-blue-origin-will-take-the-first-woman-to-moon-s-surface/story-PCobpNWkdQ7zRyA8ls1pTO.html

The vaccine, created by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, has arrived at secure locations in Britain from Belgium, the department of health and social care said on Sunday.Britain will become the first western country to deploy a Covid-19 vaccine after regulators approved the Pfizer-BioNTech shot on Wednesday.Here’s how the UK is preparing for the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine:1. Following quality checks to ensure the vaccines have been kept at the correct temperature, the shots will be made available to 50 hospital hubs around the country, before being distributed to doctor-run vaccination centres that will administer them.2. The government has bought 40 million doses from the companies, enough to inoculate 20 million people on the two-dose regimen. The shots will be given in order of priority, with the first vaccines going to those in care homes, including frontline workers and people over 80 years of age.3. Vaccines are planned to arrive at hospitals on Monday with the first vaccinations starting Tuesday, according to a separate release from NHS England, with patients aged 80 and over who are already in hospital or attending appointments there among the first to receive the jab, the NHS said. Any appointments not used for the first priority groups will be given to healthcare workers at high risk of serious illness from Covid-19.4. When more of the vaccine becomes available, smaller sites like local pharmacies will also be involved in administering the vaccines, the government has said.5. About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week in the country with a population of 67 million.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-hospital-hubs-to-doctor-run-centres-uk-s-plan-for-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out/story-Dl59kGsQic6yVwZJ0HRjTM.html

Biden also talked about what his father said his expectations were from a government.“My dad used to say, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems. But I expect it to understand my problems.” Folks out there aren’t looking for a handout — they just need help. They’re in trouble through no fault of their own, and they need us to understand,” he tweeted.“I know times are tough, the challenges are daunting, but I know we can do this. We can create an economic recovery for all. We can move from crisis to recovery to resurgence. This is the United States of America. We’ve done it before — and we will do it again,” he also wrote on Twitter.His remarks came a day after he said that the November US jobs report was grim and there was a need for urgent action on coronavirus relief. “This is a grim jobs report. It shows an economy that is stalling,” he said, adding he was “encouraged” by bipartisan Senate efforts on a $900 billion relief package. “Congress and President Trump must get a deal done for the American people. But any package passed in the lame-duck session is not enough. ... Congress will need to act again in January,” Biden was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.As on Friday, a new daily high of nearly 228,000 additional confirmed Covid-19 cases was reported in the US in the holiday season, eclipsing the previous high mark of 217,000 cases set the day before, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Much of the nation saw surging numbers in the week after Thanksgiving when millions of Americans ignored warnings to stay home and celebrate only with members of their household.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/understand-problems-joe-biden-recalls-father-s-words-on-government/story-5LWPoGN4MUT8uuS7COoSmN.html

Johnson and von der Leyen agreed to talk again on Monday night after acknowledging that “significant differences” remain.Amid the pessimistic noises from both sides, a British official said the resumption of negotiations in Brussels marks the last throw of the dice.Originally, the two sides had sought to reach an accord by Oct. 15, but the negotiations have gone right to the wire. Britain is due to leave the European single market and customs union at the end of this month. With the U.K. and EU both needing time to get parliamentary approval for any deal, one needs to be reached weeks before then to be ready by that deadline.Cabinet SupportOfficials on both sides said next week is realistically the last chance to get a deal. According to the Sunday Times, Johnson has the backing of his cabinet if he opts to walk away. Thirteen ministers, including eight who opposed Brexit, will support no-deal if Johnson thinks it necessary, the report said.Although the EU has said it will never be the one to walk away from the negotiations, it sees Thursday’s summit of the bloc’s 27 leaders, where they would be asked to sign off on any deal, as a natural end point. Negotiators are striving to reach a deal on Monday, or Tuesday at the latest, one official said.“Significant differences remain on three critical issues,” Johnson and von der Leyen said in a joint statement after their call, which lasted about an hour. These are the level playing field for businesses, fisheries, and the governance of any agreement -- disagreements that have dogged the talks since they started in March.“Both sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved,” according to the joint statement.Without an accord, businesses and consumers will be left facing the cost and disruption of tariffs and quotas, while relations between the UK and EU could be poisoned for a generation.Blame GameA small team of British negotiators will travel to Brussels on Sunday morning and work to see if they can bridge the final gaps, a UK official said. There is barely any time left and the process may conclude without a deal, the official added.The UK blamed France for hardening the EU’s position. On Friday, the country’s European affairs minister, Clement Beaune, said his government will veto any deal if it isn’t in its national interest. On Saturday, Beaune told the Journal du Dimanche weekly newspaper that the negotiations were a “test of sovereignty” for the EU and the UK’s demands over fisheries are “unjustifiable.”One person familiar with the EU side of the discussions said several member states were now lining up behind France to block a deal if too many concessions are made.The UK has blamed the EU for making new demands -- including on so-called ratchet clauses that would bind Britain to EU labor and environmental standards as they evolve over time, and a review of any agreement on fishing after 10 years, according to a person familiar with the British position. An EU official denied that the proposals were new.For its part, the UK has offered to delay any changes to the EU’s share of the fishing catch for three years, according to a person familiar with the EU side. This is unacceptable to the bloc, the person said.The talks are also stuck on how the UK’s state-aid rules would be regulated, as well as on how any agreement would be enforced. The EU wants to be able to punish any breaches of the deal by the UK with retaliation in other areas -- something Britain has so far rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/last-ditch-push-to-brexit-deal-starts-with-recriminations-flying/story-3mcL2Vw18hLu25Ul0MoXtL.html
06-12-2020||World||Covid-19 cases continue climbing in US during holiday season||Coronavirus infections across the US continue to rise as the country moves deeper into a holiday season when eagerly anticipated gatherings of family and friends could push the numbers even higher and overwhelm hospitals.Vast swaths of southern and inland California imposed new restrictions on businesses and activities Saturday as hospitals in the nation’s most populous state face a dire shortage of beds. Restaurants must stop on-site dining and theaters, hair salons and many other businesses must close in the sprawling reaches of San Diego and Los Angeles, along with part of the Central Valley, including Fresno.Five counties in the San Francisco Bay Area were set to impose their own lockdowns Sunday.A new daily high of nearly 228,000 additional confirmed Covid-19 cases was reported nationwide Friday, eclipsing the previous high mark of 217,000 cases set the day before, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.The seven-day rolling average of deaths attributable to Covid-19 in the US passed 2,000 for the first time since spring, rising to 2,011. Two weeks ago, the seven-day average was 1,448. There were 2,607 deaths reported in the US on Friday.Johns Hopkins had previously reported Wednesday daily Covid-19 deaths at 3,157. That was later updated to 2,804 due to a change in numbers from Nevada, a spokeswoman said Saturday.Much of the nation saw surging numbers in the week after Thanksgiving, when millions of Americans disregarded warnings to stay home and celebrate only with members of their household. Many in California anticipated tight restrictions on businesses and activities, sending people scrambling to shop or get haircuts while they still could.Arizona’s top public health official took on a blunt tone as she reported the state’s latest case numbers, a near-record of nearly 6,800 new infections, telling people to wear masks around anyone outside their household, “even those you know and trust.”“We must act as though anyone we are around may be infected,” Dr. Cara Christ, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services, wrote on Twitter. Arizona’s intensive-care units are experiencing caseloads not seen since the summer, when the state had one of the worst outbreaks in the world. Just 8% of ICU beds and 10% of all inpatient beds were unoccupied Friday, according to state data.Hospital officials issued bleak warnings about the potential for severe overcrowding, fearing that Thanksgiving gatherings seeded new outbreaks that are not yet showing in daily case counts. It takes several days after someone is exposed to develop symptoms, and several more to get test results. Eventually, more severe cases will require hospitalization.“In less than a week, we went from exceeding 5,000 new cases reported in one day to exceeding 6,000,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, North Carolina’s health secretary. “This is very worrisome.”In St. Louis, two children’s hospitals opened their doors to adult patients without Covid-19 as medical centers in the region fill up, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Mayor Lyda Krewson said the city has reopened a temporary morgue. Area hospitals are at about 82% capacity for in-patient beds and 81% capacity for ICU beds.In Idaho, the National Guard helped direct people and traffic at a Boise urgent care and family practice clinic converted to a facility for people with coronavirus symptoms. Health officials say Idaho’s attempt to hold the coronavirus in check is failing.Hospitals are struggling not only with the increase in patients but with their own staff as health workers contract Covid-19 themselves or quit under the pressure of caring for so many infectious patients.“We continue to be concerned about the potential implications of the travel we have seen in the past week with Thanksgiving, as well as social gathering related to the holidays,” said Dr. Adnan Munkarah, executive vice president and chief clinical officer for Henry Ford Health System in Detroit.The health system currently has 576 employees out because they have tested positive, have pending tests or are quarantined because of close contact, up from 378 a week ago, Munkarah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-continue-climbing-in-us-during-holiday-season/story-vGQinGpAc4x1A4GnX4TKIK.html

06-12-2020||World||Britain gets ready for roll-out of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine this week||Britain is preparing to become the first country to roll out the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine this week, initially making the shot available at hospitals before distributing stocks to doctors’ clinics, the government said on Sunday.The first doses are set to be administered on Tuesday, with the National Health Service (NHS) giving top priority to vaccinating the over-80s, frontline healthcare workers and care home staff and residents.Britain gave emergency use approval for the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech last week - jumping ahead in the global race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history.In total, Britain has ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million.About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week.Initial doses that have arrived from Belgium are being stored in secure locations across the country, where they will be quality checked, the health ministry said.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has onerous storage requirements. It needs to be kept at -70C (-94F) and only lasts five days in a regular fridge.For that reason, the health ministry said the vaccine would first be administered in 50 hospitals. It said it would take a few hours to defrost each vaccine and prepare it for use.NHS England has written to general practitioners, telling them to get ready to start giving vaccinations through local doctors’ services from Dec. 14.Rather than run clinics in individual surgeries, groups of local doctors will operate more than 1,000 vaccination centres across the country, the government said.Boxes of the vaccine contain five packs of 975 doses, but special regulatory approval is needed to split them up. A senior medical official has said that while he was hopeful it would be possible to split the packs and deliver straight to care homes, it was not guaranteed.Britain is among the first nations to roll out vaccinations outside the context of a clinic trial, raising hopes that the tide could soon turn against a virus that has killed nearly 1.5 million people globally and hammered the world economy.Russia began distributing its Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine through 70 clinics in Moscow on Saturday, although the shot has not finished its final trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-gets-ready-for-roll-out-of-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-this-week/story-DnKX1A5svBebhPbiluYIrK.html

If the situation continues, at some point we may encounter an explosive outbreak in the near future,” said Dr Albert Au, from the centre’s communicable disease branch, at a regular Covid-19 press briefing.South China Morning Post reported that Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee ordered all taxi drivers who intended to work between December 25 and January 23 next year to get tested by December 22.The Hospital Authority, meanwhile, urged residents to be patient and cooperate with medical professionals at health facilities, following an incident at St John Hospital in Cheung Chau on Thursday, where a resident had poured deep throat saliva samples on a desk in a nurse’s room after being told the deposit time for the day was over.The latest figures pushed the city’s Covid-19 tally to 6,802, with 112 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-health-experts-warn-of-explosive-covid-19-outbreak-as-city-records-101-infections/story-3Zs6BktN5u6ARgr5IDtJnN.html

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asked their Brexit negotiators to resume talks but cautioned no deal was possible unless key issues were resolved.“Significant differences remain on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries,” Johnson and von der Leyen said in a joint statement. “Both sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved.”“Whilst recognising the seriousness of these differences, we agreed that a further effort should be undertaken by our negotiating teams to assess whether they can be resolved,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-chief-says-trade-talks-with-britain-to-resume-sunday/story-zJFSVKwnvdpMIgd8MrBjJN.html

In last months’ virtual meeting, Canada’s foreign minister François-Philippe Champagne had commented on the “critical role” that India is playing with regard to the requirements globally for medicines needed to combat the pandemic.In its statement, the CIF lauded the farm laws, saying, “India enacted significant reforms to its agricultural sector through a series of bills recently. The need to reform agriculture in India and to bring it par with modern standards was never controversial.”It also welcomed “the Indian government’s willingness to listen to the concerns of the farmers. In a democracy, peaceful negotiations are the only way to resolve differences”.Trudeau’s remarks during a Facebook live event to celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak was followed up within hours with him delivering a recorded message to the annual convention of the Indo-Canadian business chamber. He extolled the economic ties between the two countries in that message and its potential. However, an Indian official pointed out, with political ties now flat-lining, economic engagement between the two governments will suffer as a result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-justin-trudeau-softens-stand-but-india-canada-bilateral-ties-have-already-taken-a-blow/story-N1Itc2oZ3HXM51NagoswRN.html
06-12-2020||World||Tens of thousands rally in Armenia demanding PM’s resignation||Tens of thousands of opposition supporters marched across the Armenian capital Saturday to push for the resignation of the ex-Soviet nation’s prime minister over his handling of the conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.In six weeks of fierce fighting that ended with a Russia-brokered peace deal on Nov. 10, the Azerbaijani army reclaimed lands that Armenian forces have held for more than a quarter-century.Armenia’s opposition parties warned Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan there would be civil disobedience across the country if he does not resign by noon on Tuesday. Pashinyan has refused to step down, defending the peace agreement as a painful but necessary move that prevented Azerbaijan from overrunning the entire Nagorno-Karabakh region.More than 20,000 protesters rallied in Yerevan on Saturday, chanting “Nikol ,you traitor!” and “Nikol, go away!” and then marched to the prime minister’s official residence.“The seat of the prime minister of Armenia is currently being occupied by a political corpse,” Artur Vanetsyan, the leader of the opposition party Homeland and the former head of the National Security Service, said at the protest rally.Several priests of the Armenian Apostolic Church joined the protest, denouncing Pashinyan for allowing Azerbaijan to take over some holy sites.Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That conflict left not only Nagorno-Karabakh itself but large chunks of surrounding lands in Armenian hands.In 44 days of fighting that began on Sept. 27, Azerbaijan troops routed the Armenian forces and wedged deep into Nagorno-Karabakh, forcing Armenia to accept the Nov. 10 peace deal that saw the return to Azerbaijan of a significant part of the separatist region. It also obliged Armenia to hand over all of the areas it held outside Nagorno-Karabakh.Azerbaijan completed reclaiming those territories on Tuesday when it took over the Lachin region located between the Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia.Armenian opposition leaders hold Pashinyan responsible for failing to negotiate an earlier end to the hostilities at terms that could have been more beneficial for Armenia. They have emphasized, however, that the opposition wasn’t pushing for the annulment of the peace deal.Veteran politician Vazgen Manukyan, whom 17 opposition parties have nominated as their candidate for prime minister, said at Saturday’s rally that his transition government would seek to renegotiate some vague aspects of the Nov. 10 peace deal.Manukyan, 71, served as prime minister in 1990-91, when Armenia was part of the Soviet Union and later served as defense minister during the separatist war.Armenia’s Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 2,718 Armenian servicemen were killed in the latest fighting. At least 55 Armenian civilians also were killed.Azerbaijan said this week that 2,783 troops of its were killed and more than 100 were still missing. The government said 94 of its civilians also were killed and more than 400 were wounded.Azerbaijan celebrated the end of fighting as a national triumph, and President Ilham Aliyev established a new Nov. 8 national holiday called Victory Day to commemorate the event.Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry said it will conduct a military parade next Thursday involving 3,000 troops and 150 military vehicles. It said the show will also feature trophy weapons seized from the Armenian forces.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is scheduled to visit Azerbaijan that day. Turkey has strongly backed its ally and used the hostilities to expand its clout in the region. Earlier this week, Russian and Turkish military officials signed documents to set up a joint monitoring center to ensure the fulfillment of the peace deal.Russia deployed nearly 2,000 peacekeepers for at least five years to monitor the peace deal and to facilitate the return of refugees. The Russian troops will also ensure safe transit between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia across the Lachin region.___Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow and Aida Sultanova in London contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tens-of-thousands-rally-in-armenia-demanding-pms-resignation/story-X3VLbF46TVpGWk2j7H8oxJ.html
06-12-2020||World||Pope Francis updates Vatican financial authority following scandals||Pope Francis has revamped the Holy See’s financial intelligence and anti-money-laundering unit following financial scandals, including an ongoing in-house corruption probe, Vatican officials said Saturday.The changes involve the governance and organization of the Vatican’s financial watchdog agency, which has been renamed the Supervisory and Financial Information Authority, or ASIF, the Vatican said. Until Saturday, the agency was known as AIF, or Financial Information Authority.The revamped authority’s president, Carmelo Barbagallo, a former Italian central bank official, said the changes ordered by Francis in the form of a new statute would strengthen the entity’s financial supervisory responsibilities.Earlier this year, Barbagallo indicated he was pressing for supervisory authority that the pontiff signed off on Saturday.Francis is intent on bringing greater accountability and transparency to the Vatican, building on efforts forged by his predecessor, Benedict XVI.ASIF’s activities are being divided into three units: vigilance, rules and legal affairs, and financial information.Its functions include “supervision aimed at the prevention and countering of money laundering and the financing of terrorism,” according to the new statute.In signing off on the statute, Francis cited the Holy See’s “progressive implementations of supervisory offices regarding anti-laundering, combating terrorism and the proliferation of the arms of mass destruction.”Financial scandals have dogged the Vatican for decades.One of the latest centers on a London real estate deal involving a $350 million investment by the Vatican secretariat of state. Vatican investigators are looking into the case.ASIF’s predecessor agency was raided last year by Vatican police who seized confidential documentation as part of an investigation by Holy See prosecutors into the 2012 investment in a swank London residential building. Much of the money the Vatican poured into the investment came from donations from Catholic faithful.When raided, the agency was conducting its own investigation of the deal, trying to discover who might have benefited from it. The sensational raid effectively torpedoed the agency’s own probe and led to the removal of its top two managers. Barbagallo was appointed a few weeks later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-updates-vatican-financial-authority-following-scandals/story-3nnaswpC4XdGYfagC7IToK.html
06-12-2020||World||UK records another 15,539 coronavirus cases, 397 deaths||Another 15,539 people in Britain have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of coronavirus cases in the country to 1,705,971, according to the official figures released Saturday.The coronavirus-related deaths in Britain rose by 397 to 61,014, the data showed.The figures came as Britain’s chief medical officers warned Saturday that the coming winter would be “especially hard” for the health service due to coronavirus despite hopes brought by vaccines.“Although the very welcome news about vaccines means that we can look forward to 2021 with greater optimism, vaccine deployment will have only a marginal impact in reducing numbers coming into the health service with Covid over the next three months,” the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said in a letter to colleagues.The experts urged the public to show restraint and self-discipline, especially in the run-up to Christmas.“The actions and self-discipline of the whole population during lockdowns and other restrictions have helped reduce the peak and in most parts of the four nations, hospital numbers are likely to fall over the next few weeks, but not everywhere,” they said.“The social mixing which occurs around Christmas may well put additional pressure on hospitals and general practice in the New Year and we need to be ready for that,” they added.England is currently under a new three-tier system of coronavirus restrictions that replaced the month-long national lockdown in England which ended Wednesday.Under the new system, shops will be allowed to re-open across England, giving a Christmas bonanza to the struggling retail sector, but all bars and restaurants in the toughest Tier 3 areas will remain closed. The system put about 98 percent of England into the highest Tier 2 and 3.However, between Dec. 23 to 27, up to three different households are allowed to meet in a private home, a place of worship, or outdoor public spaces.To bring life back to normal, countries such as Britain, China, Germany, Russia, and the United States are racing against time to develop coronavirus vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-records-another-15-539-coronavirus-cases-397-deaths/story-ZyiLRA4axrhWlocKzUZ9EK.html

06-12-2020||World||Nod from California: Joe Biden now has enough electors to officially become US president||US President-elect Joe Biden has secured enough electoral college votes to officially win the presidency after California certified its election outcome on Friday, handing him 55 pledged votes.Biden now has nine more than the 270-mark that he needed to technically secure a win over his opponent, President Donald Trump, in the election. Colorado, New Jersey and Hawaii, which Biden won, still haven’t certified their results, and when they do, Biden’s tally of electoral college votes will go up to 306, which he has been projected to win for weeks now. Trump lost the election, garnering 232 electoral college votes. But he has refused to accept his defeat, alleging, without any proof, election fraud. The Trump campaign and his allies have filed multiple lawsuits challenging the outcome in the six states that cost him the election - Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia Arizona and Nevada - and his campaign announced one more lawsuit on Friday. The outgoing US president is scheduled to address a rally in Georgia in support of Republican senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler whose fate in the January run-off would determine who controls the Senate. Their loss would hand over the Republican-controlled chamber to the Democrats.California’s certification of Biden’s win wouldn’t have received so much attention. But Trump’s refusal to accept defeat has turned every formality in the election process into a milestone. It’s still a significant milestone, as Edward B. Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University, told AP. “It is a legal milestone and the first milestone that has that status,” Foley said. “Everything prior to that was premised on what we call projections.”The remaining states have until December 8 to certify their results. And on December 14, electors of the electoral college will vote to declare the victor - in this case, Biden. They will convey the outcome to US congress, which will approve it on January 6, two weeks to the inauguration on January 20.Trump has tried to persuade Republican-controlled legislature in these states to declare their own list of electors. But has had no success yet. He is also trying to get state legislators to petition Congress to reject the electoral college result.Dozens of Republican state legislators wrote to the state’s congressional delegation on Friday, seeking rejection of the electoral college vote. “We, the undersigned members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, urge you to object and vote to sustain such objection to the electoral college votes received from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021,” they wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nod-from-california-joe-biden-now-has-enough-electors-to-officially-become-us-president/story-HyEX871CDIxtLT1trBz8YK.html
06-12-2020||India||Opposition parties back Bharat Bandh, Sharad Pawar to meet President on December 9 | 10 points||The ongoing protest by the farmers against the three farm bills went from strength to strength on Sunday as several political parties, including the Congress, Shiv Sena, Telangana Rashtra Samithi, extended support to the nationwide strike on December 8, a day before the next round of talks are held between the two parties. The protest, which entered its 11th day on Sunday, has so far been limited within Punjab, Haryana, Delhi. But with more farmers marching towards Delhi, and farmers’ unions of other states, trade, transport, bank unions extending their support to the protest, the impact of the nationwide strike will be felt far and wide.Here are the top 10 updates of the protest:1. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, DMK chief M K Stalin and PAGD chairman Farooq Abdullah also issued a joint statement backing the proposed day-long strike. The Congress, NCP, Shiv Sena, TRS, DMK, SP, AAP, Trinamool Congress, RJD, JJM and the Left parties have supported the strike. देश के आन-बान-शान हैं हमारे मेहनती किसान।देश के मालिक को मजदूर बनाने के केंद्र सरकार के षड्यंत्र के खिलाफ़ झारखण्ड में भी होगा उलगुलान।किसान अन्नदाताओं के पक्ष में झारखण्ड मुक्ति मोर्चा परिवार 8 दिसंबर को भारत बंद का पूर्ण समर्थन करता है।2. Not only opposition parties, NDA allies also came forward to support the farmers. The Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) supported the bandh call.

The relocation of people to these villages “promises China with better border surveillance and patrols through a network of herders,” the tweet said.Also read: ‘Will Centre entirely fund vaccines?’ Amarinder Singh writes to PMSatellite imagery from Planet Labs, a private US company, was cited by NDTV to show that at least three villages have come up in an area about five kilometres from Bum La. The imagery suggested construction of these villages, which are on the Chinese side of the LAC, had continued even as thousands of Indian and Chinese troops faced off in Ladakh sector of the LAC. One image from Planet Labs dated February 17 showed only one village with some 20 structures in the area. A second image dated November 28 showed three additional villages in the same area with a total of about 50 structures. The villages are located about a kilometre from each other and connected by new roads. Satellite imagery that emerged last month showed China has built a village called Pangda some two kilometres within territory claimed by Bhutan on Doklam plateau. This imagery also showed China has built a road in the same region that goes about nine kilometres inside Bhutanese territory. Pangda is located about 10 kilometres from the site of the 2017 standoff. In August, Chinese state media reported on how the government has improved infrastructure in villages close to the Arunachal Pradesh border. State-owned Global Times tabloid cited authorities in Yadong county of Tibet Autonomous Region as saying that 27 households with 124 people had “voluntarily moved from... Yadong county to Pangda village in September”.Also read: Covid-19 - How states are preparing for vaccination driveIn 2017, Chinese president Xi Jinping had also written a letter to Tibetan herdsmen living near the Arunachal Pradesh border to “set down roots” and safeguard “Chinese territory”.Strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney pointed to the new villages near Bum La and said building border villages to “fortify claims and escalate cross-frontier intrusions is integral to China’s territorial aggrandisement”. Sim Tack, a Belgium-based security analyst for Force Analysis, said the new villages were clearly part of a strategy to “push Chinese presence and strengthen claims on disputed areas”.“We have seen the relocation of civilian populations into sparsely populated and disputed border regions by other countries, for example, by Morocco in Western Sahara. The Chinese are doing the same, so that they can infringe on the border and potentially build a case for their territorial claims,” he said.A report released in September by Stratfor, a leading security and intelligence consultancy, had said that China has more than doubled the number of airbases, air defence positions and heliports near the LAC since 2017. China began building at least 13 new military facilities near the LAC after the standoff at Doklam, and work on four heliports began after the current tensions in Ladakh, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/satellite-imagery-shows-china-setting-up-border-villages-between-india-bhutan/story-9lECh2DZ0cvHpvxfszKwHM.html
06-12-2020||India||Pawar as agri minister sought amendment in APMC Act, role for private sector: Report||With NCP chief Sharad Pawar backing farmers’ protest against the contentious agri reforms, government sources on Sunday pointed out that as the agriculture minister in the UPA dispensation he had asked chief ministers to amend the APMC Act in their states to allow the private sector to play an important role in the field. Sharing the content of some letters he had written to various chief ministers, the sources claimed that the BJP-led NDA government has made the same set of changes in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act as pushed by Pawar when he was the union minister. Pawar is scheduled to meet President Ram Nath Kovind on December 9 over the ongoing farmers’ protest against the new agrarian laws after the NCP joined other opposition parties in supporting the ‘Bharat Bandh’ called on December 8 by farmer unions, which have demanded the repeal of the Centre’s new agri-marketing laws. The government sources said Pawar in a 2010 letter to the then Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit that the agriculture sector needs well-functioning markets to drive growth, employment and economic prosperity in rural area of the country. “This requires huge investments in marketing infrastructure including cold-chain. And for this, private sector participation is essential, for which an appropriate regulatory and policy environment needs to be in place,” his letter said, calling for amending the state APMC Act. In a letter on similar lines to the then Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Pawar had underlined the need for  investments in post-harvest and marketing infrastructure from the farm gate to the consumer and said “private sector needs to play an important role in this regard”. Pawar was the union agriculture, consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister in the then Manmohan Singh-led government. Earlier on Sunday, Pawar asked the Centre to take serious cognisance of the ongoing farmers’ protest and said if the deadlock continues, the agitation will not be limited to Delhi and people from across the country will stand by the protesting farmers. The ruling BJP has accused the opposition of playing politics on the matter and noted that the manifesto of the main opposition party, the Congress, had also batted for some of the reforms the Modi government has ushered in. Prominent opposition leaders including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, DMK chief M K Stalin and PAGD chairman Farooq Abdullah issued a joint statement on Sunday supporting the call for Bharat Bandh on December 8 by farmer groups and pressed the Centre to meet the legitimate demands of the protesters. Protesting farmer unions have demanded the repeal of all three laws Parliament had passed in the last session. The government has been holding talks with union leaders, and the next round of dialogue is scheduled for December 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pawar-as-agri-minister-sought-amendment-in-apmc-act-role-for-private-sector-report/story-5vyVUV9pgHcbEOV20CbwTP.html

The CM has said that Punjab has a higher mortality rate because of the age profile of the population and because of high co-morbidities. Singh said the vaccines currently under consideration would not perhaps reduce transmission but will help in prevention. Hence, the best use will be in preventing serious illness in the most susceptible groups — the elderly — the population of which is high in Punjab. A statement released by the CMO said the CM has also sought clarity as to whether the Covid-19 vaccination would be entirely funded by the Centre, including the cost of vaccines and vaccination supplies. Singh also sought to know whether the definition of frontline workers for the purpose of immunization could be expanded to include administrative officials and other essential staff. How the general population will be vaccinated, whether those who have once been infected with Covid-19 are eligible for vaccination are a few issues that Singh sought clarity on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-centre-entirely-fund-vaccines-amarinder-singh-writes-to-pm-seeks-priority-allocation-for-punjab/story-zv4EEHTy3LriSka1N4naaM.html

Ironically, Sanjay Chandra was released from Tihar jail after 43 months on Friday evening after a trial court in Delhi granted him interim relief for four weeks considering his aggrieved medical condition. He was last arrested in April 2017 by Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for allegedly cheating homebuyers who had invested in company projects. Unitech Ltd, which used to be a construction giant before the company was embroiled in 2G spectrum scam, is facing multiple investigations by various agencies including CBI, ED and Delhi Police. Sanjay Chandra is already facing trial in 2G spectrum scam. He was first arrested in 2011 by the CBI for allegedly conspiring to get telecom licence for his company. Also read: India dials up ties with Gulf countries, sharpens the contrast with PakistanTo give relief to about 30,000 homebuyers, in January this year, the Centre decided to take over the company and appoint nominee directors so that unfinished housing projects can get completed. The move was approved by the Supreme Court. In its latest FIR, filed on the complaint of Canara Bank, the CBI has alleged that Unitech had availed different credit facilities from it which it failed to repay. As directors of the company, Sanjay Chandra, Ramesh Chandra and Ajay Chandra had given personal as well as corporate guarantee to the bank and had mortgaged properties as collateral security. It has further alleged that the company has illegally sold the properties mortgaged as collateral security without informing the bank. The Supreme Court had appointed M/s Grant Thornton to conduct a forensic audit of Unitech, which revealed that the company had diverted, siphoned off and misappropriated funds. “Out of Rs 14,270 crore collected from 29,800 homebuyers, around Rs 5,063.05 was potentially not utilized for construction/execution of 74 identified projects. Similarly, Unitech availed Rs 1,805.86 crore from six financial institutions, out of which Rs 763.06 crore was not utilized for projects,” states the complaint filed by Canara Bank, reviewed by HT. Grant Thornton report further revealed that between 2007 and 2019, three subsidiaries of Unitech made investments of Rs 1,745 crore in 10 companies in Cyprus, it added.

Nayak had also sought to know the amount of sitting fees and every other remuneration or allowances payable to the chairperson and every member of the expert group and the amount of sitting fees and every other remuneration or allowances actually paid to them.The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) was constituted under the chairmanship of Member (Health) of Niti Aayog V K Paul on August 7 to prepare a strategy for the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccine.The information on these points was not provided by the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO), saying the details of meeting, agenda and material circulated during the meetings do not come under the definition of “information” which can be shared under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.The CPIO said that details of the amount of sitting fees and every other remuneration or allowances payable to the chairperson and other members of the expert group are not available with the immunisation section of the ministry.Nayak filed an appeal before a senior official in the ministry challenging the order of the CPIO. The official ruled that the CPIO does not have information and does not know where the information can be.The application was also transferred to the Indian Council of Medical Research and the MEA.The ICMR said it does not have information sought by Nayak.On the NEGVAC material shared with it, the MEA cited exemption clause of national security and related issues to deny the records.Nayak said both the CPIO and the first appellate authority not knowing about the physical location of NEGVAC’s papers despite the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) servicing this body is “truly perplexing”.“How can people’s meaningful participation be ensured if the MoHFW does not place in the public domain details of NEGVAC’s working. There is a statutory requirement of proactive information disclosure under Sections 4(1)(c) and 4(1)(d) of the RTI Act about NEGVAC’s working. MoHFW and other public authorities involved in the vaccination roll-out plan have a statutory duty to make all facts and figures public along with the underlying reasoning for their decisions and actions under these provisions,” Nayak said.He said he would approach the Central Information Commission to challenge “the actions and omissions of MoHFW and MEA”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-rti-response-health-ministry-says-not-aware-where-records-related-to-covid-19-vaccine-expert-group-are-kept/story-LsmaqGl3wNQUijFCSzqkbK.html

But my point is that since Parliament is a constitutional institution, the foundation stone of its new building should be laid by the President of the country,” Punia said, adding the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government is doing this with the intention of etching their name on the new building. “It is very unfortunate,” he said.“Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal has rightly said changing the edifice is not enough, change the way you function within, the way Parliament has been downgraded, and procedures bypassed,” Punia added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of the new Parliament building and perform bhoomi pujan on December 10.The construction will begin this month. In the new building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members against the present strength of 543, whereas Rajya Sabha chamber will be able to accommodate 384 seats against the current strength of 245 members.The maximum seating capacity in the Lok Sabha chamber is expected to be 1,272 for joint Parliamentary sessions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-should-lay-the-foundation-stone-of-new-parliament-building-cong-s-punia/story-TkqPK0AqhRaDQHlexWmmoN.html

As per the initiative, the export hubs in each district would sell some specific products from each district where their production is more. The development has come about a month after chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, on the occasion of state foundation day, had announced that the Uttarakhand would have its export policy to promote its products in a much bigger market. He said that the products, including the agricultural produce, would be marketed under an umbrella brand named ‘Holy Himalayas’ which would give the consumers a feeling of “Himalaya’s purity”. An official from the state industry department on the condition of anonymity said that once established, each export hub in the districts would supply specific products. “The department has chalked a policy for the initiative. Under that the export hubs in all 13 districts would supply specific products to the market of the respective district,” said the official. Also read: India dials up ties with Gulf countries, sharpens the contrast with PakistanHe added, “As per the policy framed, Bageshwar district would supply organic wool, Champawat would supply ironware, Dehradun - maize products and Uttarkashi - apples. Similarly, Almora would supply pickles, Chamoli - fish, Haridwar - sugarcane products, Nainital - Aipan handicrafts, Pauri Garhwal - wooden handicrafts, Pithoragarh - carpets and Rudraprayag- honey.” He also informed that the remaining districts Tehri Garhwal and US Nagar would supply “honey and bakery products respectively.” Economic advisor to the CM, Alok Bhatt, while terming it an important development, said that it will greatly help in providing a bigger market to the local products. “The growth centre initiative to arrest the migration from rural areas and their development has significantly improved the production of local products. However, there lies an issue of providing them with a proper market due to lack of proper connectivity. These export hubs would help in resolving the issue,” said Bhatt. He said, “If the supply is increasing, then it has to be absorbed in the demand. The export hubs will enable them to reach the national as well as foreign market.” Director of the state directorate of industries, Sudhir Nautiyal, on the development said, “At present Uttarakhand contributes about 0.48 per cent of the total exports of the country. This move will help in improving it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-create-export-hub-in-all-13-districts-to-promote-local-products/story-xXwIG9PmN7o38aegKMWWFL.html

But we do have a formidable fleet of transport aircraft and we can pitch in at short notice if required,” said one of the people.“There are no doubts about the IAF’s capabilities to carry such supplies to all parts of the country,” the person added.Also read: Pune hosp starts Sputnik V phase two trials, volunteers under observationThe IAF’s transport fleet includes eleven C-17 Globemaster heavy-lift aircraft, each of which can carry up to 75 tonnes of cargo, C-130 Hercules aircraft, which can carry up 19 tonnes, and workhorses such as the Il-76s and An-32s. The people cited above said, if required, smaller aircraft such as the Dorniers and even helicopters can be used to ferry the vaccines to remote areas with smaller airfields.It is understood that the military has worked out modalities that will have to be put in place for transporting vaccines if there is a request from the government. This will primarily involve moving vaccines from the 28,000-unit cold storage network and ensuring the doses reach remote areas without losing their efficacy.“The vaccines will be transported in special boxes and there will be no need to reconfigure the aircraft to carry them. It’s not as if the aircraft will have to be modified in any way,” the person cited above said.The IAF recently demonstrated its heavy-lift capabilities by transporting thousands of troops and thousands of tonnes of fuel, food, supplies and equipment to the Ladakh sector, where the Indian Army is engaged in a dragging standoff with Chinese forces along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The IAF also has extensive experience of airlifting medical supplies and equipment during contingencies both within the country and in the neighbourhood. Even before the pandemic, IAF aircraft have ferried medicines and other essential supplies to neighbouring countries such as the Maldives. They have also transported currency notes during the demonetisation drive and electronic voting machines (EVMs) and other equipment during elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-fully-prepared-to-transport-millions-of-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-across-country/story-dRiQ6dyoMIAAgOeGNQl55L.html
06-12-2020||India||India dials up ties with Gulf countries, sharpens the contrast with Pakistan||Foreign minister S Jaishankar will travel to Qatar and Kuwait and his deputy, V Muraleedharan to Oman later this month as part of India’s continuing outreach to Gulf countries that is described by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as India’s extended neighbourhood, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday as Indian Army chief General MM Naravane preps to begin his visit to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Jaishankar, who had focused on deepening ties with West Asia through the Covid pandemic, addressed the Gulf Cooperation Council leaders at the annual political dialogue last month and later travelled to the UAE and Bahrain.“India shares warm, close and multi-faceted relations with the Gulf countries underpinned by historic cultural, religious and economic linkages,” a government official said, underlining how New Delhi - after reaching out to countries in the immediate neighbourhood for the past few weeks - had put the spotlight on West Asia.The dates and the specific agenda for the two ministerial visits to Qatar, Kuwait and Oman later this month are still being worked out.Officials told Hindustan Times that a key focus of this heightened engagement at this point was to protect the interests of Indian workers who were employed in the West Asian countries before the coronavirus pandemic disrupted economic activity and plunged the global economy into a contraction.India is asking the Gulf countries to start opening its doors to the thousands of workers who had come back during the pandemic. This was also one of the central themes of Jaishankar’s address to the GCC Troika in early November, urging the GCC leadership to facilitate the return of Indian workers and professionals eager to resume work through sustainable travel bubble arrangements.Officials believe that New Delhi’s efforts to reach out to the Gulf countries through the peak of the pandemic when India sent not just medicines but medical teams to countries in the “extended neighbourhood” had held the country in good stead. The Indian gesture was reciprocated by the West Asian countries as well. Like when the UAE was packing off immigrants from every other country following the outbreak of the pandemic, India requested Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to go slow with repatriating Indian nationals because the state governments didn’t have the infrastructure to deal with the influx. The request was immediately accepted.Six West Asian countries - UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain - accounted for nearly 70% of all Indians who live abroad. UAE is home to the largest number of Indians, 3.4 million, which was approximately a quarter of all NRIs around the world. Another 2.6 million were in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain were home to another 2.9 million NRIs.Between them, they sent home nearly half of India’s total foreign remittances of US 80 billion.The World Bank, back in October, had projected a 9% decline in foreign remittances to India due to the Covid-induced restrictions and disruption in economic activity across the world.Officials said India is working closely with UAE which stopped giving work and visit visas for nationals from 12 countries including Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan, seen as a fallout of Islamabad trying to challenge Saudi Arabia’s leadership of the Muslim world and its stand against the UAE’s peace deal with Israel that paved the way for UAE-Israel relations. According to a report in the Nikkei Asian Review over the past week, many of the job opportunities that Pakistani workers are losing are going to Indian workers.Indian officials said that UAE’s visa ban on Pakistan was just one aspect of Islamabad’s growing diplomatic isolation. Pakistan’s embarrassing moments when its request for a side event on Kashmir was turned down at the recent Organisation of Islamic Cooperation foreign ministers meet was another.Indian officials also cite a change in Malaysia’s approach towards South Asia after Mahathir Mohamad’s exit. There are clear indications that Malaysia is looking at its relationship with India from a broader perspective. This change led New Delhi to reduce the duty on palm oil last month, prompting Malaysian foreign minister Hishammuddin bin Tun Hussein to tweet his thank you note to foreign minister Jaishankar. Messaged HE @DrSJaishankar, India's Foreign Minister to say thanks on behalf of 🇲🇾 Malaysian smallholders! India has announced a 10% reduction of basic customs duty on crude palm oil to 27.5%. This could further ⬆️ Malaysia's #PalmOil exports to 🇮🇳 which in turn could ⬆️ prices! pic.twitter.com/9mBY9Pds1EOr when defence minister Rajnath Singh and foreign minister S Jaishankar, were planning to make a transit halt in Iran on their way to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Russia this September, Tehran requested for meetings with the Indian leaders and turned the halt into a bilateral visit. It was during these meetings that Iran indicated that it was keen to restore its energy relationship with India and it emerged that New Delhi and Tehran were on the same page as far as Afghanistan is concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-lines-up-visits-to-gulf-countries-sharpens-the-contrast-with-pak/story-rACiWqmyh3kKsK3NX5eqBL.html

The Delhi Goods Transport Association and India Tourist Transport Association expressed their solidarity with the ongoing protests.“Farming and transporting are like two sons of a father,” India Tourist Transport Association president Satish Sehrawat was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. He further added that 51 transport unions have decided to support farmers in their Bharat Bandh call.Delhi Goods Transport Association president Parmeet Singh Goldie said that farmers form the roots of their business hence they feel they should express their solidarity with the agitating farmers’ unions. Goldie said, “We are supporting our farmer brothers. They are the roots of our business.”On December 2, the apex body of transporters All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) had threatened to halt operations in north India in support of agitating farmers’ unions. AIMTC represents 95 lakh truckers and other entities across the nation.AIMTC president Kultaran Singh Atwal told PTI that the apex body of transporters had from the beginning lent their support to the agitating farmers. He further added, “AIMTC has already extended its support to the farmer agitation from day one. We have decided on stopping our operations strategically starting from North India and if the government does not address the issue of the farmers, then we may decide to go for shutting down of transport operations nationwide in their support.”Bal Malkit Singh, AIMTC core committee chairman, had outlined that they will primarily halt supply truck movements in north India starting December 8 and said that it will escalate into a countrywide halt of movement of supplies if the government chooses not to address the issues.“Starting December 8, we will halt the movement of supplies in entire North India including Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. We will then escalate it to the entire country if the government fails to address their issues,” Singh said.Several transporters’ bodies believe that the protests are legitimate and have extended their support to them as 65% of their trucks carry farm produce.The Centre and the protesting farmers’ unions have not yet reached an agreement over the three laws - Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill. Despite assurances from the government, farmers’ unions have said that they will go ahead with the Bharat Bandh on December 8.The Centre and the farmers’ union will hold the sixth round of discussion over the laws on December 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/like-two-sons-of-a-father-transport-unions-support-bharat-bandh-call/story-RBdTdBV62ilh7uTBnKKiqM.html
06-12-2020||India||West Bengal govt distancing itself from rule of law: Dhankar||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday alleged that the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government has distanced itself from rule of law and the soul of BR Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian Constitution, is getting deeply hurt. “I am deeply disturbed, concerned, worried and pained. The governance in the state of West Bengal is getting away from the path of the Constitution. It is distancing itself from rule of law. The soul of B R Ambedkar is deeply hurt,” Dhankhar said at a programme held to pay homage to Ambedkar on his death anniversary. “High time @MamataOfficial to ensure governance in accordance with constitution and render police & administration “politically neutral”. CS & DGP @WBPolice non responsive stance ignoring lawful accountability, letter & spirit of constitution is fraught with serious consequences,” Dhankhar tweeter later in the day. TMC Lok Sabha member and spokesperson Saugata Roy reacted by saying that Dhankhar is not following ethics. “He cannot make such statements in public every day. If he has anything to say about the government he can write to the chief minister or call her up. What he is doing is not right. There is nothing wrong with law and order in Bengal. The governor cannot see the reality,” said Roy. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), meanwhile, took potshots at chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her nephew Abhishek Banerjee at a rally held at Red Road in the heart of Kolkata. “The country is run by the Constitution drafted by Ambedkar but Bengal is run by a constitution drafted by bhaipo (nephew),” Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP national general secretary said without naming Abhishek Banerjee. He also accused young TMC Lok Sabha member of corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-govt-distancing-itself-from-rule-of-law-dhankar/story-h4FwZjuTwBrw6VgCb3rdBI.html
06-12-2020||India||Clashes mar outreach programmes of BJP, TMC in poll-bound Bengal||Clashes have marked the outreach programmes launched by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) earlier this week in poll-bound West Bengal. Violence have been making headlines ever since the BJP emerged as the ruling party’s principal adversary during the panchayat polls in 2018. The clashes peaked around the Lok Sabha polls last year. The assembly elections are due in about five months. The BJP has alleged that 120 of its workers have murdered in the state since the panchayat polls. On Saturday, the Barabani area of West Burdwan district was rocked by clashes between supporters of the two parties. Lakshman Ghorui, president of the BJP’s district unit alleged that five of his workers sustained bomb and bullet injuries when they were attacked by criminals backed by the TMC. “Our workers assembled around noon for a procession planned as part of the ar noi anyay (no more injustice) programme. They were attacked without provocation. One worker was hit by a bullet,” said Ghorui. Hitting back, Jitendra Tiwari, the TMC district president, said: “It is a false allegation. The clash took place between two rival groups of the BJP. Our party is not involved at all.” TMC’s local lawmaker Bidhan Upadhyay, on the other hand, alleged that workers of the ruling party were attacked by the BJP at Jamgram when they were visiting homes as part of the “duware sarkar (government at the doorstep)” programme launched by chief minister Mamata Banerjee earlier this week. A large police contingent headed by Manav Singla, assistant commissioner of Asansol-Durgapur Police rushed to the spot to control the situation. BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya went to a private hospital in Durgapur on Saturday evening to see the injured party worker. “The situation is now under control,” a senior police officer of the district said on condition of anonymity on Sunday. “The BJP approached the police to seek permission for its programme but it was not given to avoid tension since both parties wanted to hit the streets in the same area,” he added. In a similar incident, several BJP workers were allegedly beaten up at Sitai in the north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district on Saturday. Nisith Pramanik, the BJP Lok Sabha member from Cooch Behar, alleged that bombs were hurled by TMC workers when BJP workers were taking part in the ar noi anyay programme. Noor Alam Hussain, the karmadhakshya of the TMC-controlled zilla parishad, denied the allegation and said the clash took place between rival groups of the BJP. Kolkata, too, witnessed some tension between two factions of the TMC in north Kolkata during a “duware sarkar” camp. There was however no violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clashes-mar-outreach-programmes-of-bjp-tmc-in-poll-bound-bengal/story-R9xnMHGsvBFClsH5y4r3sI.html

The epilepsy-like symptoms have been so baffling and serious that doctors in Eluru admitted the patients instantly. According to ANI, 140 persons were admitted to Eluru Government Hospital and subsequently discharged after treatment since Saturday night.So far, 227 people, including 46 children, have been hospitalised. After initial panic, doctors in the government hospital on Sunday said the situation was under control.

Shukla has also said that there was nothing serious so far. While most patients complained of convulsions, headaches, some reported bone dislocations and muscular pains. What serves as the common link among many of the patients is that they all consumed tap water. Many of the patients have been feeling distressed as they don’t remember what happened to them for which psychiatrists and psychologists have also been roped in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mystery-disease-with-people-fainting-strikes-andhra-pradesh-city-what-we-know-so-far/story-x91eCzaituMg2CTbak4dLJ.html
06-12-2020||India||Ahead of assembly elections, Assam parties battle in semi-final BTC polls||Ahead of assembly polls in the state in March-April next year, political parties in Assam are battling it out in a semi-final to assume control of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC). Polling for the council, which administers Bodoland Territorial Region covering Udalguri, Kokrajhar, Baksa and Chirang, will take place in two phases on Monday and Thursday. Counting of votes will take place on December 12. Polling for 40 seats in the council, which comes under Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, scheduled in April was postponed due to Covid-19 and the area placed under Governor’s rule. Since its formation in 2003, BTC had been governed by Hagrama Mohilary, a former rebel who now heads the Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF), a partner in the ruling coalition headed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) as the third partner. But relations between the BJP and the BPF started souring after BTC was placed under Governor’s rule. Both parties are now contesting the BTC polls separately. the BPF has fielded candidates in 37 seats while BJP is contesting 26 and supporting Independent candidates in the other seats. The campaigning has been bitter and personal with senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma accusing Mohilary of large-scale corruption and the latter terming the former a bully. “There’s lack of development in BTC areas due to misrule of BPF. The large crowds at our rallies indicate the BJP will come to power in BTC this time,” Sarma said at an election rally in Udalguri district on Saturday, the last day of campaigning for the first phase of polling. Hitting back, Mohilary said at an election rally: “Sarma can be a bully in Dispur, but he has no say in BTC. We are coming back to power again and the BJP’s plan to rule BTC will fall flat.” Apart from the BJP and the BPF, opposition Congress and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), which have a tie-up for the assembly polls, are contesting total 20 seats. The other prime contenders are United Peoples’ Party Liberal (UPPL), which is contesting all 40 seats and Gana Surakha Party (GSP) of Kokrajhar MP Nava Sarania, which is fighting in 35 seats. The BTC polls would be the first election in Assam since the Covid-19 pandemic started and the administrative machinery and poll machinery are geared up to ensure smooth polling while maintaining all protocols. “There are 11 constituencies in our district and nearly 700,000 voters. Polling parties have gone to their stations and security arrangements are in place for Monday’s voting. Face masks, sanitisers etc. have been provided to the poll officials and social distancing will be maintained during polling,” Ranjan Sarma, deputy commissioner of Baksa district said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-assembly-elections-assam-parties-battle-in-semi-final-btc-polls/story-P0XWHkABwmzkONFgnbbSDO.html

06-12-2020||India||India’s leadership on solar, industry transition reason to believe climate goals can be achieved: UN||India’s leadership on solar and industry transition is the reason to believe the world can achieve its climate goals, a top UN official has said, asserting that as governments look to restart their economies after Covid-19, it is vital to pursue a recovery that is not only sustainable, resilient and fair, but also job-rich. UN Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed highlighted “encouraging news” on global efforts to overcome climate change while attending a webinar titled ‘People and Climate- Just Transition in Practice’ last week. “Today there is encouraging news: Japan and the Republic of Korea, together with more than 110 other countries, have now pledged carbon neutrality by 2050. China says it will do so before 2060. India’s leadership on solar and the industry transition is reason to believe that we can achieve our climate goals,” she said. She said the European Union and its Member States had a strong history of leadership on climate action, including the commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. “It is essential that the European Union delivers on its promise to adopt a new climate target this year, by coming forward with a baseline of reducing emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030,” she said, adding that it is also crucial for the European Union to accelerate its transition toward renewable energy. Amina stressed that there must be no new coal, and all existing coal in the European Union and in all OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries should be phased out by 2030, and by 2040 elsewhere. “And the financing of fossil fuels internationally must come to an end,” she added. The top UN official underscored that as governments look to restart their economies following the devastation from Covid-19, it was vital that they pursue a recovery that is not only sustainable, resilient and fair, but also job-rich. “The notion that we must choose between climate action and economic strength has been proven wrong. Investments in renewable energy yield three times more jobs than investments in fossil fuels,” she said. A just transition must be a managed transition, she said, urging all governments to work with stakeholders to develop a credible, just transition plans. “Meeting the climate challenge means major shifts in our economies and societies, and these will naturally bring significant impacts on people, families and communities that touch the core of their identities and well-being. A just transition cannot be an afterthought; it an integral part of climate action and a responsibility for all of us,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-leadership-on-solar-industry-transition-reason-to-believe-climate-goals-can-be-achieved-un/story-rGfwuLoCmp7zOGnV8Wpj0I.html
06-12-2020||India||India plans to allow relinquished coal-fired plants to sell power||India’s power ministry proposes letting coal-fired power plants keep selling power after completing their agreements with buyers, a letter seen by Reuters shows, despite national promises to close old plants to curb pollution.The proposal, if approved, would help old coal plants earn additional revenue, increase liquidity in short-term power markets and help distribution companies in states facing a power deficit access cheaper power, the ministry said in the draft proposal dated Friday.“It is in the consumer interest to keep the tariff of electricity as low as possible,” says the letter sent to power departments of India’s states and the heads of federal government-run utilities such as NTPC Ltd.Such a move would enable federal-run electricity generators such as NTPC “to sell power in any mode” after distribution companies exit an agreement upon the completion of the tenure, the ministry said. Power Minister R.K. Singh and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman have previously said they plan to shut old coal-fired power plants. The environment ministry has also pushed for shutting down coal plants, which account for 80% of India’s industrial pollution, if they do not comply with green laws. The outcome remains unclear. The power ministry has sought comments from the states and the heads of federal government-run power generators. A final decision on the proposal is not imminent.A senior power ministry official said on Sunday only inefficient plants would be shut down. “Cost-effective utilities that provide cheap power will still be allowed to operate. Small, inefficient plants will be shut down,” the official said.Distribution companies operated by states such as Punjab, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha want to surrender power allocated by federal government-run utilities after the plants complete 25 years, the power ministry said.The states cited reasons such as the availability of excess power and high cost of electricity as reasons for surrendering power allotted to them under the agreements. A list compiled by the power ministry in 2019 shows distribution companies wanted to surrender power generated from utilities with a capacity of 5.75 gigawatts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-plans-to-allow-relinquished-coal-fired-plants-to-sell-power/story-v6uVXLvcTMH18XQ1yaqQzL.html
06-12-2020||India||Congress, AAP, TRS, Trinamool: List of parties which are supporting December 8 Bharat Bandh||The proposed Bharat Bandh called by farmers’ unions on December 8 is gathering strength as several political parties have now extended support to the cause of the farmers and the call for a nationwide strike. Though the union leaders are engaged in talks with the Centre on the three agriculture bills that they are opposing, the farmers have announced that their proposed plan of the nationwide strike, a day ahead of the next round of talks with the Centre, will be on track. Normal life is likely to be hit on December 8 as the farmers now have support of several trade unions and political parties that are in power in many states. Banking and transport services are likely to be affected on December 8 as unions have already backed the strike. CongressIn support of the bandh on December 8, there will be demonstrations at all party offices, district and state headquarters. The decision to support the bandh stems from Congress’s long-maintained stance on the farm laws. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had earlier addressed kisan rallies in Punjab after the laws were enacted.Aam Aadmi PartyDelhi Chief Minister and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has extended support to the bandh call. Delhi government supported the farmers when Delhi Police was mulling to detain the protesting farmers as they reached Delhi borders a few days ago.

The party has said sit-in protests will take place on December 8 in solidarity with the farmers’ cause.Rashtriya Loktantrik Party, Shiromani Akali Dal too backed the bandh.Apart from the political parties, a joint forum of trade unions including Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS), Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), All India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC) and Trade Union Co-ordination Centre (TUCC), is supporting the bandh.Among the bank unions, Officer unions All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Officers’ Association (AIBOA) and Indian National Bank Officers’ Congress (INBOC) have supported the farmers.

06-12-2020||India||Congress backs protesting farmers’ call for Bharat Bandh on December 8||Congress leaders will support the farmers’ call for a Bharat Bandh, or a nationwide strike, on December 8 to show their dissent against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre earlier this year, the party’s spokesperson Pawan Khera has said.“Congress has decided to support the Bharat Bandh on December 8. We will be demonstrating the same at our party offices,” Khera said, according to news agency ANI, adding the move will be a step towards strengthening Rahul Gandhi’s support to the farmers and that they will ensure that the demonstration is successful.Former party chief Rahul Gandhi, through tractor rallies, signature campaigns and farmers’ rallies has been raising the party’s voice in support of the farmers, he added.Also Read: Farmers’ protests at Delhi borders enter Day 11; city traffic divertedWhile speaking to the media at the party headquarters, the Congress spokesperson asked the government why the laws were enacted in a hurry. “In the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government in June surreptitiously brings ordinances. What was the hurry, the entire country was focussed on the fallout of Covid-19, the economic, social, health fallout? But the government was busy surreptitiously bringing ordinances to help its industrialist-corporate friends,” Khera said.“Where was the need to bring these legislations so fast, you suspended the opposition parties from Parliament, you did not follow parliamentary procedure and hurried through the passing of the bills, why was the hurry,” he added.Khera said the government would have sought suggestions from the farmers before introducing the legislation if it was really bothered about them. The Congress leader said that the entire nation was witnessing the plight of protesting farmers, who are camping outside at national capital borders during winter nights waiting for the government to listen to them.“What we are seeing today is the result of a conspiracy between the government and its corporate friends, wherein the victim would be the farmer, and the farmer knows this,” Khera claimed.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are sitting on various borders of the national capital since November 26 to protest against three farm laws - Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020- cleared by the government during the monsoon session of the Parliament.Leaders of farmers’ unions met the central leadership on Saturday to resolve the deadlock.

Yadav’s comments came after a case was filed against him and 18 other leaders from the constituents of the Grand Alliance-led opposition in Bihar for protesting without permission amid the coronavirus pandemic.The first information report (FIR) has been registered against them under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Epidemic Diseases Act. An FIR was also lodged against 500 unidentified people.“The government of Bihar, led by a cowardly chief minister, has lodged an FIR against me for raising the voice in support of the farmers.

Dhankhar said he is deeply disturbed and pained that governance in the state is shifting from the path of the Constitution.Speaking on the occasion of the 64th death anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar, Dhankhar claimed that the state of West Bengal is “virtually on fire”. Expressing his anger towards the West Bengal government, Dhankhar said he has sent them multiple reminders but to no avail, adding that the state is functioning unconstitutionally.“The state is virtually on fire and they seem to be fiddling politically, it can’t be countenanced. I have sent them multiple reminders, but no effect on them is a very big indication that it would take me a lot of effort to say the state government is functioning constitutionally. It is very unfortunate that their work is such that I am being forced,” he said according to news agency ANI.Dhankhar hoped that the state government would understand the letter and spirit of the Constitution and come to the right path. “I hope they will give it topmost priority and not force my hands beyond a limit,” he added.Dhankhar paid floral tributes to Ambedkar at Red Road in Kolkata on Mahaparinirvana Diwas, observed on the death anniversary of the leader.This isn’t the first time Dhankhar has lashed out at the Mamata Banerjee led government. He had been flagging concern over law and order and other issues in several tweets in the past and seeking a response from the chief minister’s Office (CMO). On November 18, he had pledged to ensure the assembly elections scheduled to be held in 2021 will be conducted in a free and fair manner in the state. “I will do everything in my power to ensure that the people of West Bengal get a free and fair election without violence. I have nothing to do with the outcome, only the upholding of the process of law and voter satisfaction,” Dhankhar had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-br-ambedkar-s-death-anniversary-bengal-governor-reminds-state-to-uphold-constitution/story-NaD0V1uRJ2wwdlqnfjPSEJ.html

06-12-2020||India||Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi’s NGO rescues 1600 trafficked children from exploitation during pandemic||Over 1,6oo trafficked children were rescued from “situations of exploitation” in the past eight months, Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi’s NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan said, noting that there has been a rise in such cases as many parents lost their livelihood due to the Covid-19 pandemic and during the lockdown. The lockdown was imposed by the central government across the nation from March 25 to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. However, from June 8, the Centre gradually started easing restrictions under ‘Unlock’.“One of the biggest worries during the lockdown was the fact that the financial crisis of families will lead them to take loans unethically. This eventually increased the vulnerability of children and their families of being lured by traffickers with the promise of a better livelihood opportunity,” Dhananjay Tingal, an executive director at BBA, said. Thirteen-year-old Krishna (name changed) was one of the 1,675 children rescued by the child rights organisation between April and November.Krishna was trafficked from his village in Bihar to work in a garment factory in Gandhinagar in Gujarat, where he toiled for 12 hours a day, and stayed in a tiny room that he shared with six others like him, BBA officials said. Though they were promised payment, they were never given the promised amount. Besides, this he and the others just got half a day to rest every week and were under tremendous pressure to meet production targets, they said.Krishna landed up in Gujarat and became a victim of trafficking after his parents, farm labourers, lost their jobs with the outbreak of the coronavirus, the BBA said.Moreover, his parents had taken a loan of Rs 20,000 before the lockdown to fix the roof of their house, but being unemployed they were unable to pay their lender, the officials said.It was getting difficult for Krishna’s parents to feed a family of 11 and traffickers took advantage of the situation and for Rs 20,000, Krishna was taken to Gujarat to work, they said.For months he endured exploitation at the hands of his employer, before being rescued by the BBA in July. The story of 14 -year-old Saad Khan (name changed) is no different.There were three earning members in his family, but the pandemic induced poverty forced Khan to search for work, the BBA officials said. He and his family were lured by a trafficker, who gave them an advance of Rs 5,000 and promised work for Khan. “The advance payment by any trafficker further complicates the issue as it becomes a case of bonded labour,” Tingal said. Khan was rescued along with 15 other children in September while he was being transported in a bus to work at a bangle making factory in Jaipur in Rajasthan. He was rescued by BAA with the help of the anti-human trafficking unit and local police. The child rights NGO said during April to November, 1,675 children rescued from “situations of exploitation” and 107 traffickers were arrested. “During August and September 2020, 80 vehicles, including 51 buses and 29 trains were intercepted based on information received from field activists, exclusively deployed to report suspected cases of child trafficking,” Tingal said, terming children as the biggest victim of the pandemic.“There is a dire need of being more vigilant and active in mapping children and families, who are specially at risk and try to stop trafficking at the source. The immediate measure that we have at hand to prevent this is to rehabilitate rescued bonded labourers, especially by ensuring that they are financially compensated and do not fall back into the cycle of exploitation,” he said.Tingal said that bangle making units of Jaipur have been under the scanner for over a decade now due to children being employed. The pandemic momentarily halted production but as soon as restrictions were relaxed, manufacturing resumed, and employers started employing children, he said.Children are employed primarily for two reasons- first due to cheap labour cost and secondly, due to their small hands which helps in efficiently fitting embellishments on bangles, Tingal said. “The advent of the pandemic has seriously damaged the work done in the past two decades by child rights organisations in terms of decreasing child labour. BBA has been adapting to the challenges posed by the pandemic in dealing with the steep rise in trafficking,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nobel-laureate-kailash-satyarthi-s-ngo-rescues-1600-trafficked-children-from-exploitation-during-pandemic/story-z0qvYvcXQhQSeMJPV3Cr4K.html

06-12-2020||India||UP MLC polls heat up as aggressive BJP goes all out||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) scripted some amount of success in teachers’ and graduate constituency seats of the Legislative Council election even as its leaders said the party was looking to dominate teachers’ politics in the state. The party’s gains come after it raised the stakes in these polls by launching an aggressive poll campaign. It, however, faced a tough contest on some of the seats from the opposition Samajwadi Party and independents. Of the 11 MLC seats —six teachers’ and five graduates’ — the BJP contested nine and backed an independent for the teachers’ quota seat in Gorakhpur. The results won’t affect the overall standing in the UP Legislative Council, where the SP dominates with 52 seats against the BJP’s 19, the Bahujan Samaj Party’s 8 and the Congress’s 2 members. However, the party would increase its tally after winning three of the six teachers’ constituency seats. An independent backed by the party has won as well in Gorakhpur. The SP registered a win in Varanasi and another independent candidate, who is a member of the unaided teachers’ outfit, won the Agra teachers’ seat. He is believed to enjoy the tacit support of the BJP. The state chief of unaided teachers’ association Umesh Dwivedi has already joined the BJP and won the elections from Lucknow teachers’ quota seat. Among the five graduate constituency seats, the BJP and Samajwadi Party had won two seats each. The BJP was also leading in the Agra graduate constituency. The overall results are yet to be announced officially. The BJP was poised to win the Lucknow graduates’ seat, though it faced an upset in the Varanasi graduates’ constituency as well as in the Allahabad-Jhansi graduates’ constituency seat, where it lost after 24 years. Political experts said the BJP’s aggressive foray in these polls, where it got its top state leaders to campaign for the first time, was set to impact teachers’ politics in the state. “It’s now clear that like these polls, the BJP would aggressively contest the panchayat polls, too, where a good show would definitely provide a psychological edge to the party ahead of the 2022 UP assembly polls,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran political observer. He said this would be most evident in west UP, where the BJP brought about a major upset by ending the nearly 50-year domination of teachers’ leader Om Prakash Sharma, 87, who had been winning the seat since 1970. “The results would impact teachers’ politics both inside and outside the UP Legislative Council,” agreed SK Dwivedi, a retired head of the department of political science in Lucknow University. “The complete results haven’t come so far, but there is no denying that BJP now would have a say in teachers’ politics in a big way,” he added. Even before the results for all the 11 MLC seats had come, the BJP quickly shifted focus to the panchayat polls. Its top state leadership met at the party office on Saturday to strategise for the next political assignment in UP. The panchayat polls in UP are expected to be announced early next year. The SP cited its win against the BJP in Allahabad and Varanasi as proof of what it termed its growing acceptability. “Despite desperate efforts to rig the polls by misusing official machinery, the BJP has suffered reverses from Jhansi till Kashi. The Samajwadi Party’s symbol cycle raced ahead triumphantly and is well set to win the 2022 assembly polls. The party’s popularity is growing and it has started showing too,” SP MLC Sunil Yadav said. The BJP faced reverses in graduate constituency seat in Varanasi, losing to the SP there. The BJP did not officially contest the Varanasi teachers’ seat. The Allahabad-Jhansi graduates’ seat was won by the SP and here the BJP cadres entered into a heated exchange of words with the police and administration. “The results make it clear that only the SP has the capability to challenge and checkmate the BJP,” said SP leader IP Singh though BJP leaders said having made an impact they were looking ahead. The BJP was poised to win the Lucknow graduate constituency seat after a tough contest, where independent candidate Kanti Singh levelled accusations against the administration of siding with the ruling party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-mlc-polls-heat-up-as-aggressive-bjp-goes-all-out/story-5rIj5d0va5tZs5cMISnwNP.html

And on Thursday, the DRI team arrested two persons including a woman from 02549 North East Festival Special train and recovered three foreign-origin gold bars weighing 1.496 kg. Those arrested were identified as Afroz Amirullah and Mohammad Shamad, both residents of Mumbai, who were travelling in AC-2 compartment of the Delhi bound train. The back-to-back seizures have revealed that smugglers from states such as Maharashtra, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh are increasingly using long-distance trains to smuggle gold into Delhi and other parts of the country, said the official quoted above.The intensified checking at the airports compared to the absence of baggage scanning and other security features at majority of railway stations in the country has led to the smugglers relying on rail routes, the official added. Also Read: Jewellery worth lakhs go missing from check-in bag of Bengaluru-bound couple, FIR lodgedThe suspect, arrested on Saturday, was identified as Sanjay Katkar, a resident of Sangli in Maharashtra and he was picked up from B4 compartment of Dibrugarh-Delhi special train. In his statement, recorded under section 108 of the Customs Act, he said the gold had been smuggled from Myanmar into India.The official said that the two accused arrested a day earlier on Friday were identified as Sunil Lun and Ravi Chug-- both residents of Thane in Maharashtra. Ravi was travelling in A-1 coach, while Sunil was travelling in H-1 compartment of the train. The gold was found concealed in the waistbands worn by the duo. They couldn’t produce any valid document showing legal importation, possession and transportation of the gold bars, valued at Rs 1.1 crore by a government value assessor, he said.“Acting on the basis of specific intelligence, very meticulously and painstakingly developed over days, the sleuths of Patna Zonal Unit of DRI apprehended two persons at Patliputra Railway Station when the train arrived,”said the official.Also Read: IIT-Patna student bags Rs 47 lakh annual package The intelligence inputs indicated that the recovered gold bars carrying foreign markings, had been smuggled into India from Myanmar through the international land border at Moreh in Manipur by a smuggling syndicate operating from Guwahati. Intelligence officers say rail routes are becoming popular among smugglers as it not only provides them with a safe, surveillance-free passage but also allows switching of handlers, carriers and routes, to avoid being tracked. The DRI have also intercepted a person identified as Kishan Lal of Madhya Pradesh near Patna junction. He was found carrying a consignment of 2.99 kgs of Heroin, worth Rs 15 crores. An RPF officer said that smugglers disguise ganja as luggage. “Most of the time, ganja is smuggled in general compartments. Since they are jam-packed, no one notices the extra luggage,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-gold-seizures-in-3-days-at-patna-station-confirm-new-smuggling-modus-operandi/story-h9HMeC6WOSUbA2j5Z4OGZP.html

The All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) in a statement said the government should come forward and resolve their demands in the interest of the nation and farmers. Officer unions All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Officers’ Association (AIBOA) and Indian National Bank Officers’ Congress (INBOC) have also requested the government to initiate meaningful dialogue to resolve the impasse by referring the bills to a select committee by a special Presidential Order. The farming community has expressed apprehension that three new laws -- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 -- would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations. Enacted in September, the laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. “Our nation needs peace and main stakeholders of the nation should not be made to suffer, as the agriculture sector alone performed positively in the Covid-19 pandemic, which reflects the inherent strength of the sector,” three officers’ unions said in a joint statement. The peasants constitute 80 per cent of the customer base of the public sector banks, regional rural banks, co-operative banks and old generation private banks and thus are major stakeholders of India’s banking system, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bank-unions-lend-support-to-farmers-agitation-against-agri-laws/story-XNsl3SO4iyicGEpnlXpS6H.html
06-12-2020||India||IISc researchers working on Covid-19 detection using Raman spectroscopy, artificial intelligence||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, are working on rapid identification of Covid-19 biomarkers in blood plasma using Raman spectroscopy and artificial intelligence. Raman Spectroscopy is a non-destructive chemical analysis technique which provides detailed information about chemical structure, phase and polymorphy, crystallinity and molecular interactions. It is based upon the interaction of light with the chemical bonds within a material.According to the team, using artificial intelligence and deep learning, the Covid-19 detection process will be automated and rapid and there will be no requirement of any extraction procedure. “It is of critical importance to develop new technologies that can rapidly detect Covid-19 and perform mass testing, and at the same are cost-effective. In this regard, Raman spectroscopy holds significant promise,” according to Dipankar Nandi, Professor at IISc Bangalore and principal investigator of the project.“Traditionally a chemist’s tool, Raman spectroscopy has found numerous applications in biomedicine, especially in disease diagnosis. This method probes bond vibrations and is very sensitive to the structural changes, giving a molecular fingerprint of the sample. Every disease is associated with a change in biochemistry which can either be a cause for disease manifestation or may be a consequence of the disease itself,” he added.The research is being conducted in collaboration with AIIMS, Bhopal, which will be providing patient samples and healthy controls. “Our proposal is directed at identifying Covid-19 biomarkers in the blood plasma of infected patients. No extraction procedure or reagents are required. The only requirement is a spectrometer and the patient samples. Using artificial intelligence and deep learning, the detection process will be automated and rapid. Spectra collected from infected Covid-19 patients and healthy controls will be used for training and building robust classification models,” according to Nandi.India’s Covid-19 caseload rose to 96.44 lakh, while the total number of people who have recuperated from the disease crossed 91 lakh pushing the national recovery rate to 94.37 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Sunday.The Covid-19 active caseload plunged to almost 4 lakh after 138 days.The total coronavirus cases mounted to 96,44,222 with 36,011 new infections being reported in a day, while the death toll crossed to 1.40 lakh with 482 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iisc-researchers-working-on-covid-19-detection-using-raman-spectroscopy-artificial-intelligence/story-f0zZuYUJD8QwOyUJDip1mO.html
06-12-2020||India||India considers French offer of six Airbus multi-role mid-air refuellers||India is considering a French proposal to acquire six Airbus 330 multi-role transport tanker aircraft on a government-to-government basis for expanding the Indian Air Force (IAF) strike capability through latest mid-air refuelers. IAF as of now operate seven Russian IL-76 M refuellers with Pakistan acquiring same four refuellers from Ukraine and China operating three same Russian refuellers along with vintage 10 others modified versions of Russian bombers.According to South Block sources, while IAF wanted to get an Airbus 330 MRTT on wet lease from a British company, the French proposal involves selling 5–7-year-old six aircraft for the air force with a certification of another 30 years of platform life at a much-reduced rate. IAF has been eager to acquire MRTT since the past decade with the previous RFP expiring without any results.According to a former Indian Air Force chief, the Airbus 330 MRTT platform has much larger wings of Airbus 340 as a result of which the aircraft can refuel two fighters mid-air at the same time through drogues (attached to wing pods) or a central refuelling boom system. The best part about the Airbus aircraft is that it can transport 260 personnel in cabin and fuel in the cargo hold due to highly efficient and high-powered engines. The MRTT can be turned into purely a tanker or transport or air ambulance or all three at the same time with a total crew of three.Mid-air refuellers are a key to expanding the operational envelope of the IAF and Indian Navy carrier-based fighters by extending their range. According to the former IAF chief, a mid-air refueller can be used to extend the flight of a Su-30 MKI or Rafale flying from Port Blair all the way up to Sunda, Lombard and Malacca Straits for freedom of navigation missions.“The French proposal is a win-win for IAF as the international market for aerial platforms is down due to Covid-19 pandemic. The aircraft does not guzzle fuel and has high power engines to operate from high altitude air bases in Ladakh like Leh, Thoise and Nyoma at the same time transport troops or conduct medical evacuation if required,” said a senior IAF official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-considers-french-offer-of-six-airbus-multi-role-mid-air-refuellers/story-70sYwYarTrtUMQcE0wvV7N.html

The incident occurred at around 6:30 pm, said the DFO.“An enquiry on location and circumstances of the accident has been initiated. The fault of railway department or forest field staff is also being looked into,” he said. The other herds moving near the railway tracks are being monitored and precautionary alarm has been raised with the Railways officials in the region, he added.With elephant corridors getting squeezed due to mining and rapid industrialisation, more and more elephants in Odisha are straying to human habitations for food and getting run over by speeding trains. Early this week, two elephants had died of electrocution after coming in contact with a livewire trap laid by bushmeat poachers.Meanwhile, the National Green Tribunal gave three months’ time to the Odisha government to submit an action plan on elephant corridors in the state. NGT, which was hearing a petition filed by wildlife NGO Wildlife Society of Orissa, had earlier directed that an action plan with specific timelines be prepared by the state government. Wildlife conservation NGO Asia Nature Conservation Foundation, which had graded 14 elephant corridors in the state according to their functional existence and ecological feasibility, had said that there is an urgent need to protect and augment the traditional movement paths to neutralise the increasing trend of elephant-human conflicts, wherever feasible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elephant-run-over-by-train-in-odisha/story-Npu7kwixyD1BiEFPSUtVpN.html

I am aware that systems alone cannot foster creativity. Even so, our constant endeavour must be to act as enablers of the youth -- many of whom have tuned in today,” he said on Saturday.Indian culture and art are integral to India’s soft power, Shringla said.“Artists dedicated to Indian art forms are not merely performers but brand ambassadors who have been taking our rich cultural heritage to the global audience,” he said.“At a personal level, I recall as a student in Delhi University the privilege of getting access to our best classical artists free of cost in open air concerts of SPIC MACAY. It has been both a privilege and pleasure to have hosted some of our most distinguished artists in various diplomatic missions where I have served,” Shringla said.He also reaffirmed the support of the Ministry of External Affairs and Indian missions abroad to SPIC MACAY’s efforts to showcase India’s classical art forms globally.“As we start to recover from the grasp of Covid-19, we look back to find that in times of crises people need nurturing of the soul,” Shringla said.“We are reminded of the important role of art in giving people hope. The disruption caused by the pandemic has driven many of us to reimagine art, and art forms. Taking art online has become a necessity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-culture-art-integral-to-its-soft-power-fs-shringla/story-5XObtR5OytboXrpDCG5GsM.html
06-12-2020||India||Been only 14 days since first vaccine shot: Anil Vij after testing Covid-19 positive||Haryana’s health minister Anil Vij, who tested positive for Covid-19 a little over two weeks after he joined a trial for a vaccine candidate, said on Sunday it had only been 14 days since he was “vaccinated”. Vij also said that at the time of being given the shot he was told by the doctors that antibodies develop after 14 days of its second dose.To be sure, the trial is a double-blind, randomised experiment so half of the volunteers are given a placebo and the other half the vaccine, according to Bharat Biotech’s trial registry. This means neither Vij nor those administering the shot would be aware of whether what he was given was indeed the vaccine. Technically, there is a 50% chance he got the inoculation.“It is a double-blind trial (meaning, neither the recipient nor the researchers know who is given a vaccine and who is given a placebo). Such trials have a very rigorous protocol for unblinding,” a Union health ministry official said asking not to be named.“Before administering Covaxin, doctors told me that antibodies will develop after 14 days of the second dose... I am being treated at a civil hospital and I feel fine. It has only been 14 days since I got the first shot,” Vij wrote on Twitter in Hindi. मुझे कोवेक्सिन लगाने से पहले डॉक्टरों ने बता दिया था कि वेक्सिन दूसरी डोज 28 दिन के बाद लगने के 14 दिन बाद ही अन्टोबोडी बनेगी । पूरी एहतियात बरतने के बाद भी मैंकरना के काबू आगया । मेरा सिविल हस्पताल में इलाज हो रहा है ओर मैं ठीक महसूस कर रहा हूँ । मुझे वैक्सीन लगवाये अभी 14 दिन ही हुए थे ।The minister’s tweet comes after his illness and participation in the trial for Bharat Biotech International Limited’s Covaxin triggered confusion over the vaccine on Saturday. Hours after Vij tested positive for the coronavirus disease, the pharmaceutical company clarified that the shot is meant to be protective only two weeks after the second dose – which is given after a gap of 28 days following the first dose.Later, the minister himself addressed the concerns by issuing a similar statement to news agency PTI.

In between there is no protection,” Vij told PTI over the phone.Developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the government’s National Institute of Virology, Covaxin is a two-dose vaccine. It uses an inactivated virus to elicit an immune response in people.The third phase trials of the potential vaccine against coronavirus disease is currently being conducted with over 25,000 volunteers across 25 centres in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/been-only-14-days-since-first-vaccine-shot-anil-vij-after-testing-covid-19-positive/story-1lUbMRYVH0CC8pLZmgw2VN.html

Delhi Traffic Police have closed as many as seven borders, including Singhu, Auchandi, Lampur, Piao Maniyari, Mangesh, Tikri, Jharoda, for any traffic movement in view of the protest against the farm laws.Follow latest updates on farmers’ protests here On Saturday, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal and minister of state for commerce Som Parkash, offered to make four major amendments to the set of farm laws during the talks, although they presented no written material, an official said. The farmers, however, did not accept any changes and demanded that the laws be repealed.The protesting farmers, who have called for a nationwide strike on Tuesday, will meet the central leadership again on Wednesday to arrive at a consensus. While the government leans on its new reform agenda for better crop prices and higher investments in the farm sector, farmers say changes approved by Parliament in September would allow big corporations to exploit them.Kavitha Kuruganti of the Women Farmers’ Rights Forum, a participant, Saturday’s talks were stalled at one point as farmers carried out a silent protest on their seats during the discussions. “We rejected the proposal for amendments.

Hindus and Muslims have decided to refrain from observing any kind of event to mark the anniversary of Babri mosque demolition this year. In the past, Muslims of Ayodhya used to observe the day as “Yaum-e-Gham” (day of sorrow) by displaying black flags and keeping their establishments closed. Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, successor designate of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das who is the chairman of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust, has issued an appeal to Hindus to not observe “Shaurya Diwas” on Sunday. “When the Supreme Court has decided in favour of Ram Mandir, there is no point in observing “Shaurya Diwas”. Now, “Bhoomi Pujan” of Ram Mandir has also taken place and foundation work of Ram Mandir is going on,” said Sharad Sharma, regional spokesperson for Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), who operates from Karsevakpuram, Ayodhya. “So, both Hindus and Muslims must move ahead,” he added. On November 9 last year, the constitution bench of the apex court ended decades’ old Ram Mandir–Babri Masjid title suit dispute by ruling in favour of a Ram Mandir.Unlike in the past when a big congregation used to assemble at Tedi Bazaar residence of Haji Mehboob, one of the litigants in Ram Mandir–Babri Masjid title suit to observe “Yaum-e-Gham” or “Shahadat Diwas”, this time there won’t be any symbolic protests. At Mehboob’s residence, clerics from across the state also used to assemble and a memorandum addressed to the President of India used to be handed over to city magistrate demanding the restoration of Babri mosque.On the other hand, saffron organisations led by the VHP used to observe the day as “Shaurya Diwas” (day of valour). However, after “Bhoomi Pujan” of Ram Mandir, which was presided over by PM Narendra Modi on August 5 , the Muslim community in the temple town has decided to stop observing December 6 as “Yaum-e-Gham”. “There will be no ‘Yaum-e-Gham’ this year. No black flags will be hoisted and Muslims will also open their establishments on December 6,” said Haji Mehboob. “Only recital of the Quran will be held in Tedi Bazaar mosque for those who were killed in violence on December 6, 1992,” he added. “We have decided to move ahead of the past and convey a message to rest of the Muslim community across the country to forget the past for a better future,” Mehboob said. Iqbal Ansari, the son of the late Hasim Ansari who was the original litigant in the Ram Mandir–Babri Masjid dispute, said: “Long ago, I had stopped observing “Yaum-e- Gham”. Now, after the Supreme Court’s order in favour of Ram Mandir, there is no point observing the day as a day of sorrow for any Muslim.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-event-in-ayodhya-on-babri-anniversary-as-hindus-muslims-move-on/story-f6GfHRaIVJBhC8bEkI5hPI.html

UDF has tied up with Jamaat-e-Islami. Muslim league will understand the setback from the Muslim community for this alliance after the election,” he said.“Even a single leader of Congress, Muslim league or UDF did not speak against BJP... LDF will not ally with communal forces for few votes,” he said.The Chief Minister said that there are few states where Congress governments are in power but BJP can topple them any time.“The Central government is taking a policy of destroying the federal system of our nation. Congress party is in power in a few states. Any time BJP can overthrow Congress governments. We have witnessed it in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka,” Vijayan said.The Chief Minister alleged that the Central government is using national investigative agencies to sabotage the government in Kerala.“The Central government and BJP are spending a huge amount to sabotage other governments. They are using investigative agencies. They are purchasing elected people’s representatives in many places of our country,” he said.“Left party is in power in Kerala only. They cannot sabotage the government by purchasing MLAs. So the Central government is using national investigative agencies to sabotage the government in Kerala. Congress and Muslim League are supporting the BJP,” Vijayan said.“Now the farmers of our country are protesting in the national capital. The labourers and farmers are resisting the forces destroying Constitution, selling public wealth and destroying rights if the people. The LDF candidates are their representatives.”“The economic policy of the BJP government is destroying the country. Earlier it was Congress’ policy. Both BJP and Congress have the same economic policy. There is no difference. BJP’s rule is for corporates. Under BJP’s rule, corporates are becoming richer and poor people are becoming poorer. Our economy is facing a historic decline. Even RBI officials have to admit it,” he said. Due to COVID protocols, public campaign and rallies are not allowed for local body election. Sunday is the final day of the election campaign for the first phase of the election. Polling will take place on 8, 10 and 14 December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-alleges-congress-led-udf-and-bjp-have-secret-alliance-for-local-body-polls/story-tlsZtiqU1oLFDoVZGS1wEP.html

Birla added that the construction of the building will directly involve 2,000 people and indirectly involve 9,000 people.“The new building will showcase the cultural diversity of the country. Hopefully, in the 75th year of Independence (2022), Parliament session will be held in the new building,” he said.Also Read: PM Modi to lay the foundation stone of new Parliament building on Dec 10Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new Parliament building, close to the existing one, at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore under the Central Vista redevelopment project in September this year.Here’s a look at the features of the new Parliament building:Spread over 64,500 square metres, earthquake resistance: The new building will have an area of 64,500 square metres and is being built at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore, Birla said and added that the new building will be earthquake resistant.To be built indigenously: “The existing temple of democracy is completing 100 years... It is a matter of pride for our countrymen that the new one will be built by our own people as a prime example of Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” the Lok Sabha speaker said.Seating capacity for over 1,000 MPs: According to the Lok Sabha speaker, as many as 1,224 MPs can sit together in the building, while a new office complex for all MPs of both the houses would be built at the site of the existing Shram Shakti Bhawan.

His family members claimed that the farmer was worried about selling his paddy crops cultivated over six acres of land after learning that the maximum area of his farm under paddy production was written off in the government record for the purpose of procurement.Meanwhile, the district administration has suspended a revenue official for allegedly making an erroneous entry for the farmer’s paddy cultivation area in the government record.However, the administration said that the error was not the reason for the farmer’s death. The farmer was found dead on December 2.As per preliminary information, Markam had sown paddy on his 2.731 hectare (6.70 acre) of land and was eligible to sell around 100 quintal of paddy at the minimum support price (MSP) in the cooperative society, Kondagaon collector Pushpendra Kumar Meena said.The state government has started a paddy procurement drive from December 1 and 15 quintals of paddy is purchased at MSP from every registered farmer for every acre of land under cultivation for the crop.On December 2, Markam had sent his relative to local Large Area Multi-purpose Society (LAMPS) to collect the token for selling his paddy crop following which he learnt that he was only eligible to sell around 11 quintals as the record showed only 0.32 hectare or 0.79 acre of his farm land under paddy cultivation.Next day, he allegedly took his own life following which the local sub divisional magistrate (revenue) was asked for a report, Meena said.“The SDM found that there were multiple factors that might have prompted Markam to end his life. According to his family, he had been under depression since the death of his son two years back and had started consuming liquor,” the collector said. Also Read: Villagers in Chhattisgarh district protest over mining nod, arrest of 6 tribals The probe also revealed that the alleged negligence by the patwari (revenue official) resulted in the erroneous entry of Markam’s paddy cultivation area.The patwari has been suspended and the concerned tehsildar was issued a show-cause notice, he said.However, if Markam would have contacted the officials, the error could have been rectified immediately, he added.BJP national vice president and former chief minister Raman Singh has alleged that another farmer’s life in the state had been lost to misrule and poor policies of the state government.He alleged that the government was insensitively hell bent on branding the victim as an addict and the chief minister was not ashamed of that.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-denies-official-error-behind-chhattisgarh-farmer-s-death-bjp-targets-cm/story-JPYTNMMcwzO901C2AWlDMN.html

Every year, this day is observed as the Mahaparinirvana Diwas.“Remembering the great Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on Mahaparinirvan Diwas. His thoughts and ideals continue to give strength to millions. We are committed to fulfilling the dreams he had for our nation,” PM Modi tweeted.The term ‘parinirvana’ has a deep meaning in Buddhist traditions and refers to someone who has attained nirvana in his lifetime and after death. December 6 is observed to commemorate Ambedkar’s contribution to society and his achievements. Ambedkar’s effort in shaping the directive principles, the formulation of the reservation system for the upliftment of the backward sections of the society, the voicing of the equal right of the Dalits have earned him an irreplaceable position in Indian political history.Presidents, Prime Ministers, chief ministers and top politicians, all come forward to commemorate Ambedkar on Mahaparinirvana Diwas every year.Ambedkar had led from the front along with Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi and played a pivotal role in the upliftment of the poor and backward classes of the society.

06-12-2020||India||On BR Ambedkar’s death anniversary, a look at his contributions||December 6, 2020, marks the 64th death anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Indian Constitution. BR Ambedkar breathed his last on December 6, 1956, in his sleep and people pay their tributes to him on this day every year which is observed as the Mahaparinirvana Diwas.Parinirvana, regarded as one of the major principles as well as goals of Buddhism, is a Sanskrit term which means release or freedom after death. As per the Buddhist text Mahaparinibbana Sutta, the death of Lord Buddha at the age of 80 is considered as the original Mahaparinirvana.Owing to his status as a Buddhist leader, Ambedkar’s death anniversary is referred to as Mahaparinirvana Diwas. Ambedkar, who belonged to the Mahar caste which was considered untouchable in Hinduism, converted to Buddhism after studying the religion for years on October 14, 1956, in Nagpur along with 500,000 supporters.He died just a few days after completing his last work, The Buddha and His Dhamma, a treatise on Buddha’s life and Buddhism. Ambedkar believed that Dalits can never get their rights within Hinduism.Baba Saheb, as he is fondly called by his supporters, was born on April 14, 1891, in Madhya Pradesh’s Mhow. Because of his caste, Ambedkar witnessed economic and social discrimination since childhood. Most of these painful experiences that honed Ambedkar’s life have been written down by him in his autobiographical book Waiting For A Visa.In 1912, Bhimrao graduated in political science and economics from Bombay University after which he got a job in Baroda but decided to move to the United States in 1913 for further studies. In 1916, he received a doctorate degree from Columbia University, becoming the first Indian to do so. According to Ambedkar, Columbia University was the first place where he “experienced social equality.”When he returned from the United States, the Maharaja of Baroda appointed Ambedkar as his political secretary. Bhimrao moved to Bombay in 1917 and established a fortnightly newspaper “Mooknayak” in 1920 which laid the foundations of an assertive and organised Dalit politics. Ambedkar was appointed by the Bombay Presidency Committee to work in the Simon Commission in 1925.In 1926, Ambedkar successfully defended three non-Brahmin leaders who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel. This made Ambedkar popular in the country after which he led the Mahad Satyagraha in 1927 to allow untouchables to use water in a public tank in Mahad, Maharashtra. The Kalaram Temple Movement of 1930 formed a pivotal role in the Dalit movement in India in which Ambedkar led a protest outside the Kalaram temple which did not allow Dalits to enter the temple premises.In 1932, Ambedkar was invited to attend the Second Round Table Conference in London where he demanded separate electorates for Dalits. Mahatma Gandhi was against separate electorates for untouchables and protested by fasting in Yerwada jail. Ultimately, Ambedkar agreed with Gandhi and signed the Poona Pact, whereby a number of seats were reserved for the untouchables, which gave the Dalits a place in the general electoral list.On August 29, 1947, he was appointed as the chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee for the constitution of independent India. After Independence, he was appointed as the law minister of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-br-ambedkar-s-death-anniversary-a-look-at-his-contributions/story-tnhfl7ksDJ0fIxuaOtJ0QI.html

The visit is being seen as a testimony to New Delhi’s commitment to warming ties between India and the Gulf countries. While Naravane’s visit to Saudi Arabia is the first such visit by an Indian Army chief, his visit to the UAE comes close on the heels of a visit by foreign minister S Jaishankar to Bahrain and the UAE during November 24-26.Here’s everything you need to know about his Army chief MM Naravane’s visit:1. This visit will be Naravane’s third foreign trip this year during which he will meet his counterparts and other senior officials in these countries. Naravane is set to travel first to Saudi Arabia, where his engagements will include an address at the Saudi National Defence College. He will then travel to the UAE, whose defence ties with India have been expanded in recent years.2. Both the West Asian countries are home to a majority of the nine million Indian expatriates in the region.3. The visits are being seen as part of India’s outreach to West Asia, which is seen by New Delhi as part of its “extended neighbourhood”. This outreach has dramatically expanded defence and security cooperation, especially counter-terrorism, in recent years.Read more| Army chief’s visit to Saudi Arabia, UAE signals India’s intention to boost security cooperation, say experts4. The visit comes against the backdrop of the UAE, Bahrain and Sudan normalising relations with Israel and Iran’s efforts to position itself as a key player in West Asia. India has welcomed the normalisation of ties between Arab states, saying that such moves are in line with its efforts to back peace and development in West Asia.5. The upswing in ties between India and the Gulf countries also comes amidst a cooling of ties between Saudi Arabia and the UAE and Pakistan. In August, Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi expressed his displeasure at Saudi Arabia, once Pakistan’s strong ally, for failing to convene a special meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on the Kashmir issue.6.

We will conduct the elections in the coming summer keeping the safety of the public in mind. TDP will be wiped out of Andhra Pradesh just like in Telangana.”“YSRCP will win 90 per cent of panchayats and municipalities, otherwise I will resign and quit politics. Atchannaidu is accused in the ESI scam. TDP is a fake party. Can anybody from that party come forward to take up my challenge?” he added. On SEC Nimmagadda Ramesh, Rao SAID, “Who is Ramesh to write a letter to the Governor for the conduct of local body elections? Nimmagadda Ramesh is a boot licker for Chandrababu, he has no right to conduct local body elections. He is not competent to advise the governor. Nimmagadda Ramesh is not caring the government, public and governor, so we won’t recognize him as SEC at all. In fact, he had to conduct local body elections in June 2018, he did not conduct elections then, what was he doing, counting the teeth of a blind horse? He is benami for Chandrababu Naidu. We won’t accept his proposal to conduct local body elections in February 2021,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tdp-will-be-wiped-out-of-andhra-just-like-in-telangana-says-state-minister/story-lDxOfPaMcynJZUmDnJRASK.html

06-12-2020||India||Haryana minister tests positive for Covid-19||Haryana’s health minister Anil Vij announced on Saturday that he tested positive for Covid-19, a little over two weeks after he joined a trial for a vaccine and was administered the first of two shots, which may or not have been the actual inoculation.Vij’s illness and participation in the trial for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin triggered confusion over the vaccine, prompting the company to clarify that the shot is meant to be protective only two weeks after the second dose – which itself is given after a gap of 28 days following the first dose. Later, the minister himself addressed the concerns.“I was told that antibodies start to develop after the second dose, which is administered after 28 days of getting the first shot. And full antibodies are developed 14 days after the second dose is given. So, the complete cycle takes 42 days. In between there is no protection,” Vij said over a phone call to news agency PTI. Earlier, he announced in a tweet: “I have been tested Corona positive. I am admitted in Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt. All those who have come in close contact to me are advised to get themselves tested for corona,” he tweeted. Covaxin is a two-dose vaccine developed by the Indian vaccine manufacturer Bharat Biotech in collaboration with government’s National Institute of Virology. It uses an inactivated virus to elicit an immune response in people. The vaccine is at present in phase III trials, with over 25,000 volunteers. According to Bharat Biotech’s trial registry, half of these people will be given a placebo and the other half the vaccine. The trial is a double-blind, randomised experiment – meaning it neither Vij nor the officials would be aware of whether what he was given was indeed the vaccine. He technically has a 50% chance he got the inoculation. “It is a double-blind trail (meaning, neither the recipient nor the researchers know who is given a vaccine and who is given a placebo). Such trials have very rigorous protocol for unblinding,” a Union health ministry official said, asking not to be named. This person too said even if Vij indeed was a recipient of the inoculation, it is unlikely to offer protection unless he gets the requisite booster dose and a gap of two weeks after that. The vaccine manufacturer Bharat Biotech reiterated the same in a statement. Experts said he is most likely to have contracted the infection naturally by coming in contact with a positive person. “First, we do not know whether he got the vaccine or the placebo dose. Second, he did not get both the doses of the vaccine after which the body produces an immune response. Third, no vaccine is 100% effective,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine and one of the investigators of the vaccine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. “Infections are likely to be reported in both the vaccine and placebo arm of a trial. No vaccine is a 100% effective and the difference in the incidence of the infection in both the arms tells us the efficacy of the vaccine. Even Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are about 95% effective. There are predefined protocols for unblinding a trial. One, it is done if there is a serious adverse event and the investigators need to see whether it is caused by the vaccine candidate. Even then it is done under the guidance of data safety monitoring board. Two, it is unblinded for interim analysis when there have been a certain predefined number of infections,” said Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, a Delhi-based vaccinologist and public health specialist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-minister-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-JlRjD205eAg9SRfTtiWKoN.html

06-12-2020||India||Modi to lay the foundation stone of new Parliament building on Dec 10||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone for the new Parliament building on December 10, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla announced in New Delhi on Saturday, minutes after he met the PM to formally invite him. The 64,500 sq m new building will replace the 93 years old existing parliament house and will be constructed at an estimated cost of ₹971 crore, Birla announced, dubbing the proposed complex as a prime example of “Atmanirbhar Bharat” -- a flagship initiative of the Modi government . The Speaker and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led government is hopeful to inaugurate the building in 2022 when the India celebrates its 75th year of Independence. The new Parliament building is part of the Central Vista redevelopment project, which also involves constructing a common Central Secretariat along with residences of Prime Minister and vice-president, and a revamp of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate. The new triangular Parliament building will house a total of 1,224 MPs — 888 in the Lok Sabha and 384 in the Upper House — with 55% additional seating capacity than the current strength of Parliament, which could be utilised if the two Houses are expanded in the future. Presently, Lok Sabha has a sanctioned strength of 543 members and Rajya Sabha 245.A new office complex for all parliamentarians will also replace the Shram Shakti Bhawan and Transport Bhawan, right next to Parliament. “The new building will showcase the cultural diversity of the country. Hopefully, in the 75th year of independence, Parliament session will be held in the new building,” Birla said, adding that the construction of the earthquake resistant structure would involve 2,000 workers directly and another 9,000 indirectly. The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India’s democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space. The Speaker also said that invitation for the foundation stone laying ceremony will be extended to all political parties and that the ceremony will follow all Covid-related guidelines. In September this year, Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new Parliament House. Steps have been taken to control air and noise pollution during the construction work for the new building, which will have separate offices for all MPs. The existing building will be conserved as it is an archaeological asset, Birla said.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-lay-the-foundation-stone-of-new-parliament-building-on-dec-10/story-TEMJ9mdxvTJuFm8lEAiyNI.html
06-12-2020||India||Farm talks deadlocked, another round on December 9||The fifth round of talks between protesting farmers and the Centre showed no signs of progress, dealing a blow to the government’s offer to bring a set of amendments to the three new farm laws that agriculturists say will hurt their interests. Farm unions stuck to their demand for a full withdrawal of the legislation, but agreed to another meeting on December 9. With the stalemate persisting, farmers’ representatives said they would intensify their agitation, as thousands laid siege to the Capital’s entry points for the tenth straight day. They have called for a nationwide blockade on December 8. The government team, led by agriculture minister Narendra Tomar, railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal and minister of state for commerce Som Prakash, offered to make four major amendments to the set of farm laws during the talks, although they presented no written material, an official said, requesting anonymity. While the government has leaned on its new reform agenda for better crop prices and higher investments in the farm sector, farmers say changes approved by Parliament in September would allow big corporations to exploit them. The government on Saturday proposed new rules for free markets provided for by The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, one of the laws being opposed by the farmers. Before the meeting, home minister Amit Shah, Tomar, defence minister Rajnath Singh and Goyal met Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an hour to discuss the four amendments they had offered to make. During the talks, the government made four verbal offers. One, it offered to amend the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, to levy trade fees in new free markets to create a level playing field between these and traditional, government-controlled notified markets. Farmers say free markets, where traders don’t have to pay any trade fee, will wipe out traditional markets which they depend on for assured prices of staples. Two, the government said it was open to bringing a system of registration for traders in free markets to help bring transparency in farm trade, price levels and traceability of traders. Three, the government said it would bring new clauses to its new contract-farming legislation – the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 – to strengthen farmers’ land-holding rights. Lastly, officials said it would allow farmers to approach any civil court to settle disputes with traders. Under the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, such disputes were to be settled at the level of a sub-divisional magistrate within 30 days. Farmers feel they should be free to approach higher courts, but the government has maintained that restricting dispute settlement to the local level was done for speedier resolution.The talks stalled at one point, as farmers carried out a silent protest on their seats during the discussions, according to Kavitha Kuruganti of the Women Farmers’ Rights Forum, a participant. “We rejected the proposal for amendments. All members of delegation have decided to keep silent. The government side was trying to draw us out. There was utter silence from our side,” Kuruganti said. Farmers showed placards, asking the government to say ‘yes or no’ on the demand for complete withdrawal of the laws, said Rakesh Tikait, the leader of the influential Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait faction). The government sought more time to come up with a “concrete proposal” and “written suggestions” from the farmers would help take the talks forward, Tomar said. He appealed to the farmer leaders to send elderly protesters and children home.Kuruganti said the agriculture minister concluded by complimenting the farmers for holding a “disciplined and peaceful protests, which were free from party political”. “That’s quite a distance from the initial view of the government that the farmers were misled and were being instigated.” The recent reforms in the antiquated farm sector allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers fear the reforms could pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at federally fixed minimum support prices (MSP), erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of private buyers. “The issue is not about one particular clause, but about the direction in which the Govt of India is pushing farming in India,” said Avik Saha, the secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-talks-deadlocked-another-round-on-december-9/story-LyTx1DrdohD6tQt36nACaJ.html

When Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesman for the UN Secretary-General, was asked about the farmers’ protest at a daily news briefing on Friday, he replied: “As to the question of India, what I would say to you is what I’ve said to others when raising these issues is that people have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and authorities need to let them do so.” The reporter who asked the question also contended the farmers involved in the protest were being met with “repressive measures” and this had a bearing on India’s democracy. Dujarric responded by saying: “We want to see people have a voice in their lives.” Trudeau was the first world leader to comment on the farmers’ protest, telling a Facebook video interaction on Tuesday that the situation in India was “concerning”. On Friday, the external affairs ministry summoned Canada’s envoy Nadir Patel and told him the remarks by Trudeau and Canadian lawmakers had the potential to “seriously” damage bilateral ties||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-have-a-right-to-protest-peacefully-un-spokesperson/story-55X6f8dJ68kIABuUWZcX8N.html

06-12-2020||India||Habeas corpus plea heard after 23 years||The Calcutta high court on Friday closed a petition filed 23 years back about a hospital’s alleged failure in handing over a newborn to his mother after his birth after the officials stumbled upon the plea’s file gathering dust in one of the court’s cupboard for over two decades. The matter was last heard on December 22, 1997. A division bench of chief justice TB Radhakrishnan and justice Arijit Banerjee lamented the “great misfortune” that the matter had remained pending for so long. “Though different directions were issued with the further order to the registry of this court to list the matter after three months [from December 22, 1997], it is a matter of great misfortune that this matter is listed today [Friday] after 23 years of hibernation of this file in the cupboard of the high court,” the bench said. In 1997, the court had directed the police to register a case and investigate the matter when the petition was last heard. “We are in a judicial system. We cannot afford to stack files without the same being listed in spite of judicial orders,” the bench said on Friday.It added that the court should consider initiating action for misconduct against officers responsible, more so because it was a habeas corpus petition, which mandates that the involved party is brought before a court or a judge.“When matters are not listed by the office of the high court in spite of judicial orders, it may, at least in certain situations, be appropriate that the courts should consider initiating action for misconduct against the officers concerned for having deflected the course of justice by disobeying judicial orders for posting a case,” the order said.A senior official of the Calcutta high court told HT on condition of anonymity that more such files were found. “This is not the oldest case file that was found stacked in a cupboard. We have started re-listing old case files before the court so that they could be heard. There are a few files dating back to the mid-80’s, which have been listed. At present around 40 - 50 old files, dating back to the mid-80s and early 90s have been listed. There could be more.”“Had anyone been arrested, his liberty taken away and then the matter went into a cold storage for two decades, that would have been condemnable.

The pharma company has already applied to the US FDA seeking EUA for the vaccine.The extreme low temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius required for storing the vaccine poses a big challenge for its delivery in a country like India, especially in its smaller towns and rural areas where maintaining such cold chain facilities would be very difficult, top government officials have said.When contacted, Pfizer said it remains committed to engaging with the Government of India and explore opportunities to make this vaccine available for use in the country.“During this pandemic phase, Pfizer will supply this vaccine only through government contracts based on agreements with respective government authorities and following regulatory authorisation or approval,” the global pharma major said in a statement.Five vaccines are in advanced phases of clinical trials in India with the Serum Institute of India conducting phase-3 trial of the Oxford-Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccine, while the indigenously developed vaccine by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR has already started the phase-3 clinical trial.Drug firm Zydus Cadila has received the approval from the DCGI to start the phase-3 clinical trials of the indigenously-developed anti-coronavirus vaccine.Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) have announced that they commenced adaptive phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V in India, Also, Biological E. Ltd has started early phase 1 and 2 human trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pfizer-seeks-emergency-use-authorisation-for-covid-19-vaccine-in-india/story-HPxJDxx2hfNfBw4Nzr1t9H.html
06-12-2020||India||Covid-19: Inspection teams flag violations by private hospitals||Private hospitals and nursing homes in the Capital are needlessly testing Covid-19 patients admitted with mild and moderate symptoms, using therapies not on the Union government’s clinical management guidelines, and are only partly complying with infection control protocols, according to an inspection by teams constituted by the Union home ministry, which has suggested a tighter vigil on these facilities.The teams, formed when Delhi was in its third and most serious wave of infections in November, surveyed 114 privately run health care facilities in the city on November 17 and 18. It presented the findings to the director general of health services (DGHS) under health ministry, and the report is now part of an affidavit by the Centre to the Supreme Court. The court is hearing a public interest case to evaluate steps taken by the Union and state administrations to control and mitigate the Covid-19 outbreak.“In the discharge policy prescribed by MoHFW, only severe categories of admitted cases are required to be tested using RT–PCR technique prior to discharge. However, it was noted that all private hospitals inspected were testing every admitted Covid-19 patient using RT– PCR technique prior to discharge,” said the report.DGHS’s guidelines say that apart from severe cases, patients with moderate or mild symptoms can be discharged after three consecutive days of no fever without the need for an RT-PCR test. Experts have previously stressed on this point since nucleic acid tests like RT-PCR can throw a positive result if it finds viral fragments. People infected with Covid-19 are typically believed to not be infectious after 10 days. “Majority of the hospitals inspected were not complying with the Clinical Management Protocol prescribed by MoHFW and using drugs and treatments based on the clinical judgement of respiratory physicians, general physicians working in these hospitals,” said the summary report, citing what they said was regular use of remdesivir and convalescent plasma therapy.The report added that while these have been prescribed as “investigational therapy (on experimental basis)”, hospitals were using these “routinely”. “Further, these hospitals were found to be using favipiravir, doxycycline, azithromycin, ivermectin in many patients in spite of these drugs not being prescribed in the National Clinical Management Protocol issued by MoHFW (ministry of health and family welfare).”According to experts, approaches for treatment of Covid-19 are still evolving and most therapies are experimental. “Despite a lot of data from across the world, there are studies saying opposite things about many therapies. In such a scenario, doctors are going by their clinical experience and their institution’s clinical experience on what seems to work and what does not. Even the national protocol is dynamic,” said Dr Harsh Mahajan, senior vice-president, Nathealth, an association of healthcare stakeholders.“There are new therapies and medicines emerging, evidence on what works and what doesn’t is being published every day. So there should be some leeway for the treating physicians to decide what works and what doesn’t for their patient,” said Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council.According to Dr Samiran Panda, head, epidemiology and communicable diseases, ICMR and a member of the National Task Force (NTF) on Covid-19 Management, the guidance on plasma therapy has been changed to mention caveats but it has not been banned. “ICMR has made it public that the therapy isn’t of much use based on the evidence that we have, and our revised guidelines were drastically modified for reference of those wanting to administer it. It has not been banned but there are clear cut dos and don’ts mentioned in ICMR advisory,” Panda said.According to the government’s affidavit, the DGHS has thus recommended a special vigil on private facilities to ensure they are testing and discharging people as per guidelines. “Similarly, to avoid misuse of drugs not recommended by the MoHFW, GOI, a special restrictive order may be considered for issuing,” said the report, urging the Delhi government to consider appointing nodal officers for monitoring the performance of all these hospitals on a day to day basis. The inspectors said they were satisfied with the facilities’ compliance with government’s direction to earmark a certain percentage of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients, displaying data regarding occupancy of the identified beds, and the rate of infections among health care workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-inspection-teams-flag-violations-by-private-hospitals/story-9TjfHaOmc8UwO9NAHAypTL.html
06-12-2020||India||Odisha farmers block roads to protest against centralised paddy procurement system||Hundreds of farmers stacked their paddy produce on major roads in various parts of Western Odisha on Saturday, demanding the withdrawal of the centralised token system for procurement of the crop in the state-run market yards.Farmers, under the banner of the Paschim Odisha Krushak Sangathan Samanway Samiti (POKSSS), demanded the procurement of paddy from across the region on the basis of the harvest report, submitted by the agriculture department of the districts concerned.POKSSS convenor Lingaraj said the paddy procurement system should be decentralised.The government has decided to procure 19 quintals of paddy per acre of irrigated land and 13 quintals of rain-fed fields. But the decision has been taken in Bhubaneswar.“This should be taken at the district level. In a decentralised procurement system, the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS) play a pivotal role and generate tokens for selling of the crop in the market yard. But the tokens are being generated from Bhubaneswar,” he alleged.Bargarh sub-divisional police officer Deepak Kumar Gochhayat said the paddy growers blocked the National Highway- 53 at Attabira for more than five hours. “As the people faced severe difficulties, we were forced to take around 40 farmers into custody to clear the road,” he said.In Sambalpur, the farmers parked their paddy-laden vehicles at Sindurpankh on NH-53, protesting against the “faulty” procurement system and refused to discuss with the district officials.However, police detained at least 15 farmers there to clear the road in the evening.Farmers in Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sonepur and Balangir districts also took out rallies and held sit-ins to protest against the centralised procurement system.Food supplies and consumer welfare minister R P Swain said that some groups with vested interests have been agitating in the name of farmers to disturb the procurement process. He said senior officers of the department have been posted in each district to oversee the process and ensure transparency in the system.“Had the farmers raised the issue at the district level procurement committee (DLPC), the government would have considered their demand. More than 56 per cent paddy has already been procured in 16 districts. It is not possible to revise the decision now,” the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-farmers-block-roads-to-protest-against-centralised-paddy-procurement-system/story-LldyjlkQn99ddCuX44cdqM.html
06-12-2020||India||To ensure peace, Khalsa Fauj forms ring of security at Singhu||Nihang Sikhs or the “Khalsa Fauj” took over the security of farmers at the Singhu border late Friday night, saying they had not come to fight but to ensure peace.Occupying one side of the Sonepat-Delhi highway right next to the police barricades, the men donning blue tunics and large turbans with a chakra (round sharp weapon) around them, and armed with swords, said they had taken positions at the barricades forming a wall between security personnel and farmers protesting peacefully.Camping with 50-60 horses, brought to the Singhu border in trucks from Kudhiana, Ropar and other areas of Punjab, and a northern goshawk — the bird known as baaj in Punjabi associated with the tenth Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh as a symbol of strength and tenacity — the Nihang Sikhs said their presence symbolised safety and security.“We have now camped right at the barricades across which the police force is deployed. If they need to reach out to the peaceful protesters, they will have to go through us. Nihangs mean safety and security. We are here to provide our people safety and we do not mean any harm. We do not endorse violence in any way,” said Gurdeep Singh, a member of the group, from Ludhiana.Condemning the violence that left many protesters injured on the first day of the agitation when police stopped them from marching into the city, he said Nihang groups were spread over the country and assembled whenever required. “We do not want the violence to be repeated. We have our men from Delhi, Haryana and many parts of Punjab joining us. At present, there are about 500 of us,” he said.The horses are tethered next to the concrete barriers placed by police. On a pole, in between, rested the bird, around which the Nihangs were busy preparing their meal of the day. The area where they cook is considered sacred and no one other than a Nihang is allowed near the spot.Another Khalsa fauji (warrior) Aman Singh, from Ropar, said their fight was not a religious one. “We are here to fight for our people’s rights. We have weapons but we will never resort to violence. The weapons symbolise safety. Our presence means that no one will be oppressed or ill-treated.”Another Nihang, Satnam Singh Baaghi, who joined the group from Maharashtra, said there are more of them coming. “Our number will only swell. We will only move forward,” he said.Singh said they were keeping an eye on any anti-social elements who may try to malign the peaceful protest. “Our men are vigilant and we are keeping an eye on anyone who looks like an outsider. They are intercepted and only let in after their credentials are verified,” he added.While Nihangs were spotted only at the Singhu border in a noticeable number, at the Ghazipur protest site too participants sounded concerned about anti-social elements.Digambar Singh, 40, a farmer from Bijnor and president of the UP unit of the Bhartiya Kisan Union’s youth wing, said, “People are trying to politicise the protests. We’ve had political cadres come in and sport caps from farmers’ bodies to mislead public and get their agenda across. Our volunteers keep a strict eye on who is doing what at the protest sites.” While addressing the gathering on the highway, Singh told the farmers that they must be alert and not allow anyone to harm the legitimacy of the agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-ensure-peace-khalsa-fauj-forms-ring-of-security-at-singhu/story-dir6elcChHMugCndToUN7M.html
