The objective, General Rawat added, would be to “counter China’s attempts to dominate the Indo-Pacific region”.In this context, a recent report about the Indian military restructuring the existing 17 single service commands to optimise existing resources and assets merits scrutiny. Since China will remain the primary focus for Indian military planners and the maritime domain is acquiring greater strategic salience, the possible creation of the first Maritime Theatre Command (MTC) with headquarters in Karwar needs to be carefully examined. The report indicates that the final MTC plan has been submitted to the government for approval and, once approved, the new command will be in place within a year. An integrated functional Air Defence Command is also in the pipeline and other commands dedicated to land border threats and other theatres will follow.The MTC is being packaged as part of the long delayed re-wiring of the Indian military, whereby the first ”geographical” theatre command will enable the creation of “an integrated land-air-sea war-fighting machinery for greater combat punch in a more cost-effective manner”.The subtext of this new operational command structure is puzzling. The new MTC is expected to ”subsume” the existing operational commands of the Navy (Western in Mumbai and Eastern in Vizag), the tri-service Andaman & Nicobar command in Port Blair and the Southern Air Command (Thiruvananthapuram). The puzzle increases, for the MTC envisions “service-specific-verticals” whereby air assets (fighter aircraft and cruise missiles) will be under the C-in-C of the Southern Air Command (an Air Marshal), who will, in turn, report to the freshly-minted C-in-C (Vice Admiral) of the MTC. To add to the “combat punch” that is the final objective, the C-in-C of the proposed MTC, as the theatre commander, will report directly to the joint Chiefs of Staff committee led by the CDS.In this new MTC matrix, the CNS (chief of naval staff) is marginalised and the CDS assumes a supra-operational role that was not envisaged in the original conception of this post. Much the same fate awaits the current army and air chiefs when other theatre commands are created.Some basic features of the theatre command merit recall. The United States (US) has such a model where the C-in-C of a theatre command (say the Pacific commander in Hawai) reports directly to the US Secretary of Defence (the equivalent of the Indian Raksha Mantri) without being mediated by a CDS equivalent. Furthermore, theatre commands are premised on the availability of dedicated strike and surveillance assets to the commander. The US model is distinctive given the huge defence allocation and the Pentagon’s operational requirements mandated by geography and geopolitical commitments. And the top brass is groomed at every level to acquire the professional competence to assume multi-domain theatre command responsibilities.None of these characteristics can be currently applied to India and substantive funding for the Indian military over the next five years would be unlikely given the grim fiscal situation due to the Covid-19 convulsion. While seeking tri-service jointness for greater operational efficacy is desirable, it has morphed into what could become unviable theatre commands with meagre trans-border capable platforms/resources.The creation of theatre commands needs to be reviewed holistically and discussed objectively both in Parliament and with professionals who can testify before select committees before embarking upon this restructuring. The Narendra Modi government is to be commended for creating the CDS in the first place but a hasty MTC pursuit could become the equivalent of India’s military demonetisation.Beijing will be watching as to how India will exude “dissuasive deterrence” from Karwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/don-t-rush-into-unviable-theatre-commands-with-skewed-structures/story-5HEIO8bWVrTHxTDhAzS0vN.html
20-12-2020||News||Decoding the dip in public expenditure||Typically, when a crisis hits, the expectation is that the Centre — which has more revenue-raising abilities than states — will take the lead in preparing a fiscal road map, loosen its purse strings and raise expenditure significantly. The Covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented in its scale and impact. But this is also when the government is needed even more.In the initial period when relief measures were the need of the hour, this required ensuring adequate social safety nets. Now, as the economy is opening up, for its multiplier effect on growth, priority needs to be given to infrastructure investments by increasing capital expenditure. The Centre has announced several stimulus packages aimed at doing just that. Unfortunately, a look at the data suggests a difference between rhetoric and reality.First, despite announcements of over ₹20 lakh crore in fiscal packages, total expenditure till October this year increased by only ₹6,550 crore when compared to the same period last year. In fact, as a proportion of its initial Budget Estimate (BE), actual expenditure is lower by five percentage points than the same period last year. A deep-dive into the ministry-wise expenditure data shows that, in terms of the total quantum of funds spent, a staggering 41 out of a total 55 ministries spent less this year till October, compared to last year. The fact that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contraction was less severe in the September quarter than in the first quarter is not because of increased public expenditure, but despite reduced expenditure.Second, low revenues necessitated a repurposing of expenditure. Areas considered essential for dealing with the pandemic such as health, rural livelihood and the public distribution system (PDS) were prioritised. Expectedly, the corresponding ministries constitute nearly 20% of the total central expenditure. But there are some puzzles here too.There remains little doubt that there is an urgent need to expand and universalise the PDS to deal with the severity of the income and hunger crisis. A recent survey conducted by Hunger Watch across 11 states and covering 4,000 respondents found that more than half the surveyed households had no income source since April. As many as 62% households reported reduced incomes. Yet, the department of consumer affairs and public distribution, which is responsible for subsidising foodgrains, till October, spent 9% less this year than in the same period last year. If past trends are anything to go by, further downward adjustments may be seen by the end of the fiscal year.This decline — despite measures to increase PDS entitlements and expand coverage to include 80 million migrant workers — suggests one of two things. Either the Centre has not paid the Food Corporation of India (from where the grains for the public system are procured) its dues, thereby increasing its debt burden, or the subsidy released to states which have opted for decentralised procurement has been cut, adding to the burden on state finances.Similarly, while additional allocations of ₹40,000 crore have been made for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), and this is a welcome step, the scheme is still struggling to meet current demand. As of today, 10 million fewer households have been provided employment than demanded. In fact, with nearly four months remaining in the fiscal year, the relevant ministry is running out of even the additional allocations.Third, capital expenditure plays a key role in promoting growth, but this, too, is not showing a significant increase. In fact, only 47.9% of the year’s target (or BE) has been spent till October, as against 59.5% in FY 2019-20. This expenditure includes loans disbursements, which have naturally seen a substantial rise this year. Even ministries that have large infrastructure-related projects such as the ministry of jal shakti and the ministry of housing and urban affairs have seen over 20 percentage points less expenditure than in the corresponding period in the past.For states, the Centre‘s failure to increase its expenditure spells trouble twice over. Over the years, the Centre has systematically encroached on areas traditionally under the domain of states, including education, health, nutrition, employment, agriculture, through a steady expansion of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs). For fiscally weaker states, these funds, despite the conditions attached to accessing them, have become an important source of non-wage finances. As states spend on welfare provisioning through CSSs, their dependence on the Centre has also increased. Simultaneously, lower tax devolution to state governments has hampered their own ability to increase expenditures. Till October, states had received 19% lower funds than they did for the same period last year.In any country with a federal set-up, and that too one with a centripetal bias such as India, the Centre plays a key role in the social contract between the citizens and the State. Several ground-level surveys along with the government’s own expenditure numbers suggest a failure by the government to live up to its obligations. It’s less than two months to go before the Union government presents its estimates for the current and next fiscal year in Budget 2021. The Centre must present a clear roadmap for the country — one that can balance economic recovery while ensuring redistributive social welfare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/decoding-the-dip-in-public-expenditure/story-1fdmOEEnKTyRHwHdcN9n3L.html
20-12-2020||Delhi||Woman murdered over Rs 2,500 in Kotla Mubarakpur||A 32-year-old woman was killed at an under-construction site in Kotla Mubarakpur on Sunday. Police said the murder happened over a tiff she had with a man, to whom she had lent Rs 2500 and had been asking him to return the money. While the woman was killed on December 11, her decomposed body was discovered six days later on Thursday, said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south). The suspect, Ajay, was arrested after the police’s local enquiry revealed that he was the last person seen with the woman, said Thakur. The victim, Kajal, was a widow who lived with her sister in Kotla Mubarakpur and worked odd jobs. A few months ago, she had lent R2,500 to a local man named Ajay who is a labourer. Police have identified Ajay and Kajal only by their first names. “For the past few days, she was repeatedly asking Ajay to return her money. But Ajay didn’t have money to return and was going on seeking an extension for the deadline,” said another police officer who didn’t want to be identified. Police said Ajay decided kill her instead of returning the money. “On Thursday, he called the woman to an under-construction site in the same neighborhood on the pretext of returning the money. There, he strangled her to death and then crushed her face with a stone in a bid to hide her identity,” the officer said. He then covered her face with a cloth and fled the spot. The body lay there undetected and decomposing for six days, said the officer. When the body was finally discovered on Sunday, the investigators found no documents to identify the woman. Local enquiry, however, helped ascertain her identity after which the police began checking for people who may have seen anyone with her. That finally helped the police zero down on Ajay and arrest him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/woman-murdered-over-rs-2-500-in-kotla-mubarakpur/story-8f8fPu2izp5Mv2iClpDlWI.html

20-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Mahagun Moderne residents protest against AOA, demands election||NOIDA: A group of residents of Mahagun Moderne housing society in Sector 78 on Sunday protested against the apartment owners association (AOA), demanding fresh elections to form a new executive body. However, AOA office bearers alleged that the protest is backed by the developer who does not want to hand over the maintenance of the society.Protesters shouting slogans against AOA carried out a march in the society, demanding immediate action from the Noida authority. “For the past three years, no election has taken place in our society. We want democratically elected AOA that looks after the maintenance in the society. We are not satisfied with the maintenance by the current AOA. We hope the authority will look into this issue,” said Himanshu Shekhar Singh, a resident of society.The residents alleged that the existing AOA office bearers are “hand in glove” with the developer and not practising transparency in their conduct. “There is no transparency in keeping the accounts of our society. And if we dare to question, then AOA office bearers use foul language and misbehave,” said Indrani Mukherjee, another resident.However, AOA refuted all the allegations. “We have fought against the developer and won a case for the welfare of the society. In compliance with Allahabad high court’s order on November 18, 2019, the Noida authority ordered the developer to hand over maintenance to AOA and Rs 20 crore interest-free maintenance security (IFMS). A handful of residents want to stop that ongoing process to benefit developer. The majority of residents are with us. And we are ready for elections once the handover process is over,” said Sandeep Chauhan, president of AOA of Mahagun Moderne. “We will file a defamation case against those, who are throwing mud on us,” said Chauhan.Amit Jain, promoter of Mahagun, said that they are not supporting any of the side. “We could not hand over the maintenance because of issues in AOA. But we will take steps to implement the Noida authority’s order on handing over the maintenance as per rules,” said The Noida authority CEO, Ritu Maheshwari, said, “Once the case is decided by the authority, then it is closed from our side.”The developer, Mahagun, had started offering possession to buyers in 2018. An AOA was elected in 2018 for this society, which had 2,700 flats spread over an area of 25 acres. However, maintenance has not been handed over yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-mahagun-moderne-residents-protest-against-aoa-demands-election/story-aa8KqwVjazkdRbQXLAtQ9N.html
20-12-2020||Delhi||13-year-old gang raped by four in Greater Kailash||A 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by four people, including her minor friend, in the servants’ quarters of a building in south Delhi’s Greater Kailash on Saturday, the Delhi Police said on Sunday, after nabbing all the suspects. The victim is physically out of danger and is being counselled, the police said. The girl, who lives in a slum in south Delhi, had been working as a domestic help in one of the houses in Greater Kailash for the past four months, said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south). The minor boy, who is 17-year-old, had briefly worked with the victim before quitting around a month ago.

On Saturday evening, the boy called the victim to meet him in the servants’ quarters of a house in Greater Kailash. “Three men, Shivam, Hari Shankar and Mangesh, were already present there when the girl reached the place. They all offered the girl something to drink, after which she fell unconscious,” said the DCP quoting the survivor. In the early hours of Sunday, when she regained consciousness, she got to know that the minor boy and three others had gang raped her. She returned home and narrated the incident to her mother, upon which a call to the police control room (PCR) was made. The police then sent the victim for a medical examination, the report of which is awaited.A case of gang rape, wrongful confinement and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered at the Greater Kailash police station. “We arrested the three adult suspects and the victim’s minor friend was apprehended from the locality soon after receiving the complaint,” the officer said.

20-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Three held for duping over 450 people on pretext of govt jobs||Noida: Three people, including two contractual clerks with the primary education office in Greater Noida, were nabbed by the Noida police for allegedly duping more than 450 people on the pretext of helping them get government jobs.The suspects have been identified as Brajesh Kumar Verma, Mahesh Patel and Rajveer. Patel and Rajveer were clerks with the additional Basic Shiksha Adhikari (BSA) office in Dankaur, the police said.According to the police, the scam started in 2007 when Verma registered a fake NGO in Prayagraj. Over the years he opened seven offices in as many districts of the state, including one in Gautam Budh Nagar, they said.Verma is a science graduate who would run an optician shop in Rae Bareilly and also fought 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the police said, adding that he duped unemployed people of Rs 25-30 lakh for the election cost.“In October this year, he opened a training centre in Sector 22 to make women self-reliant. He obtained a fake letter from the state government using which he would contact government schools where he would pretend to organize training seminars for low-level administration jobs, investigation officers, beauticians, and tailors, among others,” said Luv Kumar, joint commissioner of police (law and order), GB Nagar.Verma would offer fake certificates and joining letters to the victims and collect various amounts as security money.“He would then tell the victims that they were at adhoc positions. A few months later, he would change base and use a different name in a different city,” said Kumar.Police officials suspect that he has duped at least 100 people in Noida so far, around 50 in Ghaziabad and more than 300 in other districts. The suspect was planning a new centre in Delhi in January but had been denied permission because of Covid restrictions, the officials said.The police said that by using his luxury office in Sector 22, he was on his way to obtain a Rs 25 lakh fund from NABARD in January on pretext of opening a farmer’s club and Haat bazaar. An inspection of the site had already been done by government officials.“He would also get demand letters from government schools and then share this with the state government. He was trying for a Rs 1 crore fund from the state welfare board as well,” said the joint CP.The officials said that he has already gone to jail in 2011 and 2013 in Mainpuri and Fatehpur districts, respectively. A probe is underway to identify how he was able to carry on with the scam even after being arrested twice, they said.The police said that at least five other people, some of them principals of government schools, are involved in the racket, and efforts are on to arrest them.Rajveer’s wife had also been appointed as a coordinating officer to bring in candidates but police said that she was unaware of the scam while Rajveer and Patel were both bringing in victims.The suspects were booked for cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy. Several sets of fake certificates, documents, phones, and Rs 41,500 were recovered from them, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-three-held-for-duping-over-450-people-on-pretext-of-govt-jobs/story-fqmRAgwlvh54x6vqXx3n9L.html
20-12-2020||Noida||Temporary relief from cold wave||Noida: As the city continues to shiver for the fifth day in row due to cold wave, the weather department has predicted that the minimum temperature will spike slightly on Monday providing temporary relief.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the maximum temperature will hover around 21 degrees Celsius for the week, the minimum temperature may rise by two to three degrees on Monday. However, the mercury will start falling again with icy cold winds, leading to another spell of cold wave and cold day from Wednesday, IMD said. “The wind directions have temporarily changed due to the western disturbance from north-westerly to westerly and south-westerly. This has led to slight rise in the mercury. The minimum temperatures will rise till Tuesday, but temperatures will start falling from Wednesday again and hover around 4 degrees Celsius returning the cold waves,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.He said that the sky will be clear from Tuesday, leading to better sunlight and warmer day or higher day time temperatures.“The cold wave conditions will return from Wednesday onwards. However, the cold day condition will not persist unlike this week as the maximum temperatures will be around the season’s average due to clear sky,” added Srivastava.On Sunday, the minimum temperature for Noida was recorded at 6 degrees Celsius, against 5.1 degrees Celsius a day earlier. While the maximum temperature was recorded at 21.6 degrees Celsius, against 21.1 a day earlier.Meanwhile, the average minimum for NCR, based on the Safadarjung observatory, was recorded at 3.4 degrees Celsius, against 3.9 degrees Celsius a day earlier. On Monday, the minimum and maximum temperatures are likely to hover around 6 degrees and 22 degrees Celsius, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/temporary-relief-from-cold-wave/story-TIQPROFf4JSCCeMVyKgNgO.html
20-12-2020||Noida||Air quality in Noida and Ghaziabad slips again, enters ‘very poor’ zone||Noida: The air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad slipped to ‘very-poor’ levels again on Sunday due to unfavourable weather conditions. The three cities’ air had been oscillating around ‘poor’ levels since December 14. According to the weather analysts, the wind speed dropped and humidity spiked on Sunday, leading to better hold of the pollutants thereby spiking the pollution levels. “The wind speed on Sunday was around 12-13 kmph, slightly lower than past few days due to the western disturbance. The wind speed will drop further from December 22 onwards,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD).According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Sunday was 333 against 301 a day earlier and 288 on Friday. Greater Noida’s AQI was 346 against 292 on Saturday and 297 on Friday. The AQI of Ghaziabad also worsened from poor to very poor category on Sunday. Its AQI was 346 against 295 on Saturday and 304 on Friday. The AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. The fine particles or PM2.5 levels also spiked and are currently two to three times higher than the standards. On Sunday, PM2.5 for past 24 hours in Noida was recorded at 169.36 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³) against 156.41 µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 197.80 µg/m³ against 149.72 a day earlier, while the same for Ghaziabad also increased to 204.18 µg/m³ against 162.03 µg/m³ on Saturday. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 µg/m³.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), AQI is likely to worsen further due to poor ventilation factors. “The overall air quality is at the lower end of the ‘Very Poor’ category. Surface-level winds are moderate and west south-westerly. The cold day conditions are forecasted to intensify and surface winds are likely to slow down. So the current better dispersion conditions are likely to decrease. Hence, AQI is forecasted to deteriorate to middle end of Very Poor category on 21st December, and further deteriorate to the higher end of Very Poor on 22nd Dec and further deteriorate by 23rd Dec,” said the SAFAR statement on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-quality-in-noida-and-ghaziabad-slips-again-enters-very-poor-zone/story-YZYE4qtfVu2DO2HBLeabiJ.html
20-12-2020||Noida||Three Madhya Pradesh Police personnel among five arrested in Noida over robbery of service pistol||Noida: Noida Police arrested three policemen from Madhya Pradesh claiming that they had extorted people under investigation. The alleged extortion was discovered when one of the suspect policemen lost his licensed firearm and the Noida Police were called to investigate.The policemen -- two sub-inspectors Rashid Parvez Khan and Pankaj Sahu and a constable -- were part of the MP cybercell department. The name of a fourth member of the team was not disclosed as police did not consider him a suspect. On December 18, Khan had his gun snatched when five unidentified men scuffled with the team in Noida sector 18.When Noida Police investigated the case, they discovered that the cyber police team were in Noida on a case and were extorting the suspects in that case.“An eyewitness had video recorded the final moments of the robbery and shared it with us. We were able to note the licence plate of the getaway vehicle and traced it to a Delhi-based woman. Her husband was a friend of the man the MP police was investigating,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.The MP Police team arrived in Noida on December 15 to investigate a ponzi scheme case. They suspects in the case were brothers Suryabhan and Shashikant Yadav, who were residents of Sector 12 and worked from Sector 62, police said.“The case was filed by a man named Chandraketu Dubey in Jabalpur. He claimed to have had lost around ₹2.5 lakh to the duo. During the probe, MP Police had frozen a bank account associated with the brothers with ₹58 lakh in it,” said Gautam Budh Nagar joint commissioner of police, law and order, Luv Kumar.On December 16, the MP Police team allegedly visited Suryabhan at his office and took him for questioning in an SUV and roamed around in Delhi. In a public park in Mahipalpur, the three policemen allegedly started extorting him.“Suryabhan transferred ₹1.7 lakh into a Jabalpur account after threats from the police. Over the next two days, he borrowed ₹3 lakh in cash and handed it over to the three. They also had him transfer bitcoins worth ₹24 lakh in Chandraketu’s account which were then transferred to constable Khan’s account,” said the DCP.Police said that on December 18, the team allegedly came to a bank to released Shashikant’s account apparently to withdra more money.“Suryabhan had shared his ordeal with the Delhi-based friend who then decided to take matters into his own hands. Along with four accomplices, they reached sector 18 in his wife’s car and confronted the officers. During the scuffle, the fled with S-I Khan’s gun,” said the joint CP. This forced S-I Khan to approach the Noida Police.Noida Police said there had been inconsistencies in the statements of the visiting policemen and the video helped them put the pieces together.The three policemen, and brothers Shashikant and Suryabhan were arrested on December 19 from near the sector 18 metro station, said police. They were booked under sections 395 (punishment for dacoity), 384 (punishment for extortion), 120b (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.Police said that the persons who robbed the pistol were yet to be apprehended.

20-12-2020||Chandigarh||Military Lit Fest: ‘Govt lacked political will to resolve Khalistan issue’||The rise of militancy in Punjab and its tragic fallout in the assassination of the then prime minister Indira Gandhi and the anti-Sikh riots have important lessons. All critical decisions of governments should be addressed politically and not by force, said panellists discussing the book, The Khalistan Conspiracy by former RAW officer GBS Sidhu at the concluding day of the Military Literature Festival on Sunday.In a session moderated by GS Aujla, former Indian Police Service officer, Sidhu spoke to panellists MPS Aulakh, former director general of police and Jagtar Singh, journalist.Sidhu, who played a key role in the inclusion of Sikkim into the Indian Territory, recalled the rise of militancy in Punjab and abroad, especially in Canada and other European countries, where Sikhs migrated during the 1970s.He also touched upon the efforts of the then Union government to resolve the problem.To this, Aujla said , the ‘issue’ had not been addressed at the political level at that time and was a great lesson in how political will was lacking in that period to sort out matters.Aulakh, who had held prominent positions in the Intelligence Bureau at that time illustrated a series of events of that period.Speaking on the occasion, Jagtar Singh said the Indian government should have released papers related to that period for a clearer picture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/military-lit-fest-govt-lacked-political-will-to-resolve-khalistan-issue/story-Lwaf2xaQQ4K1v0kDJX0LcN.html
20-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Hospitals with over 100 beds to be made Covid-19 vaccination centres||NOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has decided to make all the government and private hospitals – having more than 100 beds – the centres for the different phases of Covid-19 vaccination in the district. GB Nagar district chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that the decision was taken in the meeting held on Saturday with the office bearers of Noida chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA). “It is mandatory for the hospitals to have three separate rooms for the vaccination purpose. While the first one will be the waiting room, the second and third rooms will be for vaccination and post-immunization assessment,” he said. Health officials said that about 21,500 doctors and other medical staff will get Covid-19 vaccines in the first phase of the immunisation drive in the district. Ohri further said that there will be separate entry and exit points at all the vaccination centres. “The health department will keep the name, address and mobile number of every person, who’ll get the shots in the first phase,” he said. The CMO further said that the district will have 13 cold storage points where vaccines can be stored, besides a vaccine depot at his office. “Following the instructions by the district administration, the health department has identified 73 centres where the vaccination will take place. We have already prepared a list of 21,543 doctors and other medical staff, who will be inoculated in the first phase. It will be followed by vaccination of employees of the authorities, armed forces, mediapersons and police personnel in the second place. In the third and last phase, people above the age of 50 years will get the shot. However, we’ll begin the registration process for the second and third phases of vaccination, once getting the detailed guidelines in this connection from the government,” he said. Ohri also said that besides district’s Covid-19 integrated call centre at Sector 59, a team of doctors will be deployed at every primary health centre (PHC) and community health centre (CHC) to monitor the vaccination process. “We’ll put life support ambulances at all these spots to tackle any emergency situation,” he said. Dr NK Sharma, president of the Noida Chapter of IMA, said that the association “has asked all its members to provide full support to the Covid-9 immunisation drive in the district”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-hospitals-with-over-100-beds-to-be-made-covid-19-vaccination-centres/story-BfSWUyfaDtQ2cKZfMcmoGP.html
20-12-2020||Mumbai||Mutual funds can help fund your retirement||When it comes to mutual funds, two things stop people: Either they are not planning for their retirement, or they prefer to invest in fixed interest instruments that promise capital protection, though the earnings may be relatively low compared to financial tools like mutual funds that are inherently volatile. Now, caution is always a good thing, but unless you make adequate investments in the present — despite the risk — your retirement is likely to be a financial mess. So let’s address the how. A lot depends on your investment objective. What is the corpus you want to create? What is your tolerance for risk? And, crucially, how many years are left till your retirement? Experts suggest the following: Pick a figure: Unless you have decided your retirement corpus, hitting on the right mutual fund is not possible. It’s called having a financial goal. And you can have more than one. Another way of looking at this is to think of the milestones you want to achieve, like retiring at 40 or an making an emergency fund for contingencies. Adhil Shetty, Chief Executive Officer, BankBazaar, an online marketplace for financial products, puts this in perspective and said, “Investing is not about putting funds in a bucket and forgetting about it. The entire point of investing is to ensure you have funds for your life goals. So you need to plan your investments just like your life goals and give them enough time to grow.” Judge your appetite: All investment involves risk. Choose among mutual funds investing in stocks, debts, government securities, or commodities markets depending on your risk appetite. A way to judge the risk level of a mutual fund is to check how frequently its returns change every year. Mutual funds with large variation in returns are deemed more risky owing to their fluctuating performance. Higher risk means increased volatility of returns. Know the expense ratio: Asset management companies charge money to run mutual funds. A percentage of the asset’s value goes towards the payment of fees and operational expenses of such companies. Expense ratio refers to the per unit cost incurred for managing a mutual fund scheme. It’s important that you invest in mutual funds with lower expense ratios said Sahil Arora, director (Investments), Paisabazaar.com, a virtual debt syndication service. “As the operating expenses of a fund are met from the assets managed by it, a lower expense ratio would mean that most of your money would remain invested in the fund,” he said. The ideal expense ratio is somewhere between 0.5 per cent and 0.75 per cent. An expense ratio more than 1.5 per cent is considered high. In some mutual funds like debt funds, which have limited chances of giving high returns it pays better to keep the expense ratio low. Avoid high turnover rates: Did you know that the turnover rate of an MF portfolio matters? Turnover ratio refers to the percentage of the portfolio bought and sold every year. Kaustubh Belapurkar, director (Portfolio Specialist), Morningstar India, an investment research and management services firm said, “You can find the portfolio turnover ratio in the monthly factsheet and the annual report. A higher number indicates significant changes are being made in the portfolio, which could indicate an inconsistent investment process or change in investment strategy.” There is no ideal turnover ratio for an MF. However, if a mutual fund is turning over at a rate between 20 per cent and 30 per cent, you might want to pay closer attention to how the fund is being managed. Diversity always pays: Do not invest all your earnings in one mutual fund alone. If you are unsure of how the stock market works, investing in diverse mutual funds helps. Raj Khosla, founder and managing director, MyMoneyMantra.com, a financial services marketplace said, “A well-diversified portfolio includes a dash of equity, debt funds as well as cash equivalents. Never put all eggs in one basket.” What’s more, the market value of your assets matters. A greater fund size, i.e Assets under Management or the total market value of the assets managed under the mutual fund depicts more trust by investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mutual-funds-can-help-fund-your-retirement/story-yeiNJC83ffn9pbUOmblvBP.html

In the circular dated December 18, DGCA stated asymptomatic pilots will undergo home isolation for 10 days, and on completion of this period, the crew can be declared fit for unrestricted flying, provided their clinical parameters are normal. In case of positive mildly symptomatic air crew, the period will be extended by three more days. These crew members will be discharged only if they do not have fever for the three days after the initial 10 days since the onset of symptoms. However, the ones in isolation for more than 14 days will be examined by DGCA-empanelled class-1 examiner who will provide a cure certificate. They will also require opinion of a specialist concerned. Once such crew are declared fit to fly by the examiner, they will be allowed to fly again..Positive moderately/ severely symptomatic air crew will have to undergo special medical examination at one of the IAF boarding centres and will require a cure certificate. The circular read, “Such pilots can be considered for unrestricted flying provided their clinical examination and laboratory investigations reveal no finding that can cause a functional deficit. Once declared ‘fit for flying’ at the IAF boarding centre, the air crew can commence flying only after DGCA medical assessment is issued.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dgca-gets-stricter-with-isolation-norms-for-air-crew/story-T0mZIFY1nxcLNaG93IpsaM.html
20-12-2020||Mumbai||FYJC admissions: Special round on December 24, 1.85 lakh seats vacant||The Maharashtra education department will declare the special merit list for admissions to first-year junior colleges (FYJC) in the city at 11am on December 24. Every student who wishes to participate in the round has to give consent in the portal which would ensure that students who have secured admissions elsewhere are not allotted seats again. According to the data shared by the department, after the third admission round which concluded on Friday, nearly 1.85 lakh seats remain vacant in colleges across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) which will be available in the special admission round. This includes nearly 37,000 seats from various quotas such as minority, management and in-house quotas which remained vacant after the three admission rounds and were surrendered. In the special round, students who were restricted to participate in the earlier rounds will also be allowed to participate. This includes students who had got the college of their first preference but failed to take admission there. Students who are allotted colleges under the special round can secure their admissions by December 26. The education department has said that it will declare the further admission schedule as per the requirement and government approval after the special round. The department has also said that it would start bifocal admissions soon. Meanwhile, junior colleges which have completed more than 75% admissions can start their online classes. Colleges, however, said they were hoping for some clarity on the academic calendar. “Since the year has begun so late, we are hoping to get some clarity on how to conduct exams, whether there will be further syllabus reduction, etc” said a principal of a suburban college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fyjc-admissions-special-round-on-december-24-1-85-lakh-seats-vacant/story-Ft0YemJB8uSgvhidoEJNIL.html

The police said they want to connect with youngsters to increase their knowledge and awareness about criminal laws and the impact of pressing issues such as cyber crime and drug abuse. It is a structured programme to build a productive rapport with the youth, save them from self-destructive behaviour and help them in realising their potential, said the police. A group of 100 students will be enrolled for the programme in one batch and they will be counselled about new career opportunities generated by technological changes and the policies and programmes of the government. OP Singh, Faridabad commissioner of police, said that the programme is scheduled daily between 10am to 11am for 3,000 people, who would be enrolled from Monday onwards. “Case studies of incidental offenders of hurt and affray cases registered in 2020 will be discussed. Participants will be taught anger management through exercise and self-awareness sessions. Also their trainings will be conducted at police stations,” he said. The programme is for students to help them find their strength through online aptitude tests and plan their career accordingly, said the police. The police said a leadership training program, which is a part of the plan, will help the participants to develop core competency like documentation, networking and project delivery that they need to carry on with their voluntary work. Singh said this programme will help aspiring sportspersons and cultural artists to steer clear of doping and unfair practices. “The slum dwellers and poor people will be taught how to avoid being plundered by spurious financers. We will involve all village sarpanches to motivate them to integrate youth development activities in panchayat-led village development programmes,” he said. The programme will also encourage people for voluntary compliance to law and will sensitise them about the hazards of breaking laws, officials said.

20-12-2020||Gurugram||Farmers hold tribute meeting for protestors who died during course of agitation||Farmers protesting along the Delhi-Jaipur national highway against the new farm laws paid homage to their fellow protesters, who have died during the agitation until now. A tribute meeting was held on Sunday, during which farmers remembered the sacrifices of their counterparts, observed silence for two minutes and took a vow to continue their agitation against the laws. Farmers from states such as Rajasthan, Haryana and Gujarat have been protesting at Jaisinghpura-Khera (near Shahajahanpur) on the Delhi-Jaipur highway since the past eight days after the Rewari Police stopped them from proceeding towards Delhi. Farmers across the country have been protesting against the three newly enacted farm laws. They fear that the new laws will put them at the mercy of large corporations and put an end to the minimum support price (MSP) they receive on important crops Sanjay Madhav, the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that the tribute meeting was held in remembrance of 29 farmers who have died during the course of agitation. “During this movement, 29 farmers have died across the country. Today, we paid tribute to them and took a pledge to continue our movement until the laws are repealed,” said Madhav. Blaming the Central government for the deaths, the protesting farmers said that they had been compelled to protest on the streets due to the anti-farmer laws. “The protesting farmers who have died until now are martyrs for us. It is unfortunate that they are no longer with us. They died due to accidents, diseases and the freezing cold while participating in the farmers’ movement,” said the union of farmer leaders, adding that the sacrifices of the farmers will not go in vain. On Sunday, three different contingents of supporters joined the protest. These included members of Bhim Army, Bawal Khap Panchayat, Rajasthan Jat Mahasabha and Rajasthan Teachers Association (Shekhawat). Members of these organisations have joined the ongoing agitation at the protest site. Ranjit Singh Raju, coordinator of Grameen Kisan Mazdoor Samiti, one of the farmers body under the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, said that a decision had been taken to keep Haryana toll free between December 25 and 27. “We remember the sacrifices of the protesting farmers who have died so far. We hold the government responsible for these deaths. The government says that the laws were made for farmers but farmers were not consulted before doing so. Why were these anti-farmer laws made? Today, we are on the streets to protest against the three laws and we hold the government responsible for this,” said Raju.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-hold-tribute-meeting-for-protestors-who-died-during-course-of-agitation/story-4ocnkt5GbgRXyWBrqtOLpK.html
20-12-2020||Gurugram||DTCP proposes to raise penalties for violators of building norms||To curb violations of building norms by property owners, the department of town and country planning(DTCP) has proposed to increase the penalties manifold to ensure strong deterrence. In a proposal submitted by DTCP, Gurugram, to its headquarters in Chandigarh, the department has also called for increasing the penalty for home owners, who misuse their premises for commercial purposes. The letter written by department proposes that penalty for misusing residential premises for commercial purposes should be raised from ₹630 per square metres to ₹6,778 per square metres (sq m). It has also proposed that the bank guarantee furnished by the owner for a period of one year should be raised from ₹1,260 per sq m to ₹13,557 sq m. DTCP officials said earlier there were no provisions for penalising home owners, who made additions and alterations or indulged in excess coverage and zoning violations in plotted colonies after obtaining the occupancy certificate(OC). Officials could have only demanded a restoration of the violations.RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram, said that the department has now proposed that apart from removing violations, they propose to impose penalty at the rate of ₹1,260 per sq m on plot area. The bank guarantee, which has to be furnished for a year, has been proposed at ₹1,260 per sq m on plot area. The department has also proposed that shop owners in commercial complexes, who encroach common areas, there shall be a deterrent penalty of ₹1,260 per sq m.“The purpose of these measures is to ensure that property owners, who engage in repeated violations, such as operating guest houses and building beyond permissible limits, are deterred” said RS Bhath, district town planner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-proposes-to-raise-penalties-for-violators-of-building-norms/story-cMjoNtgZbqx4NwPzx1DpkJ.html
20-12-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram sees warmer days as cold wave conditions abate||Following the recent cold wave, which saw temperatures in the city plunge to as low as four degrees Celsius (minimum) and 13.1 degrees Celsius (maximum), the city is now seeing warmer days. On Sunday, Gurugram recorded a maximum temperature of 21 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature stood at six degrees Celsius. These readings are the highest in over two weeks. According to the India Meteorological Department(IMD), however, a western disturbance is expected to pass over north India on December 22, which may cause isolated rainfall in some parts, bringing back cold wave conditions to the plains.“Cold wave conditions have abated in most parts of northwest India. There is clear sunshine, which is able to warm the surface. The layer of fog has moved away. We are expecting a western disturbance to impact the region around December 22, when moisture will increase and dense fog is likely to envelope the entire region. Cold wave conditions might return,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre at IMD.As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Gurugram, shallow to moderate episodes of fog and mist during the early morning hours are expected to persist until at least December 26. Officials said this was due to a high level of humidity, which has set in after the passage of a previous western disturbance about 10 days ago. Under the influence of cold winds from the snow-laden Himalayas, which are sweeping across the plains, this moisture leads to foggy conditions, which dissipate later in the day, under the influence of clear skies. Gurugram recorded relative humidity at 94% on Sunday evening.Air quality in the city, meanwhile, remained in the “poor” category of the air quality index (AQI) bulletin for the fifth consecutive day, recording 262 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily air quality index(AQI). “Despite being in the middle of winter, when pollution levels typically become severe, we are feeling the influence of strong northwestern winds, which keep pollutants from gathering. If it rains this week, the AQI may even come down to the upper end of the ‘moderate’ category,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-sees-warmer-days-as-cold-wave-conditions-abate/story-yJSxCgHoXz0nfxJBoxB3JM.html
20-12-2020||Gurugram||For the first time since September, district sees two consecutive zero fatality days in Gurugram; less than 1,000 cases reported in the last week||In the seven days from December 14, Gurugram recorded less than 1,000 new cases of Covid-19, as against 2,099 the week earlier.This is the lowest seven-day aggregate of new infections in at least four months. Gurugram has also reported no new Covid-19 related deaths over two days, a first since September. Before these two days, Gurugram’s last zero-fatality day was October 18.Officials said the trend indicated a significant slowdown in the transmission of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, among the community. “We are now in a similar situation as in September. We are seeing fewer deaths, fewer cases requiring intensive care, and the positivity rate is also improving day-by-day. It’s hard to pinpoint the precise reason behind this slowdown, but it is plausible that a large number of people have already been exposed to the virus and have acquired immunity while being asymptomatic,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram, but adding that it would take a serosurvey to establish that.As per the last serosurvey in October, nearly 26 percent of Gurugram’s urban population had developed antibodies against Covid-19 (up from 14 percent in August). In the district’s rural blocks, the seropositivity increased from 6 percent to 10 percent between August and October. “Now it may be one in every three or two people, perhaps, who have been exposed. The seropositivity would have certainly gone up, but only a proper survey can help us determine whether herd immunity is responsible for the deceleration in new cases,” Sharma said. The district’s weekly test-positivity rate, meanwhile, dropped to 3.5 percent in the week ending December 20 (as against 7 percent the week prior), while the number of deaths also reduced, from 12 deaths to seven deaths. The district over the past week tested 27,155 new samples for Covid-19, of which 4002 tests were conducted on Sunday. Over 90 percent of all daily tests are being conducted via the gold-standard RT-PCR method, while the remaining are rapid antigen tests.The total number of active patients in the district stands at 1512 (down from 2,250 a week ago). These comprise about 4 percent of Gurugram’s total Covid-19 caseload (55766 infections) so far, indicating a recovery rate just over 96 percent. Of the active cases, 1365 are currently under home isolation, while 143 are in hospitals. Another four active patients are under observation at district Covid care centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/for-the-first-time-since-september-district-sees-two-consecutive-zero-fatality-days-in-gurugram-less-than-1-000-cases-reported-in-the-last-week/story-MkPkCS12yJUdvtmmOKoeZO.html
20-12-2020||Gurugram||Health minister’s progress satisfactory: doctors||Gurugram health minister Anil Vij is recovering well from Covid-19, said doctors on Sunday. Vij, 67, had been admitted to the ICU at Medanta Hospital on December 15 with Covid-19 induced pneumonia. He had initially been admitted to PGIMS Rohtak on December 12, but was later transferred.As per a statement released to the press by Dr A K Dubey, the medical superintendent at Medanta Hospital, the health minister’s blood reports showed consistent improvements, while his oxygen requirement has also been reducing. On Sunday, he was examined by a group of doctors, including district chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav, senior director of internal medicine at Medanta Dr Sushila Kataria and senior director of respiratory and sleep medicine Dr Anand Jaiswal.The minister is under observation in the intensive care unit and continues to make steady progress, said Dubey. Vij’s blood pressure, kidney and liver function also continue to be normal.A slew of political leaders have been treated at Medanta for Covid-19 over the past few months, including home minister Amit Shah, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and former chief minister OP Chautala. BJP MLA Kiran Maheshwari and Congress leader Ahmed Patel were also admitted there, but succumbed to the illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-minister-s-progress-satisfactory-doctors/story-wAiD8dhOenURV6HcQDyvhP.html
20-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG issues over 400 notices for violations related to Grap measures||The civil defence team of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has issued more than 400 notices over the last one month for violations related to Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) rules, said officials on Sunday.On November 15, the MCG formed civil defence teams to increase surveillance on Grap violations. It is the first time that the civic body has used civil defence teams for this purpose.Initially, the teams were made up of around 70 volunteers. Over the last two weeks, the number of volunteers in the teams has increased to 600 and so has the issuance of notices.“Overall, more than 400 notices have been issued by us. Most of them have been issued over the last two weeks following the increase in the number of volunteers and after a more stringent policy was adopted,” said Mohit Sharma, chief warden, civil defence teams, MCG.Sharma further said that there has been a change in the pattern of surveillance, which has also led to higher enforcement.“Earlier, we were mainly focusing on looking out for Grap violations at construction sites. Now, we are also focussing on spotting Grap violations at eateries, where the practice of burning wood or coal is common,” said Sharma.In the notices, civil defence teams attach the photo of the violation as evidence and register the name and address details of the offender. The same is then uploaded on the MCG app, and enforcement wing officials on the ground are alerted about the offence.Based on the notices, enforcement wing officials visit the site of violation at random, to spot repeat offences and accordingly issue fines.“The notices serve as a formal warning from the administration that a repeat offence will lead to the issuance of fines and even an FIR. We have observed that, in most cases, after the issuance of notices, the offender does not commit a repeat offence as he or she is wary of the consequences,” said Chahat Sanghvi, consultant, MCG commissioner office.Sanghvi explained that the notices are the first line of action against Grap violations.“The MCG has been actively trying to encourage the participation of citizens in the fight against air pollution. We realised that the entire operation should be a collective responsibility and not be solely carried out by a single agency. Hence, the MCG has formed civil defence teams, who have been given formal training by the civic body officials for greater supervision of Grap violations,” said Sanghvi.The MCG increased its Grap enforcement this month after it realised that there has been a 58% drop in issuance of Grap-related fines.As per official MCG data, between October 15 and December 1 this year, the MCG had issued only 267 fines for Grap violations. In the same time period last year, the civic bod had issued 643 fines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-issues-over-400-notices-for-violations-related-to-grap-measures/story-yVwzXre8egy1VvM4IGuFyK.html
20-12-2020||City||Gurugram police launches drive to prevent accidents due to foggy weather||The police launched an awareness drive on Sunday to reduce the number of road accidents due to poor visibility as a result of fog. Police personnel from all police stations have been deployed on a 33km stretch on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, starting from the defunct Sirhaul toll plaza to Bilaspur toll plaza as a part of the drive, said the police. As per the police, precautions have been taken to ensure that no trucks are stationed on the highway that can lead to accidents.KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that many a time, truck drivers park on the roadside near dhabas on the expressway. This leads to accidents as vehicles plying at a high speed cannot make out parked vehicles from a distance and collide with them. “The stretch has witnessed about 160 fatal accidents in the last three years. It is regularly used by motorists coming from and going towards Delhi and Jaipur on NH-8. The lack of street lights makes the stretch prone to accidents and crimes,” he said. Rao said they have urged drivers to turn lights to low beam during fog as it is easier for others to see them.High beams are less effective during foggy weather conditions. The stretch is also notorious for carjacking cases. According to police data, half a dozen carjacking cases have been reported on the stretch in the last ten months. Most of the accidents on the stretch leave vehicles damaged beyond repair. With winter setting in, foggy weather is likely to increase the chances of accidents, said the police.Rajesh Kumar, a daily commuter, said, “While the motor vehicles still have effective headlights, it is the cyclists and pedestrians who suffer the most in the absence of proper street lights on this stretch.” Patrolling vehicles have visited dhabas and told owers not to allow trucks to park on the service lanes. “If any truck is found parked near dhabas, the owners will be penalised,” said Rao. The police said they are requesting commuters to keep a good distance between moving vehicles and have requested civil agencies to paint lines on the road as a guide when the visibility is extremely poor. People were also instructed to avoid using mobile phones and music systems while driving. Rao said the drivers will be asked not to overtake on the highway and to be careful while changing lanes. Sarika Panda Bhatt, road safety expert, said that visibility is the key to avoid road accidents in foggy weather. Improving visibility of vehicles and infrastructure through retro-reflective tape, street lights, markings, cat-eye installation, etc. is very important in the current situation, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-police-launches-drive-to-prevent-accidents-due-to-foggy-weather/story-Yyn0TZNHTOBKBErC3HhMjN.html

Soon, however, she lost consciousness after she saw her home, with her wedding dress, jewellery and money, in flames and had to be taken to hospital.The fire department was informed about the blaze at about 3.29 pm and it took four fire tenders two hours to put it out. ‘How will my daughter get married now?’“Nothing is left. I don’t know how my daughter will get married,” said Rupali’s mother Kalawati as she sifted through the ashes to collect remnants of the jewellery, which had melted into lumps.“My family was about to apply mehndi on my hands when we saw our jhuggi on fire. I barely managed to rush out,” said Rupali, who was later released from hospital.The wedding guests too escaped and the family managed to pull out the gas cylinders right on time from the hut.

20-12-2020||City||Ludhiana: Riding gets bumpy on Sherpur Chowk slip road||Bumpy rides have become a daily hassle for commuters due to the poor condition of the slip road alongside the Panipat-Jalandhar National Highway-44. The road starting from Sherpur Chowk has been in a state of disrepair for a long time, forcing commuters to take sharp turns to avoid running into the potholes and dilapidated patches. The situation gets worse during peak hours as a number of vehicles get stuck in potholes, leading to traffic snarls.To top it all, parking of commercial vehicles, including trucks and auto-rickshaws, adds to the chaos. SPS Hospital’s public relations officer Lakhvir Singh Namdhari said that a number of times, they have brought the problem to the notice of the authorities, but to no avail.“The broken road is also leading to a number of accidents,” said Namdhari.In July last year, two persons were killed after a tipper container had fallen on them on the slip road. An industrialist Avneesh Aggrawal said, “The situation gets worse during rains and commuters, unaware of the pothole, get stuck in it.”Another industrialist Paramvir Singh Bhogal also raised a similar concern. He said, “The sections of the road are so badly engineered that every drive is a death-defying endeavour. Instead of being penalised for being directly or indirectly complicit in the hazardous state of the highway project, it is unimaginable that the highway authorities are being allowed to further fleece the hapless citizens by increasing toll rates.”On being asked about the poor condition of the slip road, NHAI project director Virendra Kumar said the matter had come to their notice and corrective measures were being taken. Member of Punjab Road Safety Council, Rahul Verma, said a meeting between Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma and NHAI authorities was scheduled for December 24 to discuss the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-riding-gets-bumpy-on-sherpur-chowk-slip-road/story-qTVlbxwTlCjyJVrj9IBFLM.html

It can be used in emergency situations, but the domain of the two (politics and army) should be kept firmly apart.”Tharoor, who has also served as a minister of state for external affairs, said if politicians do their job well, lives of soldiers will not be put to needless risk. “Many situations on our borders need to be resolved through diplomacy and trade itself is an aspect of diplomatic relationship,” he said.Tharoor also touched upon the ongoing debate on Hindi as the national language. He said that the move, being pushed by the ruling party, will run into resistance from those who feel themselves at disadvantage if any language is taking over their own language.“Hindi may win the hearts and tongues of a majority population, but it should never be imposed upon the unwilling. It will divide the country. We should understand the complexity and diversity of languages in our country and realise that this diversity is our strength. Let languages evolve and people will use them when they need to use them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/political-failures-should-not-result-in-loss-of-soldiers-lives-shashi-tharoor/story-mqt6ZDmpzpqRMJXO9Pr9SL.html

But this slogan is not to be seen anywhere today because of appeasement policy and dictatorship. TMC is limited to being a family party today,” Shah said at a press conference here.“Instead of being concerned about the 10 crore people of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee is concerned about making her nephew (Abhishek Banerjee) the chief minister of West Bengal,” he added.The Union Home Minister further stated that there are three dangerous trends that have been set in West Bengal-- complete politicisation of administration, complete criminalisation of politics and institutionalisation of corruption.Shah further said: “I want to make an earnest request to the people of West Bengal to join forces with BJP’s ‘Aar noi anyay’ (no more injustice) campaign and support Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”“It is BJP’s commitment to give a good administration to the people of West Bengal and it will not back down at any time,” he added.Shah, while speaking on the farm sector in West Bengal, said, “The money due to the farmers of West Bengal given by the central government should be given to them by the state government.”“According to the 2016-17 figures published by NABARD, in terms of the monthly average income of farmers, West Bengal is at the 24th position amongst the 29 states,” he added.He further said: “West Bengal is the most well-endowed state in the country in terms of its freshwater sources. But irrigation is limited to 55 per cent of the area. It can be further increased.”Shah attacked the TMC government for not passing on the benefits of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana to the common people in West Bengal.“In the health sector under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a Rs 5 lakh cover is provided to every poor person in the country. But in West Bengal, this facility has been barred. Is this the way to advocate a federal structure of the constitution?” he said.On Saturday, over 10 MLAs in Bengal apart from former minister Suvendu Adhikari joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in the presence of Amit Shah. An MP and a former MP also joined the BJP.Shah’s much-anticipated visit to the state began on Saturday.West Bengal is scheduled to go for assembly polls in mid-2021.

20-12-2020||Bangalore||‘May extend issue-based support to BJP but no merger’: HD Kumaraswamy||Former Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy on Sunday said that Janata Dal (Secular) may extend issue-based support to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the coming days in public interest.The JD (S) leader said that his party is a party of Kannadigas with self-esteem and it “will never think of political merger.”In a series of tweets, he also attacked the Congress party, with which JDS formed the Karnataka government in 2018.“The Janata Dal (S), which is a party of Kannadigas with self-esteem, will never think of political merger. The party, which is a strong voice of the people, will never display such stupidity. At the most we may extend issue-based support to the BJP if need be in the coming days in public interest. There is no importance for any imaginary reports on a political merger,” Kumaraswamy tweeted.Attacking the Congress party, Kumaraswamy tweeted, “the Congress high command, which had ridiculed us as BJP’s B team before the Assembly polls, actually came to our doorsteps after the polls and extended an invitation to form a coalition government with it.”“We would not have formed the government with the Congress if we’re to be BJP’s B team. There is no tacit understanding with the BJP as alleged by the Congress. Only an issue-based understanding is possible,” he added.Kumaraswamy asserted that JD (S) took many welfare measures and the situation of committing suicide by merging itself with the other party has not come.“People trust the JD (S) which took up welfare measures like a waiver of farm loans and Badavara Bandhu besides conducting itself as per the aspirations of former prime minister H. D. Deve Gowda known for disciplined administration,” he tweeted.“I want to clarify that for such a party like the JD (S), the situation of committing suicide by merging itself with other party has not come. I don’t foresee such a situation gripping us in future too,” he added.To keep BJP out of power, Congres and JD (S) had joined hand with others to form government with Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister after no party got a clear majority in the 2018 assembly polls.After Lok Sabha Elections 2019, internal differences cropped up and the rebellion by some MLAs led to collapse of the coalition government last year. Since then, both Congress and JD(S) leaders have been blaming each other for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/may-extend-issue-based-support-to-bjp-but-no-merger-hd-kumaraswamy/story-GAMiWlsjymPw8K9XJwVbNK.html

As per the new system, a student who wants to learn any subject from any department can opt for it and use that department’s library, laboratory and other facilities. “Along with the student’s course s/he is studying for, they can now learn another subject from any other department which is useful for their career. Accordingly, their timetable will also be scheduled to accommodate the new subject. The school system facility is available at several centralised universities in the country and the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) had instructed us to start this at the SPPU. Accordingly, we decided to start it and over the last month preparations to start were initiated. Under this, a total of 18 ‘schools’ will be started under 52 departments and study centres at the SPPU. For each school, a director will be appointed,” said SPPU pro-vice- chancellor NS Umrani. “It is an important decision taken by the SPPU for upgradation in education. Faculty with same motive of studying and research will benefit and also tying up with international universities with a school system in place will be more useful for us,” said Umrani. Students have welcomed the decision.

20-12-2020||Lucknow||‘People rejected by the nation are now misleading farmers’: Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said that politicians who have been rejected by the people are misleading farmers regarding the newly passed agricultural laws.Adityanath was addressing attendees at a Kisan Sammelan Sabha in Ayodhya. The event was a part of Atmanirbhar Bharat programme and was targeted at bringing reforms to the agricultural sector in Uttar Pradesh.“Politicians who have been rejected by the people are trying to spoil the atmosphere inside the country by misleading the farmer brothers. But Indians are aware and will ignore their efforts. The unwavering loyalty and faith of the people of the country lies with Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said.The chief minister also assured farmers that the system of minimum support prices (MSP) will not be affected due to the newly passed bills. He reiterated that mandis under the jurisdiction of the government will work simultaneously with other centres which will also facilitate the selling of yields.Adityanath said, “Mandi system will not end. Mandis will do their work and if the farmers get more price of their grain anywhere else in the country, they can take their produce and sell it there. No tax will be levied on it.”The Uttar Pradesh chief minister also pointed out that the bills have been brought not only to reform the agricultural sector but also generate employment for the youth.Farmers’ groups who have been protesting against the farm laws at Singhu in Delhi-Haryana border are yet to accept the government’s proposal and continue to be concerned about MSPs. They also fear that the government’s new rules will allow multinational companies to enter the agricultural sector and make profits.The protests against these laws have been going on for more than 3 weeks. Farmers’ groups have been staging peaceful demonstrations against the government’s new rules at Singhu borders and across other checkpoints across Delhi’s borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/people-rejected-by-the-nation-are-now-misleading-farmers-yogi-adityanath/story-i6eGX6jaBqWztgO60ycjTI.html
20-12-2020||City||Warder among six booked after 27gm opium, mobilephone found in Ambala jail||Police on Saturday booked six people, including the warder, after authorities found around 27gm opium and a mobilephone at the Central Jail in Ambala.The authorities said the conspiracy involves a jail warder, four prisoners and a relative of an inmate. Those booked include warder Purshottam, Gurdeep alias Deepa, Amit alias Babu, Devender and his brother Gurjinder and Iqbal Ahmed, as per the FIR registered on the complaint of deputy superintendent of jail Rakesh Kumar. The issue came to light after a scuffle between prisoners Gurdeep alias Deepa of Mahesh Nagar in Ambala Cantt and Amit alias Babu of Valmiki Nagar in Ambala city was reported to the authorities on Saturday evening. Later, when both of them were interrogated by the jail officials, Amit confessed that another prisoner Devender had used his mobilephone to call his brother Gurjinder and planned to bring the contraband through an employee/official inside the jail. Amit said the drug was brought in but he didn’t get his share.Kumar, in his complaint, said Devender wrote his brother’s number to another inmate Iqbal Ahmed, who also negotiated the money with warder Purshottam. The opium was recovered from Gurdeep’s possession. “A white-colored Samsung mobile phone was also recovered from Amit. During questioning, Iqbal confessed that the consignment was received through the warder on Thursday at 3:45pm. This was also proved when the CCTV footage at the block was checked,” Kumar told the police. A case under Sctions 120-b of the Indian Penal Code, 18 of the NDPS Act and 42 of the Prisons Act has been registered at Baldev Nagar police station. Investigating officer Surender Kumar said no one has been arrested yet. However, as per the process, the prisoners will be brought on production remand by the police for the crime.

20-12-2020||City||Jal Adhikar rally: Khattar says agitating farmers should also demand construction of Satluj-Yamuna Link||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday asked farmers protesting against the agriculture laws to include construction of Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) in Punjab as one of their demands during talks with the Union government.While addressing ‘Jal Adhikar rally’ at Mahendergarh’s Narnaul, Khattar said the water table in many parts of the state has gone down and Punjab chief minister has failed to implement the Supreme Court’s direction to hold talks with him to solve the SYL issue.“It is very painful that Punjab has not been giving Haryana’s share of water. The farmers of southern Haryana had been waiting for water for the last many years but after the formation of our government, we provided water in all the canals in the region. Now, our government is planning to start a micro irrigation scheme in southern Haryana so that water can reach every field. In a democracy, we abide by the constitution and Punjab should provide water through SYL to Haryana at the earliest,” the CM added.He said the farmers are being misled by false information on the minimum support price, Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) and farming agreement after the three laws were brought by the Centre to bring reform in the agriculture sector.“If the MSP and mandis system is abolished, I will resign from the post of chief minister. I want to assure Haryana farmers that neither will the MSP be put on hold nor will it be revoked. Now, the farmers can sell their produce in the open market, if he gets more price than the MSP and vice versa. In the previous UPA government, a committee headed by former CM Hooda in 2010 had recommended to make new changes in the APMC Act and now they are opposing the same,” he added.Khattar said his government has made 88 out of 104 mandis in the state online and every year Haryana has to suffer a loss of Rs 700 crore due to wastage of food grains.Union minister of state Rao Inderjit Singh asked Haryana CM and state party chief OP Dhankar to hold such rallies in Sirsa and Kurukshetra districts, where the farmers are protesting more against farm laws. “The people of Bagar (southern Haryana) are with the BJP. CM sahab, Dhankar sahab you need to hold such rallies in other parts of the state to apprise farmers about the three farm laws,” he added.Meanwhile, a man was taken into custody after he showed black flags to Khattar during his rally. However, he was released later.Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal, former education minister Ram Bilash Sharma, Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh and other senior BJP leaders were present at the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jal-adhikar-rally-khattar-says-agitating-farmers-should-also-demand-construction-of-satluj-yamuna-link/story-0stI9x2LNMEVcRW85VSEmK.html

20-12-2020||Pune||PMC to invite bids again for Mula-Mutha river rejuvenation project||PUNE: Following the Centre’s go-ahead to scrap the previous tendering for Mula-Mutha river pollution abatement project, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has initiated fresh tendering process. The re-tendering may further delay the long-pending project executed with the help of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Mula-Mutha river abatement project officer Jagdish Khanore said, “Both the central government and JICA gave its nod to scrap the previous tendering process which was inflated. The ministry of jalshakti has now agreed to execute the new tendering process and approve consultants. Jalshakti will also frame the terms and conditions. With the Centre’s approval, we have placed the proposal before the PMC standing committee for information.” According to Khanore, as the earlier tendering was carried out in 2016-17, there will be only one fresh tender that will take into account the cost factor. The previous tender was divided into various parts. PMC had requested the Centre to scarp the earlier tender citing inflated cost as the extra fund had to be borne by the civic body. The project Mula-Mutha river is one of the 302 polluted river stretches of the country identified by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The major reasons for pollution of Mula-Mutha are discharge of untreated domestic waste water into the river due to inadequate sewerage system (including pumping stations) and sewage treatment capacity in the town, as well as open defecation on riverbanks. A loan agreement was signed on January 13, 2016 with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for pollution abatement of Mula-Mutha by January 2022. Under the agreement, the government of Japan committed to provide a soft loan of 19.064 billion Yen (about Rs 1,000 crore) to India for the project at an interest rate of 0.30% per annum. The major components proposed under the project include construction of 11 new sewage treatment plants (STPs), which will result in a creation of an additional treatment capacity of 396 million litres per day (MLD) over the existing treatment capacity of 477 MLD, laying of 113.6 km of sewer lines and renovation/rehabilitation of four existing intermediate pumping stations. Once the project is completed by January 2022, the total STP capacity available in Pune will be 873 MLD, which will be sufficient to cater to sewage generation for 2027. The project also includes installation of a system for centralised monitoring of functioning of STPs, construction of 24 units of community toilet facilities in slum and fringe areas, public participation and awareness programme, GIS mapping of sewerage facilities for better asset management. The proposal Augmentation of existing sewage treatment capacity by adding new 11 sewage treatment plants (STPs) to cover sewage generation up to 2027 New STPs to be designed for better effluent quality with 10 mg/L BOD (biological oxygen demand) and 10 mg/L TSS (total suspended solids) along with nitrogen and phosphorus removal Augmentation of exiting four intermediate pumping stations For collection of untapped sewage – laying of 113.6 km of sewers with house connection and laterals Installation of centralised SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) for STPs and IPS (intermediate pumping station) to monitor flow and effluent water quality Implementation of GIS/MIS system for management of assets created under the project Construction of 24 community toilets in slum areas to check open defecation along the riverbanks Institution development and capacity building Facilitation of public awareness programmes Main objectivesTo improve water quality and river ecology as well as stoppage of pollution of river Mula-Mutha To intercept, divert and treat domestic sewage generated discharging in the river To tackle the non-point sources of pollution to improve the hygienic condition of city and surrounding areas and aesthetics of river front Institutional strengthening, capacity building, public awareness for sustainability of projects||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-to-invite-bids-again-for-mula-mutha-river-rejuvenation-project/story-7KzJn0TUg0visEncUmhnZL.html

Their earnings are affected while no one supported them for food. Veena Kene, 28, a Vitthalwadi resident said, “For nine months, we suffered due to lack of food or money. No one thought about our wellbeing. We heard about the show and decided to give it a go. It was good to forget our worries for some time.”She added that they have realised that their traditional means of earning will no longer be fruitful. “Through the event, we also explored new means of earnings by meeting people from different fields,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ulhasnagar-transgenders-display-their-creative-genius/story-vE1WrzBQddNEm2B9j2uflO.html

20-12-2020||Mumbai||NYE nears, Navi Mumbai police step up their vigil||Navi Mumbai police have upped their vigil on the farmhouses in Panvel and its peripheries for the New Year celebrations. Many celebrities from Mumbai own farmhouses in this part of the city and come to celebrate New Year here.The Navi Mumbai police commissioner has warned people not to bring narcotics, firearms or any banned substance to the farmhouses, otherwise strict action will be taken.The farmhouses in Panvel had hit the headlines during Diwali in 2012 when four real estate agents were murdered at Patil farmhouse at Shiewale village by one of their colleagues. They had come to discuss some property-related issues at that farmhouse, and four of them were found murdered.Shivraj Patil, deputy commissioner of police (zone 2) said, “Taking past incidents into consideration, we will ensure heavy bandobast around the farmhouses during the New Year celebrations. No one will be allowed to carry firearms to the farmhouses. Our officials will be stationed in those areas from the evening of December 31 till the next morning.“Separate teams will be formed for patrolling and they will also conduct surprise visits in the farmhouses. If we find anyone violating the norms, he or she will be arrested on the spot.”According to Patil, there are around 200 farmhouses in that region that are scattered in the jurisdictions of Panvel, Panvel Taluka, Taloja and Uran police station.“We have also instructed the senior inspectors of these four police stations to call the owners or the managers of the farmhouses and explain the norms in detail. They are now in the process of doing it. Earlier this week, we also appealed through local media to the farmhouse owners not to violate the Covid-19 norms,” he said.Bipin Kumar Singh, police commissioner of Navi Mumbai, said, “We have no issues if people from other places come and celebrate at the farmhouses. But they should not violate norms. As far as the other rules of New Year celebrations are concerned, we will follow the guidelines issued by the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nye-nears-navi-mumbai-police-step-up-their-vigil/story-z6tDEOSyjDrlqneqIDDaeP.html
20-12-2020||Dehradun||‘Government of zero work’: Manish Sisodia slams Uttarakhand CM||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) senior leader and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia accused both Opposition Congress and ruling BJP of looting Uttarakhand during their respective governments in 20 years of the formation of the state. Sisodia attacked both the parties while interacting with media persons during his first visit to Dehradun on Saturday evening. He had reached the state capital on Saturday morning from Haridwar where he had arrived on Friday. During his one-day visit to the capital, he held several events including a townhall session and an interactive session with about 250 principals of different schools across the country. “The condition in which the state is today is because both the Congress and the BJP did nothing for it while in power except for looting it for the last 20 years. They did nothing for the people of Uttarakhand but took turns to dupe them,” said Sisodia. He said, “But now this won’t happen again as the AAP is receiving full support and love from the people of Uttarakhand who want change. We are sure of winning the 2022 elections and work for the development of the state.” Also read: ‘Covid-19 is ‘out of control’ in UK, says British health secretary HancockDuring his media interaction, he attacked the BJP-led government and said, “This government is not of zero tolerance but zero work.” With zero tolerance, his reference was towards CM Trivendra Singh Rawat’s claim of zero-tolerance towards corruption. Training his guns at Rawat, Sisodia also challenged him for an open debate. “I challenge him for an open debate where he should name five development works which he undertook in his tenure since 2017. I bet he will fail as he has done nothing,” said Sisodia. Earlier during the day, after arriving in Dehradun, he paid tributes to the statehood activists at Shaheed Sthal at the premises of district court. The BJP and the Congress, however, refuted his allegations and refused to accept it as a challenge. “AAP leaders are day-dreaming by claiming to win the elections. It’s never going to happen as people of Uttarakhand will never forget what their government in Delhi did with them during the lockdown,” said Manveer Singh Chauhan, BJP state media in-charge. “Kejriwal government had left our people at the border by giving false assurances that Uttarakhand buses are waiting to take them home. This is how they treated our people in Delhi and now coming here they are posing themselves as the messiah,” said Chauhan. Meanwhile, the Congress termed it as an “opportunistic” party. “Since 2017 elections, we while being in opposition, have been raising our voice for the people of the state against the government by hitting the streets. This AAP was nowhere to be seen and now when only about more than a year is left for the polls, it has come here thinking people will support them. People of Uttarakhand are not fools, they know who is doing what,” said Garima Dasauni, Congress state spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/government-of-zero-work-manish-sisodia-slams-uttarakhand-cm/story-ALJrnsQSsm78PvAg5zmynN.html
20-12-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand mulls cancelling final exams of class 9 and 11 in govt school||Uttarakhand education department is mulling cancelling the final exams of class 9 and 11, in government schools, as studies were affected this year due to Covid-19 epidemic. R Meenakshi Sundaram, the secretary for school education in the state said the department is reviewing the progress of online studies in the state and a decision will be taken depending on the outcomes. “Proper studies of both class 9 and 11 were affected this year due to Covid-19 pandemic. Online mode of education could not be conducted properly for all the students given the topography of the state and constraints due to that. It would be unfair to the students to test them without teaching them the whole syllabus. We have not taken any final decision yet but the options are being considered,” said Sundaram. He added that private schools can decide on their own whether to conduct the final exams or not. Strictly following the guidelines and norms to prevent the spread of Covid-19, schools in Uttarakhand opened after a gap of over seven months on November 2 for students of class 10 and 12. Schools were re-opened for students of class 10 and class 12 as they have to appear for board examinations.

20-12-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand in talks with Madhya Pradesh to bring white tiger to new safari park near Corbett||The Uttarakhand tourism department is in talks with the Madhya Pradesh (MP) government to bring a white tiger to soon-to-be-built tiger safari park near Corbett Tiger Reserve. State tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said that he is in talks with Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to bring a white tiger from Maharaja Martand Singh Judeo White Tiger Safari and Zoo located in Rewa district of the state. Citing plans for the tiger safari park to be built in Corbett Tiger Reserve at a cost of Rs 150 crore, Maharaj said, “I have directed the tourism department officials to chalk out a plan to promote tourism for the new tiger safari park. To make it more attractive and exciting for the tourists, I am in talks with MP CM to bring a white tiger from there to the safari park.” The tourism minister said if the department succeeds in bringing a white tiger, “the popularity of the tiger safari park would increase further.” The wildlife experts, however, claim that the move is just a “political statement” by the tourism minister as shifting a tiger to a new habitat is a lengthy procedure and has to be justified at many levels. Ajay Dubey, Madhya Pradesh based prominent wildlife activist said, “So far it seems that Uttarakhand’s tourism minister’s statement is just a political one.” Also read: ‘Never seen a roadshow like this, people of Bengal want change’ - Amit Shah“Transferring a tiger from one state to another cannot be done by mere talks between ministers. The Central Zoo Authority would be involved in it which would conduct a thorough analysis of whether the climate and environment in the new place would be favourable to the animal or not from the existing one and various other aspects. A comprehensive report is prepared by if before allowing such a move,” said Dubey. He, however, added that shifting a white tiger won’t give a free environment to it in the new safari park. “It is because at present they are in a closed enclosure in Rewa and in Uttarakhand too they would be in another closed enclosure. Also, there are not many white tigers in MP, which might also be a hindrance in shifting one to Uttarakhand,” said Dubey. The tiger safari park, which would be a closed enclosure zoo, was announced a few days ago by state forest minister Harak Singh Rawat during which he had said that it would be built in the Pakhro areas of Corbett Tiger Reserve. He had said that the safari park, “will not just focus on tourism but also spread knowledge about wildlife. It would be made in an area spread over 106 hectares which will be divided into five large enclosures.” Rawat had informed that the state government plans to open the new tiger safari park in November next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-in-talks-with-madhya-pradesh-to-bring-white-tiger-to-new-safari-park-near-corbett/story-q2qQy7nzU7LM66JRdwwjEN.html
20-12-2020||Pune||PMC seeks permission to appoint a consultant to prepare DPR for water scheme||With 23 villages likely to get included in the city very soon and 11 villages already merged, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has begun the process to execute the water scheme for them. The PMC water department put forward a proposal in front of the standing committee to appoint a consultant at the cost of Rs13 crore to prepare a detailed project report for the water project in these 34 villages. PMC water department head Aniruddha Pawaskar said, “24x7 equal water distributions scheme execution is going on in the old city limit area. Meanwhile, three years ago, 11 villages were added into the city and again 23 villages were in the pipeline. The PMC needs to frame the water pipeline scheme in these newly merged areas which can be synchronized with the existing scheme. By considering the future need, PMC decided to appoint the consultant to prepare the water scheme for all these areas.” Pawaskar said, “Once the villages would be merged in the municipal limit, it’s mandatory to provide drinking water to these areas. We are keeping a plan ready. Though the consultant cost is high at Rs13 crore, it includes many components. They would work on this project for nine years from the appointment. They would do a survey of the existing water system. Then they would need to prepare the Detailed Project Report (DPR). Later, the consultant would need to monitor the work once the project work starts and they would need to work with the PMC for operation and maintenance for the next four years.” According to the water department, a tender has been floated for it and a total of seven parties participated in the tendering process. Among them, the LN Malviya firm was proposed by the administration as it quoted a cheaper fee. The standing committee of the PMC would take a call on this proposal in the meeting scheduled next week. As the PMC has floated a tender for the proposed villages, it is clear that the state government would issue the village merger order anytime soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-seeks-permission-to-appoint-a-consultant-to-prepare-dpr-for-water-scheme/story-MEFPIrNAWKOtx2vZi2SEJK.html
20-12-2020||Pune||Woman booked for duping auditor of Rs 1.4 crore by alleged wrongful diagnosis of liver cancer||The Wanowrie police on Friday booked a woman claiming to be naturopath and Ayurveda doctor for allegedly duping another 58-year-old woman from city to the tune of Rs 1.47 crore by falsely diagnosing her with liver cancer. Within six months since June 2020, the complainant paid Rs 1,47,58,700 through 54 transactions to the doctor for treatment of cancer, according to Police sub inspector Bholenath Ahivale of Wanowrie police station who is investigating the case. The 58-year-old complainant works as an auditor at the Principal Controller of Defence Accounts in Pune. In 2017, the accused doctor was practicing naturopathy when the complainant first met her as her friend was taking treatment from her. In October 2019, the complainant had taken treatment from her for another health-issue she was facing. In June, the complainant had started experiencing discomfort while swallowing food and had consulted with the female doctor. The accused told her that her private clinic had shut down and she was now working at a franchise of ayurvedic medicine provider based in Canada. The doctor visited the complainant’s office in Golibar Maidan area and took stock of her health complaints while enquiring about her job, according to the complaint. She asked the woman to send a picture of her navel on WhatsApp which she claimed was sent to Canada for close inspection. After a few days, the woman informed the complainant that she had been diagnosed with liver ascites and that the reports of her conditions had to be kept confidential. The accused also refused to share prescription and insisted on providing the medicines herself after each payment. The complainant made multiple transactions through cash and various online methods too, according to her complaint.

Since November 24, until December 18 the civic body has collected over Rs 1.78 lakh from over 1,668 establishments. The PMC has formed special squads to keep a check on such establishments where the Covid-19 norms are not being followed. Across the 15 wards, the PMC has penalized hotels, bars, restaurants, malls, shops and other establishments and even issued notices when found that the patrons were not following the Covid-19 norms including social distancing and wearing masks. The Shivajinagar-Ghole road ward collected the maximum amount of fines from such establishments of Rs 30,500.PMC additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “These squads included policemen and also the civic staff. We had formed these to keep a check on such establishments where these norms are not being followed. We have asked our squad to take action more promptly which is not specifically for New Year but on a regular basis.” The civic body had initiated action against those who do not wear masks and do not follow social distancing norms and also against spitting. Any offender found not wearing masks in public places is penalized Rs 500 per offence. Wearing masks has been highly recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent the spread of Covid-19. With the upcoming New Year season, it is expected that a large number of people would crowd hotels and restaurants like Diwali which may lead to a high surge in the number of cases in the city.

20-12-2020||Pune||Percentage of vaccinated kids in Pune falls from 81% to 58% in four years||According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) Pune district, the percentage of vaccinated kids in the district has fallen from 81 per cent in 2015-16 to 58.1 per cent in 2019-20 which is a drop of 22.9 per cent. The data was interpreted based on the information from either the vaccination card of the child or the way their mother’s recalled the vaccination of the kids.The data also showed that for most of the ailments including polio, BCG, DPT, measles, Hepatitis B and rotavirus, the percentage of kids covered under various vaccination programs has fallen down. The percentage of kids aged 12-23 months who received vaccination in public health facilities went up by 10 per cent in the same period. The data for vaccination of kids aged between 12-23 months who were vaccinated based on information from the vaccination card alone was 95.4 per cent in the year 2015-16 went down to 79.2 per cent in the year 2019-20. Pune district health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar said, “I have not gone through the survey data yet but I can say that it is not so low. We were supposed to cover at least 8 per cent of the kids every month which we could not this year due to the pandemic. However, we are just behind by 2-3 per cent. We were supposed to vaccinate about 67 per cent of the kids until November end but we have covered only 64 per cent which we are hoping to cover the gap in this month.”Dr Abhijit More, public health activist and AAP leader in the city said, “I have not seen the report yet but I have heard about this. If it is true then it is very alarming. Vaccination needs to take place at the right time otherwise it is not effective. This is also reflective of the situation that the community outreach program has not worked effectively. The unresolved issues of Asha workers over the years could have caused this. The Auxiliary Nurses Midwives (ANM) working in primary health centres in rural areas are responsible for community awareness and because of most of the work allocated to the Asha workers who are now overburdened, this awareness program must have been hampered. Low vaccination rates among kids means a weaker future generation.”The survey showed that only 66.2 per cent of the kids aged 12-23 months were vaccinated in the year 2019-20 which was about 86.3 per cent were vaccinated in the year 2015-16. In the case of Diphtheria, Tetanus & Pertussis (DPT) vaccine, about 92.8 per cent of the kids were vaccinated in the year 2015-16 which came down to 68 per cent in the year 2015-16. Only 67.7 per cent were vaccinated with first doses of measles in the year 2019-20 which was 98.1 per cent in the year 2015-16. In the year 2019-20, a total of 79 per cent of the kids aged 12-23 months were vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine which went down to 61.3 per cent in the year 2019-20.The survey also showed that more kids got vaccinated in public health facilities in the past four years while in private health facilities the number of kids getting vaccinated went down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/percentage-of-vaccinated-kids-in-pune-falls-from-81-to-58-in-four-years/story-W5l5lW3cveIeomk3UxqyKM.html

20-12-2020||Patna||Bihar aims to be beggar-free by 2021 by turning vagabonds into vendors, artists||Bihar is proving the old adage-- Beggars can’t be choosers—wrong by giving them a choice of a respectable profession and a shot at a dignified induction into the mainstream of the society, while ridding the state of the scourge at the same time, said an official. Under a Bhikshavritti Niwaran Yojna or a scheme to rid beggars of the habit, being run by the State Society for Ultra Poor and Some Welfare, SAKSHAM, Beggars, under this programme, are being asked if they want to become entrepreneurs or publicity managers for government programmes.The programme, with twin objectives of eliminating begging and rehabilitating beggars, has so far managed to give financial support to 18 beggars for starting their own business. At a function held at the SAKSHAM office in Patna, each of the 18 beggars was given a cheque of Rs 10,000.They have also been provided Aadhar cards and regular bank accounts.“Some of them want to start selling vegetables while others want to sell other items,” said a SAKSHAM official. He added that the agency has set a target to provide financial support to 100 beggars in Patna.It’s the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment which is running this Bhikshavritti Nivaran Yojna in 10 cities of the country and Patna has been made a part of this. The other cities covered under this project are Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow, Indore, Nagpur, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.SAKSHAM, a part of Bihar’s social welfare department, is the implementing agency of this project.“This project is, in fact, a replication of Mukhyamantri Bhikshavritti Nivaran Yojna started by the state government in 2008-9. It was intended to protect and promote the rights of beggars and to ensure their care and development through socio-economic policies,” Dayanidhan Pandey, the SAKSHAM director, said before adding that the Union government had adopted the same project and extended it to other states.The rehabilitation of beggars also includes a choice to return home to their families. Others may stay at the government care institutions and learn skills for setting up their own small business or get trained as salesperson.This project has been running in 12 districts of the state including in Patna, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Purnia, Gaya, Nalanda, Rohtas, Katihar, Bhagalpur, Saran, Araria and in Vaishali..Ashok Chaudhary, the social welfare minister, said, there’s a plan to make Patna beggar-free by March 2021.“Beggars are being identified and being motivated to stop asking for alms and instead start their own work,” he said.Also Read: It took only a 4 hour vehicle-checking drive to arrest 65 criminals in BiharOver 2200 beggars have been identified in the state capital. SAKSHAM official Randhir Kumar said that many do not want to leave begging.“In fact, they have become so used to this kind of living that they don’t want to stop it. Recently we tried to identify their interests and passions to give them the opportunity to pursue it. Some were found to be interested in singing while many others have acting abilities,” he said.The agency says the multiple talents found among the beggars can be used for creating awareness among the poor about government welfare programmes.“They may do street plays and motivate others to avail the facilities provided to them by the government,” Kumar added.For the male beggars, there are seven rehabilitation centres known as Seva Kutirs and six short stay homes, known as Shanti Kutirs, in the state.“Patna also has Basera, the day and night shelter with a kitchen. The government has decided to start Baseras in all districts of the state. In the first phase, 25 such facilities are to be created at the government-run Buniyaad Kendras in different districts,” said a government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-aims-to-be-beggar-free-by-2021-by-making-vagabonds-vendors-and-artists/story-cTOD7dgHZALElCsCPk3vJI.html

20-12-2020||Jaipur||Vigilance operation reveals corruption and laxity in police work in Rajasthan||An internal vigilance operation by Rajasthan police has revealed corruption and laxity within the ranks, with policemen at several police stations found either responding late to complaints or not entertaining it at all. Several policemen were also found to be taking bribes at traffic barricades and allowing liquor sales to go beyond mandated hours.Several instances of inefficient policing and corruption was noted during decoy operations conducted on Saturday by the vigilance teams from the state police headquarters across 16 districts. The operation, carried out on the nights of December 17 and 18 not only revealed negligence in carrying out duty but also connivance with liquor vends and the sand mafia at several places. “In Nagaur’s Padu Kalan police station, when the decoy team called to report a robbery via phone, there was a lack of prompt response and readiness among the cops of the station. In Udaipur’s Surajpole police station area, a constable took a written report from the complainant at the spot but did not register an FIR,” said Additional director general of police (ADGP), vigilance, Biju George Joseph. Similarly, on a complaint pertaining to a missing girl at Taleda police station in Bundi, the duty officer and the police officer asked a variety of questions but finally told the complainant to contact another police station instead. On the brighter side, three police stations responded satisfactorily and registered FIRs for alleged robbery and bike theft incidents at Bedu and Ratangarh police stations in Churu and at Fagi police station in Jaipur Rural. In Ganganagar city, it was found that liquor was being sold freely in several places, including Hanumangarh Road, Shiv Chowk, Suratgarh Bypass, Mira Chowk and Kotwali police station area.Also Read: Rajasthan HC seeks state govt’s reply on work in prisons In Jhunjhunu’s Udaipurwati police station area and in Nagaur police station area, of Nagaur district, a number of vehicles were found transporting illegal river sand in absence of any police intervention.

20-12-2020||Lucknow||UP CM wants timelines for Covid vaccination met, but challenges remain||The Uttar Pradesh government has stepped up preparations for Covid-19 vaccination drive, however, registration of all healthcare workers, to be vaccinated in the first phase, and development of additional storage capacity in select districts, remain major challenges for authorities.As of now about 605,000 of 780,000 healthcare workers have got themselves registered at the CoWIN portal, a digital platform set up by the Union government for real-time monitoring of Covid vaccine delivery. Healthcare workers employed with the private sector are lagging behind with less than 90% having registered so far.Officials aware of the developments said, private health facilities in nearly 14 districts have not come forward with details for registration of all their healthcare workers on the CoWIN portal.“Yes, the scenario is bad in 14 districts including Lucknow, Prayagraj, Bareilly, Kanpur Nagar, Meerut, Ballia, Maharajganj, Moradabad, Chandauli, Badaun, Farrukhabad and Sambhal. Less than 90% workers of private facilities have filled up the registration details in these districts against 99% workers in government facilities. This may be because private hospitals may not be willing to show a certain category of workers as their staff,” said a senior officer on condition of anonymity. Principal secretary, medical and health, Alok Kumar, however, said all efforts were being made to ensure that most of the healthcare workers fill up the form for vaccination. “We have asked chief medical officers (CMOs) to make all out efforts to get all healthcare workers registered on the portal. We are keeping the option for registration on the portal open to get more coverage and preparations are afoot for vaccination of 8 lakh health care workers,” said Kumar. Uttar Pradesh has 5,235 government healthcare facilities, while the number of facilities in the private sector is about 21,280. Workers in 5,180 government facilities have completed the registration along with staff in 19,170 private facilities. The state has about 783,000 registered healthcare workers including 546,500 with the government centres and 237,000 with the private sector. A programme to train more than 1 lakh vaccinators has been launched and about 35,000 Covid vaccination centres are being set up in the state, said an official. He added that each team of vaccinators is expected to vaccinate 100 persons per day.Also Read: Yogi Adityanath govt coins MYK mantra to counter opposition before 2022 pollsAdditional funds of about Rs 4 crore have been made available for installing additional cold chain storage capacity in the state for about 2.5 lakh litres of vaccine. Construction or renovation work has been completed only in 26 districts so far, with another 25 districts likely to finish work by December 20.Most other districts are expected to complete the capacity installation by December 31, while Bareilly and Mirzapur are likely to complete it by January 20 and January 10, respectively. Amethi and Sitapur are among the districts, where the work on vaccine storage has not even begun. Also Read: Mayawati again seeks withdrawal of new farm lawsThe Union government is providing refrigerators and deep freezers to store the vaccine and 4.5 crore syringes have been allocated to the state for the purpose. About 1,040 deep freezers have been allotted against the requirement of 1,240. There is also a shortfall of vaccine carriers with an allotment of about 26,800 carriers against the demand for 115,635, said an official. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said that all timelines for the vaccination drive must be met and arrangements for the safe storage of vaccines and maintenance of the cold chain should be fool proof. He added that a police constable and a home guard will be deployed with every vaccination team. The Covid 19 vaccination drive is likely to be a major challenge for India’s most populous state and its experience of immunization programmes for polio and other diseases is likely to help. A state steering committee, headed by the chief secretary, has been coordinating with various departments and task forces headed by district magistrates in every district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-cm-wants-timelines-for-covid-vaccination-met-but-challenges-remain/story-a8piZ9xo8CfNJ6UWuH8EfJ.html

Also, it assures that “very soon, the city will be made free from the menace of stray dog and stray cattle.” This promise, which has been highlighted in red, is a long pending one.Cattle-free status still unachievedAfter missing at least three deadlines, the Panchkula authorities had set the 2020 New Year goal to attain a stray-cattle free status. However, residents continue to suffer due to stray cattle menace, which causes traffic chaos and accidents.Even repeated “strict instructions” by Haryana Vidhan Sabha speaker and Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta have had no impact, as the contractors continue to miss deadlines of readying the dog-pound and cow-shelter at Sudarshanpur village.The pound and shelter was proposed in 2018, but is not ready yet.Setting up of a solid waste management plant in Jhuriwala is another major promise. Also a long pending project, it was allotted by the MC in 2019, but residents living across the Ghaggar river had protested against it.To solve the problem of parking, the party has proposed multi-level parkings in sectors. Speeding up development works, improving the conditions of parks, installing gym equipment in parks, bettering the street lights, and construction of new and better roads which connect Chandigarh to Panchkula are some of the other promises.Health and education are listed as points 19 and 20 on the manifesto, wherein the party proposes medi-city and education hub in the district.The party also promises, making Panchkula a slum-free place and plans construction of over 7,000 flats.Further, it promises upgrading of the railway station, which falls in Panchkula, and upgrading fire stations, better rain-water harvesting, activity centres in all sectors, cleanliness of drainage system in sectors 2, 4, 12 and 12A, an e-library is Sector 5, cleanliness of roads, and clean toilets in markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-mc-polls-bjp-releases-25-point-manifesto/story-tfZRP77WVXlgA5izfVGWLJ.html

20-12-2020||Chandigarh||Military Literature Festival: ‘India should shed hesitation and embrace QUAD to tame China’||Underlining military manoeuvres and challenges from China, security and foreign experts at the Military Literature Festival (MLF) on Saturday suggested that India must shed hesitation and adopt a more aggressive approach by embracing quadrilateral security dialogue or QUAD to tame the dragon.Former Chief of Naval Staff Sunil Lanba (retd) was among the panelists discussing “The QUAD: The emerging Indo-Pacific naval alliance”. Lanba explained the genesis of QUAD as a club of four nations comprising India, US, Japan and Australia.“Forged in wake of coordination amongst these four democracies during the 2004 tsunami, the ambitious grouping went into limbo owing to Australia’s reluctance to antagonise China then. It’s prominence in 2017 has been a response to China’s assertiveness in the region,” he explained.Former ambassador Shyam Saran revealed that it was the US which in fact had wanted to play down the group’s significance because it did not want to lose out on China and Russia’s support for pushing the Iran Nuclear Deal.Vice-admiral Pradeep Chauhan said China considered India as one of its target of military assertion, a challenge our establishment had so far not been familiar and comfortable dealing with.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/military-literature-festival-india-should-shed-hesitation-and-embrace-quad-to-tame-china/story-3a2q33dkArI2Igq1SV8Z8L.html

20-12-2020||Delhi||Sun out, but Delhi shivers at 3.9°C||Cold wave conditions persisted in the Capital as Delhi recorded the season’s lowest temperature on Saturday although abundant sunshine during the day lent some respite, weather scientists said. Safdarjung Observatory, taken as representative for the city, recorded a minimum temperature of only 3.9 degrees Celsius, the lowest seen in the winter months so far and four notches below normal, according to India Meteorological Department. Mercury dipped to 3.3°C and 3.4°C at Lodhi Road and Ayanagar stations, respectively, as icy winds from snow-laden western Himalayas continued to sweep the city, IMD said.However, ‘cold day’ conditions -- when temperatures are lower than a specified threshold -- abated on Saturday, with Safdarjung recording a maximum temperature of 21.8°C, one degree below normal. “Cold wave conditions are likely to persist over Delhi for a few days. Cold day conditions have abated in most parts of northwest India which means there is clear sunshine, which is able to warm the surface. The layer of fog has moved away. We are expecting a western disturbance to impact the region around December 22, when moisture will increase and dense fog is likely in the entire region. There may be cold wave conditions also,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre. A cold day is recorded when minimum temperature is under 10 degrees C and maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees C below normal. A “severe” cold day is seen when the minimum temperature is under 10 degrees C and maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees C below normal. A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lower than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degree C in the plains. Witnessing a cold day and cold wave together means the gap between day and night temperatures was lower than normal. IMD has forecast that there is likely to be a gradual rise in maximum temperatures by 2-3 degrees C in the next two days, but minimum temperatures could drop 2-4 degrees C during the same period over central and east India. Cold wave/ severe cold wave conditions may persist in some places over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh; at isolated places over Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Gangetic West Bengal during next three days and decline thereafter, the IMD’s bulletin stated. Cold day/severe cold day conditions are also likely at a few places such as Uttarakhand, eastern and western Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh during next 48 hours. Cold day conditions are likely to recede from these regions from December 21, it added.Delhi’s air quality remained in the “poor” category, with average air quality index (AQI) standing at 290 on Saturday. “Air pollution levels may begin rising from December 21 because wind speed is likely to reduce and dense fog is likely to impact the entire northwestern region,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sun-out-but-delhi-shivers-at-3-9-c/story-TuHJt8SgL49dJJMymGHzdN.html
20-12-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan HC seeks state govt’s reply on work in prisons||Taking note of a report that prisons in Rajasthan were allocating work to inmates based on their caste, the Rajasthan High Court has sought the government’s response and called for a complete overhaul of the “archaic” rule book.The division bench of Justice Sandeep Mehta and Justice Devendra Kachhawaha, while hearing the petition filed by Manoj Yadav, directed additional advocate general Farzand Ali to apprise the court regarding the proposed steps for complete overhauling of the Prison Manual and to ensure that the prisoners are not forced to indulge in menial jobs like cleaning toilets, etc, merely on the basis of their caste and also that no under trial prisoner is forced to perform such jobs in the prison.In the interest of justice, the court urged the state government to consider installation of mechanized/automated cleaning facilities in all the prisons.“We have come across a very disturbing report regarding the existence of a caste-based work assignment system in the prisons in Rajasthan. The report is based on a research paper of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI). The researcher of the CHRI interviewed various prisoners (since released) from prisons in Rajasthan and a shocking finding came out that till date the archaic Prison Manual, which was a gift of the British Rule, is prevalent in the prison system of the State,” said the judges in their order.The order came following detailed reporting in The Wire, which also used resources from CHRI. According to the news website’s report, the arrangement was clear – those at the bottom of the caste pyramid did the cleaning work; while those in higher cases handled kitchen or legal documentation department. “And the rich and influential did nothing;they only threw their weight around. These arrangements had nothing to do with the crime that one was arrested for or his conduct in prison. “Sab kuch jaati ke aadhar par tha (It was all based on caste),” said the report, a part of which was cited in the order,The court fixed ‪February 2 as the next date for hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-hc-seeks-state-govt-s-reply-on-work-in-prisons/story-ah0jrEY8AzHOU3G8ZRRsnO.html
20-12-2020||Chandigarh||Process set in motion to dismiss an SP, 2 DSPs convicted in criminal cases, Punjab govt tells HC||The Punjab government has initiated the process to dismiss three senior officers, including a superintendent of police (SP) and two deputy superintendents of police (DSPs), who were convicted in criminal cases.In a report submitted in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the state government said a total of 103 cops, including three SPs, two DSPs, two inspectors, eight assistant sub-inspectors, 13 head constables and 75 constables, have been convicted in criminal cases. The officers against whom dismissal proceedings were initiated are Paramdeep Singh Sandhu (SP-rank) and DSPs Gurcharan Singh and Hardev Singh. Sandhu, posted as additional inspector general (AIG security), was booked in 2011 in a graft case and convicted in 2018. Gurcharan Singh, posted with the 3rd Indian Reserve Battalion, Ludhiana, was convicted by a trial court in 2016 in a graft case registered in 2012. Approval is being sought from the competent authority in his case. Hardev Singh, who is lodged in Central Jail Amritsar, was booked in 2004 for extortion and criminal intimidation and convicted in February this year. Approval is also sought from the competent authority in his case.Two more convicted cops are Gurdaspur SSP Rajinder Singh Sohal who was booked for illegal detention in 1995 and convicted in 2013 and Harpreet Singh (DSP) who was booked in a kidnap case in 1995 and convicted in 2005 and These officers are currently in service.Details were sought on the petition of a Moga resident, Surjit Singh, who had approached the court challenging his dismissal order passed by the the district police chief. Surjit told the court that the dismissal order was passed even as the criminal case against him was pending adjudication. He termed the move discriminatory, as a large number of police officers facing criminal cases are still in service. The details submitted in October also revealed that at least 1,326 police officers/officials are facing criminal cases. On the court’s query on rationale in re-instating/allowing the continuance of such officers in service despite conviction, the affidavit submitted by additional chief secretary (home) Anurag Aggarwal says neither there is any provision of the Constitution nor any rules provide that in case of conviction in a criminal matter a government employee has to be necessarily dismissed from service. It is for the authorities concerned to decide in each case the quantum of punishment to be imposed on the convicted employee, keeping in view the gravity of offence which led to their conviction. The dismissal of a government employee cannot be automatic merely on registration of a criminal case against them, Aggarwal argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/process-initiated-to-dismiss-an-sp-2-dsps-convicted-in-criminal-cases-punjab-govt-tells-high-court/story-36gjBN9xQ5C6EfUVcpzV9O.html

Backed by various farmer rights associations, the GNDTP employees union had been opposing dismantling of the facility. Various associations had staged dharnas disallowing the work after Mumbai-based firm HR Commercial Private Limited won competitive bidding to dismantle the plant’s infrastructure in September. These unions were demanding that the state government revoke its decision and restart the 46-year-old coal-based plant. DP Garg, who holds the additional charge of GNDTP chief engineer, said the firm is continuing with its work for over a month now. “After completing the bidding formalities, the Mumbai-based private firm was issued sale order on October 8. Initially, the unions had expressed reservation but now the work is going on smoothly. The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has asked the firm to complete the work within 18 months,” said Garg.The PSPCL had got Rs 164 crore from the firm against a reserve price of Rs 132 crore in the e-bidding. The state government is pitching for construction of one of the three ‘bulk drug parks’ being set up by the Centre where companies relocating from China will be invited to set up shops. In October, the Bathinda municipal corporation (MC) decided to keep nearly 1,200-acre land of the defunct plant out of its jurisdiction for the proposed pharma industrial project.The four mega cooling towers of the power facility have been declared monuments and will not be brought down. Only civil structures, including chimneys and machinery used in power generation besides cables and pipes, will be disposed of.The plant was shut down in 2018 in view of the Central Electricity Agency (CEA) guidelines to retire non-viable thermal power plants that have exceeded a life span of 25 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmer-unions-away-in-delhi-dismantling-of-bathinda-thermal-plant-picks-pace-without-any-resistance/story-BrIcnshcFMhtqNSAoOWl5J.html
20-12-2020||Mumbai||Researchers come up with natural solution to prevent red ants from attacking Olive Ridley turtle nests in Maharashtra||A first-of-its-kind study in India, researchers have tried to combat the problem of red army ants predating on Olive Ridley turtle eggs and hatchlings, and have found natural control measures to protect nesting sites for further conservation of the species. During the 2018-19 turtle nesting period along Maharashtra’s west coast, local turtle conservationist Suhas Toraskar at Wayangani Beach in Vengurla, Sindhudurg, was startled to discover predating ants on protected hatchling sites. The nesting period saw more than 75% nests infested with red ants, which caused four of seven nests with over 500 eggs (one nest has around 125 eggs on average) to be completely devoured, resulting in an extremely low hatchling survival rate. Owing to a lack of any detailed study, conservationists were left clueless on how to protect these species and reached out to the forest department for help. Funded by the Mangrove and Marine Biodiversity Conservation Foundation –an autonomous body that assists the state mangrove cell (under the forest department) in coastal marine conservation through research projects – Anuja Vartak from the department of biodiversity, MES Abasaheb Garware College, Pune, under the supervision of Sumedha Korgaonkar, research scholar, Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, commenced a study from December 2019 to understand the feeding, foraging and predatory behaviour of this ant species during the nesting season and find a solution to prevent predation. “This is the first time that any study from the Indian subcontinent has identified ant species responsible for predatory behaviour affecting turtles. It has provided a roadmap for species conservation for the west coast and across India,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell) and executive director, Mangrove Foundation. Researchers identified that changes in weather pattern have led to a shift in turtle nesting months, followed by the ant attack. “After assessing turtle nesting data of the past 20 years, a prominent shift in the peak nesting season was identified along Maharashtra. The nest and its incubation period had shifted to the summer months of March-April instead of January-February, most likely owing to the impacts of climate change,” said Korgaonkar, adding that coincidentally, the predation of protected and relocated nests increased at Wayangani. Though natural predators such as golden jackals, birds, feral dogs etc. are known to predate on emerging sea turtle hatchlings, hatcheries can be protected by building sheds, protective cover or relocating the nests. “However, in this case, the attacks were happening through the sand as these insects would already demolish nests by the time a hatchery could be excavated,” said Korgaonkar. After collecting samples, researchers with help from expert Dr Himender Bharti, identified the ant species as Dorylus orientalis (commonly called blind ant or red ant). It is native to the Indian subcontinent and known to be an agricultural pest that attacks potato and groundnut crops. “In this case, the nesting site did not have these crops but our survey with locals revealed that these ants were present in these areas for over three decades, which meant they were an ecological indicator,” said Vartak. Meanwhile, the research team’s investigation also revealed that beach managers were using chemical insecticide (phorate powder) a few metres away from nests. “This was harmful to the ecosystem as well as dangerous for the developing turtle embryos,” added Korgaonkar. Finally, researchers came up with a natural solution using neem (Azadirachta indica) powder as an eco-friendly control measure by identifying ant tunnels along nesting beaches. By maintaining a safe distance from the nest, protective layers were carved out sprayed with neem powder. “We found the solution was 100% effective with not a single case of predation or destruction of eggs during the 2019-20 season at Wayangani Beach. However, the solution is not locally available and a more native eco-friendly measure is being sought under the next phase of the study,” said Korgaonkar. The Mangrove Foundation said methods suggested would be implemented wherever such predation was observed along the state coastline. “The problem of red ants predating on turtle eggs has been documented at some sites along the Maharashtra coast and this short study shows us that there are some simple biological control methods which can be employed to deal with this problem. Thus in the future, such measures will be used to counter these problems,” said Manas Manjrekar, deputy director, Mangrove Foundation. Though the second phase for the research work – identifying a locally available natural solution for the problem – was delayed due to Covid-19, researchers will recommence the study during the 2020-21 nesting season. “Our research has been the first evidence of red ant predation on sea turtles reported from India. Being a vulnerable species, such behavioural research has assumed top priority for conservationists worldwide, furthering the effectiveness of conservation management,” said Vartak, adding, “Once the study resumes we hope to develop a low-cost, locally available natural solution to prevent ant attacks on the vulnerable hatchlings.” Among the smallest of the world’s sea turtles Named for the greenish colour of its skin and shell, Olive Ridley sea turtles are found in warm tropical currents of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Along with the Kemp’s Ridley, they are known to be among the smallest of the sea turtles globally. They are protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List and travel thousands of kilometres in the ocean, with only the females returning to their original nesting sites within a minimum of two years to lay eggs. After a 45-65 day incubation period, juvenile turtles break the eggshell, dig through the sand, and crawl to the sea. While females return to their place of birth, males never return to land. Female turtles use geomagnetic imprinting (navigating to their geographic area of origin using magnetic field) and olfactory (relating to the sense of smell) cues to find their natal areas. According to the mangrove cell, only two-fifths of all Olive Ridley turtle hatchlings made their way to the sea in Maharashtra in 2019-20 with 12,149 hatchlings survived from 27,254 eggs during the period, accounting for a survival rate of 44.5%. In 2018-19, the survival rate was 54.4% with 12,601 hatchlings that made it to sea from 23,131 eggs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/researchers-come-up-with-natural-solution-to-prevent-red-ants-from-attacking-olive-ridley-turtle-nests-in-maharashtra/story-VLP2tWIjnjUz1dhvuEU4pM.html
20-12-2020||City||Haryana BJP leaders protesting over SYL face farmers’ wrath||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders protesting in support of the farm laws and demanding Haryana’s share of water from Punjab through the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal, faced the farmers’ wrath on Saturday, with the latter accusing the saffron party of trying to divide farmers of the two states.In Fatehabad, farmers uprooted a tent put up by the party workers for their day-long hunger strike. BJP district chief Baldev Groha and other party leaders were present when the farmers showed them black flags, raised slogans and uprooted the tent. They left the venue under tight police security.In Karnal, soon after the BJP leaders assembled at their venue in Sector-12 to participate in the strike, a group of farmers took out a protest march against them. After a high-voltage drama, lasting more than an hour, police managed to convince them to move near the mini-secretariat for their dharna.Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia’s son Chand Bhatia also faced a blockade by farmers when he was going to attend a programme in Assandh town. He was allowed to pass only after he “apologised” to the agitators, who claimed that his MP father had not raised their concerns in Parliament.At Dadri, farmers entered at the park where the BJP workers protesting, with the help of a ladder which they used to climb down from an adjacent building. Raising slogans, the farmers disrupted the saffron party’s protest.Satpal Kaushik, a farmer leader from Karnal, said, “These protests by the BJP are aimed at creating a rift between farmers of Punjab and Haryana, who are jointly leading the agitation against the three black laws passed by the Centre.”Hisar MP skips protestThe state BJP had announced to hold demonstrations in all district headquarters. Hisar MP Brijendra Singh, whose father and former Union minister Birender Singh had extended support to farmers on Friday, skipped the protest on Saturday. Sirsa MP Sunita Duggal, Fatehabad MLA Duda Ram and Ratia MLA Laxman Napa also did not join the protest.In Bhiwani, the protest was led by state agriculture minister JP Dalal while Haryana BJP chief OP Dhankar observed the strike in Jhajjar. Dalal said, “Farmers from Southern Haryana have been waiting for SYL water for many years. The Haryana farmers should list this issue before the union water and resources minister Gajendra Singh, along with their other demands regarding three farm laws. We are hoping that the farmers and government will find an amicable solution in the seventh round of meeting,” he added.On the Fatehabad tent uprooting incident, BJP state chief OP Dhankar said farmers cannot be behind such activities, it may have been carried out by miscreants.In a video message, Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhry of the Congress hit out at the BJP for trying to divide farmers of Punjab and Haryana. “The BJP can do one thing, and that is to create a division among farmers. But the farmers have seen their real face. I want to ask the Haryana agriculture minister why did his party fail to take a single step to bring the SYL water to Haryana despite being in power for six years? The minister should ask his government to send water in the Hansi-Butana canal so that farmers of southern Haryana can benefit,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-bjp-leaders-protesting-over-syl-face-farmers-wrath/story-gAgsgYVz34SxpCO8Xnc2oO.html

The case fatality rate (CFR) in the state is 2.57%. A total of 1,781,841 patients have recovered so far, of which, 3,119 patients recovered on Saturday. The recovery rate in the state is 94.14%. Maharashtra presently has 61,095 active Covid-19 cases. Of the 74 deaths, 33 were in the past 48 hours, 15 were in the past week and 26 were in the period before last week. According to the daily analysis of Covid-19 cases by Maharashtra’s Medical Education and Drugs Department as of Saturday morning 10 am, the state has the highest number of cumulative Covid-19 cases in the country.So far, Maharashtra has conducted 12,059,235 Covid tests, of which 62,611 were in the past 24 hours. The positivity rate in the state is 15.69%. Positivity rate is calculated as the number of cases corresponding to the tests done so far. The area under jurisdiction of Pune district contributes the highest number of active cases in the state at 17,213, followed by Thane district at 10,599, then Mumbai, at 7,725, and Nagpur district at 4,376 active infections. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid task force formed by the Maharashtra government, told HT earlier this week, “There are some characteristics peculiar to Maharashtra that led to a higher number of cases and deaths in the state. These is high population density in urban parts of the state such as Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, higher mobility, and greater instances of comorbidities in the population such as hypertension, diabetes, due to lifestyles. Having said this, Maharashtra has managed to bring down its CFR, and growth rate of cases in the state. We have also not seen the surge we expected post Diwali, which is a good sign.” While on December 1, Maharashtra reported 4,930 fresh cases, on December 2 it reported 5,600 cases. One week later, on December 7, Maharashtra reported 3,075cases, on December 8, it reported 4,026 cases. By mid- December, on December 15, Maharashtra reported 3,442 cases. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance office,r said, “The figures showED that the situation in the state is improving. Despite this, we have kept up efforts such as actively testing maximum number of suspected cases, identifying ‘super-spreaders’ among frontliners, traders, vendors, who work closely with the community, to check the spread of the infection.”When asked about Maharashtra having the highest number of cases in the country, Dr Awate said, “Maharashtra had a large number of cases in the beginning of the outbreak, so we are carrying that baggage forward, when being compared to other states. However, it is not just with Covid-19 infection numbers, but also swine flu, dengue numbers in the past decade, Maharashtra has had higher cases. This is because the state has sharp surveillance, and we are very alert. We also do not hide any numbers or facts.” Mumbai on Saturday recorded 632 infections and 10 deaths, taking the tally to 286,264 and toll to 10,980. Among the municipal corporations around Mumbai, Thane Municipal Corporation recorded 109 cases and 2 deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of cases to 54,951, and toll to 1,195; Navi Mumbai recorded 88 cases and 2 deaths, taking the tally to 52,396 and toll to 1,059; Kalyan-Dombivili Municipal Corporation (KDMC) recorded 113 cases and one death, taking the tally to 59,516 and toll to 979; Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation recorded 47 new cases and no new deaths, taking the tally to 26,352 and toll to 638; Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation recorded 26 new cases and no new deaths, taking the tally to 30,044 and toll is at 587.

20-12-2020||Mumbai||Sonia Gandhi’s letter to Uddhav Thackeray brings unease between Congress-NCP to the fore||A day after Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asking him to fulfil promises made to socially backward classes, the unease between Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) was visible even as the Congress insisted that Gandhi’s letter should be seen as dialogue and not confrontation. On the other hand, Congress on Saturday launched an attack against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accusing the party of working against the interests of backward classes. Significantly, the three ruling partners, Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, have decided to contest elections to gram panchayats in January separately, although Thackeray had earlier announced that the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) will contest all local polls together as a coalition. The letter from Gandhi, which made the fissures in MVA visible, came at a time when there is unease in the Congress over the way the government is being run. Most Congress leaders in the state think that the government is being run by Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, and that Congress doesn’t have any scope to decide policies of the government.Congress leaders in the past have expressed unhappiness over the lack of funds provided to local bodies controlled by the Congress. More recently, energy minister Nitin Raut’s proposal to provide relief to consumers on inflated electricity bills was shot down by the finance department headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar as the state’s financial condition was precarious to allow to let go of ₹60,000 crore in pending bills. A senior Congress leader said, “For the past few months, our ministers such as Ashok Chavan and Vijay Vadettiwar have publicly expressed unhappiness over funding of certain schemes or plans or even local bodies where our party is in power.” He added, “It is no coincidence that the state finance department is headed by NCP’s Ajit Pawar.”NCP minister and spokesperson Nawab Malik said the letter could be the outcome of a lack of communication within the party or differences between its leaders in the state. “The functioning of various programmes and schemes of the government is interrupted due to the pandemic and lockdown, which has adversely affected state’s revenue. Its two senior ministers in the government know it. Besides, the tribal development department is headed by a Congress minister. The party’s leaders should have asked the minister what is the reality,” said Malik.State Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat on Saturday dismissed the opposition’s criticism that Gandhi’s letter indicated that all was not well with the government and it is dysfunctional. Thorat, the revenue minister in the Sena-led MVA government, said that the letter was a dialogue and not a sign of resentment. He also said the Congress would consider the opinion of Ajit Pawar, who is NCP representative in MVA’s coordination committee, and not Malik’s. While Thackeray has not reacted to the letter yet, Sena has welcomed the same and said that the points in the CMP (common minimum programme) will be implemented gradually in the coming year of the government.Thorat said, “Congress’s stand has always been in favour of the upliftment of the poor and deprived sections of the society and Gandhi’s letter was part of a dialogue on how welfare measures can be taken. There is no resentment,’’ he said. ‘’A CMP for the welfare of different sections of the society is the agenda of the MVA and Uddhav Thackeray is working in that direction. Some issues might have gone on the back-burner due to the pandemic. But the government is slowly getting back on track and focusing on the CMP,’’ Thorat added.Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut denied that there is any “pressure politics” by the Congress on the MVA government as the media is speculating. Speaking to reporters on Saturday in Mumbai, Raut said, “If the Congress party has brought forward an agenda, which is in the interest of people of Maharashtra and the state, then it should be welcomed. There are no pressure politics.”Meanwhile, the MVA allies, who tasted electoral success in the recently held legislative council elections, are not going to contest the upcoming elections of 14,234 gram pachayats in an alliance. Thackeray had said that the three parties will contest all local body elections in an alliance, but on Saturday, the Sena boss told party functionaries that the party will put candidates in almost all the gram panchayats and asked them to win maximum gram panchayats. A similar stand to bag most gram panchayat seats was taken by Thorat, while NCP state president Jayant Patil said the party never gives ticket to candidates, indicating that there will be no alliance.The gram panchayat elections are slated for January 15, and all the four political parties are gearing up for the local polls to see their individual strength and acceptability after the shift in the political dynamic that happened in November 2019 with the formation of MVA. Of the over 28,000 gram panchayats, elections to 14,234 of them in 34 districts were announced by the State Election Commission last week.The gram panchayat elections are not fought on party symbol but by forming a panel at the local level.“We are going to ensure that Congress controls most number of gram panchayat and we are confident that the Congress will get big success at the gram panchayat level,” Thorat said in a statement. Patil, meanwhile, said, “No party, and particularly NCP, does not contest gram panchayat on a party ticket and therefore parties contesting gram panchayat polls does not arise.” Thackeray has been holding meeting with party functionaries for the past three days over the preparation for the polls. He met with Sena district presidents and directed them to win maximum number of gram panchayats. At a meeting with deputy leaders and sampark pramukhs of the party held on Saturday at his official resident Varsha, Thackeray told them to take the work carried out by the Uddhav Thackeray-led government to the people in villages. A senior functionary, who was present in the meeting said, “Uddhav ji has said that the party will put up candidates on mostly all 14,000 odd gram panchayat. His instructions to all district president and contact heads was to convey work done by government during Nisarg cyclone and other natural calamities that struck the state. He has directed us to win maximum gram panchayats.”Meanwhile, addressing a press conference in Nagpur, state energy minister and chairman of AICC SC cell,, Nitin Raut insisted that the Congress president’s letter was indication of the party’s social agenda. He said Gandhi’s “revolutionary letter” will act as the guiding factor for the welfare of SC/ST communities and other backward classes under the CMP of the ruling alliance in the state. Raut trained guns at the BJP government in the Centres and the previous state government and said, “BJP governments in state and at the Centre have been conspiring to deny chances to backward classes in jobs and self employment.” He further added, “The road to progress of SC/ST and backward classes was hindered by the BJP. When the Dalit and backward classes became IAS and IFS officers, and came at par with them, they disliked it. When they became business-owners they did not like it. The Central government conducted direct recruitment of officers at joint secretary level. You will not find one person from backward classes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sonia-gandhi-s-letter-to-uddhav-thackeray-brings-unease-between-congress-ncp-to-the-fore/story-DckQMSyitCggqsGo8Drq3L.html
20-12-2020||Mumbai||Central Railway to approach offices to “encourage” staff to travel on Mumbai’s AC local trains||After receiving a poor response from passengers on its newly-launched air-conditioned (AC) local services, the Central Railway (CR) has decided to approach offices, whose employees are permitted to travel on trains, to encourage their staffers to undertake the journey on the new locals, with an aim to increase the passenger footfall. It is a rare step for the railways, as it never had to popularise its suburban train services owing to the high demand. CR in its appeal will inform office-goers that AC train journeys will cut travel time and cost lesser as compared to cabs.On Thursday, CR had introduced 10 AC train services between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Kalyan station on the slow line. The new services operate from Monday to Saturday. However, the services received poor response as only around 50 passengers travelled on AC locals on the first three days. On Saturday until 8pm, only seven passengers had travelled by the AC locals.“We will use different methods to increase passengers on AC local trains. The journey between CSMT and Kalyan is affordable and time-saving as compared to that by road. We are confident that passengers will increase in the coming days,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR.While the fare of a one-way journey between CSMT and Kalyan by a cab costs around ₹1,482, the monthly season pass of the AC local between the two locations is ₹2,135. The journey by train takes 90 minutes, as opposed to 150 minutes by cab. Passenger associations believe that the railways will witness a rise in commuters travelling in AC locals after trains are made available for all citizens. The association has also asked CR to change the timings of the trains, operate AC locals as additional services and increase their frequency. “Mumbaiites have witnessed a lot of difficulties during road travel in the past eight months. There will definitely be an increase in the number of AC train passengers after locals restart for all citizens. The timings of the trains will have to be changed according to peak hours. AC trains should be operated as additional services,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.“We are taking feedback from passengers and changes will be made after it is completed,” said a senior CR official.Currently, around 5 lakh passengers travel on CR’s mainline every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/central-railway-to-approach-offices-to-encourage-staff-to-travel-on-mumbai-s-ac-local-trains/story-jerr6anABTLdk5FH9A2sMK.html

20-12-2020||Mumbai||Ashok Jagtap appointed new Mumbai Congress chief||The Congress leadership on Saturday appointed Ashok Jagtap as Mumbai Congress president and Charan Singh Sapra as working president. Jagtap succeeded veteran leader Eknath Gaikwad, who was handling the party unit as its acting president after Milind Deora quit as the city unit chief, following the party’s defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.With elections to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) 14 months away, the city unit of the party had to have a chief as it had been without a full-time president for more than a year. Jagtap, who is known as Bhai Jagtap in political circles, is a trade union leader-turned politician and former legislator, while Sapra began with the party as a student leader. Jagtap is also known as a Maratha community leaderHK Patil, the party’s in-charge in Maharashtra, had recently held discussions with city and state leaders on selecting the new city unit chief to revive the party organisation ahead of the 2022 Mumbai civic polls. Earlier this week, all key Mumbai Congress leaders were summoned to Delhi by the Congress’s top brass to discuss the issue. The party also employed technology to get feedback from functionaries in the city to appoint the Mumbai Regional Congress Committee chief. A name for the next chief was sought through an interactive voice response call with its functionaries. Besides the feedback from around 450 Congress functionaries via a call, other inputs were also sought from various quarters before the decision was finalised, senior Congress functionaries said.A senior party leader said the leadership decided to appoint a Marathi face as its Mumbai unit head. The party leadership has also tried to accommodate different factions within the party by appointing their leaders in key positions. Mohammad Arif Naseem Khan, a former minister, will head the campaign committee, while Amarjit Singh Manhans will head the coordination committee. Suresh Shetty has been appointed head of manifesto and publication committee. Khan, Manhans and Shetty were aspirants for the city unit chief’s post. Jagtap was not available for his reaction. Sapra said: “Our priority is to rejuvenate the party’s organisation in Mumbai and ensure the party wins the upcoming Mumbai civic polls.”Mumbai-based political analyst Surendra Jondhale said the appointment of Jagtap could be a fresh start for the party, which has had a bad run, with respect to its city chief, in the past few years. “Bhai Jagtap has solid grass-root level contacts, a strong organisational background and good understanding of city politics as he was a trade unionist. A reason for his selection could be because he is not seen attached to any factions within the city Congress outfit. It is a good start for Congress and Jagtap,” he said.However, Jagtap’s trade unionist background could be a hindrance for him to connect with the corporate class in Mumbai. “Since the time of SK Patil to Murli Deora to Gurudas Kamat to Milind Deora, all Mumbai Congress bosses had excellent relations with the Mumbai Inc. It will have to be seen how Jagtap can manage to connect with corporates, since he was always on the other side divide, given his background,” Jondhale added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ashok-jagtap-appointed-new-mumbai-congress-chief/story-T2daVWYrTFiWqYpLnraCuM.html

20-12-2020||Noida||Greater Noida: South Korean national among four arrested under anti-conversion law||Four persons, including a foreign national, were arrested Saturday for allegedly pressurising two families in Greater Noida for religious conversion. According to the police, the four suspects had allegedly been visiting the two families for the last six months and supporting them financially, and recently, had started pressuring them for conversion. Pradeep Tripathi, station house officer Surajpur police station, said that the prime accused, Mu Cu Lee, 50, belongs to Seoul in South Korea and is allegedly involved in missionary activities in Greater Noida. “The woman had been visiting India for some years and getting people to convert after luring them with financial benefits. She is associated with some missionary organisation. She had already converted three – Seema, 25, a resident of Chapartala in Prayagraj and Sandhya, 24, Koraon in Prayagraj. She had also coaxed a man, Umesh Kumar, 30, who worked as Lee’s driver, for religious conversion,” he said. The three have are also accused in the case and have been arrested.Tripathi said that while Lee lived in a high-rise society in Sector Beta 2 area, the three lived in a rented accommodation in Malakpur village in Surajpur. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that Lee had allegedly identified two Indian families in Surajpur Kasba for this purpose. “She was providing rations and other assistance to the two families, since they were poor. She was also asking them to visit Church on Sundays,” he said. Locals said that the four persons had allegedly reached the victims’ house at 11 am in a car on Saturday. They allegedly held two of the family members and started chanting some verses from religious scripture, the victims said. “The suspects also told the victims to remove idols of their religion from their houses. This led to a heated argument and some locals gathered at the spot,” the victims alleged to the police. A police team reached the spot after getting a call from a local. “When we questioned the victims, they admitted that the suspects were pressuring them for conversion. We then arrested the four suspects,” they said.

Additional DCP Goswami said that the concerned sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) was informed for further legal proceedings.A senior fire officer who was leading the rescue operation said that since the factory building was in a narrow lane, the fire tenders could not reach there. He said that the building only had one entry and exit and it was partially blocked because of the metal items and debris.“There were five big and small lathe machines just on the ground floor. Prime facie, it appears that they all were functioning. The shacking of the machines and the overload of metal items may have led to the roof collapse. No fire safety arrangements were found in the building,” he said.Workers and locals became the first responderAs the mishap took place, around 20 people, including a dozen workers working on the building’s first floor and locals, rushed to save the lives of the six trapped workers. The collapse of hundreds of kilos of debris led to a power cut and created a cloud of dust, rendering the first responders blind for at least a couple of minutes.“The entire area was dark and we were not able to see anything. Since we did not hear anyone’s scream from inside, our first impression that everyone was dead. But as we began our rescue , we found Ravi lying near lathe machine, crying in pain and asking for help. He was not able to move his body because of fractures in his back,” said Raju Singh, a local resident.Another resident, Deepak Yadav, said that it took almost half an hour to rescue the trapped workers, despite 20 people worked together and removing the debris. “By the time the rescue teams reached, we had already rescued four people from the debris. The faces of two women were crushed beyond identification,” added Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/four-killed-after-roof-of-loft-collapses-in-vishnu-garden-building/story-kg1Jtop3mYrEeJlnv2b6QP.html
20-12-2020||Delhi||Court takes cognisance of offence of sedition against Sharjeel Imam||A Delhi court on Saturday took cognizance of a supplementary charge sheet filed against JNU student Sharjeel Imam in connection to a case related to alleged inflammatory speeches during the protests against CAA and NRC at Jamia Milia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University (AMU).Imam was arrested on January 28 from Bihar’s Jehanabad in the case related to violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) near Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) in December last year.Imam is being probed for his alleged inflammatory speech at Jamia on December 13 and subsequently on January 16 at AMU, where he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat took cognizance of the offence for sedition (124A), promoting religious enmity (153A), 153B (assertion prejudicial to national integration) and 505 (circulation of certain statement, rumours etc) of the Indian Penal Code against Imam while noting that sanction has been granted by the Delhi government under the provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).On July 29, a city court had taken cognizance under charges of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and other charges under the IPC. However, the judge had deferred the cognizance on the section 124A/153A/153B/505 IPC for the want of requisite sanction.On Saturday, the police, through Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad, filed the supplementary charge sheet mentioning the permission granted by the Delhi government for Imam’s prosecution under sedition and promoting religious enmity.Following this, the court said, “The requisite sanction under section 196 CrPC in the form of supplementary charge­sheet has been filed. I have perused the supplementary charge ­sheet. In view of the same, I take cognizance for commission of offence under Section 124A/153A/153B/505 IPC”.The city police’s crime branch had filed the charge sheet in the Patiala House Court on July 27 against Imam in the case registered against him on January 25.The charge sheet has been filed under several relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act including sedition, promoting enmity between groups, and spreading rumors, etc.“In the garb of protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA), he (Imam) exhorted people of a particular community to block the highways leading to the major cities and resort to ‘chakka jaam’, thereby disrupting normal life. Also, in the name of opposing CAA, he also openly threatened to cut off Assam and other Northeastern states from the rest of the country,” police had said.In this case Imam has been charged for delivering the ‘inflammatory and seditious’ speech. The officer said that in this same case, police later added sections of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against Imam. Citing the charges against Imam, police had said that the charge sheet filed had mentioned, “In the grab of protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA), he (Imam) exhorted people of a particular community to block the highways leading to the major cities and resort to ‘chakka jaam’, thereby disrupting normal life.“He also openly defied the constitution and called it a fascist document. Also, in the name of opposing CAA he also openly propagated blocking North-East states with the rest of the country,” a police officer had said.Imam was allegedly involved in organising protests at Shaheen Bagh but came into limelight after a video showed him making controversial comments before a gathering at Aligarh Muslim University, following which he was booked under sedition charges.Separate cases have also been registered against him in Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/court-takes-cognisance-of-offence-of-sedition-against-sharjeel-imam/story-Amj6l8LL2sHJngUNIza7TN.html
20-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi records lowest number of Covid-19 cases in 117 days||Delhi on Saturday conducted more than 87,000 tests, and reported 1,139 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) — the lowest in 117 days, since 1,061 cases were reported on August 24. With fewer new cases, Delhi saw its positivity rate drop to 1.30% on Saturday – the second lowest since the government started providing daily data on number of tests and cases since early April. The positivity rate – proportion of samples that test positive among the total tested – has remained below 2% for the fifth day in a row. Experts believe that the spread of the infection is in control if the positivity rate remains at 5% or less for two weeks. In Delhi, it has been 5% or less for 18 days now. This is the first time that Delhi has seen the positivity rate remaining below the 5% threshold for an extended period of time. Previously, it had remained below 6% for 17 days between September-end and mid-October. With fewer new cases and higher number of recoveries, the number of active cases or those with current infection has reduced to 10,358 as on Saturday, lowest since August 10. At its peak, Delhi saw 44,456 concurrent infections in mid-November. Also Read| Covid-19: Delhi has overcome third wave, says KejriwalOn Saturday, the city also reported 32 deaths due to the infection, taking the total toll to 10,251 so far. The seven-day case fatality ratio – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – was 2.58% on Saturday. In comparison, Delhi’s 7-day average CFR was 1.55% on November 18 when the city reported the highest number of deaths 1 131. “The declining number of cases and positivity rate is a good sign. With a huge proportion of people having been infected in the city, especially during the surge last month, it seems unlikely that Delhi would see a surge in cases again. Some infections may continue to be reported from pockets where people have been left unexposed. A spike in Delhi is only possible if the virus mutates, if a lot of susceptible people migrate into the city, or years later when there are a substantial number of children who are unexposed to the virus,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital. Also Read: India bans Covid-19 rapid antigen test kits by Korean company for 7 daysHe said, even on a national level a surge is unlikely as the infection has already spread even to rural areas. “The virus may just disappear just like its predecessor SARS,” he said. SARS is caused by a similar virus from the coronavirus family that caused an outbreak in 2002-03 that infected about 8,000 people and killed 774 globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-records-the-lowest-number-of-cases-in-117-days/story-w0SeUdvN6KzRsM0tsiifTN.html
20-12-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi has overcome third wave, says Kejriwal||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said Delhi seems to have overcome the third wave of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said that from a peak of around 8,600 fresh cases on a single day, the national Capital’s Covid-19 situation seems to have “significantly” improved, with only 1,133 new cases being reported in the last 24 hours. He also claimed that each and every Covid-19 test conducted in Delhi is genuine and that no “fraud” was done, as reported in some other states.“There was a time in November when for every 100 persons tested for Covid-19, over 15 used to test positive. The positivity rate back then was 15.26%. Today, the positivity rate has come down to 1.3%. This is probably the lowest in the country. In today’s health bulletin, which will be released shortly, the total tests done in the past 24 hours were 87,000,” he said.According to Saturday’s bulletin, the positivity rate in Delhi has remained below 2% for the fifth consecutive day. Kejriwal further said there was a time when Delhi had 45,000 active Covid-19 cases, which came down to almost 12,000 on Saturday. The recovery rate of the city is nearly 96.5%. On November 19, Delhi had recorded the highest number of fatalities with 131 deaths in a single day. On Saturday, the number of Covid-19 deaths in a single day was 36.Also Read: Delhi records the lowest number of cases in 117 days“In Delhi, testing was most important for us to fight Covid-19. I am proud of our doctors, officers and other corona warriors who have helped us increase the city’s testing numbers. Till August 20, Delhi used to conduct about 20,000 Covid-19 tests every day. When the second wave came, we increased this to 60,000 tests per day in just about 10 days. When the third wave came, we increased this to 90,000 tests per day. We tested and isolated people, which has been our main Covid-19 management strategy,” Kejriwal said.On December 16, Delhi, for the first time, conducted 90,354 tests for Covid-19 in a single day - the most the city has ever seen. Delhi saw its first wave in June, the second in September and the third in November. The chief minister said the current daily figure of about 90,000 tests per day in the city is not only the highest in the country, but is also one of the highest across the world.“Today, Delhi is conducting 4,500 tests per million of population every day. Uttar Pradesh is testing only 670 people per million daily. Gujarat is testing 850 people per million every day. In the USA, 4,300 tests per million are being conducted every day. England is testing more than Delhi, though, with 4,800 tests per million,” Kejriwal said.Also Read| Covid-19: WHO was warned lives were at risk over yanked report on ItalyHe reiterated that the national Capital was the first in the world to introduce the home isolation system, which reduced the load on the city’s hospitals manifold. He cited the example of New York City, how despite having only around 5,600 new cases per day, it had patients lying in hospital corridors for want of treatment. Kejriwal said that even when Delhi had 8,600 cases on a single day, the city had over 7,000 beds vacant for Covid-19 patients. He also recalled how the city was the first to start plasma therapy which helped keep the number of deaths low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-has-overcome-third-wave-kejriwal-on-covid-19-in-capital/story-M6u0vzFMmsirQwrRwuPnSK.html
20-12-2020||Delhi||‘Special’ langar menu, ardaas, paath on martyrdom day at Singhu border||December 19, the martyrdom day of Guru Teg Bahadur, the ninth guru of the Sikhs, marked an early start to the day at Singhu border on Saturday, with the morning ardaas (prayer) and a paath (religious readings), followed by the day-long agitation, in between which a special langar was served. The protestors, majority of them Sikhs, also paid a visit to a memorial of Guru Teg Bahadur, located right next to the protest site, where many of the farmers have been camping since the first day of the protest.Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), Ludhiana said, on Saturday the songs they usually play in the mornings and evenings on loudspeakers were replaced by bhajan and paath. “It is Guru Teg Bahadur’s martyrdom day. Unlike every day, we started our movement with ardaas and paath and in the evening too, a paath was organised specially for the day. The activities throughout the day remained more religious on Saturday than other days,” the farmer leader said.On their next move, Lakhowal said that all farmer leaders are scheduled to meet on Sunday to chalk out strategy further and plan on how to proceed with their demands of getting all three new farm laws repealed.Also Read: PM Modi stresses on India’s economic potential, defends new farm lawsThroughout Saturday, the loudspeakers at the border mostly echoed religious teachings or bhajans. The main stage also, most of the time, remained occupied by those talking about Guru Teg Bahadur’s valour and inspiring the participants of the agitation to not lose patience and stay united until “justice is served”.In the afternoon, langars had a special menu. Maan Singh, a worker at a gurdwara management in Delhi that is running one of the biggest community kitchens at Singhu border, said they served prasad in the morning followed by breakfast. “Since the day started early on Saturday, our kitchen also had to start functioning early. We are serving tea round the clock. On the occasion of the shahid diwas (martyrdom day), we had matar-paneer and sarso ka saag with makki ki roti for lunch. Since this is langar, we do not call it a special meal but today’s menu was a little different than usual,” said Singh, who is managing the biggest langar at the border.He said that on Saturday, the gathering was bigger than other days. “Every day, we serve at least 70,000 to 80,000 meals at our langars. On Saturday, as it was a special occasion, we were expecting a larger turnout. By night, at least one lakh to 1.25 lakh meals will be served here,” he added. The count includes four to five rounds of meals a day, including breakfasts, lunch, dinners and sweet dishes.The site also witnessed a swell in gathering on Saturday as more people visited the border to add their voice to the farmers’ demands. Many said they had come in solidarity while some were here to eat the prasad (religious offering) at the langars (community kitchen).Also Read: Next round of talks with farmers could be held in the next 2-3 days, says Haryana CM after meeting TomarRatanveer Singh, a resident of Tilak Nagar, said he had come to visit the protest site on the occasion of Guru Teg Bahadur’s martyrdom day. “We’re here to support the cause for which the farmers have gathered at the doorstep of Delhi. Their demands need to be met. We stand in solidarity with the farmers,” said 28-year-old Singh, who was visiting Singhu border for the third time on Saturday. Chetan Singh, a student of B.Com from the Delhi University, who visited the Singhu Border on Saturday, said this was his first time there. “We had food at the langar. It is one of the best meals I’ve had. No country can run without the support of its farmers,” he said.A group of visually impaired supporters from Punjab also arrived at Singhu border on Saturday to express solidarity with the agitating farmers. Farmer leader Lakhowal said they’re overwhelmed by the support of the differently-abled people and that such voices will only strengthen their fight for a better future for the farmers of the country. The day also saw a blood donation camp at Singhu border. Many farmers and visitors donated blood that the organisers said will be used for the treatment of thalassemia and cancer.Also Read: Farmers uproot BJP workers’ tent in Fatehabad for fast backing farm lawsOne of the organisers, not authorised to speak to the media, said the blood donation camp was from 10 am till 3pm. “The turnout was good. Till afternoon, we received 36 units of blood. We will set up more such camps here as well as at other border areas where farmers are camping,” the organiser said, asking to not be named.Senior police officers said that as the farmers; agitation entered 23rd day on Saturday, it overall remained peaceful. Jitendra Kumar Meena, additional deputy commissioner of police, said nothing untoward was reported. “We maintained sufficient deployment. The situation is being monitored regularly,” Meena said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/special-langar-menu-ardaas-paath-on-martyrdom-day-at-singhu-border/story-ODEraH1ZNvx7VTXy6HXpLO.html
20-12-2020||Delhi||Take legal recourse, AAP’s Durgesh Pathak tells BJP on MCD funds||Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak on Saturday said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporation should take legal recourse if they feel that the Delhi government actually owes them money. “If the BJP thinks that our government has any dues left with the MCD, they should take the court’s route. Instead of putting banners across the city and staging fake protests, they should opt for more lawful means to get the money from the AAP government,” he said on Saturday. “But, they are not doing it because in reality, they are merely playing politics. The AAP government has no dues left with the MCD. I want to tell every teacher, doctor, sanitation worker, or any other employee who works with the MCD that this is the actual truth,” Pathak said. He also took a dig at the Congress for not “saying a word” on the issue raised by the AAP with regard to the alleged Rs 2,400 crore scam where the north municipal corporation waived off the sum for the south civic body over rent of office occupancy at the Civic Centre — the MCD headquarters. “As per some news reports, a municipality school teacher has written a letter to the President of India and has appealed that either his salary be paid immediately or he should be allowed to die by suicide. During these Covid-19 times, they have not been paid their salary for the last 4-5 months. This has worsened their already bad situation. There are high court orders for everyone to see, and none of them mention that the AAP government has any dues left with the MCD,” he said. Hitting back, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the AAP should know that the case related to MCDs funds is still in the Delhi high court. “AAP’s Pathak should not try to confuse the matter by showing court orders of a different case pertaining to demand of salary by employees. There is no scam in North MCD and we once again challenge the Delhi government to immediately order a CBI inquiry into this wild allegation of the Rs 2,400 crore scam. Chief minister Kejriwal should be prepared to resign if the allegation falls flat,” he said. Abhishek Dutt, vice-president of Delhi Congress and leader of Congress in south corporation said, “We have demanded a forensic audit of the BJP-ruled Municipal Corporations of Delhi by a sitting Delhi high court judge. Despite having several sources of income, the MCDs are perennially short of funds under the BJP rule and the AAP government in Delhi is only contributing to the mess, by either delaying or not paying the money they owe to the corporations. If the audit is held, then accountability can be fixed for the reasons of the disappearance/leakage of the funds.”He further said “The three mayors and Kejriwal were playing out a “pre-conceived drama” to divert people’s attention from the farmers’ dharna on the Delhi borders and mismanagement of the Covid pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/take-legal-recourse-pathak-tells-bjp-on-mcd-funds/story-KHpUwYHJ3AZjMUqgxBg8JI.html
20-12-2020||Delhi||After 13 days, mayors call off protest outside CM residence||Thirteen days after they started camping in front of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s Flagstaff Road residence, the mayors and councillors of all three BJP-led municipal corporations called off their sit-in protest on Saturday, following a Delhi high court order.The Delhi Police had served the protesting mayors a notice to vacate the venue citing the court order. Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri, along with Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, and other senior leaders visited the mayors and councillors at the protest site on Saturday. The Delhi high court on Friday asked the Delhi police to shift protesters outside Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s house stating that the protest gives an incorrect signal that the prohibitory orders of the Delhi District Management Authority (DDMA), in view of Covid-19 spread, are not being followed.“You have to shift them (protesters). The district magistrate has to pass an order. Otherwise, an incorrect signal will go,” Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva had told the police on Friday after a plea by the Civil Lines Residents Association contended that the protest was causing an inconvenience as agitators were blocking the road.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash, who was undergoing treatment at the protest site, said that they have been served notice by the Delhi police to vacate the protest venue. “We are law abiding citizens. We will follow the court’s order and leave the venue. But our protest will continue in a different form. We will now take this battle to each ward,” said Jai Prakash. On Saturday, the health of several councillors deteriorated during the third day of their indefinite hunger strike. South corporation mayor Anamika Singh was admitted to Hindu Rao hospital after her condition deteriorated. Her condition is said to be stable right now. Earlier in the day, speaking to the media after meeting those sitting on protest, Puri said, “These people have been sitting on protest for the past 13 days not for themselves, but for the employees of municipal corporations. They have raised the issue about problems faced by employees, especially during the pandemic, as the corporations are unable to pay salaries. Instead of helping them, the government is not releasing Rs 13,000 crore. The CM didn’t even come and speak to them. There can be change of heart and I hope he (Kejriwal) understands the gravity of the situation and finds a solution to the problem.”Even though the sit-in outside the CM’s residence was called off, the BJP said that the protest for funds will continue. From December 25, birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Late Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP is planning a door-to-door campaign to tell people about how the government was not paying Rs 13,000 crore. “It is unfortunate that he couldn’t take out time to even meet the mayors to find a solution to the problem. Today, Delhi has seen the real face of the CM, who is insensitive to the problems of the people. The CM is not letting the municipal corporations work,” said Gupta. The mayors have been protesting outside the CM’s residence to press for the immediate release of Rs 13,000 crore which they claim the Delhi government owes the municipal corporations. They say that the corporations have not been able to pay salaries to its employees for the past two-three months due to the financial crunch. Nirmal Jain, mayor of East corporation, said, “We might not sit outside the CM’s house, but our protest will continue. We will now take it to the people and tell them about how the Delhi government is not letting us work. We will tell them about the plight of our employees, whom we are not able to pay for the past two-three months.”Reacting to the allegations, senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said, “BJP leaders who are sitting outside the residence of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal are doing drama. For the last 13 days, the BJP-ruled MCD is not working because these leaders are sitting outside the residence of chief minister. In the last 15 years, the BJP has completely ruined the MCD. Garbage is piled up everywhere because the MCDs do not perform their duty....To distract the attention of the citizens of Delhi from the Rs 2,400 crore scam done by the BJP, they are doing this drama.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/after-13-days-mayors-call-off-protest-from-outside-cm-s-residence/story-8gnlhKTGHcLzFCLAyALv8J.html
20-12-2020||Pune||AISSMS engg students win at national contest||A team of engineering students representing Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and from AISSMS College of Engineering Pune, got first rank at the national-level Anveshan 2019-20 competition in engineering and technology category. The team presented a model named as “Automated Railway Crossing with Auto Train Speed Control and Live Tracking Technology”. The model focused on automatic railway crossings depending on the train speed and will help reduce accidents on tracks. The students namely Anurag Lambor (BE, electrical engineering) and Gaurav Dudhe (TE, civil engineering) participated in the competition at undergraduate level. Earlier the Avishkar Research Convention 2019-20 was organised at different colleges across Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune. For the preliminary round, more than 6,000 entries were received of which 2,500 were selected. The AISSMS team of Lambhor and Dudhe won at both university and national levels. Their project was awarded first rank in the best innovation award among Pure Science, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Engineering and Technology, Medicine and Pharmacy ideas. The team was awarded by Nehru Science Centre and National Centre for Science Communicators and was selected for West Zone Anveshan - the Student Research Convention jointly organised by Association of Indian Universities, New Delhi and Department of Student’ Development, University of Mumbai at Mumbai University, Kalina Campus on February 19-20 this year. The team AISSMS COE Pune represented Maharashtra State and SPPU under the category of UG - Engineering and Technology against UG , PG, PPG and PhD level teams from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Goa, Madhya Pradesh ad Maharashtra states. Lambhor said, “With the use of this technology which we have shown in our project, it will activate spikes once the shutters at the railway crossing being closed and will not allow people to cross the tracks. Every year hundreds of people die in such mishaps while crossing the tracks and so we focused on this major subject. Also, for bike riders crossing the tracks, in our system it will puncture the wheels of the rider once they start crossing the track.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/engineering-students-representing-sppu-win-first-prize-at-national-contest/story-UiccwXwgPTXfrPTaY9CyNN.html

20-12-2020||Pune||Maharashtra sees 174 leopard deaths in 2020||After a leopard in Solapur was shot dead by a sharp shooter, the number of deaths of big cats in Maharashtra this year has gone up to 174, 60% more than the figure registered in 2019 that saw 110 leopard deaths, according to the state forest department (wildlife) authorities. On December 18, a leopard that had killed at least eight people and injured others in Beed, Aurangabad and Solapur forest divisions since November 15 was shot dead by the state forest department after 10-day chase involving choppers and sharp shooters. The highest number of wild cat deaths was recorded in Nashik with 70 leopard deaths, followed by 27 in Pune and 26 in Kolhapur districts respectively.Out of 174 leopard deaths till December 2020, 85 died natural deaths, 64 accident-related, 18 cases of poaching while seven animals died because of electrocution. The forest department in its report mentioned that leopard deaths due to road and train accidents had doubled from last year. Seventeen leopards died in road and train accidents in 2019 compared with 34 for 2020. Similarly, 25 leopards drowned in 2020 as compared to 10 last year.The forest department report states that loss of human life due to leopard attacks has gone up three times. Twenty-three people died in attacks in 2019 while 35 died in 2020. A total of 37 leopards were rescued in 2020. Taking the man-animal conflict into consideration, the state wildlife board in November decided to set up a committee to assess the damage to humans in most vulnerable spots involving leopard population especially in rural Maharashtra. A study group is scheduled to be formed under the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) (wildlife) to address the issue in a holistic manner aimed at mitigating the evolving situationMaharashtra has seen 35 deaths due to leopard attacks till December which is the highest in a decade, the forest department stated in its report.Vidya Athreya, a scientist at Wildlife Conservation Society - India, said, “It is important for the forest department to take proactive measures to check leopard deaths. Earlier the man-animal conflict in Junnar and Mumbai was intense, but later reduced considerably. The conflict reduction model of Mumbai and Junnar needs to be replicated in other sensitive areas of Maharashtra. We need to have over bridges or underpasses at places where leopards cross to make a safe passage so that casualties can be avoided.”Jayarame Gowda, deputy conservator of forests (Junnar division) said, “Junnar, Shirur and Ambegaon terrain is the leopard belt of the state and its territory is expanding as most of the geographical spread is sugarcane belt area. Sugarcane cultivation has increased thrice over the past and it is a favourable habitat for leopards. It is a congenial atmosphere and there is no disturbance once the animal goes deep inside a cane field. Sheep and goat population is equally good in the area where leopards get enough prey. Deaths are increasing due to accidents either through road accidents, drowning and territorial fights.” The story of big catsLeopard population across India is between 12,000 and 14,000 as per the 2016 census,According to Phase IV tiger estimation exercise in 2020, 669 leopards have been recorded in Maharashtra.According to the state forest department, 173 leopard deaths were officially reported till November85 leopards died of natural causes64 died in roads accident 18 fell prey to poaching7 died of electrocutionMaharashtra sees 35 deaths due to leopard attacks in 2020||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-forest-dept-records-174-leopard-deaths-this-year/story-oarcoUfkqZEzUbzTF97iyJ.html
20-12-2020||Pune||Leopard rescued from 70ft deep well in Ballalwadi||A 1.5 years old male leopard was rescued from a 70-foot well in Ballalwadi located in Junnar sub-division of Pune district by Maharashtra forest department and Wildlife SOS on Saturday. The animal is under medical observation. A farmer heard frantic roars of an animal echoing from a well near a field in the early hours of the morning. He found the leopard struggling to stay afloat in waist-deep water. The forest department and Wildlife SOS team were alerted and a three-member team rescued the leopard.“Sometimes leopards enter village chasing stray dogs, and with shrubs covering the well, they fall in the well,” said Ajit Shinde, range forest officer, Ballalwadi.Crowd control measures were implemented by the team to manage onlookers as a trap cage was lowered into the well and, after a few attempts, the leopard entered the cage and was rescued.“After being carefully loaded onto the back of the Wildlife SOS rescue vehicle, the leopard was transferred to the Leopard Rescue Centre for medical examination. The animal is exhausted from the ordeal and will be kept under observation for a few days till he is deemed fit for release,” said Nikhil Bangar, wildlife veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/leopard-rescued-from-70ft-deep-well-in-ballalwadi/story-4YEFn3a0KxoqqETnMe0tqN.html

Despite opting for new adaptive measures like phone sex, masks and gloves as the job involves physical contact, customers are hesitant to visit fearing risk of the infection.Located at the heart of Pune, Budhwar peth offers a contrasting picture with areas like Laxmi road, Tulshibaug and Mandai overcrowded with shoppers while the narrow bylanes where the CSWs run business wear a deserted look. One of the oldest and largest red-light areas in the state, Budhwar peth houses around 3,000 sex workers earning their livelihood at the 700 small and big brothels. Though CSWs were permitted to reopen their business in June, measures like phone sex and other standard operating procedures (SOPs) have failed to attract customers, said Tejaswi Sevekari, executive director of Pune-based NGO Saheli. With no new customer visits and only regulars trickling back, survival for these workers has become difficult. “It is unpredictable as to when the business will again pick up,” said Sevekari, whose NGO has been working for CSWs for more than two decades. In November, the Maharashtra government decided to provide financial help of Rs 15,000 to each registered commercial sex worker for a period of three months from October to December 2020. However, in the absence of bank account, transfer of funds has not happened for some. “I don’t have any paper or bank account. Hence, I have not received any state aid,” said a CSW, who has been in the business for over 10 years after coming to the city from Hindi heartland. In existence since the Peshwa era, most CSWs in the red-light area of Budhwar peth have mostly migrated from West Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. “When the lockdown restrictions were lifted, we thought the worst is over. But the number of clients visiting us is very low as per our expectations,” she said. “The CSWs opted for online measures, but with limited success. The women are not trained to do that and are also afraid of losing their confidentiality” said Sevekari. The major reason for few footfall, apart from the obvious crippling fear of contracting Covid-19, is the fact that majority of clientele are struggling as they belong to the class worst hit by the lockdown, according to the NGO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sops-like-phone-sex-masks-fail-to-attract-clients-in-budhwar-peth-red-light-area/story-4erdaBPh1WEY5dRnRacFhJ.html
20-12-2020||Mumbai||5-time MP Mohan Rawale was known for Parel brand of Shiv Sena politics, says Raut||Five-time Shiv Sena parliamentarian Mohan Rawale passed away in Goa on Saturday morning following a cardiac arrest. He was 72. Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray condoled Rawale’s demise. A statement issued by his office on Saturday evening read, “The demise of Mohan Rawale, who represented Mumbaikars in the Parliament for a long time, came as a shock. He had a connect with the common man because of his nature and style of working. The entire Shiv Sena family shares the grief of his family. May God give peace to his soul. A heartfelt tribute to former MP (Member of Parliament) Mohan Rawale.” Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson and MP Sanjay Raut also paid his tributes to Rawale. Raut said that Rawale had represented the ‘Parel brand’ of the party’s identity, referring to the politics followed by leaders coming from the middle class mill workers’ family from the Marathi community-dominated central Mumbai. The Parel-Lalbaug area has been considered the Sena stronghold for decades. “Mohan Rawale passed away at 4am in Goa. I used to regularly tell him to cut down on his work due to his ill health. Mohan was a Shiv Sainik of ‘Parel brand’. Despite being a five-time MP, he was very accessible; anybody on the street could stop him to speak about their issues. Mohan’s passing is really shocking for all of us. The new generation of Shiv Sena leaders must learn from him,” Raut said. Raut also recalled Rawale’s contributions since the party’s inception and said he was beaten up and jailed by the police during agitations and had “spilled his blood” for the party. “This son of a mill worker had alone disrupted the proceedings of the Parliament once. Mohan had continuously worked for the party and was the face of the common man in the Sena,” Raut said. Rawale was briefly expelled from the Sena in 2013 after an outburst against the leadership, alleging it was being run by middlemen. The old guard of the party, including Rawale and former CM Manohar Joshi, had developed problems after the change of leadership in the party during Bal Thackeray’s final days and after his death. He had attacked party chief Uddhav Thackeray’s personal assistant Milind Narvekar for allegedly creating a divide between the leadership and the workers.

He had also served as the president of Sena’s youth wing Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sena from 1979-1984 and had worked closely with Sena supremo the late Bal Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/5-time-mp-mohan-rawale-was-known-for-parel-brand-of-shiv-sena-politics-says-raut/story-7i35humZTbLszV3D6oTcvJ.html

Tiwari, a TMC MLA from Pandabeshwar, had resigned from the party after accusing the top leadership of depriving Asansol city and not allowing central funds to flow in. On Friday, however, Tiwari met Aroop Biswas, a State minister and a senior TMC leader, in the latter’s office in south Kolkata and said that he would remain with the TMC and would ask for forgiveness from TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee. On Friday afternoon, Banerjee had sent a strong message to party rebels in a meeting with the party’s top leadership. She had branded the TMC leaders, who were deserting the party, as baggage.

Tiwari’s U-turn came after senior BJP leaders, including Union minister Babul Supriyo, expressed their reservations against Tiwari joining the BJP. Even though Tiwari had never said that he was going to join the BJP, there were widespread speculations that he might join the BJP with a few other former TMC leaders. “There can be some misunderstanding within a family. Tiwari is with the TMC,” said Biswas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/2-tmc-rebels-make-u-turn-swear-allegiance-to-mamata-banerjee/story-HeUK7HV7CsLNWcZrtQC8sM.html
20-12-2020||Delhi||Punjab farmers got 30% higher crop price than their Bihar counterparts due to MSP, says new study||The farmers in Punjab’s regulated agriculture markets got 30% more price for their produce than their counterparts in unregulated and partially regulated mandis in Bihar and Odisha in 2018-19, revealed a new study that termed minimum support price (MSP) as the only risk-management instrument for cultivators. The study was conducted by the University of Pennsylvania Institute for the Advanced Study of India through surveys and research in collaboration with local research institutes to understand the dynamics of agriculture trading systems in the three states. It comes at a time when the farmers from Punjab, Haryana and some other states are protesting against the central government’s three farm laws, demanding they be scrapped. In Punjab, 90% of the farm produce is traded in markets regulated under the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act by licensed commission agents. Bihar abolished the APMC Act in 2006 and traders and private players can buy produce directly from the farmers. Odisha has both the market system and farm gate procurement. Shoumitro Chatterjee, co-author of the study, said in a tweet, “We found that the price gap between open market sales and public procurement was a significant 30% and deregulation of markets, as in Bihar, had helped traders, more than farmers as their access to farm produce improved.” “The erstwhile APMC markets (now unregulated) in Bihar still remain the main produce selling venues that have a dilapidated infrastructure. On the other hand, the Punjab markets have better infrastructure and are within the reach of farmers,” he tweeted, clearly showing that private sector investment has not helped build agriculture infrastructure in Bihar on the expected lines. The study said that only 5% and 11% mostly big farmers in Bihar and Odisha sell their produce to government agencies whereas in Punjab even the small and marginal farmers benefit from government procurement. Nearly 80% Bihar and Odisha farmers are small and marginal, according to the agriculture ministry data. “Inadequate procurement centres, delay in start of procurement and payments are the reasons most farmers in Bihar and Odisha prefer to sell their produce to the private players,” the study conducted in seven districts of the three states found. Despite these constraints, the farmers prefer selling to government agencies because of the assured MSP. In Bihar, the farmers told the surveyors that they would like to sell maize, the flagship crop, to government because of the MSP but there are not enough procurement centres, it added. ‘Govt insurance scheme has poor penetration’ “The study clearly shows that the MSP is the only risk management instrument available to the farmers as crop insurance scheme of the government has poor acceptability and penetration,” Chatterjee said in a tweet. Crop insurance was availed by less than 7% farmers in Bihar and Odisha while it was even less than 1% in Punjab. The reason for this is a cumbersome process to get claims and low insurance value of the produce. Unlike Punjab, the farmer-trader relationship was weak in Bihar and Odisha where due to the absence of the mandi system the growers seldom sell their produce to the same dealer every year, it was revealed. Contrary to the popular perception, there is transparency in the farmer payment system in Punjab due to online disbursement of money. The commission agents or arhtiyas can pay only up to Rs 10,000 in cash and the rest has to be transferred to the farmer’s bank account. The government transfers commission of agents directly into their bank accounts, as per the Central government’s mandi system reforms in 2018. In Bihar and Odisha, there is no such transparency as unregulated small traders have replaced the licensed ones. “In Odisha, there were instances of cartelisation, collusion during the sale of chilly and farmers were forced to sell at lower prices,” the study said. Former Union agriculture secretary Siraj Hussain said, ““It is a comprehensive study which summaries the ground reality. It clearly outlined that marketing challenges are more pronounced in Bihar where commission charged by middlemen for several crops in informal markets are much higher than in the regulated markets in Punjab and Odisha.” ‘Assured market needed for crop diversification’ The study also underlined that as MSP could be a hindrance in the way of crop diversification as it provides price assurance for a given crop, with the farmers growing too much of wheat and paddy in Punjab and Haryana despite a high demand for cereals and pulses. But diversification cannot be achieved through legal reforms as it requires several coordinated public investments on the ground, Chatterjee said. R Ramakumar, a professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, said if the government wants the farmers to diversify crops through the three laws, it would weaken the MSP system. “The government needs to sit with the farmers and assure them of compensation for the income loss due to diversification. This can be done through higher MSP for crop or through cash,” he said. Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said the mandi system was well established and working well for decades. “For crop diversification, the farmers need assured market to sell their produce. The area under basmati (not covered under the MSP regime) saw a massive jump last year, but got reduced this time because the prices dropped. Though the government has declared MSP for 23 crops, there is no assured procurement for most,” he said. Admitting the state was short of regulated markets, an official of the Odisha food and civil supplies department said they are continuously upgrading facilities so that more small and marginal farmers can sell their paddy under the MSP system. Bihar agriculture minister Amrendra Pratap Singh said findings of the study are far from ground reality. “What is the basis of such findings? They (researchers) do not know the system. The MSP of paddy is Rs 1,868 per quintal and it is transferred directly to the farmers’ accounts. You cannot deposit less than the MSP in their account,” said Singh.

But the effective work of the intelligence agencies, bound to the law and national interests, has undoubtedly always been and will always be extremely important for Russia,” Putin said at the SVR headquarters.National security, according to the Russian leader, is one of the most crucial warrants of the sovereign, democratic and diverse society, which can withstand any challenges.“Among these challenges is international terrorism. ... We remember everyone who died defending Russia from this ruthless enemy that our country faced in the most difficult period of its history,” Putin noted.The president added that Russia had recently seen the creation of a powerful nationwide mechanism for combating terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/risks-of-simmering-conflicts-near-russia-require-stepped-up-border-protection-putin/story-sXEhQJrU5MTwachfM48FtN.html
20-12-2020||World||Several EU nations halt UK flights, fearing Covid-19 variant||One by one, several European Union nations banned flights from the UK on Sunday and others were considering similar action in a bid to block a new strain of coronavirus sweeping across southern England from establishing a strong foothold on the continent.Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Italy all announced restrictions on UK travel, hours after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that Christmas shopping and gatherings in southern England must be cancelled because of rapidly spreading infections blamed on the new coronavirus variant.Johnson immediately put those regions into a strict new Tier 4 restriction level, upending Christmas plans for millions.The German government said that it’s banning flights coming from Britain in reaction to the new coronavirus strain. The transportation ministry said all UK flights with the exception of cargo flights were no longer allowed to land in Germany starting at midnight Sunday. It didn’t immediately say how long the flight ban would last.The Netherlands banned flights from the UK for at least the rest of the year while Belgium issued a flight ban for 24 hours starting at midnight and also halted train links to Britain, including the Eurostar. Austria and Italy said they would halt flights from the UK but did not say exactly when that would take place.Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, said an order signed Sunday blocks flights from Britain and prohibits entry into Italy by anyone who has been in the UK in the last 14 days. The order bans plane travel until Jan. 6.The Czech Republic imposed stricter quarantine measures from people arriving from Britain. An EU official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were still ongoing, said Sunday afternoon that the European Commission was in touch with member states on the rapidly developing situation.High-speed train operator Eurostar canceled its trains between London, Brussels and Amsterdam beginning Monday, but kept trains operating on the London-to-Paris route.Johnson said Saturday that a fast-moving new variant of the virus that is 70% more transmissible than existing strains appeared to be driving the rapid spread of new infections in London and southern England. But he stressed “there’s no evidence to suggest it is more lethal or causes more severe illness,” or that vaccines will be less effective against it.Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said Sunday said he was issuing the flight ban for 24 hours starting at midnight “out of precaution.”“There are a great many questions about this new mutation,” he said, adding he hoped to have more clarity by Tuesday.The World Health Organization tweeted late Saturday that it was “in close contact with UK officials on the new #Covid19 virus variant” and promised to update governments and the public as more is learned.The new strain was identified in southeastern England in September and has been spreading in the area ever since, a WHO official told the BBC on Sunday.“What we understand is that it does have increased transmissibility, in terms of its ability to spread,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19.Studies are under way to better understand how fast it spreads and and whether “it’s related to the variant itself, or a combination of factors with behavior,” she added.She said the strain had also been identified in Denmark, the Netherlands and Australia, where there was one case that didn’t spread further.“The longer this virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to change,” she said. “So we really need to do everything we can right now to prevent spread, and minimizing that spread will reduce the chances of it changing.”Viruses mutate regularly, and scientists have found thousands of different mutations among samples of the virus causing Covid-19. Many of these changes have no effect on how easily the virus spreads or how severe symptoms are.Susan Hopkins of Public Health England said while the variant has been circulating since September, it wasn’t until the last week that officials felt they had enough evidence to declare that it has higher transmissibility than other circulating coronaviruses.U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee for U.S. surgeon general said Sunday that the emergence of the new strain doesn’t change the public health guidance on precautions for reducing the spread of the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing and washing hands.“While it seems to be more easily transmissible, we do not have evidence yet that this is a more deadly virus to an individual who acquires it,” Vivek Murthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “There’s no reason to believe that the vaccines that have been developed will not be effective against this virus, as well.”Europe has been walloped this fall by soaring new infections and deaths due to a resurgence of the virus, and many nations have reimposed a series of restrictions to reign in their outbreaks.Britain has seen over 67,000 deaths in the pandemic, the second-highest confirmed toll in Europe after Italy. Europe as a whole has recorded nearly 499,000 virus deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts believe is an undercount, due to limited testing and missed cases.The European Medicines Agency, meanwhile, is meeting Monday to approve the first Covid-19 vaccine for the European Union’s 27 nations, bringing vaccinations closer for millions of EU citizens. The vaccine made by German pharmaceutical company BioNTech and American drugmaker Pfizer is already in use in the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries.The EMA moved up its assessment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by a week after heavy pressure from EU governments, especially Germany, which has said that after the EMA approval it could start vaccinating citizens as early as next Sunday.In an urgent address to the nation on Saturday, Johnson ordered all non-essential shops, hairdressers and gyms in London and large parts of southern England closed and told Britons to reorganize their holiday plans. No mixing of households is now allowed indoors in the region, and only essential travel is permitted. In the rest of England, people will be allowed to meet in Christmas bubbles for just one day instead of the five that were planned.After he spoke, videos emerged online that showed crowds of people rushing to London’s train stations, apparently making a dash for places in the UK with less stringent coronavirus restrictions before the new rules took effect. Health Secretary Matt Hancock called those scenes “totally irresponsible.”While Hancock insisted officials had acted “very quickly and decisively,” critics said Britain’s Conservative government should have moved against rising infections and hospitalizations much earlier.“The alarms bells have been ringing for weeks, but the prime minister chose to ignore them,” said Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party. “It is an act of gross negligence by a prime minister who, once again, has been caught behind the curve.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/several-eu-nations-halt-uk-flights-fearing-covid-19-variant/story-0ZnzgJZOwXOGcQSuCkR7aO.html

The animals will then be incinerated, it said.“Once the [dead] mink are no longer contaminated with Covid-19, they will be transported to an incineration facility, where they’ll be burned as corporate waste,” the ministry said. “That way we can avoid having to handle the mink as dangerous waste.”The agreement comes after the animals had started to resurface from their mass graves, prompting fears of contamination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-to-dig-up-millions-of-dead-mink-after-botched-cull/story-F1kK4Oa7irAl0ovr3UMY8M.html
20-12-2020||World||Unclear If US has UK Covid-19 mutation, says chief scientific adviser Slaoui||It’s not clear whether a more transmissible variant of the coronavirus that prompted tighter restrictions in the UK has made its way to the US, according to Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for the government’s vaccine acceleration program.“We don’t know,” Slaoui said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” on Sunday. “We’re looking at that.”Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir questioned the threat posed by the virus changes cited by the UK government, saying it has mutated more than 4,000 times since its discovery. There’s no imminent need to suspend flights from the UK, he said on ABC’s “This Week.”“We don’t know that it’s more dangerous, and very importantly we have not seen a single mutation yet that would make it evade the vaccine,” and while that can’t be ruled out for the future, “I don’t think there should be any reason for alarm right now,” Giroir said.The new variant may be as much as 70% more transmissible, which led UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce a lockdown for London and large parts of southeast England on Saturday. He canceled plans to ease pandemic restrictions for five days over the holidays, and banned household mixing in London and the southeast while restricting socializing to just Christmas Day across the rest of England.Vaccinate Trump?Even if the variant does become more widespread, Slaoui said the vaccines that are now rolling out will provide protection against it. That includes the Moderna Inc. vaccine that received approval from US regulators Friday, and Slaoui said the first shots are expected to be administered Monday.Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, urged President Donald Trump to get vaccinated against Covid-19 to promote acceptance of immunization among his supporters.“Again, we have every reason to believe that these two vaccines are very effective and they are safe,” he said. “So I would encourage the president to get a vaccine for his own health and safety, and also to generate more confidence among the people who follow him so closely.”Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence received the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE in a televised event at the White House on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unclear-if-us-has-uk-covid-19-mutation-says-chief-scientific-adviser-slaoui/story-6VAK42BI1wPeqcwcwyTP0J.html

20-12-2020||World||Nepal’s private airline flew 69 passengers to wrong destination: Report||Passengers bound for Nepal’s Janakpur were in for a surprise after they ended up in Pokhara, 255 kilometres away from the actual destination, after a rare flight mix-up by a leading private carrier, according to a media report on Sunday. The incident happened on Friday to 69 passengers travelling on Buddha Air, The Kathmandu Post reported.The weather was not quite favourable for the flights on Friday so carriers were making use of every available weather window to take the passengers on board as quickly as possible and take off, the report said. Buddha Air’s flight U4505 was cleared to take off for Janakpur airport in the plains. Passengers were taken in and the plane took off, with its estimated arrival time at Janakpur by 3:15 pm.When it took off, it had already been delayed. But when it landed, it actually landed in Pokhara instead of the destination airport. According to the preliminary report, due to weather issues, flights to Pokhara were permitted until 3 pm under the visual flight rules (VFR). The VFR is a set of regulations under which a pilot operates an aircraft in weather conditions generally clear enough to allow the pilot to see where the aircraft is going.“The weather was already causing flight delays and to make up for the flying time, Buddha Air officials decided to fly to Pokhara first,” said an official at the airline company.Accordingly, the flight number was changed and the mix-up happened. Buddha Air admitted to serious lapses on its side, the report said. Birendra Bahadur Basnet, Managing Director of the carrier, told the Post that they have formed a committee to investigate the incident.“The difference in flight schedule between Janakpur and Pokhara was 15 to 20 minutes,” said an official.“The ground staff transferred [on paper] 69 passengers of flight U4505 to flight U4607 which actually was cleared for Pokhara by the air traffic controllers,” said the official.Everything was in the right order but the ground staff and the flight attendant failed to brief the flight’s captain and co-pilot that the flight’s number had been changed, according to the official.“The flight attendant did make an announcement on the flight that it was heading to Janakpur,” said the official.“There was a miscommunication between the ground staff and the pilots,” said the official. “The flying pilots also did not look at the passengers’ manifest.” Aviation experts say such incidents may happen, but they happen quite rarely.Tri Ratna Manandhar, a former director-general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, said this is the second incident of such kind in Nepal’s aviation history in the last two and a half-decades. In 1993, a Twin Otter of the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation had landed in Simara airport which was supposed to land in Bharatpur airport.“The Buddha Air incident happened due to miscommunication. It’s not part of safety lapses but it’s a serious lapse on the part of management,” said Manandhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-private-airline-flew-69-passengers-to-wrong-destination-report/story-usAU3E9Goq7tiZ4wr0CdEL.html

The paper identified the women as Merve A., Yasmin A. and Leonora M.Also Sunday, Germany’s federal prosecutor’s office said a German citizen by the name of Leonora M. had been arrested upon her arrival at Frankfurt airport. It said she is accused of membership in the foreign terrorist group Islamic State and allegedly committed crimes against humanity.Maas said he was “very relieved” about the return of the 12 children and three of their mothers.“These are humanitarian cases, especially orphans and children with illnesses — cases in which the departure was urgently needed,” Maas said.“This good news just before Christmas makes us confident that we will be able to organize the return of further cases as well,” he said adding that the government would advocate the return of others in coming weeks and months.Maas said the return was organized in cooperation with Finland, which brought home six children and two women.Hundreds of Europeans — many of them young women — left the continent in the last couple of years to join the Islamic State and fight in Syria and Iraq.

20-12-2020||World||Millions in stringent new UK lockdown amid coronavirus variant surge||A surge in the infection rate caused by a new variant of coronavirus has led to millions entering a stringent new stay-at-home lockdown in the UK from Sunday, with non-essential shops and businesses now closed.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the new rules at a briefing from 10 Downing Street on Saturday evening, which means a planned five-day “Christmas bubble” of relaxed rules has been cancelled in favour of a new Tier 4 level to the current three-tier lockdown system to try and control the surge in infections being caused by the new mutation of the deadly virus.“It seems that the spread is now being driven by the new variant of the virus,” Johnson said.“We have alerted the World Health Organisation and are continuing to analyse the available data to improve our understanding,” said Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer for England.“There is no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments although urgent work is underway to confirm this,” he said.The state-funded National Health Service (NHS) is set to vaccinate people against the coronavirus on Christmas Day as part of a drive to accelerate the number of inoculations nationally, according to ‘The Sunday Times’. More than 100,000 Pfizer jabs have been booked at general practitioner (GP) surgeries and hospital hubs across the country for the coming week.Under the new Tier 4, people would be banned from mixing with anyone outside of their household, including on Christmas Day, and for the other tiers, Christmas rules allowing up to three households will now be limited to Christmas Day of December 25 only, rather than five days. The changes will last for two weeks with the first review now due on December 30.The new restrictions – similar to the second national lockdown which ended in November – applies to all areas in the South East which were in tier three, covering Kent, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Surrey (excluding Waverley), Gosport, Havant, Portsmouth, Rother and Hastings. It also applies in London and the East of England – Bedford, Central Bedford, Milton Keynes, Luton, Peterborough, Hertfordshire, and Essex. In Wales, the restrictions were brought forward pre-Christmas to also begin right away.“We are sacrificing the chance to see our loved ones this Christmas so we have a better chance of protecting their lives so that we can see them at future Christmases,” he said, adding that he “bitterly regretted” have to make these changes. The UK PM said there is no evidence to suggest vaccines would be any less effective against the new variant but that it was required to act fast to try and control its acceleration.“Our advisers on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) have spent the last few days analysing this new variant – there’s no evidence that it causes more severe illness or higher mortality but it does appear to be passed on significantly more quickly,” he said.Non-essential shops, gyms, cinemas, hairdressers, and bowling alleys will be forced to close for two weeks, while people will be restricted to meeting one other person from another household in an outdoor public space.Johnson added: “I know how much emotion people invest in this time of year, and how important it is, for instance, for grandparents to see their grandchildren, for families to be together. So I know how disappointing this will be. But we have said throughout this pandemic that we must and we will be guided by the science. When the science changes, we must change our response.” “I think the Prime Minister should apologise. This is not just one mistake when he has otherwise got things right. It is the same mistake over and over again,” said Sir Keir Starmer, the Leader of the Opposition.“At the heart of the problem here is a Prime Minister who simply doesn’t want to be unpopular and therefore won’t take the tough decisions that are necessary, until he is forced into them at the 11th hour. We can’t go on like that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-in-stringent-new-uk-lockdown-amid-coronavirus-variant-surge/story-NJcovax13CXUpscmofp5dP.html
20-12-2020||World||Christmas travel chaos hits UK as Europeans suspend flights||The UK plunged into Christmas chaos with police deployed to stop people boarding packed trains, holidays abroad scrapped and Europe banning travel with the country after London went into an emergency lockdown.In a sudden turnaround, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson canceled plans to allow families to see each other over the festive period as the government warned that a new strain of the coronavirus is “out of control.” There were scenes of panic at train stations, with people defying social-distancing rules to get out of the capital before the new rules took effect on Sunday.More than 16 million Britons are now required to stay at home after new restrictions came into force Sunday in London and southeast England. The measures ban household mixing in the capital and the southeast, and restrict socializing to just Christmas Day across the rest of England.France and Germany are considering joining Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium in banning air and train links with the UK, which is in the middle of delicate and critical Brexit negotiations with its partners in the European Union (EU).The talks were expected to reach a breakthrough as soon as this weekend.For many Britons, either trying to see relatives or trying to go on a winter vacation, the situation is reminiscent of the last nationwide lockdown and will stoke fears that even with a vaccine the virus is still dangerous, if not as deadly. It is also but the latest U-turn from a government that has been reluctant to impose limits to movement, unless forced. Until Friday, Johnson was adamant that close households would be able to mix over Christmas.Crowded AirportsWhile London’s Heathrow airport was crowded Sunday morning as dozens of planes departed, an 11:45 a.m. KLM service to Amsterdam left empty, according to a spokeswoman for the hub, while two later British Airways flights to the Dutch city showed as cancelled. Most other operations were shown to be on schedule.The bans are very concerning, the spokeswoman said. Heathrow has just had one of its busiest weeks since the first UK lockdown as people caught flights in the run up to Christmas, and there are large numbers still due to travel, she added.A spokesman for Schiphol airport in Amsterdam said planes arriving from London on Sunday were essentially empty. Deutsche Lufthansa AG has cancelled crew layovers in the UK and is weighing further actions, a spokesman said.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that more British Transport Police will be dispatched to stop people taking unnecessary journeys out of London.“Please do not come to a station unless you are permitted to travel,” Shapps said in a statement. “Extra British Transport Police officers are being deployed to ensure only those who need to take essential journeys can travel safely,” he said after videos of people fleeing the capital spread on social media.London’s Metropolitan Police are also increasing patrols, prioritizing high footfall parts of the capital as well as areas where the virus is spreading rapidly, it said on a statement. “At this critical moment for the city, officers across London will pay particular attention to those groups who have wilfully ignored the rules, putting communities and lives at risk,” it said.Officers are deployed across airports “as part of routine security and policing,” a Met Police spokesperson said.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News presenter Sophy Ridge earlier this morning that it is more important than ever that people are responsible and not only stick to the rules but restrict all social contact as much as is possible because “this is deadly serious.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/christmas-travel-chaos-hits-uk-as-europeans-suspend-flights/story-TwgnoDZhY1jK2b00t4n8tM.html
20-12-2020||World||Second Covid-19 vaccine authorized in US ships out||Initial shipments of the second Covid-19 vaccine authorized in the US left a distribution center Sunday, a desperately needed boost as the nation works to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control.The trucks left the factory in the Memphis area with the vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. and the National Institutes of Health. The much-needed shots are expected to be given starting Monday, just three days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized their emergency rollout.Later Sunday, an expert committee will debate who should be next in line for early doses of the Moderna vaccine and a similar one from Pfizer Inc. and Germany’s BioNTech. Pfizer’s shots were first shipped out a week ago and started being used the next day, kicking off the nation’s biggest vaccination drive.Public health experts say the shots — and others in the pipeline — are the only way to stop a virus that has been spreading wildly. Nationwide, more than 219,000 people per day on average test positive for the virus, which has killed at least 314,000 in the US and upwards of 1.7 million worldwide.The Pfizer and Moderna shots shipped so far and going out over the next few weeks are nearly all going to health care workers and residents of long-term care homes, based on the advice of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.That panel meets Sunday to debate who should get the doses available after those early shots are given.There won’t be enough shots for the general population until spring, so doses will be rationed at least for the next several months.The panel members are leaning toward putting “essential workers” next in line, because people like bus drivers, grocery store clerks and others are the ones getting infected most often. But other experts say people 65 and older should be next, along with people with certain medical conditions, because those are the Americans who are dying at the highest rates.The expert panel’s advice is almost always endorsed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No matter what the CDC says, there will be differences from state to state, because their health departments have different ideas about who should be closer to the front of the line.Both the new Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot require two doses several weeks apart. The second dose must be from the same company as the first. Both vaccines appeared safe and strongly protective in large, still unfinished studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-in-us-ships-out/story-0shaFBluZ1u5VVZt0djtUL.html

He was 72.Sheikh Nasser, who held various government posts over the years including minister of defense and deputy prime minister, had been considered a top contender for crown prince following the death in September of his father, the 91-year-old Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah.Although he drew popular support for his ambitious mega-projects and anti-corruption efforts, he was passed over for his uncle, Sheikh Meshal Al Ahmed Al Jaber Al Sabah, a more cautious choice of heir apparent at a turbulent time for Kuwait’s politics and the wider region.The KUNA state-run news agency did not specify how Sheikh Nasser died, but he was known to be in fragile health after having a lung tumor removed two years ago.In a country that depends on oil for some 90% of its revenues, Sheikh Nasser championed bold plans to diversify Kuwait’s economy by building up a business hub with a free zone and deep sea port in the country’s north. But with many in Kuwait’s parliament committed to the status quo, his ideas repeatedly ran aground even as fears mounted that the country was falling behind its more powerful and better-developed neighbors, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Last year, Sheikh Nasser’s public allegations of government corruption vaulted him into the national political scene, as he pressed for investigations into the suspected embezzlement of hundreds of millions of dollars from a military fund.His efforts backfired when his father, the emir, ousted him from government, but he retained a substantial following and continued to make public statements about the need to fight corruption both in Kuwait’s sprawling bureaucracy and his own ruling family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-s-key-reformer-son-of-late-emir-dies-at-72/story-QZ8ZuW8MH0eb3Q22AbNZzJ.html
20-12-2020||World||Ban on UK flights: Here’s how countries have reacted to new Covid-19 variant||While some countries have decided to ban flights from the United Kingdom, some are still mulling over the action after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday confirmed that a new strain of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is rapidly spreading in certain areas. During a televised briefing, Johnson said that the new variant of the coronavirus is 70% more transmissible than existing strains. “There is still much we don’t know. While we are fairly certain the variant is transmitted more quickly, there is no evidence to suggest that it is more lethal or causes more severe illness,” said the UK PM.Johnson announced that London, parts of the South East and the East of England, which were under Tier 3 restrictions, have been moved to Tier 4. Ahead of the announcement, Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said there is no evidence to suggest the new variant of coronavirus causes a higher mortality rate or it affects vaccines and treatments, however, urgent work is underway to confirm this.“We have alerted the World Health Organisation and are continuing to analyse the available data to improve our understanding,” Whitty said in a statement.Also Read | Covid-19 is ‘out of control’ in UK, says British health secretary HancockHere’s how other countries have reacted to the threat of new virus strain:Netherlands: The European nation announced a ban on all UK passenger flights, which came into effect on Sunday and will last until January 1. The Dutch government said it will assess with other EU nations the “possibilities to contain the import of the virus” from the UK.Belgium: The government issued a flight ban for 24 hours starting at midnight and also halted train links to Britain. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo on Sunday said that he was issuing the flight ban “out of precaution.” “There are a great many questions about this new mutation and if it is not already on the mainland,” he said.Italy: Foreign minister Luigi di Maio said Italy plans to suspend flights to and from the UK over fears of the new strain of coronavirus. “As a government, we have the duty to protect Italians, for this reason, after having notified the British government, with the Ministry of Health we are about to sign the provision to suspend flights with Great Britain,” Di Maio wrote in a Facebook post.Germany: The German government is also reportedly mulling over the decision to ban flights from Britain as a high-ranking official told news agency dpa that restrictions on flights from the UK are “serious option.”Austria: The EU member has said that it would also ban flights from Britain, but no immediate details on the timing of the ban were announced, according to the Austrian news agency APA.Kuwait: The civil aviation authority of the Arab nation on Sunday added the UK to its high-risk list of countries, following instructions from the health authorities. All flights from the countries on the high-risk list are prohibited from entering Kuwait.Israel: The Israeli government has reportedly decided mandatory two-week quarantine for all arrivals from the United Kingdom, South Africa and Denmark. According to a local daily Haaretz, people arriving from these three countries have to undergo two negative coronavirus tests, one upon arrival and a second after nine days, if they would like to reduce the quarantine period to 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ban-on-uk-flights-here-s-how-countries-have-reacted-to-new-covid-19-variant/story-kPwKnWsVX8fBWzBbZWqpgO.html

20-12-2020||World||UK emergency Covid-19 lockdown heaps pressure on Brexit trade deal talks||Boris Johnson’s emergency virus lockdown is heaping last-minute pressure on negotiators as they race to reach a post-Brexit trade deal.Officials said the announcement has focused minds on bringing the talks to a conclusion within days. As the British prime minister was detailing the new restrictions for London and southeast England on Saturday, negotiators in Brussels were inching closer toward an agreement.People familiar with both sides’ positions said the talks are unlikely to wrap up on Sunday, but should do so before Christmas.Whether nine months of talks between the UK and European Union result in a trade accord will depend on the two sides bridging their disagreements over fishing, the last remaining major obstacle. But that is proving difficult: European countries with large fishing industries are resisting any further concessions proposed by the European Commission. Nevertheless, officials from both sides said the gap can still be bridged.“I think everybody wants a deal,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Sunday. “Unfortunately, the EU have put in some unreasonable demands” that don’t respect Britain’s 2016 referendum decision to leave the bloc, he told Sky News.Cost of failureFailure to reach a trade deal would mean the UK doing business with its largest and nearest commercial partner on terms set by the World Trade Organization -- meaning millions of businesses and consumers would face the cost and disruption of tariffs and quotas.The pandemic has heavily disrupted the post-Brexit trade talks since they started in March. Both chief negotiators were forced into isolation after displaying symptoms early in the process and for months the two sides could only talk by video link.“We do need to see that movement from the EU side and I very much hope that they make the steps that are necessary so that we can conclude a deal and then we can all look forward,” Hancock said. “We have got a huge amount to get through as a continent because there are very significant problems with this virus on the continent as well.”With most other major issues now settled, the entire deal now effectively depends on how much the EU is prepared to give up of its fishing catch in UK waters. While Britain was a member of the EU, the bloc controlled fishing rights through its Common Fisheries Policy, a system that Johnson argues penalized the UK’s domestic industry.Teams from the European Commission in Brussels held a second round of talks with national capitals on Saturday. The deliberations were tense and not straightforward, one EU diplomat said.EU’s offerAfter its discussions with member states on Friday, the Commission made an offer that would see the bloc lose around 25% of the current 650 million euros ($800 million) of fish it catches annually in British waters. The UK rejected it, and has been pushing for the EU to give up 60%, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.The EU also offered to reduced the phase-in period of the new arrangements to six years, after originally wanting 10. The UK rejected the offer of six and has proposed just three years.The British team feels it has the upper hand after making recent concessions on the other major roadblock, the level competitive playing field for businesses. But Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, made clear on Friday that access to the single market will be conditional on keeping UK fishing waters open to boats from the bloc.The talks could still break down. Despite the cautiously optimistic tone coming from negotiating room, one person familiar with the UK government’s position said a no-deal outcome remains the more likely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-emergency-covid-19-lockdown-heaps-pressure-on-brexit-trade-deal-talks/story-gfrHfJygGWCpwgutD8PoQI.html
20-12-2020||World||Airlines balk at refunds as UK tells travellers not to fly||British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. aren’t offering refunds to passengers who cancel year-end trips following new U.K. coronavirus rules, even as regulators investigate carriers’ earlier refusal to hand cash back to customers caught in lockdown.IAG SA-owned BA will grant ticket holders a voucher or let them switch to a later date, it said in an emailed statement. It said it will only refund fares if the airline cancels a flight, a policy echoed by Virgin Atlantic in a Twitter post.The refund issue ignited a firestorm when similar curbs were in place last month. The UK Competition and Markets Authority launched a probe last week into whether airlines violated consumer rights by failing to offer passengers their money back for flights they couldn’t lawfully take.“Some airlines like EasyJet have mostly been doing the right thing and offering refunds, while others like BA only offer the option of a voucher or a rebooking,” said Rory Boland, travel editor at consumer advocacy group Which?. “The CMA investigation is looking precisely into this, as the wording for Tier 4 restrictions indicates these are legal requirements, not guidance so you should be due a refund.”The latest travel rules took effect Sunday, less than a day after they were announced, catching many with holiday travel plans off-guard. London Heathrow airport was crowded after airlines largely kept to schedules and many ticket holders opted to fly.EasyJet Plc said it would offer refunds for those who stayed home. “We understand some customers may now need to change their flights.”On Twitter, passengers called out Ryanair Holdings Plc and Aer Lingus for refusing refunds.Aer Lingus will waive change fees up to two hours before departure, the IAG-owned airline said in a statement. Customers may be entitled to vouchers or refunds depending on fare type, it said.Irish discounter Ryanair didn’t respond to requests for comment.New StrainPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced the tightening on Saturday, in a bid to stamp out a fast-spreading mutation of the coronavirus that’s behind a rapid rise in cases in London. Movement in the capital and much of southeast England has been restricted, including getting on foreign flights.“People should carefully consider whether they need to travel abroad and follow the rules in their tier,” Johnson said. “Those in Tier 4 areas will not be permitted to travel abroad apart from limited exceptions, such as for work purposes.”The Dutch government on Sunday banned incoming flights carrying passengers from the U.K., saying samples showed the new virus strain had reached the Netherlands.Johnson made it clear that the policy is aimed at stemming holiday gatherings that could further spread the disease.While the flight restrictions will be similar to lockdown rules lifted earlier this month, the exceptions haven’t been clearly defined.People who live outside the area may transit through Tier 4, which includes Heathrow and Luton airports, “but you should carefully consider whether you need to do so,” according to advice on a government website.The rise of the new virus strain forced the government into an abrupt policy switch at the height of the Christmas travel season. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had assured the public last week that so-called travel corridors won’t be switched for two weeks to give people certainty about booking holidays.Some customers took to social media, with one Virgin Atlantic passenger saying he was unable to get through to make changes to a flight scheduled for Sunday.“While it is a really difficult position for the government, the fact is that a number of people have taken decisions to travel based on government advice in recent weeks,” Boland said. “People will understand why this decision had to be made, but be angry that it has been made so late in the day, leaving plans to see family in tatters and another fight for a refund on flights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airlines-balk-at-refunds-as-uk-tells-travellers-not-to-fly/story-WyH3p2kyrbHWOQ2V28R7cJ.html

20-12-2020||World||Biden’s options for Russian hacking punishment: sanctions, cyber retaliation||President-elect Joe Biden’s team will consider several options to punish Russia for its suspected role in the unprecedented hacking of US government agencies and companies once he takes office, from new financial sanctions to cyberattacks on Russian infrastructure, people familiar with the matter say.The response will need to be strong enough to impose a high economic, financial or technological cost on the perpetrators, but avoid an escalating conflict between two nuclear-armed Cold War adversaries, said one of the people familiar with Biden’s deliberations, speaking on condition of anonymity.The overarching goal of any action, which could also include stepped-up counter cyber espionage efforts, would be to create an effective deterrence and diminish the potency of future Russian cyber spying, the person said.The unfolding crisis - and the lack of visibility over the extent of the infiltration into the computer networks of federal agencies including the Treasury, Energy and Commerce Departments - will push to the front of Biden’s agenda when he takes office on Jan. 20.President Donald Trump only acknowledged the hacking on Saturday almost a week after it surfaced, downplaying its importance and questioning whether the Russians were to blame.The discussions among Biden’s advisers are theoretical at this point and will need to be refined once they are in office and have full view of US capabilities.Biden’s team will also need a better grasp of U.S. intelligence about the cyber breach before making any decisions, one of the people familiar with his deliberations said. Biden’s access to presidential intelligence briefings was delayed until about three weeks ago as Trump disputed the Nov. 3 election results.With Trump taking no action, Biden’s team are concerned that in the coming weeks the president-elect may be left with only one tool: bluster, according to one of the people familiar with his options.“They’ll be held accountable,” Biden said in an interview broadcast on CBS on Thursday when asked about how he would deal with the Russian-led hack. He vowed to impose “financial repercussions” on “individuals as well as entities.”TEST OF WORKING WITH ALLIESThe response could be an early test of the president-elect’s promise to cooperate and consult more effectively with US allies, as some proposals likely to be put before Biden could hit the financial interests or infrastructure of countries friendly to the United States, a person familiar with the matter said.“Symbolic won’t do it” for any US response, said James Andrew Lewis, a cyber security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “You want the Russians to know we’re pushing back”A spokeswoman for Biden’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment.The massive data breach, first reported by Reuters, enabled hackers believed to be from Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service to explore the networks of government agencies, private companies and think-tanks for months.Moscow has denied involvement.One potential target for US Treasury financial sanctions would be the SVR, said Edward Fishman, an Atlantic Council fellow who worked on Russia sanctions at the State Department during the Obama administration.Media reports have suggested the SVR-linked hacking group known as “Cozy Bear” or APT29 was responsible for the attacks. The United States, Britain and Canada in July accused https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-cyber/russia-trying-to-steal-covid-19-vaccine-data-say-uk-u-s-and-canada-idUSKCN24H236 “Cozy Bear” of trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine and treatment research from drug companies and academic institutions.“I would think, at the bare minimum, imposing sanctions against the SVR would be something that the U.S. government should consider,” Fishman said, noting that the move would be largely symbolic and not have a major economic impact. The US Treasury has already imposed financial sanctions on other Russian security services, the FSB and the GRU.Financial sanctions against Russian state companies and the business empires of Russian oligarchs linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin may be more effective, as they would deny access to dollar transactions, both Fishman and Lewis said.Those targets could include aluminum giant Rusal, which saw US sanctions lifted in 2018 after blacklisted Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska reduced his stake to a minority in a deal with the Treasury.Lewis said a stronger option could be to cut Russia off from the SWIFT international bank transfer and financial messaging system, a crippling move that would prevent Russian companies from processing payments to and from foreign customers.Such a move was contemplated in 2014 when Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, but it would hurt the Russian energy sector, complicating gas sales to Europe and hit European companies with Russian operations.Neither the Treasury nor State Department responded to questions about possible actions in response to the hacking.The Pentagon’s US Cyber Command likely has options for counter actions that could cripple Russian technology infrastructure, such as disrupting phone networks or denial of internet actions, Lewis said, adding that this too could hurt European allies.“They’ll need to think through the diplomacy of that,” Lewis said.The hackers likely left behind some malicious code that would let them access US systems for retaliation against any US cyber attack and it will take months to find and eliminate those “Easter eggs,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-s-options-for-russian-hacking-punishment-sanctions-cyber-retaliation/story-A73MWoX9qw38LBAEc1wjpO.html
20-12-2020||World||New variant makes Covid-19 ‘out of control’ in UK, flights banned||Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock on Sunday admitted that the coronavirus is out of control, hours after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a lockdown on London and southeast England, sparking fury by cancelling Christmas at short notice and some countries imposing flight bans.The Netherlands, Italy and Belgium have banned flights to and from the UK to prevent the new Covid-19 variant from entering the countries, as reports said other European countries were considering similar measures. The Eurostar from Belgium was also subject to restrictions.Scotland banned travellers from England, while Wales went into another lockdown as health officials tried to grapple with the new variant of the Covid-19 virus that is assessed to be up to 70% faster in transmission than the earlier strain - most evident in recent days in Kent.Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show whether the coronavirus is under control, Hancock said, “No, sadly”, adding that the situation now is “incredibly difficult”. The best gift that people could give for Christmas is to stay at home and not spread the virus, he said.Also Read: Unclear If US has UK Covid-19 mutation, says chief scientific adviser SlaouiLabour Party leader Keir Starmer said his party supported the latest restrictions, but he accused PM Johnson of “gross negligence” in failing to act earlier, adding that “alarm bells have been ringing for weeks but the prime minister chose to ignore” it.Hancock said it was on Friday that scientists showed ministers evidence of the “causality” between the new fast-transmitting variant and the spike in new cases in London and southeast England, which prompted the measures outlined by Johnson on Saturday.London and southeast England have been placed in the new Tier 4 of the alert system, which has varying curbs, from Tier 1 (lowest) to Tier 4 (toughest; equivalent to full lockdown). People are prohibited from travelling to and out of Tier 4.Also Read: Israelis returning from UK to be sent to quarantine hotelsHancock indicated in Sunday’s media interviews that London’s lockdown could last months, until vaccines are rolled out across the population. So far, 350,000 people have been received the first shots of their two-dose vaccine delivered by Pfizer-BioNTech.“There are no easy answers or easy options. I think the mistake would be to ignore new scientific evidence,” he added.London’s airports, train stations and roads were clogged on Saturday night as thousands tried to escape the new lockdown restrictions that came into effect early on Sunday. Scotland Yard said the police would enforce Tier 4 rules from Sunday.People’s fury at Christmas plans being cancelled was reflected in screaming newspaper headlines on Sunday and veteran Conservative MP Charles Walker calling on Hancock to resign, amid growing criticism in the ruling over party over handling of the virus situation.Hancock said he understood Walker’s frustrations, which he admitted are shared by millions of others, but he said he is focused on the job and “of course” will be staying in his position, adding, “I am dealing with a global pandemic in the best way I can...and we must take action, however uncomfortable we find it.”He said he is “very worried” about the health service’s capacity to deal with the current crisis, saying there are currently 18,000 Covid-19 patients in hospitals, just below the peak seen during the first wave in March and April.Also Read: Second Covid-19 vaccine authorized in US ships outScotland Yard commander Alex Murray said on Sunday, “I know Londoners will be deeply saddened by the news that the planned relaxation of the rules over the Christmas period has been scrapped. The news on the virus spread is stark and deeply concerning, and we must all now take immediate action to prevent the spread by staying at home and keeping ourselves safe.“Across the city, officers will be deployed to take action against those people whose selfish action risks jeopardising the health of Londoners. Likewise, we will continue our joint enforcement with London’s 32 local authorities – clamping down on those businesses that also flout the rules and put health at risk.”Murray warned, “Our fight against the virus is not over. The rules are very clear and our collective actions in the next two weeks will have a direct impact on how quickly our city will recover. If people ignore these new rules, make reckless decisions that risk lives, I make no apology for the subsequent enforcement action that will follow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-is-out-of-control-in-uk-says-british-health-secretary-hancock/story-2JJD1kFTKVJSAKstAw7cEL.html
20-12-2020||World||What you can and cannot do in Tier 4 areas after new Covid-19 variant threat in UK||The United Kingdom on Saturday introduced a new tier - Tier 4 - for certain areas, including London, after rapid transmission of a new variant of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). During a televised briefing, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that there is no evidence to suggest that the new strain is more lethal or causes more severe illness. The government has alerted the World Health Organisation (WHO) regarding the issue and, meanwhile, it has introduced new restrictions in the most affected areas.London, parts of the South East and the East of England, which were under Tier 3 restrictions, have been moved to Tier 4. The new restrictions took effect from Sunday morning. Tier 4 is basically ‘stay at home’ order for areas under it. The government said that these rules will not be relaxed for Christmas. According to the new guidance, the police can take action against the violators, which includes breaking up illegal gatherings and issuing fines. The police can issue a fixed penalty notice of £200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of £6,400.What you can and cannot do in areas under Tier 4?People living in Tier 4 zone cannot meet other people indoors unless they live together or they are part of any existing support bubble.The government has ordered people living in those areas to must not leave or be outside of their home except for where they have a specific purpose or a ‘reasonable excuse’. You cannot leave home for holidays or stays overnight away from your main home unless permitted by law. You can leave home for essential activities, work and volunteering, fulfilling legal obligations, education and childcare, medical reasons, exercise and recreation.You can travel outside the Tier 4 area for work, education, caring responsibilities, visiting a hospital. People travelling to Tier 4 can enter the area for similar reasons.Also Read | WHO says in close contact with UK officials on new Covid-19 virus variantWhich areas are under Tier 4?London: All 32 London boroughs plus the City of LondonSouth East: Kent and Medway, Buckinghamshire, Surrey (excluding Waverley), Hastings and Rother, Havant, Gosport and Portsmouth, Berkshire (Bracknell Forest, Reading, Slough, Wokingham, Windsor and Maidenhead and West Berkshire), East of England: Hertfordshire, Peterborough, Essex (excluding Tendring, Uttlesford and Colchester), Central Bedfordshire, Bedford, Milton Keynes, Luton||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-you-can-and-cannot-do-in-tier-4-areas-after-new-covid-19-variant-threat-in-uk/story-w75DEnV5Q33hsJGxC2ttbM.html

Without revealing his name, Obama said the family got to spend some time with him as he got stuck because of the Covid-19 situation and eventually he spent the early quarantine period with the Obama family. According to The Independent, Obama shared these details during an appearance on The Bill Simmons Podcast.Explaining how enjoyable it was to spend quarantine time with the family, he said now Malia and Sasha are at that stage where they want to spend time with their parents. “It’s a blessing because all the teenage stuff is kinda gone now and they’re just back and they love you again and they want to spend time with you and they’re funny,” he said, according to The Independent.The former president also revealed how he spent time teaching the kids and Malia’s boyfriend some spades games.“He’s British, wonderful young man, and he was sort of stuck because there was a whole visa thing and he had a job set up. So we took him in and I didn’t want to like him, but he’s a good kid,” Obama said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/didn-t-want-to-like-him-says-obama-on-daughter-malia-s-british-boyfriend/story-FFwIwJP9XzM1qjcfDtuaQM.html
20-12-2020||World||The coronavirus pandemic exposes the vulnerability of Italy’s ‘new poor’||The coronavirus pandemic did not produce Elena Simone’s first budgetary rough patch. The 49-year-old single mother found herself out of the job market when the 2008 global financial crisis hit Italy and never fully got back in, but she created a patchwork of small jobs that provided for herself and the youngest of her three children.That all changed with Italy’s first Covid-19 lockdown in the spring.With schools closed, so went Simone’s cafeteria job. Her house cleaning gigs dried up, too. While others returned to work when the lockdown ended, Simone stayed frozen out.“There was a period when I was only eating carrots,’’ she recalled from her kitchen decorated with colourful plush characters shaped like vegetables.For the first time in her life, Simone needed help putting food on the table. At a friend’s urging, she enrolled for access to the food stores operated by Roman Catholic charity Caritas. Her eligibility covers her through January, and she hopes to be off the charity rolls by then “to make room for people who need it even more.”The charity serving more than 5 million people in the Milan archdiocese, Caritas Ambrosiana, says the pandemic is revealing for the first time the depths of economic insecurity in Italy’s northern Lombardy region, which generates 20% of the country’s gross domestic product.Simone, who has two adult children and a 10-year-old son at home, is typical of Italy’s new poor. These are people who managed to get by after the 2008 financial crisis, staying off the radar of Italy’s welfare system by relying on informal, gray-market jobs and the help of friends and family.But between Italy’s near-total spring lockdown, the introduction of a partial lockdown when the virus surged again in the fall and the continued toll the pandemic is taking on Italy’s economy, the slim threads that allowed people to weave together employment have snapped.Nowhere in Italy is this more evident than in Lombardy, where Covid-19 first exploded in Europe. Italian agriculture lobby Coldiretti estimates that the virus has created 300,000 newly poor people, based on surveys of the dozens of charity groups operating in the region.Caritas Ambrosiana provided help to 9,000 people during the spring lockdown, 20% of whom reported that their financial situation had “drastically” worsened over the 10-week closure. In October, nearly 700 families requested food aid for the first time.Nationally, one-third of all people seeking help from Caritas during the pandemic are first-time recipients, and in a reversal of usual trends, most are Italians and not foreign residents.More than 40 organizations provide food on a daily basis in Milan, Italy’s financial capital. One of the largest, Pane Quotidiano, serves some 3,500 meals a day. Many of those in need once worked in restaurants and hotels, which have been particularly penalized by the coronavirus restrictions, or as domestic help.“It is even more widespread than we knew, especially for a rich city like Milan,’’ Caritas Ambrosiana spokesman Francesco Chiavarini said. “These precarious jobs were lost. And we don’t know when or if they will be restored.”Researchers at Milan’s Bocconi University said in a working paper for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that blue-collar workers without college degrees paid the heaviest price for Italy’s virus restrictions. Half reported a drop in their salaries, compared with just 20% of the top earners, and many did not have the luxury of working remotely.“What we are seeing is a substantial increase in inequality,’’ Bocconi University researcher Vincenzo Galasso said.Those without solid job contracts are the most exposed in the pandemic that has already killed over 68,000 people in Italy, the highest death toll in Europe.Simone discovered too late that her cafeteria contract described her as an occasional worker, meaning she had no basis to request government support to replace lost income. Her cleaning jobs were off the books altogether, and she has recovered only two of the dozen she held before the pandemic.Even when workers qualify for Italy’s public-private short-term layoff scheme, the money has arrived late and is generally inadequate to cover a family’s basic expenses, Chiavarini said. Basic coverage is 400 euros ($490) a month, yet monthly rents in a city like Milan start around 600 euros ($735).Food security is emerging as a key issue as the pandemic enters winter.Progetto Arca, which runs shelters and provides other social services in Milan, started operating a food truck last month after seeing that homeless people who had filled their stomachs with restaurant and bar handouts were going hungry during the partial fall lockdown when many establishments had closed.And isn’t just the homeless coming by the food truck. On a recent night, a well-dressed man in a quilted jacket and dress trousers waited off to the side until the line had dissipated. He identified himself as a lawyer but declined further comment and asked not to be photographed as he took away two hot meals and two bags of food for the next day, one for his companion waiting at home.So far, government moratoriums on evictions and the firing of contracted workers have helped keep a cap on what charity workers see as an emerging poverty crisis.“When these are lifted, we will see the real price that we need to pay for this pandemic,’’ Chiavarini said. “We celebrate Milan as the capital of innovation, but beneath these skyscrapers of which we are so proud, there is a hidden world where people are living in conditions of real precariousness. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-coronavirus-pandemic-exposes-the-vulnerability-of-italy-s-new-poor/story-LSDth26Wk2IYyn6QUUREnI.html

Opinion polls show some two-thirds of the public want to follow suit.The Justice Ministry said that, at its request, Facebook took down four groups at the weekend that had disseminated texts, photographs and videos with “deliberately mendacious content designed to mislead about coronavirus vaccines”.Such “fake news” included arguments that vaccines would be used to plant government tracking chips in recipients’ bodies, to poison them and thus cull the population or to subject them to medical experimentation, the ministry said in a statement.A Facebook spokeswoman confirmed that four Hebrew-language groups had been taken down as part of the company’s policy against “spreading misinformation regarding the vaccines”.Israeli officials say the country has enough vaccines on order by year’s end to protect the most vulnerable 20% of the population and then lift some coronavirus curbs, but worry that turnout might be dampened if people get false information about the innoculations.Israel began administering vaccines to medical staff on Sunday. At Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, dozens of doctors and nurses danced as they prepared to receive their injections.Next in line are elderly Israelis or those in high-risk groups. The wider adult population is slated to get shots in early 2021.With a population of 9 million, Israel has logged 373,368 coronavirus cases and 3,074 deaths. It has imposed two national lockdowns and is mulling new curbs on high-contagion areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-govt-says-facebook-removed-anti-vaccine-fake-news-on-request/story-SDRKcyZrPKSyWPj525t0RM.html

20-12-2020||World||Pushed over the edge, PM Oli drops a bombshell on rivals that also hurts China||A little less than three years after he took oath as prime minister for the second time, Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli on Sunday morning dropped a bombshell on his rivals in the ruling Nepal Communist Party. PM Oli’s cabinet recommended dissolution of the 275-member House of Representatives that was elected in 2017 when the opposition Nepali Congress suffered a landslide defeat in the polls.PM Oli’s surprise move on Sunday sent his rivals within the ruling Nepal Communist Party running for cover, arguing that Nepal’s constitution did not have a provision for dissolving Parliament by the Prime Minister of a majority government.Bishnu Rijal, a central committee member of the ruling Nepal Communist Party said instead of seeking a compromise within the party, PM Oli had chosen to dissolve Parliament. “The prime minister has lost the majority in the parliamentary party, central committee and the secretariat of the party,” he said, according to a Reuters report.ALSO WATCH | ‘Learn from Sri Lanka’: CDS Gen Bipin Rawat cautions Nepal on ties with ChinaPresident Bidya Devi Bhandari has accepted the recommendation and announced national elections in two phases to be held on 30 April and 10 May.Also Read: PM Oli races to get new anti-graft watchdog boss, heads for a showdown with PrachandaPeople familiar with the matter said PM Oli’s move to dissolve Parliament, would give him a free hand to run the government and split the party formed in 2018 by the merger of his Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal- Maoist Centre.For months, Prachanda had been trying to pin PM Oli down and had led several rounds of revolts against the prime minister demanding a greater say in the government. PM Oli, who had led them to victory on the basis of a nationalist agenda, however, had refused to cede any space and dropped enough hints that he was prepared to split the communist party if he was pushed to the wall.This is an eventuality that China’s communist party had been struggling to avoid for months.Beijing had deputed its envoy to Nepal Hou Yanqi to hold a series of meetings in late April and early May - around the same time that China’s soldiers were crossing the line in east Ladakh - to hold consultations with Nepal’s communist leaders to get them to stay united.Ambassador Hou continued her interventions to keep the NCP in one piece over the next few months. But PM Oli’s camp soon enough figured that China was okay with ruling NCP giving PM Oli the pink slip if this is what it would take to avoid a split in the party.PM Oli, who had spent 14 years in jail for opposing the now-abolished monarchy in the 1970s and 1980s, wasn’t ready to fade into oblivion yet.Nepal watchers said China, which initially seemed to back 68-year-old Oli, had changed tack earlier this year and was willing to sacrifice him if it would help keep the NCP united.Ambassador Hou Yanqi was working on this pitch when last month, PM Oli is believed to have told her off, suggesting that he is capable of handling challenges within his party without any assistance from other countries.The Chinese envoy didn’t exactly back off but her subsequent interventions were done quietly. When meeting politicians from the ruling party, she would move around in unmarked cars or taxis in Kathmandu, said a Nepal watcher.“There were two other formulas that the Chinese envoy continued to work on,” a person who tracks developments in Nepal politics said. Apart from negotiating a format where the NCP’s former prime minister Dahal and Madhav Nepal hold the strings of power minus PM Oli, Ambassador Hou also explored the possibility of the NCP shunting out PM Oli and promoting Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam instead.Since Bamdev Gautam comes from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) that PM Oli headed before the 2018 merger, it was expected that this would minimise the damage that PM Oli could wreak on the party in case of a split. The fourth option that the Chinese envoy did explore was the possibility that the senior leadership of the NCP let the next generation leaders of the party who would be more amenable to a negotiated settlement take charge, a Nepal watcher said.PM Oli’s Sunday surprise, however, upended the Chinese efforts as well.Oli aide Rajan Bhattarai said the prime minister had made the move due to the backlash against him from his party, which had also asked him to consider quitting as its president.“So he decided to face the people in an election,” Bhattarai told Reuters. “This is the best way in a democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-oli-s-surprise-upends-his-rivals-plans-and-china-s-4-options/story-ttGgtv5Zn86mbUxY16D5VM.html
20-12-2020||World||US Congress poised to vote on $900 bn Covid aid package after Fed compromise||The US Congress appeared poised to vote on Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus aid package after senators struck a late-night compromise to clear one of the final hurdles, a dispute over Federal Reserve pandemic lending authorities.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the US Capitol late on Saturday night: “If things continue on this path and nothing gets in the way, we’ll be able to vote tomorrow.”Congressional leaders plan to attach the coronavirus aid package, which includes $600 direct payments to individuals and a $300 per week unemployment compensation supplement, to a $1.4 trillion spending bill funding government programs through September 2021.But they face a new government funding deadline of midnight on Sunday (0500 GMT Monday), risking a government shutdown without action.US President Donald Trump, whose administration has largely left negotiations up to congressional leaders, complained early on Sunday morning that a deal had not been reached. “Why isn’t Congress giving our people a Stimulus Bill? It wasn’t their fault, it was the fault of China,” Trump said on Twitter. “GET IT DONE, and give them more money in direct payments.”Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, had insisted on language that would guarantee that the central bank could not revive emergency lending programs for small businesses and state and local governments after Dec. 31, when they expire under the CARES Act Covid-19 relief legislation passed in March. Republicans had said the programs are an unnecessary government interference in private business that politicizes the Fed. They accused Democrats of seeking to extend them into 2021 as a backdoor way to provide unchecked funds for state and local governments controlled by members of their party.Democrats in turn accused the Republicans of trying to tie the Fed’s hands in order to limit Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s options for boosting the flagging economy after he takes office on Jan. 20. LANGUAGE DIFFERENCESToomey spokesman Steve Kelly said the senator’s agreement with Schumer “rescinds more than $429 billion in unused CARES Act funds; definitively ends the CARES Act lending facilities by December 31, 2020; stops these facilities from being restarted; and forbids them from being duplicated without congressional approval.”But a senior Democratic aide said Toomey had agreed to “drop the broad language in his proposal that would have prevented the Fed chair from establishing similar facilities in the future.”The Senate adjourned a rare Saturday session with a call from Republican leader Mitch McConnell to avoid last-minute disagreements that could delay new funding for Americans and small businesses.After news of a compromise on the Fed issue, McConnell spokesman Doug Andres said: “Now that Democrats have agreed to a version of Senator Toomey’s important language, we can begin closing out the rest of the package to deliver much-needed relief to families, workers, and businesses.”In the 11 months since the first cases of the new coronavirus were documented in the United States, Covid-19 has killed 311,000 Americans, by far the most in the world, and put millions out of work, with unemployment rising. Economists say growth will likely remain sluggish until vaccines are widely available in mid-2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-poised-to-vote-on-900-bn-covid-aid-package-after-fed-compromise/story-UBnnXUV9u8zrlfRKNpoSnK.html

The country has lately been reporting more than 6,500 single-day infections.The number of persons getting the vaccine continues to rise, with the latest tally at 11,909. The initial batch of inoculations is covering the most vulnerable groups, including residents of long-term care homes and health care workers.Canada gave emergency authorisation to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine earlier this month, but won’t immediately follow the United States in granting approval to Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, which has received the US drug regulator’s nod. The Moderna vaccine is under review and Health Canada said in a statement, “There is still information and data to be provided by Moderna for review.” The agency said, “Health Canada is working hard to give Canadians access to Covid-19 vaccines as quickly as possible and will not compromise its safety, efficacy and quality standards.”All the provinces have now received shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.As for the pandemic situation in the country, federal projections say the peak may not yet have arrived; and the Christmas celebrations and gatherings - though understated this year - could contribute to a spike of over 20% in cases per day by January. Canada’s chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, noted in a statement that it “underscores that the partnership between public health and the public at large is still vitally important to bringing down the infection rate”.The current numbers, she warned, have put the country “on a trajectory for a strong resurgence for the next two months”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-covid-19-infections-tally-tops-half-a-million-mark-even-as-vaccination-is-underway/story-lNWNEZgbC8F6oZ1GupZ4zJ.html

A statement issued by Trudeau’s office said, “With the end of the first five years approaching, it is now time to provide longer-term certainty on the price of pollution out to 2030.”This has sparked dismay in Canada’s agriculture industry. The industry journal Western Producer noted that this “represents a 465% increase in Canada’s default carbon tax rate in less than 10 years”.“The increase could cost western Canadian farmers millions of dollars a year in extra taxes and increase costs for heating farm buildings, drying grain, moving commodities by rail and buying essential farm inputs, such as fertiliser and machinery,” it surmised.It quoted the general manager of the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan Duane Haave as saying, “This would be a major hit to farm margins and viability.”“What do we do when we have jeopardised farms in Canada with a $170 per tonne carbon tax and my neighbour 60 miles to the south of me in North Dakota pays nothing?” Campbell asked.“How can I compete? How will I be able to stay in business?”Bill Campbell, president of Keystone Agricultural Producers in the province of Manitoba, said, “What do we do when we have jeopardised farms in Canada with a $170 per tonne carbon tax and my neighbour 60 miles to the south of me (in North Dakota) pays nothing? How can I compete? How will I be able to stay in business?”Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association president Gunter Jochum echoed the sentiment, “I can’t believe that our federal government would put a crippling tax on small businesses and farmers.” Associations of farmers have also warned that this will lead to an increase in prices of groceries for all Canadians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-farmers-outraged-over-pm-justin-trudeau-s-move-to-hike-carbon-taxes/story-JbsdYunmEhKTS0TZK87G8O.html
20-12-2020||World||Israel begins virus inoculation drive as infections surge||Israel on Sunday began its coronavirus inoculation drive, aiming to vaccinate some 60,000 people a day in a bid to stamp out the illness that is once again surging among its population.The country will first immunize health workers, followed by the elderly, high-risk Israelis and those over 60 years old. Israel says it has secured sufficient doses for much of the country’s 9 million people from both Pfizer and Moderna, whose vaccine US authorities approved this week for emergency use.With public opinion polls showing many Israelis are reluctant to receive shots right away, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would set a “personal example” and insisted on being the first Israeli vaccinated. He received the shot Saturday night.Netanyahu expressed confidence in the vaccine before rolling up the right sleeve of his black, short-sleeve shirt and receiving the injection. He called it an “exciting moment” that would put Israel on the path to returning to its normal routines. The country’s health minister also received the vaccine Saturday.Israel has an agreement with Pfizer to secure 8 million doses of the US pharmaceutical company’s vaccine — enough to cover nearly half of Israel’s population since each person requires two doses. Israel reached a separate agreement with Moderna earlier this month to purchase 6 million doses of its vaccine — enough for another 3 million Israelis.With daily infection numbers trending upward and currently notching just under 3,000 a day, Israeli leaders are again debating whether to impose a third national lockdown since the pandemic began. Many restrictions remain in place from the country’s second lockdown in the fall, with most hotels still shuttered and restaurants open only for delivery and take out. Unemployment remains in the double digits.Israel has had mixed results in its fight against the virus. Netanyahu was lauded in the spring for sealing borders and locking down the country swiftly, a move that battered the economy but drove down infection rates.But a hasty and erratic reopening sent confirmed cases soaring in late summer, leading to what at the time was one of the world’s worst outbreaks.Israel has reported more than 368,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,000 virus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-begins-virus-inoculation-drive-as-infections-surge/story-nmEOsxdy02IliOm7Jt6DmN.html

The recommendation was cleared at an emergency meeting of the cabinet convened by PM Oli on Sunday morning.“Today’s Cabinet meeting decided to recommend the President to dissolve the Parliament,” said Barshaman Pun, energy minister in PM Oli’s cabinet announced in Kathmandu after the meeting.The surprise move comes at a time PM Oli was under intense pressure from the rival factions of the NCP led by former prime ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal better known by his nom de guerre Prachanda and Madhav Nepal.Also Read: PM Oli races to get new anti-graft watchdog boss, heads for a showdown with PrachandaPM Oli had last evening met President Bidya Devi Bhandari at her official residence ‘Shital Niwas’, one of the many meetings that he held on Saturday as he tried to convince his rivals to back down.The dissolution of parliament - he will continue to head the interim government - is seen as a precursor to a split in the party that had been piling pressure on him to withdraw an ordinance that his government had issued on Tuesday to give himself power to make crucial appointments.On Wednesday, the party’s standing committee had passed a resolution that asked PM Oli to withdraw the ordinance. He had agreed to comply at the committee’s meeting but later had other thoughts.On Saturday, PM Oli drove down to Prachanda’s house for one more attempt to reconcile their differences, offering to withdraw the ordinance if the political document that was sharply critical of him was also withdrawn. People familiar with the matter said PM Oli told Prachanda that they needed to work together and find a way out of the crisis. But Prachanda did not budge.PM Oli took the call soon after. He is learnt to have sounded out Home minister Ram Bahadur Thapa, who is seen to be close to Prachanda, and sought his support in dissolving the House.At his meeting with President Bhandari that continued till midnight, Nepal watchers said PM Oli was advised against taking such a drastic action. But PM Oli had made up his mind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-pm-oli-springs-a-surprise-on-detractors-dissolves-parliament/story-eUa1HK4to31fOCUrKd5bVK.html

It was not immediately clear when a snap election would be called if, as expected, Nepal’s president accepts the cabinet request.Opposition lawmaker Gagan Thapa of the Nepali Congress said on Twitter the cabinet decision was “unconstitutional and undemocratic”. He did not explain.After his 2017 win, Oli had vowed to fight corruption and poverty but made little progress, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic hammered the poor Himalayan country’s tourism-dependent economy.Infections of the virus that causes the disease have reached 253,184 with 1,777 COVID-19 deaths in the country of 30 million people.Sandwiched between China and India, Nepal is also influenced by the priorities of the giant neighbours keen on expanding their say in the strategically placed country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/recommendation-to-dissolve-nepal-parliament-made-in-emergency-meeting-called-by-pm-kp-sharma-oli-sent-to-president-says-minister/story-MSGC9W6Sy8owJUQ12Ubf1N.html

Anyone who had a severe reaction to a Covid-19 vaccine should not get the second dose, the agency said, defining severe as needing the medication epinephrine or treatment in a hospital.People who have had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in a Covid-19 vaccine should avoid the vaccine formulation containing the ingredient, CDC said. Two vaccines have been approved in the United States under emergency use authorizations.Individuals with histories of severe allergic reaction to vaccines should consult their doctors about the Covid-19 shot. The CDC said people with severe allergies to food, pets, latex or environmental conditions as well as people with allergies to oral medication or a family history of severe allergic reactions could still get vaccinated. The US Food and Drug Administration is investigating around five allergic reactions that happened after people were administered Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine in the United States this week.On Friday, the FDA said that the Moderna Inc vaccine, which received emergency use authorization, should not be given to individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction to any components of the shot.Britain’s medical regulator has said that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reactions to a medicine or food, should not be given the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-issues-guidelines-on-covid-19-vaccination-after-allergic-reactions/story-ki6jpQ9StvKl7KtpUCfYYN.html

There are more than 300 Covid-19 testing locations across New South Wales, the state’s health department said in a Twitter post on Sunday. Premier Gladys Berejiklian, Minister for Health Brad Hazzard and other officials are scheduled to hold a press briefing at 11am Sunday.“It is absolutely vital everyone immediately comes forward for testing if they have even the slightest of Covid-19 symptoms,” New South Wales Health said.Restrictions will be imposed across Sydney to arrest a growing coronavirus outbreak that’s disrupting interstate travel and scuppered the nation’s premier yacht race.Authorities in New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, will limit gatherings in homes and entertainment venues from midnight Sunday after 30 community-acquired Covid-19 cases were recorded in the 24 hours through 8 p.m. Saturday, state Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.At least 28 of the new cases were linked to a growing cluster of infections in the city’s Northern Beaches area that stands at 66. Twenty-three community-acquired Covid-19 cases were reported the day before, prompting at least three states to impose restrictions or border measures on travelers from Sydney to prevent the coronavirus spreading ahead of Australians gathering to celebrate the Christmas holiday season.“Whilst the numbers are higher today than yesterday, the one positive is we still have not seen evidence of massive seeding outside of the Northern Beaches community,” Berejiklian said. “And our aim, of course, is to keep that in place.”The new outbreak caused the cancellation of the 2020 Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race. The 76-year-old race is the country’s most prestigious yachting event and was scheduled to start from Sydney on Dec. 26.Household gatherings in metropolitan Sydney will be limited to 10 visitors until at least 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 23, the New South Wales Health department said.Indoor settings including hospitality venues and places of worship will be limited to one person per 4 square meters (43 square feet), with a maximum of 300 people. Singing and chanting at indoor venues will also be barred.Stay at home orders for residents in the Northern Beaches Local Government area will also continue until midnight Wednesday.“We realize the effect this will have on residents and venues, and hope to lift the cap and restrictions as soon as possible,” Berejiklian said. “But we must take this action now to ensure we keep on top of this outbreak.”Australia’s New South Wales recorded 30 new coronavirus cases overnight on Sunday, the state’s Premier Gladys Berejiklian said, as an outbreak in the city’s northern beaches suburbs continues to grow.Of the new cases, 28 were directly linked to the cluster in the suburbs and two were under investigation, Berejiklian said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-testing-expanded-in-sydney-s-northern-beaches-amid-cluster/story-zEQcTJTlZNjsMoAzGVZYRJ.html

He called it an “exciting moment” that would put Israel on the path to returning to its normal routines.The event also gave Netanyahu, who has come under heavy public criticism for his management of the coronavirus crisis, a political boost as the country appears to be heading to its fourth election in just two years.Netanyahu’s coalition government with his rival, Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz, has been plagued by paralysis and dysfunction since taking office in May and will automatically collapse on Tuesday, if it cannot pass a budget. That would trigger a new election three months from now.After receiving his shot, Netanyahu was placed in observation for half an hour to monitor for possible allergic reactions. He told reporters afterwards that he was determined to lead the country out of the coronavirus crisis.Israel’s health minister, Yuli Edelstein, also was vaccinated Saturday. Other Israeli leaders, including the figurehead president and military chief, were expected to follow suit on Sunday along with frontline healthcare workers. The vaccination campaign is set to expand to the broader public in the coming weeks.Netanyahu has said the government has secured sufficient doses for Israel’s 9 million people from both Pfizer and Moderna, whose vaccine U.S. authorities approved this week for emergency use.But polls have shown that many Israelis are reluctant to receive shots right away.Also Read: Covid vaccine can turn people into ‘crocodiles’: Brazilian President BolsonaroIsrael has had mixed results in its fight against the virus. Netanyahu was lauded in the spring for sealing borders and locking down the country swiftly, a move that battered the economy but drove down infection rates.But a hasty and erratic reopening sent confirmed cases soaring in late summer, leading to what at the time was one of the world’s worst outbreaks. A second nationwide lockdown has only been partially lifted since then amid a new surge in daily reported cases. Unemployment remains in the double digits.Israel has reported more than 366,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,000 virus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. The country currently is recording nearly 3,000 new cases a day, and officials have begun debating the possibility of a third nationwide lockdown to bring the outbreak under control.As Netanyahu spoke about his vaccine experience, hundreds of protesters stood outside the prime minister’s official residence in Jerusalem calling for his resignation. Protesters, who have been gathering there weekly for over six months, say Netanyahu should not be prime minister when he is on trial on corruption charges. They also accuse him of bungling the coronavirus crisis.Struggling to beat back the virus and watching his popularity plummet, Netanyahu has for months seen vaccinations as the key to bringing an end to the havoc wrought by the virus.Israel has an agreement with Pfizer to secure 8 million doses of the U.S. pharmaceutical company’s vaccine — enough to cover nearly half of Israel’s population since each person requires two doses. Netanyahu had personally reached out multiple times to Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla, boasting that at one point he was able to reach the CEO at 2 a.m.He thanked Bourla on Saturday and called the Pfizer chief “my new personal friend.”Israel has mobile vaccination units with refrigerators that can keep the Pfizer shots at the required minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 F). Israel reached a separate agreement with Moderna earlier this month to purchase 6 million doses of its vaccine — enough for another 3 million Israelis. Officials expect to be able to administer over 60,000 doses a day.The vaccination rollout comes at an opportune time for Netanyahu, whose Likud Party has been weakened in public opinion polls in recent months and faces a challenge from a new faction led by a former Likud lawmaker. If the country is plunged into a new election campaign, a widespread vaccination drive might reverse the long-serving leader’s political fortunes.“This was a small injection for one man, but a great step for all of our health,” he quipped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-joins-world-leaders-getting-covid-19-vaccine/story-2xhXug7ZUsWEuWdhPkIFgN.html

We need to meet the moment with the urgency it demands as we would during any national emergency.”The approach is a shift from Donald Trump’s presidency, which has been marked by efforts to boost oil and gas production while rolling back government efforts intended to safeguard the environment. The incoming Biden team will try to undo or block many of the current administration’s initiatives. There also will be an emphasis on looking out for the low-income, working class and minority communities hit hardest by fossil fuel pollution and climate change.Also Read: Joe Biden’s transition team expresses concern over tensions with Defense DepartmentIn his remarks, Biden stressed the diversity of an emerging team that he described as “brilliant, qualified, tested and barrier-busting.”“Already there are more people of color in our Cabinet than any Cabinet ever,” said the former vice president, who has promised to assemble a group of department leaders who reflect the diversity of America.If confirmed by the Senate, New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland would be the first Native American to lead the Interior Department, which has wielded influence over the nation’s tribes for generations. Former two-term Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm is in line to be energy secretary.North Carolina official Michael Regan would be the first African American man to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Regan, the state environmental head since 2017, has made a name for himself by pursuing cleanups of industrial toxins and helping the low-income and minority communities significantly affected by pollution.Also Read: President Trump signs bill that could remove Chinese stocks from USBiden’s nominee to oversee the Council on Environmental Quality is Brenda Mallory.

They are Gina McCarthy, to serve as national climate adviser, and Ali Zaidi, to serve as her deputy. McCarthy was EPA administrator from 2013 to 2017 during President Barack Obama’s second term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-introduces-his-climate-team-says-no-time-to-waste/story-AHr1Ft0sNPDpR3hPtgCrWM.html

The World Health Organization has been informed of the development.Johnson announced the creation of a new tier – Tier 4 – in the Covid-19 alert system, under which towns and areas in England are placed. London has been in the top Tier 3 with the toughest restrictions, but has gone further in the lockdown-like Tier 4. The curbs take effect from Sunday morning until December 30.Johnson said in a televised briefing from Downing Street, “There is still much we don’t know. While we are fairly certain the variant is transmitted more quickly, there is no evidence to suggest that it is more lethal or causes more severe illness. Equally there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine will be any less effective against the new variant.“Our experts will continue their work to improve our understanding of the variant. So we are learning more about this variant as we go. But we know enough already to be sure that we must act now.“First, we will introduce new restrictions in the most affected areas – specifically those parts of London, the South East and the East of England which are currently in tier 3. These areas will enter a new tier 4, which will be broadly equivalent to the national restrictions which were in place in England in November.”Life under Tier 4 in London and southeast England from Sunday morning will be similar to the lockdown, which includes people staying at home, unless moving out for exemptions allowed; non-retail shops, gyms and leisure facilities to close; work from home; people must not travel out of Tier 4 areas.Health secretary announced the discovery of the variant in parliament on Monday, while Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, gave more details of the variant identified by Public Health England’s genomic surveillance. According to Whitty, this is a “critical and dangerous moment”.Whitty added, “As a result of the rapid spread of the new variant, preliminary modelling data and rapidly rising incidence rates in the southeast, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) now considers that the new strain can spread more quickly.“We have alerted the WHO and are continuing to analyse the available data to improve our understanding. There is no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments, although urgent work is underway to confirm this.”Johnson said Christmas this year “will be very different”, adding that people in all tiers should not travel, which will affect travel to meet families over the festive period. The curbs come days after he had announced relaxations for Christmas, which are now scrapped.“As prime minister, it is my duty to take the difficult decisions, to do what is right to protect the people of this country. Given the early evidence we have on this new variant of the virus, and the potential risk it poses, it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned,” Johnson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alarm-over-new-covid-19-variant-puts-london-in-lockdown/story-ECwIUiufDSjoQZkAIvawPI.html

A policy will be prepared in this direction after discussion with industrialists. Our daughters are fully qualified to work in industrial units,” Chouhan said.He made the statement while inaugurating a large diameter welded pipe manufacturing unit of Welspun Group at Jamunia Khejda in Raisen district, the state Public Relations Department said in a statement.Chouhan appreciated the company’s move of providing about 50 per cent jobs to women at the newly-started plant.He said that the roadmap of Aatmanirbhar (self- reliant) Madhya Pradesh has been prepared during the coronavirus outbreak period.“The Madhya Pradesh government is also focusing on skill development. For this, an initiative has been taken to start Global Skill Park in Bhopal,” the chief minister said.Chouhan said that the employment potential cannot be realised only through agriculture as there is a limit of the farm sector.“Therefore, there is a need to focus on other areas for employment. For this, skill is necessary, so that people get employment. And for this, Global Skill Park will be set up at a cost of Rs 600 crore,” he said.He said that despite the difficulties posed by the coronavirus outbreak this year, the farmers in MP have surpassed those in Punjab by producing 1.29 crore metric tonnes of wheat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-govt-eyes-policy-to-give-more-jobs-to-women-in-industries/story-fecRHlr4z9YmJZ8I4iaWhN.html

This time, Mayawati has directed party leaders and workers to assist migrants, farmers, labourers and the poor people who are facing problems due to the economic slowdown. She has also asked the party leaders to follow the Covid-19 protocol announced by the government during the birthday celebration. There would be no gathering or assembly of workers, the party said.Mayawati is camping in Delhi, where she is holding regular review meetings to gear up the party cadre for the 2022 assembly election in Uttar Pradesh. She has directed the party officers to expedite the strengthening of the party organisation at the booth level. To regain lost ground, the BSP has plans to win back the support of Brahmins, backward classes and Muslims, the party leader said.The BSP did not win any seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. It bagged 19 seats in the 2017 UP assembly polls and 10 in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, when it had an alliance with the Samajwadi Party but parted ways soon after the results were declared.The party chief’s birthday programme would be finalised soon, the BSP leader said, adding that earlier the main function used to be organised at the party’s state unit office in Lucknow. Later in the evening, she used to leave for Delhi to celebrate her birthday with the office bearers of the party’s national unit.Under the Jankalyankari Diwas programme, the BSP leaders will assist the needy, poor and the handicapped. “We will visit hamlets or hospitals to distribute sweets and fruits,” said a BSP leader.About two years after Mayawati became UP chief minister for the fourth time in 2007, there was a grand celebration across the state on January 15, 2009. The display of opulence was quite palpable, the city was draped in blue and a massive stage was set up on the ground near the chief minister’s residence. The BSP supporters were transported from all the districts and neighbouring states to participate in the programme.Over the years, party MPs, MLAs and workers have been donating funds to the party for the occasion. The fund-raising drive is termed ‘arthik sahyog’ (economic cooperation) by the BSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weeks-before-birthday-mayawati-asks-bsp-workers-to-help-needy/story-xPSOZFnpyPZVkVRPnFKwqO.html

On the first day of his campaign, Palaniswami had announced a dole for 2.06 crore ration card holders to receive Rs 2,500 along with raw rice, sugarcane, cashew, grapes and sugar for the harvest festival of Pongal celebrated in Tamil Nadu in January. Ahead of the elections, where the AIADMK is seeking a third consecutive term, the party has made efforts to appease different caste groups and minority communities.Earlier in December, during his inspection in flood-affected areas after Cyclone Nivar and Buveri in Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and Thiruvarur districts, Palaniswami offered prayers at the Nagore Dargah and Vailankanni Church. In February, the state government had invited applicants from Christians to avail the financial assistance to visit the holy land in Jerusalem for a period of ten days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-increases-grant-for-christians-to-visit-jerusalem/story-1TbOBmxnI5MQjPsAC8cfVI.html

His remarks comes days after the health ministry released a document, answering public queries on vaccination.“Our first priority has been safety and effectiveness of vaccines. We don’t want to compromise on that. I personally feel, maybe in any week of January, we can be in a position to give first Covid vaccine shot to people of India,” news agency ANI quoted Vardhan as saying.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) is examining the applications of Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India (SII) and Pfizer to grant emergency use authorisation for their Covid-19 vaccines. Last week, the Centre had said that the DGCI has sought more data from these companies but it will not impact the timeline of vaccine rollout.Also Read: Second Covid-19 vaccine authorized in US ships outThe National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), headed by NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul, has recommended that 10 million healthcare staff, 20 million frontline workers and 270 million people over the age of 50 or with co-morbidities be given the vaccines on priority once it becomes available.The high-level group of ministers (GoM) on Covid-19 met on Saturday where Dr Paul made a presentation on three critical aspects of vaccination as well as the details of the six vaccine candidates undergoing trial in India.Apart from discussions on vaccines, the GoM, which met for the first time since October, was also provided data on the current situation of the infection in the country by the director of the National Centre for Disease Control Dr Sujeet Singh.Also Read: Health ministry calls urgent meeting of key group after new strain of Covid-19 found in UKHe presented an analysis of the pandemic in each state, pointing out critical parameters like positivity rate, breakup of the proportion of rapid antigen test and RT-PCR, concentration of cases in particular districts, and fatality within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maybe-in-january-harsh-vardhan-on-first-covid-19-shot/story-yw1eVlwMy0bOZfr5nWedwI.html

Encroachment of Kathajodi and Mahanadi rivers and construction in floodplain area may adversely affect the riverine ecology. There is a need to prevent irreversible damage to the riverine ecology by enforcing the applicable rules. Flood plain zones need to be identified and demarcated in the light of such norms. The Committee may identify the extent of floodplain zone/active floodplain zone from the edge of the river. The committee may complete its exercise within four months,” the four-judge bench of NGT headed by chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said.The NGT order came in response to a petition filed by Dilip Samantray, a Cuttack-based citizen to the state government’s plan of transforming the state-run SCB Medical College and Hospital into an “AIIMS Plus” institute with an expenditure of Rs 1000 crore earlier this year. Samantray in his petition had alleged that illegal construction activities such as Panchamukhi Hanuman Temple, paddy threshing ground and proposed structures such as toilet, graveyard, market complex, Kalyan mandap and other activities adversely affect the river ecology and disturbed the flow of Mahanadi river.“The reclamation of land from our lifeline Mahanadi has created once in a lifetime opportunity to breathe fresh life into the core of our ancient city,” chief minister Naveen Patnaik had said while unveiling the plan in January this year. As per the plan, 424 acres of land were to be reclaimed from Mahanadi river for expansion of the medical college though the state government in its affidavit before the NGT said a new campus of SCB medical college is proposed on 25 acres of land reclaimed from the river.The NGT said there is no central legislation to regulate the flood plains, except an October 2016 notification issued by the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development, and Ganga Rejuvenation, with respect to Ganga river, under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, prohibiting any construction in the active floodplain area of river Ganga or its tributaries.“The Water Resources Ministry circulated a model Bill on the subject in 1975 but the same did not fructify into law. There are some State Acts like Manipur Flood Zoning Act, 1978 and the Uttarakhand Flood Plain Zoning Act, 2012. The Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017 prohibit any permanent constructions within 50 meters of the Wetlands, from the mean high flood level in the past 10 years from the commencement of the rules. In Maharashtra, there are norms for demarcating regulatory and prohibitory zones in the floodplains of the rivers. There are also similar restrictions in certain Master Plans like the Revised Master Plan of Bangalore restricting constructions in catchment area of the lakes,” said the NGT bench observing that Odisha did not appear to have any legislative and administrative measures regulating and prohibiting activities in the floodplain zones of the rivers in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-save-mahanadi-river-ngt-orders-setting-up-expert-panel-to-lay-down-norms/story-sL4SUwQklBXBfCiTz17NoO.html

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice since 2009 with support from the GJM and other parties demanding creation of a separate state since it promised to find a permanent political solution to the hill issue and accord scheduled tribe status to 11 Gorkha communities. “I have joined hands with chief minister Mamata Banerjee. We will win 17 to 18 assembly seats in north Bengal. The BJP betrayed the Gorkhas and wasted our 12 years,” Gurung said at the meeting. He said Banerjee has assured him that she will find a permanent political solution to the Gorkhaland issue. There are six assembly seats in the Darjeeling hills, of which the TMC holds one while the BJP has none. The CPI (M) has one seat, the GJM has two while the remaining two are in the control of the Congress. The Gorkha community has presence in the adjoining districts in the plains as well. The two GJM legislators from Darjeeling offered support to the BJP after the 2016 assembly polls but Gurung has now withdrawn his support. Gurung went into hiding in 2017 after being charged under the anti-terror law by the Mamata Banerjee government for the violent Gorkhaland movement. He appeared before the media in Kolkata in October and announced that he was shifting his allegiance to Banerjee. Since then, the rivalry between Gurung and Binoy Tamang, his former lieutenant who has been heading a pro-TMC faction of the GJM since 2017, has intensified. Though Tamang and his men are opposed to Gurung’s entry into Darjeeling, the erstwhile fugitive leader was received with a warm welcome on Sunday. Gurung told his followers that he will start calling the shots in hill politics very soon. Without directly naming Tamang and his associate Anit Thapa, chairman of the board of administrators in Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), Gurung said, “They cannot deliver anything despite all the support they have.” Since the TMC failed to wrest the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat from the BJP in 2019 despite having the support of Tamang and Thapa, Gurung targeted the duo. “Why should they be supported (by the TMC)?” he said. “The two must leave within 10 to 12 days,” Gurung said. Local people said Gurung hinted that he wants Tamang and Thapa to step down from the GTA. Gurung returned to Siliguri town on December 6 and addressed a rally. He was waiting for the right time to visit Darjeeling. Political equations in the Darjeeling hills suddenly changed after Gurung pledged support to the TMC. “The BJP should be defeated at any cost and I will ensure that keeping the chief minister in front of us,” Gurung said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gorkha-leader-bimal-gurung-tmc-s-new-ally-holds-first-rally-in-darjeeling/story-n60Fosqf4GazyBWXnyVU4M.html
20-12-2020||India||Armed with data, TMC counters Shah’s claims on BJP workers’ killings||A day after Union home minister Amit Shah welcomed seven Trinamool Congress (TMC) MLAs, including Suvendu Adhikari and three MLAs from other parties into the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at a rally in Midnapore, the TMC on Sunday hit back with what it called a fact sheet. Shah, at the rally, brought several charges against the ruling party and the state government.TMC leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien, circulated data on social media to counter Shah’s claims. Shah’s Sunday visit to Visva Bharati, Bengal’s only Central university that was set up by Rabindranath Tagore, was also criticized by the TMC and Left student unions.“Shah claimed on Saturday that 300 BJP workers have been killed in Bengal in one and a half years. This is a lie. Many BJP workers are being killed in faction feuds. Even suicides are being passed off as political killings. Fact is that since 1998, 1,027 TMC workers have been killed. It is also on record that 116 BJP Lok Sabha members have criminal record,” said senior TMC leader and panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee.On Saturday, Shah defended Adhikari who was branded by the TMC as a traitor. “Didi (Mamata Banerjee) didn’t you leave the Congress and came to the TMC? Wasn’t it changing allegiance?” Shah said.“Mamata Banerjee did not leave the Congress to join another party. If a Union Minister tried to sell off the history of our country one needs to protest. Banerjee was not a defector. She set up the TMC, a new party, in 1998,” said Mukherjee. Also read: Health ministry body to hold urgent meeting over new Covid-19 strain in UK“Shah also claimed that people in Bengal do not get benefits under the Centre’s Ayushmann Bharat healthcare scheme. He does not know the facts. Banerjee started the Swasthya Sathi programme two years before Ayushmann Bharat was launched. Under this scheme, 1.4 crore families have been provided health insurance that covers expenses up to Rs 5 lakh per annum,” said Mukherjee.“Shah claimed that farmers in Bengal are deprived of Rs 6,000 per annum under the Prime Minister’s central scheme. Reality is that Bengal provides farmers annual assistance of Rs 5,000 per acre under the Krishak Bandhu programme. The Central scheme provides only Rs 1,214 per acre. Also, the Bengal government pays full insurance premium under Sasya Bima whereas the Centre takes part of premium from farmers,” said Mukherjee. “Shah had food at a villager’s home on Saturday and said the house was provided under the Prime Minister Awas Yojna scheme. This is another false claim,” said Mukherjee. “The Centre pays 60 per cent of the money under this scheme while the state pays the rest. Between 2011-2020, the state has built 33,87,000 houses costing Rs 39,993 crore. Under the state’s own Geetanjali Prakalpa, 3,90,000 houses were built at an expense of Rs 3,550 crore. Under the ‘Housing for All’ scheme, 4,30,000 houses were built. This cost the state exchequer another Rs 7,000 crore,” said Mukherjee. The TMC also countered Shah’s claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sent food grains for people of Bengal and it was misappropriated by TMC workers. “Reality is that under Bengal’s Khadya Sathi programme, around 10 crore people will be provided free ration till June 2021. No government in the country has ever done this. This is an all-time record,” said Mukherjee. During the day, chief minister Mamata Banerjee condemned the Centre’s move to send three Indian Police Service officers to other states. These officers were in charge of the security of BJP national president JP Nadda’s convoy that was stoned in South 24 Parganas district on December 10.TMC leaders said chief ministers from non-BJP-ruled states have called up Banerjee and expressed their solidarity on this issue.“Centre is brazenly interfering with State Govt functioning by transferring police officers. My gratitude to @bhupeshbaghel @ArvindKejriwal @capt_amarinder @ashokgehlot51 & @mkstalin for showing solidarity to people of Bengal & reaffirming their commitment to federalism. Thank you!” tweeted Mamata Banerjee on Sunday.On Sunday, Shah’s visit to Visva Bharati was also criticized by the TMC.Also read: Microsoft to kill passwords by 2021; Here’s what it will doTMC leaders in Kolkata staged a protest against placards, with images of Shah placed above Tagore, that were found all over Bolpur town on Friday. This triggered a strong reaction among residents. Claiming that the TMC had put up the placards to sabotage Shah’s visit, BJP workers quickly removed them. The TMC set up a podium outside the Tagore family’s palatial home at Jorasanko in north Kolkata and staged a protest. “The placards demeaned Tagore’s rich heritage,” said Mukherjee. The Students Federation of India, the students’ wing of the CPI(M), alleged that students who opposed Shah’s visit to Visva Bharati were pressured by the university authorities to withdraw the agitation. “When the students refused to comply, the police put two student leaders under house arrest. SFI condemns this. We have always fought against saffronisation of educational spaces,” said SFI national general secretary Mayukh Biswas. An official from the Santiniketan police station said the police took no such action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-with-data-tmc-counters-shah-s-claims-on-bjp-workers-killings/story-FFePW4vd8zWlOnIIa7ATGM.html
20-12-2020||India||Kerala to call special session of assembly to reject new farm laws||The Kerala government has decided to convene a special session of the assembly on Wednesday to reject the new farm laws being enacted by the Union government that have triggered large-scale protests in the country.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office said the government will approach Governor Arif Mohammad Khan to call a special session of the assembly. Opposition Congress and other parties have also pledged their support for the move. In the 140-member house the Bharatiya Janata Party has a single legislator. During the one-hour session a motion will be introduced to reject these bills and it will be put to vote. Earlier, the Delhi assembly had rejected all three farms laws, which had turned into a bone of contention, and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal later tore the copies of the bills in the house. Like Delhi, Kerala has also taken a consistent position from the beginning and announced its decision to move the Supreme Court against these laws. After its recent victory in the local body polls, the government has decided to be more vocal against the Centre.But the BJP has criticised the move saying it was a politically motivated decision. “It is nothing more than a political stunt. It is as futile as passing a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Both the CPI (M) and Congress are wasting public money for cheap political stunts,” Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan, hailing from the state said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-to-call-special-session-of-assembly-to-reject-new-farm-laws/story-6sdSiyL0VubS00aIx2EDFJ.html

WHO’s India representative Dr Roderico H Ofrin, who is also a member of the JMG, is likely to participate in the meeting.According to health ministry website, the JMG has been formed to review regularly the global/ Indian situation, and provide recommendations on technical matters to the ministry. It would also monitor outbreak situation.British health secretary Matt Hancock on Sunday raised the prospect that London could be under lockdown for months as he has warned it will be “very difficult” to keep a virulent new strain of the coronavirus under control until vaccinations are rolled out.“It is going to be very difficult to keep it under control until we have the vaccine rolled out,” he said. “We know with this new variant you can catch it more easily from a small amount of the virus being present.”“All of the different measures we have in place, we need more of them to control the spread of the new variant than we did to control the spread of the old variant,” he said. “That is the fundamental problem.”On Saturday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the new tier four of Covid-19 restrictions for London and other parts of England to combat an alarming surge in infections linked to a new virulent strain.“New variant may be up to 70 per cent more transmissible,” he said.A number of European countries have banned flights from the UK as the British government warned that the potent new strain of the virus was “out of control” and imposed a stringent new stay-at-home lockdown from Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-calls-urgent-meeting-of-key-group-after-new-strain-of-covid-19-found-in-uk/story-i6QRyFuLu9zhmUeMaErXdJ.html

20-12-2020||India||Bengal has set 3 dangerous trends in Indian politics: Amit Shah||West Bengal has set three trends in Indian politics - politicization of administration, criminalization of politics and institutionalizing corruption – Union home minister Amit Shah said on Saturday alleging that the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress had turned into a family-party. “West Bengal has set three dangerous trends in Indian politics - politicization of administration, criminalization of politics and institutionalizing corruption. All these three trends are dangerous for democracy and people of the state,” Shah said while urging the people to join the BJP juggernaut so that there could be change. He was on a two-day visit to West Bengal to bolster the BJP’s campaign in poll-bound Bengal. Shah has set a target of winning more than 200 out of the 294 seats in the state assembly. While the Trinamool Congress is desperately trying to highlight the development-work made by the Mamata Banerjee-administration in the past 10 years, Shah attacked the successive Left Front and TMC governments alleging that the rank of West Bengal has been sliding on various fronts including per capita income, state’s share in GDP and industrial production among others over the past few decades. “West Bengal used to rank number 1 on many fronts. But today its rank is below 20 on most fronts. Today the state is number one in corruption, nepotism, violence, in bomb making and explosion and killing of opposition workers,” Shah said. He said that not a single farmer has received central funds because the state didn’t send the list. The TMC supremo has been supporting the farmers’ protest against farm laws and Shah also attacked the state’s ruling party on that. “At least 2.3 million farmers from Bengal have applied online for Rs 6,000 a year from the Centre. You (Mamata Banerjee) just have to certify them but you are not even doing that. Sign them assuming that you are giving an autograph. Send a letter assuming that it is your nephew’s birthday. It would help many farmers,” he added.He alleged that the TMC’s main slogan of Ma Mati Manush (Mother, Soil and People) had given way to corruption, nepotism and appeasement. “Such things happen when the state’s leader instead of thinking about the 100 million voters thinks about her nephew and how to make him the next chief minister,” he added. Shah said that Bengal accounted for 30% of India’s industrial production during Independence and today it has come down 3.5%. Bengal’s per capita income was double than that of Maharashtra in the 1960s and today it is just half of Maharashtra. In the 1950s Bengal had registered 70% of India’s pharmaceutical production and today it is just around 7%. “I am sure TMC will challenge these data. Let me know the place and our youth wing leader will meet you there for a debate and tell you the source of this data,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-has-set-3-dangerous-trends-in-indian-politics-amit-shah/story-kFp9bdxWavePK4B0ZTedgP.html
20-12-2020||India||Now, 5,000 visitors can visit Sabarimala in day; RT-PCR test mandatory||The Sabarimala temple in Kerala’s Pathanamthitta district opened for 5,000 pilgrims on Sunday after the high court gave a nod to increasing the daily cap on visitors. Earlier the limit was set to 2,000 pilgrims a day. The temple was shut for nearly seven months due to the coronavirus pandemic. In November, the shrine reopened for the annual two-month-long Mandala-Makaravilakku. Under the revised guidelines, The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), which runs the hill shrine dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, also mandated that the visitors will need to show RT-PCR certificate to order to visit the temple.Here is the all you need to know about the guidelines:- Post-December 26, devotees will be allowed to visit Sabarimala hill shrine only after producing a Covid-negative certificate following an RT-PCR test. Earlier, a negative certificate from antigen test was enough for the devotees to visit the shrine.- An RT-PCR test certificate should not be more than 48 hours old prior to the visit to the temple.- Pilgrims still need to register online before visiting the temple. The online booking will be done on first-come-first-served basis.- Strict adherence to the Covid-19 protocol is mandatory for all pilgrims as authorities will keep strict vigil that social distancing of at least six feet is being maintained and masks are being properly worn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-5-000-visitors-can-visit-sabarimala-in-day-rt-pcr-test-mandatory/story-yzn3nRJmWfcry2gdcVfuXK.html
20-12-2020||India||Kisan Diwas on Dec 23, toll collection to be halted in Haryana from Dec 25: Farmers intensify stir||The farmers, protesting near Delhi seeking the repeal of contentious farm laws, are intensifying their stir by announcing they will halt toll collection in Haryana from December 25 to 27. Before that, the protesters will celebrate Kisan Diwas on December 23. The farmers have urged people to skip cooking their lunch to show their solidarity with the movement, ANI reported citing Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait. Meanwhile, Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India Party who has been supporting the protests, announced that farmers will hold a 24-hour relay hunger strike starting December 21 at all protest sites.Farmers have been intensifying their demonstrations against the three farm laws enacted by Parliament in September as the unions said that they are seeing any pragmatic changes from the government’s side. “The government is delaying our matter unnecessarily. They should have repealed the laws by now and send the farmers back to their homes. Although the government has stated that before the new year begins there would be a solution, however pragmatically speaking, we are not seeing anything hopeful or even close to that,” ANI reported Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Manjit Singh Rai as saying.Several protesting leaders demanding the complete withdrawal of the laws also threatened to step up their agitation and said that they are prepared to celebrate the Republic Day next year with their own tractor rally on Delhi borders.The three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kisan-diwas-on-dec-23-toll-collection-to-be-halted-in-haryana-from-dec-25-farmers-intensify-stir/story-weTAubr2r3OwuIUoZyeYZM.html

However, the health department said only six people were confirmed to have been infected so far and 26 others are suspected cases of the infection. Some of the suspected people were discharged later.“We have started inspection of all houses in the affected areas. Initial reports do suggest water contamination led to the infection. We have asked people to drink only boiled water and maintain strict personal hygiene,” said health minister K K Shailaja. She said samples of water and food were collected and sent for detailed lab examination. ALSO READ | North Kerala on high alert after 11-yr-old boy dies due to shigella bacterial infection District medical officer V Jayashree said at least 150 people attended the medical camp organised by the health department in the last two days. She said experts are trying to trace the root cause of the infection. Local people also said some of their water sources got contaminated and they had no idea how it took place. According to medical experts, shigella bacteria triggers an infection called shigellosis. Diarrhoea, often containing blood or mucus in stool, stomach pain, cramps, fever and vomiting are the main symptoms of the infection. An infected person shows minor symptoms in a day to two but it may take a week or so to show acute symptoms. Children under 10 are most susceptible to contract the infection, though elderly can also get infected, experts said adding patients with underlying medical conditions may require heavy doses of antibiotics.They said usually a person gets infected after taking contaminated water or taking stale food. It is highly contagious and can be transmitted after using a common toilet also. Though a worldwide phenomenon, shigella is seen more often in developing countries, especially in crowded areas. In some cases, people infected with the bacteria do not show symptoms but they are contagious. Experts have also asked people not to have sexual relations with a person who has recently recovered from shigellosis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shigella-infection-experts-try-to-trace-source-in-north-kerala-s-kozhikode-district/story-mEAhJw1BXiGPw80AntFDHO.html
20-12-2020||India||‘More than 300 BJP workers killed in Bengal’: Amit Shah||More than 300 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers have been killed in West Bengal, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Sunday while condemning the attack on the convoy on the party’s national president JP Nadda. “Political violence in the state is at its peak. More than 300 BJP workers have been killed. Investigation in those cases hasn’t moved an inch,” Shah told reporters before leaving West Bengal. He was on a two-day visit to West Bengal to bolster the BJP’s campaign in poll-bound Bengal. Shah has set a target of winning more than 200 out of the 294 seats in the state assembly.While condemning the attack on Nadda’s convoy, which took place earlier this month, Shah said that the attack was not just on Nadda but on the democratic set up in the state and that the reaction which came from the state and the TMC leadership was alarming. Also read: Bengal’s next CM won’t be an ‘outsider’, says Amit Shah“I am also concerned that the reaction, which should have come from the state leadership after the attack, didn’t come. Instead, the statements issued by TMC leaders were, in a way, supporting the attack. That was more alarming,” he added. He, however, warned that the TMC should not stay under a false impression that it would be able to stop the BJP with such violence because more the violence, the more the BJP will work to strengthen itself.He also attacked the TMC on corruption and questioned why was the party opposing a CAG audit ordered by the Calcutta High Court into the distribution of relief materials after Cyclone Amphan. “They have opposed it because there was theft of ration after the cyclone,” he said. The TMC, in its defence, refuted the allegations.“Many BJP workers were killed because of infighting within the party. Even death by suicides were being passed off as political killings. Since 1998, at least 1,027 TMC workers were killed in political rivalry. At least 116 of BJPs Lok Sabha MPs have criminal records,” said Subrata Mukherjee, state minister and senior TMC leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-300-bjp-workers-killed-in-bengal-amit-shah/story-m04nCLHfJdsAlWoHu2pHJO.html
20-12-2020||India||India rejects Pakistan’s allegations about targeting of UN vehicle||India on Sunday dismissed Pakistan’s allegations about a UN vehicle  being deliberately targeted by Indian troops on the Line of Control (LoC) as false and said such fabricated allegations were part of Islamabad’s efforts to cover up its failure to protect UN personnel. Indian officials had on Friday rejected claims by the Pakistani military’s media arm and Foreign Office that a vehicle carrying two officers of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) was “specifically targeted” by Indian troops from across the LoC.Pakistani military spokesman Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar had tweeted photos of the UN vehicle with apparent damage to its windows and chassis, and contended the SUV was the target of “unprovoked fire” in Chirikot sector of the LoC.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “Allegations by Pakistan regarding Indian forces deliberately targeting a UN vehicle on December 18, 2020 have been investigated in detail and found to be factually incorrect and false. “Our forward troops were aware of the visit of UN military observers in the area and did not conduct any firing as alleged.”Srivastava said that instead of repeating “baseless and fabricated allegations against India to cover up its own failure in ensuring the safety and security of UN personnel in territory under its control, Pakistan should responsibly investigate its lapses”. He added that India has conveyed its findings and views on “these misrepresentations” to the Pakistani side.Shortly before India made clear its position on Sunday evening, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said it had taken up the incident with the UN and asked it to “initiate a transparent investigation” into the matter.In a letter addressed to the UN secretary general and the president of the Security Council, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN alleged the “deliberate targeting of the UN Observers and their vehicle – which was clearly marked with UN logo and flying a blue flag of the UN – appears to be a new coercive and reckless ploy by India to hinder UNMOGIP’s work, and facilitate another Indian military misadventure against Pakistan”.The letter further alleged Pakistan had information the Indian government “was planning to stage a ‘false flag’ attack to divert attention from its domestic difficulties, and create justification for another misadventure against Pakistan”. “If that were to happen, Pakistan will exercise its right to self-defence,” the letter said.Indian officials have dismissed a string of similar claims by Pakistani officials over the past few days, saying they were part of an effort by Islamabad to cover up its failure to counter terrorism emanating from Pakistani soul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-pakistan-s-allegations-about-targeting-of-un-vehicle/story-oXt7ntYqnQn88jm5UhG32I.html

Items such as Dholaks, sunglasses, duffle bags, socks, slippers, shirts, coats can be seen being sold.Sahane Alam (20) who earlier used to sell dholaks in alleys of Delhi has started selling them here during the last two-three days.“So far I have sold five ‘dholaks’ and have 10 more to sell. People who are staying here at Singhu border are buying these dholaks. There are a few more like me who are selling here. Tomorrow I will bring more ‘dholaks’. The price is Rs 100 per piece,” Alam told ANI.Ravi Kumar (26) has started selling duffel bags near the first barricade at Singhu border from today.“I used to sell bags at Jahangirpuri. When I got to know that people like me are coming here for business purposes I also came. People here require big bags. I am satisfied. I am earning a good amount. Now onwards I will come here,” said Ravi.Along with these items, street food such as boiled eggs, bread omelette, paranthas, chaat can be found in ample quantities.56-years-old Virender Sahani said, “Since the protest started, I stopped my business. Recently I found people from various places started coming here for business. I decided to start again. I am happy being back in business.”However, given the scores of langars which various voluntary organisations are running in the entire stretch starting from the main stage, most of the street foods sellers are limiting themselves to places near the first barricade.Around 40 farmers’ unions are steadfast in their demand to repeal the farm laws. They have held several rounds of talks with the centre. Farmers have been protesting on different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws-Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/street-vendors-gather-at-singhu-border-hoping-for-more-sales/story-ZrWuZdSa7yktdu8bJFtd4L.html

The master plan was submitted on December 4 to the Civil Aviation Ministry for its comments. Once the ministry sends it back, it would be taken up by the NIAL Board for approval after which construction and development work would begin,” Singh said.“The project, so far, is coming up as per schedule and the first flight from the airport is expected to take off in 2023. It would be either December 2023 or January 2024,” Singh told PTI in an interview.Singh, also the CEO of the local Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), said the flight operation has to begin within three years of the signing of the concession agreement.Over 1,300 hectare of land from six villages of Rohi, Parohi, Kishorepur, Dayanatpu, Ranhera and Banwari Bans in the Jewar tehsil has been acquired by the state government under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act, 2013, for the first phase development of the airport.The Noida International Airport will have two runways and a capacity for handling 12 million passengers per annum in the first phase. Eventually, it will have five runways and a passenger capacity of 70 million a year when completed at an estimated to cost Rs 29,560 crore in total, according to officials.On the resettlement and rehabilitation of affected people, Singh said all tenders regarding the exercise have already been awarded and work is underway. This work will be completed in six months and all displaced families will be rehabilitated and resettled in Jewar Bangar, he added.“There are 3,076 families which are to be resettled. First and foremost, the families whose land has been taken up for the first runway will be resettled and then those whose land has been acquired for the second runway,” he said.“Altogether, the resettlement and rehabilitation of these families from the six villages will cost the government around Rs 350 crore,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-flight-from-noida-airport-likely-by-dec-2023-or-jan-2024-says-top-executive/story-vEzBXWpy8iLde8pywYcbzO.html

He’s busy making the final arrangements for the first match of the volleyball team he coaches in Majuli, the world’s biggest river island located in Assam. Upper Majuli, Saikia’s team of boys under 16 years, which is part of the ongoing Brahmaputra Volleyball League (BVL), are going to face a team from Monomoy tea estate in Jorhat and everyone in the region is excited. “The game was to start at 11 am but as the ferry carrying the team to Majuli reached late, we are having a delayed start. We hope to start with a win. Next month we will visit them for an away game,” said Saikia. “The league has reignited passion for volleyball in our area. A lot of new players are coming out and they are being encouraged by their parents. Other villagers are also involved in preparing the ground, ensuring proper hospitality of visiting team, etc,” he added. Though only four of his wards are taking part in the league, Saikia is training 62 players at present. Upper Majuli is being sponsored by Krishna Hazarika Rao and Asawari Parmar, both international badminton players who represented the country in several competitions.

At present, 50 teams, 33 of them boys and 17 girls, representing rural areas across Assam are taking part in the BVL, the brainchild of Abhijeet Bhattacharya, a former national volleyball captain. After representing India at various levels for many years and leading the team, Bhattacharya joined Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) and was looking for ways to give back to the game in some way when he visited a village in Thelamara close to his hometown Tezpur 12 years ago. “At the village, we saw around 15 girls playing volleyball while the boys were sitting and watching. When asked, they said their volleyball has got damaged and they need to wait for few months to get a new one. I then decided to do something positive and lasting for volleyball,” he said. Bhattacharya gave the boys a new ball and a net and started organising matches among teams in the area. He also got parents of the players and village elders involved. Soon, the matches became an anticipated activity where villagers came to watch and cheer the teams and cooked meals for all those gathered. With partial funding from the ONGC and support of friends, a sports hostel was built between 2014 and 2018 at Beseria near Tezpur where the players could come and get trained. Bhattacharya also formed an organization called Rengoni Youth Sports Foundation. A discussion with few former players led to start of the Assam Volleyball Mission 100 in September last year with the objective of providing 100 volleyballs to teams in need across Assam. This initiative connected Bhattacharya with 50 small teams across the state. Soon, a three-week training programme under an Indian team coach was organised in Tezpur to upgrade the skills of coaches who were involved in these teams. For the first time, these coaches learnt proper techniques to improve fitness and volleyball skills of the players. The next step was to create 100 players who can represent the state and the country and play the game professionally. But all plans took a backseat with Covid-19 pandemic sweeping the country. “In order to keep players motivated, I developed a module to impart training to them online. It started with young players from three tea gardens. It soon turned into the Brahmaputra Volley League with the aim of making Assam one of the best volleyball teams in the country,” said Bhattacharya. While normal teams have six players per side, it was decided to keep team size at four players with players going from one village to another to play games - a home and away format. The host village was asked to develop the play area and arrange food and stay for the visiting teams. In order to provide for kit, uniform and travel costs of teams, the word was spread to look for sponsors who would spend at least Rs 15,000 per team. This brought in people like former Indian national badminton champion Aparna Popat who adopted teams. “I came to know about it from a couple of friends who were sponsoring teams. I got very excited as this is something which is being done in a planned manner in the grassroots. My team has lost its first two games, but the joy of children playing is worth it,” said Popat who sponsors Pub Nalbari.

I, along with friends from school and university, am involved in five teams. We are very positive that this initiative will change the volleyball scenario in Assam,” said Devabrata Chakravarty, joint secretary of Assam Association, Mumbai. Soon, a logo was made and someone even wrote and composed a song for the league. The logo was unveiled by eminent athlete Hima Das earlier this month and the league started from December 12 with matches held on weekends so that players are able to return to their homes the same day. The league will end in February next year. “One can start a volleyball team with as low as Rs 2,000 - the cost for a good ball and the net. The small step taken by us has been warmly received by players and villagers and even without any involvement of the state government, it has become a movement. This is a very good sign for the game,” said Bhattacharya. Sunday ended on a good note for Saikia and Upper Majuli as they were able to defeat the Monomoy tea estate team in two straight sets. “The format is a bit challenging as four players have to cover the court instead of six, but we are enjoying the league. I have been playing volleyball for two years and want to take up the game professionally,” said 15-year-old captain of Upper Majuli, Lakhiram Das, a student of class 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-s-silent-revolution-to-revive-volleyball/story-ItC2OInba90KqcFe2wDIjM.html

A health ministry spokesman said the government in Berlin was monitoring developments in Britain very closely and working at “high pressure” to evaluate the new information and data regarding the new strain.Germany was in touch with its European partners, the spokesman said. Belgium similarly announced a ban on all flights and trains from the UK. The Dutch ban, from 6:00 am (0500 GMT) on Sunday until January 1, came hours after Britain announced a stay at home order for part of the country to slow the new variant, which British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said was “out of control”. In Germany, however, the new strain of the virus has not been detected so far, according to the chief virologist at Berlin’s Charite hospital, Christian Drosten, on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/germany-mulls-banning-flights-from-uk-over-new-covid-19-strain-fears/story-iUv6W3MyawAr82vWWnt5QO.html

This roadshow is a reflection of people’s anger against the Mamata Banerjee government. This crowd reflects people’s faith in the agenda of development of Narendra Modi Ji,” Shah told the massive gathering at the roadshow.He said the yearning was not about changing a political leader but “getting rid of corruption, political violence, extortion and Bangladeshi infiltration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-of-bengal-yearning-for-change-want-to-get-rid-of-bangladeshi-infiltration-amit-shah/story-ZvM6WP4nwgrqA3Aj2h4gIL.html

Party’s state in-charge Devendra Yadav is also going to reach Dehradun on the same day to lead members of the Youth Congress to gherao the assembly on the issue of unemployment. The Opposition has been demanding that the session be extended. This time chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat would be unable to attend the session in person due to the Covid-19 infection and is likely to attend it virtually. Pritam Singh, state Congress president, who is also the MLA from Chakrata said there are many important issues that the Congress will raise in the winter session. “The main issues are unemployment, corruption, issue of farmers especially in the context of the farm bills, the Covid-19 situation in the state, economic distress and so on. The fact is that a three-day time period is quite short to discuss all the important issues,” he said. Singh said the last assembly session in autumn was also limited to one day without any question hour. “This time we have demanded that the session be extended so that all the issues could be discussed in a proper way,” he said. Leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh who held a virtual meeting of all the 11 Opposition MLAs of Congress party a few days back, said, the party has decided to raise the issue of farm laws effectively in the upcoming winter session apart from taking up issues of corruption and unemployment in the state. “We will also press for the demand that the session be extended so that all important issues related to the public can be raised. The state government has failed on so many fronts leaving the people to suffer,” Hridayesh said. BJP meanwhile said it is the habit of the Congress to create a ruckus during the assembly session as it is frustrated and doesn’t know what to do. State BJP president Bansidhar Bhagat said on one side Congress wants the assembly session to be extended and on the other, it will create pandemonium in the House and not allow the session to function smoothly. “Congress has run out of issues. It is now misleading people, like in the case of farm bills, to remain relevant in politics. They can’t digest what the BJP government has achieved,” he said This time MLAs would also have to mandatorily carry Covid-19 negative test report with them to attend the assembly session. For the last three days, Covid-19 test of legislators is being carried out. Before entering the assembly, their negative report and that of their attending staff members will be checked apart from the routine thermal screening. The sitting arrangements inside the House have also been changed to ensure social distancing. During the three-day session, the government will also present the state’s supplementary budget of Rs 4,096 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-assembly-likely-to-host-stormy-winter-session-as-cong-gears-up-to-corner-govt/story-IlmMfGgcl7LvxN9UjClQ7N.html
20-12-2020||India||Bengal’s next CM won’t be an ‘outsider’, says Amit Shah||Launching a blistering attack on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said the way TMC workers attacked BJP national president JP Nadda during his Bengal tour proves the law and order situation of the state. “The BJP condemns it and I condemn it too personally. BJP believes that in a democracy everyone should have the right to voice their views. And it is the responsibility of the ruling party to ensure that every political party can have their voice. The attack on BJP chief is not only an attack on him. It is an attack on democracy in West Bengal and Trinamool Congress is completely responsible for this,” Shah said. ‘Never seen a roadshow like this, people of Bengal want change’: Amit ShahRevealing that BJP’s CM candidate in West Bengal for Assembly election 2021 will be someone from Bengal, not ‘outsider’ like what Mamata Banerjee generally terms BJP’s central leaders when they visit the state, Amit Shah said, “Does she want a country where people from one state will not visit another? Did she call Indira Gandhi, Pranab Mukherjee, Narasimha Rao outsiders when they used to come to West Bengal? But don’t worry, no one from Delhi will come to defeat you. Someone from Bengal will challenge you and be the next CM of the state.” With several former Trinamool leaders like Mukul Roy, Suvendu Adhikari in its fold now, BJP’s CM face in Bengal will be worth waiting for as Amit Shah didn’t divulge any more details. In fact, he dismissed any link between his comment of ‘bhumiputra will challenge Mamata’ with Suvendu Adhikari — on being asked.After JP Nadda’s convoy was attacked early this month when he was on a tour in the state, a bitter Centre versus West Bengal ensued. While Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the attack was staged as national leaders of BJP come with their separate security cover, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar in his report condemned the law and order situation of Bengal. The ministry of home affairs summoned West Bengal government’s top officials, including the chief secretary, but the state government decided not to respond and termed the Centre’s interference as damaging to the federal structure. Finally, on Friday, a video conference was arranged between Union home secretary and West Bengal government officials, ahead of Amit Shah’s Bengal visit.“We haven’t done anything in Bengal that is against the federal structure,” Shah said on Sunday.Commenting on TMC’s support to the ongoing farmers’ protest, Amit Shah said, “West Bengal is not giving Rs 6,000 to its farmers. Mamata di is not releasing those funds but is supporting the farmers’ protests. First, release that money. Give those money on the occasion of your nephew’s birthday only. 23 lakh farmers from Bengal have requested online for PM-KISAN Samman Nidhi. Mamata di still prevents them by not giving them actual certification! She is not even sending a list of farmers to the Centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-she-call-indira-gandhi-pranab-mukherjee-outsiders-amit-shah-asks-mamata/story-M0NX8LGMxPZK9VDgHP3aCO.html

Stalin set the benchmark while addressing senior leaders and thousands of party functionaries in the DMK headquarters in Chennai on Sunday. “We are not fighting only to win 117 seats—the half-way mark in the 234 Assembly-- but we must aim for 200 seats and more. We shouldn’t have one seat below that number. We shouldn’t even lose an inch,” Stalin said. The DMK has been out of power for ten years in the state.The DMK on Sunday also launched another campaign titled, “We reject ADMK”, for which 1,600 party leaders will conduct 16,000 gram sabha meetings from December 23 to January 10 with the message that ‘AIADMK is lacking in governance’ in several sectors such as education and agriculture.The ruling party was founded as Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK) and was later renamed All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).The leaders will quote from a document which the DMK calls a ‘charge-sheet’ against the government, which includes issues such as student suicides related to the National-Entrance-cum-Eligibility Test and the police firing on anti-Sterlite protestors in Thoothukudi in 2018. A website has been launched for people to mark their ‘rejection’ of the AIADMK government. Poll strategizing firm, Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC), which the DMK has roped in for the elections said that the site has crossed fifty-thousand rejections by Sunday 4pm.DMK leaders including Udhayanidhi Stalin and Kanimozhi are already on the ground on a 75-day campaign to highlight 10 years of alleged ‘AIADMK misrule’.

20-12-2020||India||Centre asks states to set up special courts for infra project litigations||The Law Ministry has asked states to set up special courts to settle disputes related to infrastructure project contracts under a law which was amended twpo years ago, saying it is very important in improving the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ ranking of both India and states.Citing the examples of the high courts of Allahabad, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh, it has suggested other high courts to allocate a special day to make already functioning designated special courts for dealing with infrastructure project litigation as dedicated courts. Section 20 B of the Specific Relief (Amendment) Act, 2018, provides for designated courts. But the Law Ministry wants a designated court to function as a dedicated court on special days. In a letter to the registrars general of all high courts last week, the secretary (Justice) in the Law Ministry said that the Karnataka, Allahabad and Madhya Pradesh high courts have set up Designated Special Courts instead of Dedicated Special Courts under the Specific Relief Act. The high courts have dedicated special days every week to enable exclusive handling of Specific Relief matters pertaining to infrastructure project contracts. “This arrangement could be considered for adoption in your high court as an alternative measure until Dedicated Special Courts are set up. This could be helpful in the enforceability of contract both from the perspective of time and cost, thereby stimulating investors’ confidence and creating conducive business climate,” the letter said.In October, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had written to all chief ministers pressing for special courts under the Specific Relief (Amendment) Act, 2018.He had pointed out that a new section 20A has been included in the Act for infrastructure project contracts which provides that the court shall not grant injunction in any suit where it appears to it that granting injunction would cause hindrance or delay in the continuance or completion of the infrastructure project.“The foreign investors are of the view that presence of special courts will ensure enforceability of contracts both from the perspective of time and cost and provide the much-needed impetus for creating an investor friendly ecosystem. Therefore, establishment of special courts will circumvent unnecessary hindrance or delay in the continuance or completion of the infrastructure projects,” Prasad wrote.This, the minister said, is very important in improving the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ ranking of both India as also states.According to Section 20B of the amended law, the state government, in consultation with the chief justice of the high court, will designate one or more civil courts as special designated courts, within the local limits of the area to exercise jurisdiction and to try a suit under the Specific Relief (Amendment) Act in respect of contracts relating to infrastructure projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-states-to-set-up-special-courts-for-infra-project-litigations/story-Njzlns93PvYOMNdKVJQk2M.html

Narayanasamy noted that more than 30 farmers have died during the ongoing protests.Slogans condemning the legislation were raised by all those present, including Congress workers, at the venue against the farm laws.Meanwhile, criticising the Chief Minister for tearing up the copies of the Farm Reforms Acts at the fast organised by the Congress here recently, The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader A Anbalagan said Narayanasamy was known for playing double game.“It is Narayanasamy and Congress who welcomed the GST, the DBT and other schemes of the Centre and later he opposed these central measures,” Anbalagan said adding people could not be hoodwinked by such ‘doublespeak’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puducherry-cm-pays-homage-to-farmers-who-died-protesting-new-farm-laws/story-pneL2EdUDVOE9DxuqwZhkL.html
20-12-2020||India||Class 10 student drugged by sister, forced into prostitution: Police||A 15-year-old girl in Madhya Pradesh has been drugged and pushed into sex trade by her elder sister in the state capital Bhopal, police said. Police arrested seven people, including the girl’s 20-year-old sister, a man and his two sons on Sunday under section 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO), officials said. Mukesh Shrivastava, Bhopal superintendent of police (North), said, “Upset with violent behaviour and drug addiction of the girl, who is a class 10 student, the mother informed the Childline and sent her to a shelter home in Bhopal in November, where she was counselled for a month.” Srivastava added: “The victim shared her ordeal recently and told the counsellors that her sister pushed her into drugs and sex trade. The mother lodged a complaint at Gandhi Nagar police station with help of Childline on Saturday.” In her statement registered with the police, the minor said she was raped for the first time two years ago when she was just 13 years old, the SP said. Her sister, who works in a company in Indore, took her to an unknown place in Bhopal and gave her some cannabis. “Later, the sister left her alone with a man who raped her. The man also gave Rs 2000 to her sister. The victim’s sister took her to several places, where people raped her and gave her money,” he said.When her cousin came to know about this, he raped the girl too, said the officer. The mother said she was noticing a major change in the behaviour of the girl, but she was not ready to share anything. “I asked her several times about change in the behaviour, but she used to change the topic every time. She used to go missing from the house many times. Last month, I came to know about her drug addiction. I contacted Childline and sent her to a shelter for counselling and de-addiction. During counselling, she broke down and shared her ordeal,” said the mother in a statement registered with police. The girl is still being counselled by the members of Childline. The minor’s father lives in Mumbai and she lives with her mother in Bhopal. Police are interrogating the accused to know more about the nexus as all the accused were found related to each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/class-10-student-drugged-by-sister-pushed-into-prostitution/story-cURH4CJv6eSOIJ86GDRdbM.html
20-12-2020||India||Govt exploring options of linking hospitals with foreign insurance firms to boost medical tourism: Patel||The government is planning to form a working group to explore the possibilities of linking Indian hospitals, wellness centres and Ayurveda clinics with foreign insurance firms to boost medical tourism in the country, Tourism Minister Prahlad Patel has said.He said the aim is to ensure that foreign nationals seeking medical treatment in India can arrive here with their own insurance which would be recognised by all health centres here.“We will form a working group to explore the possibilities to enrol foreign insurance firms with Indian health centres so that people can use these for treatment here. So, when they arrive, they have their insurance in place. This will be especially helpful for those arriving from Iraq or Southeast Asian countries,” the minister told PTI in an interview. Officials also said the ministry has recommended that foreign tourists visiting India may be offered attractively priced Covid-19 insurance covers as part of the ministry’s plans to revive the sector post the coronavirus crisis.“The working group will provide us a model on which our system can be based. We are also in discussions with domestic insurance companies as well as the departments concerned here,” Patel said.Officials said the ministry is studying insurance policies introduced by Singapore and other countries.According to a report published by the Allied Market Research, the global medical tourism market accounted for $104.68 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $273.72 billion by 2027, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 12.8 per cent from 2020 to 2027.While the sector is growing rapidly, say officials, limited medical coverage, lengthy or partial reimbursement by payers and visa approval issues hamper its growth.“We have said that we should also have an authentic list of all our wellness centres and Ayush Hospitals so that we can properly publicise them. This will also help in foreign tourists to know how many such centres we have and make a choice, “We are also working towards granting visas to foreign tourists based on recommendations from these centres and hospitals,” Patel said. More than 130 countries around the world are competing for a pie of this global business. The popular medical tourism destinations include India, Brunei, Cuba, Columbia, Hong Kong, Hungry, Jordan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand and the USA among others. It encompasses primarily and predominantly biomedical procedures, combined with travel and tourism.In India, the total number of inward medical tourists doubled in a span of just three years. In 2017, around 22 per cent arrivals from West Asia was for medical purposes, followed by 15.7 per cent from Africa, according to the Indian Tourism Statistics, 2018 report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-exploring-options-of-linking-hospitals-with-foreign-insurance-firms-to-boost-medical-tourism-patel/story-yEt3uxKKLIDfYb12gO48yM.html

I am ready to give credit to the opposition for the project... this is not an ego issue for me, as being described,” Thackeray said during a live web cast.“We have all documents to prove that the land belongs to the state government. If there is a controversy over the ownership of land, the issue can be resolved through dialogue,” Thackeray added.The Bombay high court had on Wednesday stayed the order passed by Mumbai suburban district collector allotting 102 acres of saltpan land in Kanjurmarg area for the construction of an integrated metro car shed. The court said that the manner in which the land was transferred to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) “bordered on committing fraud on power”.The bench restrained the MMRDA from carrying out any further work at the site. In the order, the high court stated that the decision-making process leading to the October 1 order did not pass the test of judicial scrutiny.The previous BJP-led state government had decided to construct the car shed for Metro line 3 (Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ) at Aarey Colony, despite opposition from environmentalists and activists to the vast tree-cutting for the project.The present Maharashtra Viks Aghadi (MVA) government - comprising the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress - recently took a decision to shift the car shed from the Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-give-bjp-credit-not-an-ego-issue-for-me-uddhav-thackeray-on-kanjurmarg-metro-car-shed/story-FD9bqrp9kwGTwzaBYa1QwM.html
20-12-2020||India||Farmers rally to pay tribute to protesters who died during farm laws agitation||Farmers on Sunday observed a Shahidi Diwas to pay homage to those who have lost their lives in the agitation against the farm laws. Farmers agitating at the Burari ground joined in to pay homage as they took out a procession in Delhi. “Farmers across the country are paying homage to those martyrs who died during this movement,” news agency ANI quoted a farmer as saying.The protests entered 25th day on Sunday as the impasse between the government and agitating farmers continues. The farmers are protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.In Jharkhand too, various farmer groups carried out a march in the state capital. “We support the protest,” a farmer told news agency ANI. “We’ve come to pay tribute to 18 farmers who died during the agitation in Delhi,” he further said.The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a Assocham event, during which he reiterated that the laws are made for farmers’ benefit only and not otherwise as the opposition is trying to project. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar met agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and said a fresh round of talks may happen soon.Meanwhile, All India Kian Sangharsh Coordination committee which is agitating at Ghazipur border said they will block both sides of the road if their negotiation with the local administration over the movement of tractors is not fruitful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-rally-to-pay-tribute-to-protesters-who-died-during-farm-laws-agitation/story-2tLXxzBJWZogUZcdXQPm3M.html
20-12-2020||India||Defence, energy, development in focus in key India-Vietnam summit on Monday||India and Vietnam are expected to sign agreements in defence, energy and development projects and take forward an arrangement to supply high-speed patrol vessels to the Southeast Asian nation during a virtual summit on Monday. The virtual meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Vietnamese counterpart, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, will cap a string of high-level exchanges between the two sides this year.The meeting is being held at a time when countries are grappling with China’s aggressive actions in the region. India is locked in a military standoff with China in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) while Vietnam has major differences over Chinese claims within its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. The two leaders will discuss bilateral, regional and global issues and are expected to issue a “joint vision” to guide the development of the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. “A number of agreements and announcements are likely, covering areas such as defence, energy, development partnership and healthcare,” one of the people cited above said.The implementation of India’s $100-million defence line of credit for 12 high speed patrol boats for Vietnam will be further progressed, and new opportunities in renewable energy cooperation will be explored, the person said.The patrol boats being built for the Vietnam Border Guard are meant to enhance coastal security and prevent illegal activities. Five vessels are being built at Larsen & Toubro’s shipyard in Chennai, and the rest will be made at Hong Ha shipyard in the Vietnamese port city of Hai Phong under the Indian firm’s supervision.India has offered another defence line of credit of $500 million to Vietnam. The two countries upgraded their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership four years ago. India is one of the few countries with which Vietnam has such a partnership.There were several high-level visits from the Vietnamese side despite the Covid-19 pandemic and the country’s vice president travelled to India in February. The two prime ministers met online during the Asean-India Summit last month.The bilateral summit on Monday is also expected to focus on India’s development and capacity building assistance through initiatives such as the quick impact projects, Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) initiatives, projects in water resource management in Vietnam’s Mekong delta, digital connectivity and heritage conservation. The two sides will exchange views on the global pandemic and their respective strategies to deal with Covid-19 and post-pandemic economic recovery. “The existing economic and trade linkages between the two sides provide a useful platform to explore new and resilient supply chains,” the person cited above said.Both countries also have stakes in the Indo-Pacific region and significant maritime interests, and the summit will enable them to look at potential cooperation on India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and Asean’s Indo-Pacific outlook.India and Vietnam will also concurrently serve as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council from 2021, and this opens up new opportunities for cooperation and coordination on regional and international issues, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-energy-development-in-focus-in-key-india-vietnam-summit-on-monday/story-QkI1qDoh1DwAywG2SMf4IJ.html

20-12-2020||India||‘Vendetta’: Mufti, Lone condemn ED action against Abdullah in JKCA case||Leaders of several political parties have accused the Centre of using central agencies against the Kashmiri leadership and termed attachment of properties of National Conference president Farooq Abdullah as “vendetta” .The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday attached residential and commercial properties worth nearly Rs 12 crore of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and Lok Sabha member Abdullah in a case of alleged money laundering.People’s Democratic Party (PDP) president and former J&K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti termed the move a political vendetta. “Attaching Dr Farooq sahab’s properties is sheer political vendetta as was evident from the abuses heaped on PAGD (People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration) by BJP. People of J&K were least impressed & placed their faith in the alliance. Using agencies like NIA & ED to settle scores shows BJPs frustration,” tweeted Mufti, reacting to the attachment of Abdullah’s property worth Rs 11.86 crores in different places by the ED.She was referring to the tie-up between Abdullah’s NC, its rival-turned-ally PDP, and four other parties with an aim to demand the restoration of the erstwhile state’s special status nullified by the Centre in a controversial move last year. The other parties in the grouping are the Peoples Conference (PC), the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), the Peoples Movement (PM), and the Awami National Conference (ANC).According to the ED, between 2005 and 2006 to December 2011, Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association received funding totalling ₹109.78 crore from the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India). “Dr Farooq Abdullah, between 2006 and January 2012 (when he was president of JKCA), misused his position and clout by illegal appointments of office bearer at JKCA to whom he gave financial powers for the purpose of laundering of JKCA funds,” an ED statement said. CPI(M) general secretary Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami said the BJP government must realise the dangers of “witch-hunting and intimidation, and desist from vindictive designs”. “ It is time for secular democratic forces across the country to raise their voice against such designs of the BJP government,” he said.The PC chairman and spokesman of the PAGD, Sajjad Lone, termed the action against Abdullah “coercive”. “The ED action against Dr Farooq Sahib seems unambiguously coercive. The timing is conspicuous. Government should understand that in the context of the hard policy that they r pursuing the dividing line between law of the land and vendetta has vanished,” he said.The Jammu and Kashmir BJP has denied any political vendetta behind the action targeted at Abdullah in the JKCA case.However, Srinagar mayor and Apni Party leader Junaid Azim Mattu hit out at Mufti for defending Abdullah in J&K Cricket Association scam.“I absolutely fail to understand how @MehboobaMufti of all the people can term any investigate action into the alleged JKCA scam as “political vendetta”. For YEARS she, her party and the other PAGD allies have been demanding EXACTLY THIS - both openly and behind closed doors!,” tweeted Mattu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vendetta-mufti-lone-condemn-ed-action-against-abdullah-in-jkca-case/story-2vqAuPn4WPM6LQnDaFIKRI.html

Residents of J&K have successfully negated the designs of separatists & terrorists and made these elections highly successful. J&K Residents have participated massively in the event like a festival.

We also congratulate every agency, security agencies, paramilitary forces, Indian army, JKP and all others without whose contribution these elections could have not been such a great success. The government employees who served tirelessly in this election are also to be thanked,” Raina said.Raina also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the elections of DDC, BDC and for Sarpanchs & Panchs, held earlier, and said that the whole Panchayati Raj system is now implemented in J&K, made possible with the abrogation of Article 370.“For 70 years, J&K was kept at a loss under the blanket of article 370 and was not granted due rights. Now, the residents of Jammu & Kashmir are thankful from the core of their heart to PM Modi, on whose directions, and due to his personal interest, this whole process could be finished,” he said.Raina said that every single district of Jammu & Kashmir witnessed massive participation in the election process demonstrating restoration of people’s faith in the democratic process.Raina’s comments come in the backdrop of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accusing the BJP of rigging the DDC polls and claiming that PDP and National Conference (NC) leaders were not allowed to campaign under the pretext of security concerns.Also Read: ED move against Abdullah in JKCA case under law, says ex-deputy CM GuptaJ&K lieutenant governor, Manoj Sinha, too, has congratulated the voters and the election machinery for the successful conduct of first-ever DDC elections in the Union Territory.Strengthening the three tiers of Panchayati Raj System in J&K, the DDC elections were held for the first time in the UT and the response to the DDC Elections has been very encouraging, he said while addressing media persons here on Sunday.The polling stations across the UT witnessed long queues of enthusiastic voters, with the voter turnout percentage, even in the traditionally low percentage areas, registering manifold increase as compared to earlier held Parliamentary and Panchayat elections, he said.

20-12-2020||India||Uttarakhand woman killed by leopard, second such incident this week||A 45-year-old woman was killed in a leopard attack late on Saturday night, making it the second such incident in the past one week from the district. The incident happened in Pukhrora village of the district when Lila Devi, the 45-year-old woman was killed by the leopard when she had gone to feed cattle in the cowshed near her home. Naveen Kapri, the revenue sub-inspector who reached the spot after learning about the incident said, “Lila Devi was suddenly attacked and dragged to the bushes by the leopard. On hearing her scream, villagers came to save her but the leopard had already attacked and escaped from the area.” In a similar incident, a woman from Kholigaon village in the same area was killed by the leopard on Friday. Naveen Pant, sub-divisional forest officer of Pithoragarh forest division said, “As both the villages fall in the same locality, it could be possible that the same leopard has killed both the women.” On Friday, Saruli Devi (68) was killed by a leopard in the district. Two other women were also injured in the attack. The deaths have caused resentment among the people in the district. This is not the first such attack to be reported from the state, where human-leopard conflict has been increasing. On December 1, a 65-year-old man was killed in a leopard attack in Chamoli district when he was going to the market. In the first week of November a 21-year-old woman was killed in a leopard attack in Champawat district. Three women including a teenager lost their lives in a week in October in Okhalkanda block of Nainital. On October 21, a 13-year-old girl was killed in a leopard attack in Nainital district when she was going to the forest to cut grass.

20-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protests more political in nature, says Union minister VK Singh||Union Minister VK Singh on Sunday said the on going protests by farmers against the three Central farm laws was “more political” in nature and underlined the NDA government’s intent to ensure the welfare of the ryots.Speaking to reporters here ahead of his interaction with farmers, the Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways claimed that “actual farmers are very happy with what has been done in last six months.” He sought to allay fears on Minimum Support Price (MSP) and other issues, saying MSP will carry on while contract farming will only benefit the farmers.ALSO WATCH | ‘Those who take commission...’: Union minister VK Singh slams farmer protest  “Lot of misconceptions are being given where farmer issue is concerned. Farmers all over India mostly are happy, actual farmers are very happy with what has been done in last six months,” he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ensured the benefit goes to the farmers, Singh said, adding, “the present agitation actually is more political than about farmers.” Farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting for the last 25 days outside Delhi against the recently enacted three farm laws, with five rounds of talks with government so far failing to break the deadlock. Singh further said that other political parties, whether Congress, AAP or the NCP led by Sharad Pawar, all of them wanted that farmers should have the freedom from the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) and “they didnt want them tied up to these mandis.” He said Modi has the “highest regard” for the farm sector and assured the government was with the farmer and pointed out at the various schemes including insurance and soil card to benefit them. “The government wants the farmer, who feeds the nation, to feel protected, to get the benefit of the government’s protection so that his income can be doubled,” he said. “...the farmer must understand that there are people who are misleading them and that is why I have come here to explain to our farmers that things are good, not as being given out by people,” he said. The legislations in question aim at protecting the farmer and one of them says the farmer is free to sell his produce anywhere he wants with “India being one market” for him, Singh said. “This is beneficial to the farmer since he can get better price.. what happens in the mandi is price is decided by the middlemen, the commission agents,” he said. The farmer has now been “freed from this,” but some were insisting “we want the mandis.” “Mandis are going go stay. No problem in that. A voice is raised on Minimum Support Price. The bill (Act) says minimum support price will stay,” Singh added. “So this misconception that has been created in the minds of our farmers friends needs to be taken away,” he said. On contract farming, he said the government has ensured the farmer gets the benefit irrespective of the price fluctuation and is especially in a position of advantage when the prices go up. “Land is free from this contract and is provided protection...the farmer is provided protection from any exploitation by a contractor,” the minister said. Singh later tweeted he attended a Kissan Sammelan Programme here. “Having interacted with people here, one can feel that farmers are excited about the #FarmBills2020 brought by the @narendramodi government and feel that these historic reforms were long due. #GenerallySaying,” he said in the tweet. He further tweeted some political parties,”to hide their historic incompetence,” were adamant on misleading farmers about bills which will bring welfare and prosperity to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protests-more-political-in-nature-says-union-minister-vk-singh/story-cINs8lEMFdXJ6tuVfSfiiI.html

He had a discussion with officials about the project while Kendrapara district collector Samarth Verma apprised the delegation about the importance of the identified site.The Ministry of Port, Shipping, and Waterways has already agreed to the Odisha government’s proposal for the riverine port to be developed by Paradip Port Trust at an investment of Rs 4,000 crore. The project is estimated to generate employment for 6,000 people.The proposed port will come up at Akhadasali village under Mahakalapada block in Kendrapara district, 13 km from the river mouth at Paradip.This all-weather and multi-user port on river Mahanadi will be set up in public-private-partnership (PPP) mode with a capacity of 54 MTPA at an investment of Rs 4,000 crore. In the first phase, the port will have the capacity to handle 22 MTPA cargo at an investment of Rs 2,562 core, an official said.While the Paradip Port Trust will develop supporting project infrastructures like rail and road connectivity and dredging requirements of the facility, the state government has already identified 300 hectares of land for the project.The state government will also provide the necessary support to PPT in respect of any additional land required for the project, the official said, adding that Odisha in 2018 had decided to go ahead with Mahanadi Riverine Port.However, the project couldn’t progress due to lack of interest by potential bidders. Paradip Port Trust then evinced interest in the project and consequently, the MoU is proposed to be signed with the state government.On commissioning of the project, the port will provide direct and indirect employment opportunities to more than 4,000 persons in the first phase and about another 1,700 in the 2nd phase.The riverine port, along with the state-aided Haridaspur Paradip Railway line, will go a long way in boosting the economy of the Kendrapara district, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-gears-up-to-set-up-rs-4-000-crore-mahanadi-riverine-port-project/story-plHkm9cw748h9WhqCznrpM.html

He said residents should follow Covid appropriate behaviour in order to avoid imposition of restrictions like the night curfew and lockdown and urged them to learn from the United Kingdom and European countries where lockdown has been re-imposed to contain the pandemic.“Recently, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said that the people will have to wear masks even after taking a shot of Covid-19 vaccine. In my view wearing a mask is necessary for six months at least. Use masks at public places for sake of your family and for the society at large. Masks can protect us from the pandemic. We will have to be vigilant while welcoming the New Year,” Thackeray said in his live address to people of the state.He said that he doesn’t believe in imposing lockdown or night curfew as suggested by the experts. “I have got suggestions from experts for imposing night curfew or lockdown ahead of the New Year but I don’t feel it is required. We have learnt what to do and what will happen if certain things are not followed from the past, though danger is yet to pass,” the chief minister said.Also Read: Covid-19 caseload highest in these 5 Indian states He also took potshots at the central government for allegedly “obstructing” the shifting of Metro-3 car shed from Aarey Colony at Goregaon to Kanjurmarg.He said it would be improper if both the Centre and the state started stopping each other’s projects. “Why are you doing this?,” he questioned, while referring to a petition filed by the Centre before the Bombay high court claiming ownership of the Kanjurmarg plot. Thackeray urged the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party to resolve the impasse claiming his government’s decision was in the interest of the people and not to satisfy his own ego.He stated that the State government decided to choose Kanjurmarg plot to build a larger car shed with two additional lines. “The size of the plot at Kanjurmarg is 40 hectares whereas at Aarey, we were getting only 25 hectares, and to expand the project we will require more land after 25-50 years. Also, at Kanjurmarg, we can construct car sheds for three lines such as — Metro-3, 4 and 6. Now you tell me if the decision of shifting the car shed to Kanjurmarg is to satisfy my ego or is it in the interest of the people,” he asked.Thackeray said the salt commissioner, who works under the Central government, filed a petition in the high court claiming the ownership of the Kanjurmarg plot.“Why are you doing this? The issue could have been resolved by sitting together. The plot is not either my personal property or yours. It is a property of the people and it would have been better if we could use it for them,” he said.“It would be improper if we both start obstructing projects taken up by each other. I urge the opposition (BJP) to initiate and resolve. I am ready to give you the credit. I am not doing this for my ego,” Thackeray said.Also Read: BKC plot rejected twice in past for Mumbai Metro-3 car depotThe state government and the central governments are at loggerheads over shifting of the car shed for Metro-3 line to Kanjurmarg. The state government, in October, decided to scrap the Metro car shed at Aarey Milk Colony and shift it to Kanjurmarg. It has also decided to integrate Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) and Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli) line.In response to Thackeray’s appeal, state BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that the chief minister is still misleading the people. “CM Thackeray is not revealing the concerns raised by the committee headed by Manoj Saunik, additional chief secretary, finance department, over shifting of Metro-3 car shed from Aarey Colony. Where is the techno-economic feasibility study of Kanjurmarg plot. How can the issue be resolved when the chief minister is not telling people the truth. He (Uddhav Thackeray) has made it an ego issue and that is reason he chose to shift the car shed to Kanjurmarg,” Upadhye said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-cm-tells-people-what-to-do-to-avoid-lockdown-night-curfew/story-wzLs7TJRUlqKOXkM1UVlZM.html
20-12-2020||India||Bengal village plays host to Amit Shah with live baul performance, local cuisine||Amidst a tight schedule on the second day of his two-day tour in poll-bound West Bengal, Union home minister Amit Shah had his Sunday lunch with a baul family in a remote Bengal village in Birbhum district. A live performance was also organized by the family. Bauls are the mystic minstrels who live in rural Bangladesh and West Bengal. Before having lunch, Shah offered puja in a temple inside the house. In the menu arranged by Basudeb Das and his family, there was roti, rice (cooked from the local variety of paddy) with moong daal, fried potato, brinjal and pointed gourd, palang saag curry, potato cooked with poppy seeds, chutney, payesh, papad and rasgulla dipped in jaggery. Earlier in the day, Shah first visited Visva Bharati, set up by Rabindranath Tagore. After spending around one hour and 40 minutes, he headed for his lunch although he was running behind schedule. “By having a simple lunch with the family of a poor villager while listening to baul songs Shah wanted to send out a message that he is very much linked to the soil of Bengal. He also wanted to send out a message that TMC’s atrocities would come to an end when BJP comes to power,” Anupam Hazra, BJP’s national secretary said. Shah was served lunch on earthen dishes and bowls and water in an earthen glass in the courtyard of the house. Neighbours chipped in to help the eight-member family to prepare the lunch since morning amidst tight security. The live performance organized by the baul artists included a folk song called Tomay Hrid Majhare Rakhbo Chere Debo Na, which simply means “I shall keep you in my heart and I shall never leave you”. Top BJP leaders including state president Dilip Ghosh, national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, national vice president Mukul Roy, also had lunch with him sitting on the floor. In the village even a 11-year-old girl could be seen playing an ektara (musical instrument) and singing folk songs, all set to welcome the Union home minister. She wanted to take a selfie with Shah and sing in front of him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-village-plays-host-to-amit-shah-with-live-baul-performance-local-cuisine/story-SiYnp3jtTYxXpZjo0j06xJ.html
20-12-2020||India||Cultural performances greet Amit Shah at Tagore’s Visva Bharati; TMC ups ante||Union home minister Amit’s Shah’s visit to Visva Bharati, West Bengal’s only central university that was set up by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, was marked by song and dance performances by students on Sunday afternoon, even as the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) staged protests against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader in Kolkata. On the second and last day of his Bengal tour, Shah flew from Kolkata to Bolpur in an army chopper and headed straight for Visva Bharati. He was scheduled to attend a political roadshow there. “I am fortunate that I could visit Visva Bharati and pay homage to a great man who had spread India’s culture, philosophy, knowledge and literature around the globe. Both Mahatma Gandhi and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who represented the two main political lines of thought at that time, drew inspiration from Tagore,” Shah told reporters while leaving Visva Bharati, where he spent more than an hour. While Shah visited Visva Bharati’s music college, the famous prayer hall, the Bangladesh Bhawan and places associated with Tagore and Gandhi --- who visited the poet and stayed on campus --- teachers and students greeted the Union home minister with a bouquet of 100 red roses, portraits of Tagore and Goddess Durga, and other gifts. In Kolkata, 160km away, the TMC staged a protest at against placards with images of Shah placed above Tagore that have cropped up across the city. Claiming that the TMC has put up the placards to sabotage Shah’s visit, BJP workers removed them. TMC leaders, led by Lok Sabha member Sudip Bandopadhyay, set up a podium outside the Tagore family’s palatial home at Jorasanko in north Kolkata and staged a protest thorough speeches and Tagore’s songs. “The placards demeaned Tagore’s rich heritage,” said senior minister Subrata Mukherjee. Shah, while interacting with journalists at Visva Bharati, projected Tagore as an ambassador of the nation. “I firmly believe that it was not the Nobel prize that acknowledged Tagore’s works. The Nobel prize found its own acknowledgement by honouring Tagore....It was an honour to visit the rooms where Gurudev Rabindranath and Mahatma Gandhi had lived,” said Shah. “Through Visva Bharati, Rabindranath Tagore not only preserved the culture, languages of literature of India, he also amalgamated the same from around the world. He is the only person whose compositions became the national anthems of two countries,” Shah added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cultural-performances-greet-amit-shah-at-tagore-s-visva-bharati-tmc-ups-ante/story-XI1Mcfctkxcku07Nv83ZII.html

He asked whether she didn’t do the same thing when she had left Congress.Trinamool MP Derek O’Brien on Saturday took to Twitter to fact-check several claims made by Shah. In seven points, he dismissed some of Shah’s claim — Mamata switching parties being the first of them. #FactCheck of the speech made in Bengal by the henchman of the "tourist gang". 7 pieces of concocted, false info in one speech.

Mamata never switched sides. In 1998, she left Congress & formed a new party - TMC. She was never associated with any other party,” he said, as quoted by ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-didn-t-switch-sides-say-trinamool-leaders-a-day-after-amit-shah-s-jibe/story-h1bHxFXHgB6QgXaYYfR5UI.html

There was a long-pending demand for investigation because it was a big scam,” said Gupta. “Among the firsts who demanded a thorough investigation into the scam was Gupkar alliance partner People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Hence, the PDP should feel happy today, “ he added.He was referring to the tie-up between Abdullah’s National Conference (NC), its rival-turned-ally PDP, and four other parties to demand the restoration of the erstwhile state’s special status nullified by the Centre in a controversial move last year. The Jammu and Kashmir BJP has denied any political vendetta.Meanwhile, Abdullah’s son, Omar Abdullah, took to Twitter to object to the ED action. “My father has seen the media reports regarding attachment of his properties in the ongoing investigation into the JKCA matter. Not surprisingly the media was tipped off regarding the seizure before he had received any official notice or documentation,” he posted. The properties attached are largely ancestral, dating from the 1970s, with the most recent one built before 2003. There can be no justification for the seizures because they fail the very basic test of having been acquired as the proceeds of the “crime” being investigated. .“Dr Abdullah is in touch with his lawyers & will fight all these baseless charges in the one place that matters - a court of law, where everyone is presumed to be innocent & is entitled to a fair trial unlike in the court of the media or the court of BJP managed social media,” he added. The attached properties includes three residential houses --- one at Gupkar Road, Srinagar; one at Tehsil Katipora, Tanmarg; and one at Bhatindi, Village Sunjwan, (Jammu) --- and commercial buildings at the posh Residency Road area of Srinagar. According to the ED, between 2005 and 2006 to December 2011, JKCA received funding totalling ₹109.78 crore from the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India). “Dr Farooq Abdullah, between 2006 and January 2012 (when he was president of JKCA), misused his position and clout by illegal appointments of office bearer at JKCA to whom he gave financial powers for the purpose of laundering of JKCA funds,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-move-against-abdullah-in-jkca-case-under-law-says-ex-deputy-cm-gupta/story-MyEr45T8oFyI37otctEXKI.html

The circular dated December 18, 2020, stated that COVID-positive flight crew members who are moderately and severely symptomatic need to undergo special medical examination -- after their complete clinical recovery -- at one of the Indian Air Force boarding centres to get the “cure certificate”.“Once declared ‘fit for flying’ at the IAF boarding centre, the air crew can commence flying only after DGCA medical assessment is issued,” the circular added.The regulator said the December 18 circular supersedes the June 22 circular which mentioned that only those cabin crew members who come in direct contact with a COVID-positive person onboard a flight will be sent for mandatory 14-day home quarantine. The June 22 circular superseded a March 23 circular of the DGCA that had made it mandatory for the airlines to put the entire crew of a flight under home quarantine for 14 days in case anyone aboard was found to be COVID-positive.

As he was addressing an array of issues including Covid-19, metro car shed project, the chief minister said experts are in favour of imposing night curfew or lockdown. But he is not in favour of these restrictions as the Covid-19 situation in the state is under control, though not completely, he said. On Saturday, Maharashtra reported 3,940 new Covid-19 cases, second in the country, though in mortality it topped the chart reporting 74 deaths, followed by West Bengal, Delhi and Kerala.The Covid-19 situation in the state improved remarkably in the past few months. In November, the government issued a circular asking authorities not to be complacent by the improvement and not lower the guards on testing as a second wave of the pandemic in the state is likely to come in January-February. However, according to experts, a second surge like that of in the UK and other countries in Europe is now unlikely in India.“Prevention is better than cure. Wearing of mask at public places should be made a habit for another six months at least,” Thackeray said, reminding people of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.Addressing other issues that the one-year-old Maha Vikas Aghadi government is dealing at present, Thackeray said, “On November 28, the state government has completed one year. Many were hoping that it would fall, but the government not only completed its first year but also faced the most difficult situation, the state may have faced in the last 100 years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wearing-masks-mandatory-for-next-six-months-says-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-DoSYSKpnS9a0N4TLQC0i4O.html

Nehal had allegedly helped Nirav in diverting money to shell corporations.Here is how he scammed LLD Diamonds, according to the indictment, court filings, and statements made on the record in Manhattan court:> In March 2015, he approached LLD claiming that he was pursuing business talks with Costco Wholesale Corporation for which he needed diamonds from LLD which would potentially be bought by Costco. > Then Nehal falsely informed LLD that Cotsco agreed to purchase the diamonds following which LLD allowed him to purchase those on credit. Full payment was required within 90 days.> But Nehal mortgaged the diamonds to secure short-term loans. > In the meantime, he made some payments to LLD but the majority of the proceeds were used for personal expenses.> He also falsely claimed that he was encountering payment issues due to a “Costco fulfillment error” and made repeated promises to satisfy the balance.> In August 2015, Nehal falsely informed LLD that Costco wanted to purchase additional diamonds. This time, LLD permitted him to take the additional diamonds on consignment, with terms explicitly stating that he did not have the authority to sell the diamonds without authorisation by LLD.> LLD also required a partial payment upfront in the event of a sale, as Nehal’s outstanding balance was nearly USD 1 million at that time.> LLD finally uncovered the fraud and demanded that he immediately pay his outstanding balance or return the diamonds. However, he had already sold or pawned all of the diamonds and spent most of those proceeds, following which LLD reported the fraud to the Manhattan DA’s Office.Nehal Modi is a citizen of Belgium and knows English, Gujarati, Hindi.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-nirav-modi-s-brother-nehal-modi-allegedly-scammed-lld-diamonds/story-3awBohLlbZ6S23pVbSKUwI.html

The Prime Minister’s visit to one of the most popular gurudwaras in the national capital assumes significance as it comes amid intense protests by farmers, especially from Punjab, against three controversial farm laws enacted by his government.Modi has reached out to the protesters on a number of occasions of late, explaining the benefits of farm reforms that the legislations aim to usher in, and also assuring farmers that the existing government mechanism to support them, including minimum support price and agriculture mandis, will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-makes-surprise-visit-to-historic-delhi-gurdwara-offers-prayers/story-4UEy1hnfQlLj1Mh70nEoFJ.html

The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) on Saturday wrote to PM Modi and Tomar and said the government is wrong in assuming that the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws is being engineered by opposition parties.The letters in Hindi come a day after the Prime Minister accused opposition parties of misleading farmers over the three farm laws. “The truth is that the farmers’ agitation has forced political parties to change their views and your (PM’s) claim that political parties fuelled it (protest) is wrong.

According to the UN website, the day celebrates unity in diversity throughout the world and serves as a reminder to governments to respect their commitment to international agreements and raise public awareness. International Human Solidarity Day also reiterates the importance of solidarity in removing poverty.The day has been observed since December 2002, when the United Nations General assembly established the World Solidarity Fund. This fund was set up in February 2003 to fund the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which worked to eradicate poverty. On December 22, 2005, the UN General Assembly identified solidarity as a universal value.According to the United Nations Millennium Declaration, solidarity is one of the fundamental values that are essential for healthy ‘international relations’. Thus, after the UN General Assembly convinced that promotion of the culture of solidarity and the spirit of sharing is important to combat poverty since then December 20 was declared as International Human Solidarity Day.On this day, the UN encourages new initiatives for poverty eradication with events held all over the world to promote the importance of solidarity. These events include presentations, seminars, conferences, and roundtable discussions. Many of these events also focus on how to combat poverty. Although, this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, the celebrations will not be the same as before.The UN says that the International Human Solidarity Day is a day “to celebrate our unity in diversity; a day to remind governments to respect their commitments to international agreements; a day to raise public awareness of the importance of solidarity; a day to encourage debate on the ways to promote solidarity for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals including poverty eradication; a day of action to encourage new initiatives for poverty eradication.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-human-solidarity-day-2020-history-and-significance-of-this-day/story-n0JP9lb1OAKut35eBEa2XK.html
20-12-2020||India||New India can give reply to any type of aggression: Rajnath Singh||India has the strength for an appropriate response to any transgression or unilateral action on the borders but believes in finding a peaceful solution to any conflict, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday, while also taking a strong view of China’s actions along the de-facto border in Ladakh, where its troops are locked in a tense stand-off with Indian soldiers. Singh made the remarks while addressing a combined graduation parade at the Indian Air Force Academy at Dundigal in Telangana, a day after India and China agreed to hold another meeting of senior military commanders to take forward the disengagement and de-escalation process along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “You are all aware of the Indo-China standoff in the northern sector. China’s attitude amid a crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic reflects that country’s intention,” Singh said, speaking in Hindi after reviewing the passing-out parade. “However, we have shown that our India is no longer a weak India. This is a new India that has the strength to give an appropriate and complete reply to any type of transgression or aggression or any type of unilateral action of the borders,” he added. Several big countries, he said, had praised and supported the steps taken by India. “You will also be aware that we believe in finding a peaceful solution to any conflict through dialogue,” he said. India and China are holding talks through military and diplomatic channels, he noted. “I would like to again say on this occasion that we want peace, not conflict. But we will not tolerate any attempt to hurt the self-respect of the country. We are fully prepared to deal with any kind of situation,” he said. Following a meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on Friday, there were no signs of an immediate breakthrough but the external affairs ministry said the two sides had agreed to hold another meeting of military commanders at an early date. During his speech, Singh also criticised Pakistan for fighting a “proxy war” using terrorists even after being defeated in four conventional wars with India. Referring to last year’s air strike on Balakot within Pakistan, carried out in retaliation for a suicide bombing at Pulwama by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), he said this had shown that India is capable to targeting terrorists outside the country’s borders. “In the same way in the western sector, on the borders with Pakistan, our neighbour is always up to some nefarious activities. Even after being defeated in not one but four wars, Pakistan is fighting a proxy war through terrorism. Our army, security forces and police are fighting the challenge of terrorism with full strength,” he said. “India is taking effective action against terrorists not only within the country but on the borders and even across the borders. By taking effective action against terrorism in Balakot, the Indian Air Force showed the whole world India’s military strength and determination to fight terrorism,” he said. Singh told the cadets who passed out of the academy that the ways of fighting wars are constantly changing and they would have to be scholars and soldiers to fight the wars of the future using advanced technologies and military strategies. “The scope of these challenges too has become comprehensive. The challenges before the country are not just on the borders and on the seas, but they can come through space and cyberspace,” he said. “I believe that defence in the coming days will not be limited to defence of the seas, land and air, this will be a dynamic challenge for which we will have to prepare ourselves.” Singh added: “I advise you to learn from history, know the present and prepare for the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-india-can-give-reply-to-any-type-of-aggression-rajnath-singh/story-kWKqdb7FSYNREFEqP8bpxM.html

She also sought the implementation of certain measures for the welfare of members of Dalit and tribal communities.“...there should be legislative backing to utilize the funds allocated (for schemes for SC/STs) during the same financial year,” she said. Also Read: Sonia Gandhi holds meeting for ‘rapprochement’Reacting to the letter, NCP minister and spokesperson Nawab Malik said that the letter could be an outcome of lack of communication within the Congress. “The functioning of various programmes and schemes of the government was interrupted due to the pandemic. Besides, the tribal development department is headed by a Congress minister. The party’s leaders should have asked the concerned minister what is the reality,” he said. Maharashtra Congress president Balasaheb Thorat said Gandhi’s letter was not out of resentment, but as part of a dialogue process. “Congress’s stand has always been in favour of uplift of poor and deprived sections of the society and Gandhi’s letter was part of dialogue on how welfare measures can be taken.

20-12-2020||India||10 MLAs join BJP at Amit Shah’s Bengal rally||Seven sitting legislators of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), including prominent leader Suvendu Adhikari, and three others from the Left and the Congress on Saturday afternoon joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah at a rally in Midnapore town of West Bengal’s West Midnapore district. The assembly polls in the state are due in five months and the defections could prove to be a headache for chief minister Mamata Banerjee.“Didi (Mamata Banerjee), listen very carefully. Today, I have come to declare that when the election results are announced BJP will get more than 200 seats,” Shah said in a short but fiery speech. In the evening, Shah discussed election strategy at a closed-door meeting in Kolkata. It was attended by BJP leaders from other states as well. Among the 10 MLAs who switched sides, Adhikari is the only one who submitted his resignation to the assembly but it has not been accepted yet on technical grounds. He touched Shah’s feet while taking the BJP flag from the Union home minister.“None of those who left were leaders of significance. The TMC will win the polls without a hitch,” TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said even as posters calling Adhikari Mir Zafar (the general who betrayed Bengal’s last independent nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah at the Battle of Plassey in 1757) appeared in East Midnapore, the rebel’s home turf. Some offices set up by his followers were also ransacked. Adhikari has been provided security by central paramilitary forces. The TMC’s Burdwan East Lok Sabha MP Sunil Mandal, former minister Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, former Lok Sabha member from north Bengal’s Alipurduar, Dasrath Tirkey, and 15 civic body councillors of the TMC and other parties picked up the BJP flag along with at least 20 district-level leaders. Significantly, several members from Muslim organisations set up by the TMC also joined the BJP. “Didi, you are talking of switching sides. Didn’t you leave the Congress and form the TMC? Wasn’t it changing allegiance? Now you are accusing Suvendu Bhai of changing sides. Thousands of people are waiting to join the BJP. Just wait and watch,” said Shah. Also Read: Suvendu Adhikari writes letter to TMC workers; asks them to join hands with him“Can you see the future of millions of youths who need jobs? You can only see your nephew and want to make him the chief minister,” Shah, who earlier in the day had lunch at a farmer’s home, said, without naming Abhishek Banerjee, the chief minister’s nephew and Lok Sabha member. Adhikari too delivered a short but vitriolic speech. “You (Mamata Banerjee) will not be number one again. You will be number two. I do not recognise anyone as my mother, except the one who gave birth to me, and my country,” said Adhikari. Targeting Banerjee and the TMC for branding the BJP’s national leaders as “outsiders,” Adhikari said, “Amit Shah Ji, JP Nadda Ji and the others are being called outsiders. India is one nation. I want Bengal and India to have the same government or else Bengal will not survive. There are no jobs, no progress. We have to ensure Narendra Modi’s government in Bengal.” Targeting Abhishek Banerjee and calling him a tolabaaj (extortionist), Adhikari raised the slogan, “Tolabaaj bhaipo hatao” (oust the extortionist nephew). His elder brother Dibyendu Adhikari, the two-time Lok Sabha member from Tamluk constituency in East Midnapore, said, “Joining the BJP was Suvendu’s personal decision. I joined the TMC as I was inspired by Mamata Banerjee. I will remain a part of the party.” Their father Sisir Adhikari, three-time Lok Sabha member from Kanthi and part of the TMC since its birth in 1998, sent a similar message to the leadership although he avoided the media on Saturday. Also Read| Amit Shah does not understand the reality of West Bengal politics: TMC MPElection strategist Prashant Kishor, the owner of I-Pac, and Abhishek Banerjee have been cited by all the rebels as reasons for leaving the TMC. Kishor was roped in after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Apart from Adhikari, the other TMC MLAs who joined the BJP are Shilbhadra Dutta from Barrackpore; Banashri Maiti from the Kanthi North in East Midnapore; Sukra Munda from Nagrakata in Jalpaiguri district; Biswajit Kundu from Kalna in East Burdwan; Saikat Panja from Manteswar in East Burdwan and Dipali Biswas, CPI(M) MLA from Gazole in Malda district. Biswas won the Gazole seat for the CPI(M) in 2016 but later joined the TMC. “TMC did not let me work,” Biswas said.The lawmakers from other parties are Sudip Mukherjee, Congress MLA from Purulia district; Ashok Dinda, Communist Party of India (CPI) MLA from Tamluk; and Tapasi Mandal, CPI(M) legislator from Haldia in East Midnapore district. “The CPI(M) leaders who joined the BJP were facing internal investigation for various charges,” said CPI(M) state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra. Referring the Purulia MLA, state Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, “I had been hearing for a long time that he was planning to leave. Let us see if he can contest the Purulia seat and win it again. It is my challenge.” Dasrath Tirkey, former Revolutionary Socialist Party MLA who joined the TMC in 2014 and won the Alipurduar Lok Sabha seat, joined the BJP on Saturday. Tirkey lost the seat to the BJP’s John Barla in 2019. Among the others who joined the BJP is retired army colonel Diptangshu Chowdhury, who had quit the BJP in 2017 and joined the TMC. On Thursday, he stepped down from the posts of chairman of the South Bengal State Transport Corporation and adviser to the monitoring cell on programme implementation of government welfare services in the chief minister’s office. TMC Lok Sabha member Kalyan Banerjee said the rally was a “flop show” as people were brought from several districts to fill up the college ground. “People started to leave even before Shah began to speak,” he said at a press conference at the TMC headquarters in Kolkata. “You (Adhikari) are driven by greed. What didn’t you get in the TMC? You were a minister with three departments. You held other important portfolios. Your family is in control of two Lok Sabha constituencies and a civic body. You have no right to say that the party did not give you anything,” said Kalyan Banerjee. On Sunday, Shah will have lunch with the family of a baul singer in Birchum district, where he is also scheduled to attend a road show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-mlas-join-bjp-at-amit-shah-s-bengal-rally/story-eH4UnEWJMEWJmMgi4p2XjM.html
20-12-2020||India||Livestock infra could provide -70°C storage for Pfizer’s Covid vaccine||India’s livestock and agriculture research agencies, not the public health network, may have a solution to create storage facilities for Pfizer and BioNTech’s mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine, which requires -70°C temperature for long term storage. The vaccine has proven to be effective in preventing Covid-19 and has become the first inoculation to be approved for emergency use in several countries after large-scale testing. But it requires the lowest temperature among all vaccine options for long-term storage. A second vaccine based on the same mRNA platform, developed by Moderna, can be stored at -20°C, a requirement that India’s health infrastructure can easily meet. A senior official involved in India’s coronavirus vaccination plans said: “National Dairy Research Institute in Karnal have refrigerators that can meet Pfizer’s requirements. Similarly, Indian Agriculture Research Institute (ICAR) too has the capacity.” The NDRI, a wing of the ICAR, has two stations in Bengaluru and West Bengal’s Kalyani. “These stations too have similar facilities and can be used as potential hubs for southern India and eastern India,” added the official, asking not to be named. Also Read| 12 nations reached out to India for Covid vaccine: NITI Aayog’s VK PaulDr Ajay Dang, the public relations officer of NDRI, told HT, “We have cold storages with (capacity) up to -80°C. These storages are used for storing embryo and semen samples of animals. We have been contributing to combat the pandemic by supplying RT-PCR kits to the health ministry.” Another official said that ICAR has already collected information about its cold storage capabilities — overall, and not just specific to Pfizer — and has sent it to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). But the question of using NDRI or ICAR facilities will come only if Pfizer is able to secure emergency authorisation from Indian drug regulators. The subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation or CDSCO had asked Pfizer to present its case last week, but the vaccine maker sought more time to formally submit its papers for an emergency authorisation. HT reported on December 7 that central authorities will sit down with Pfizer to negotiate pricing and also scrutinise the US-based company’s ability to deliver orders placed by the country. The vaccine costs 5-6 times more than the candidate developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca, which is being manufactured locally in India by the Serum Institute of India (SII).ICAR has stations and centres in Indore, Kalimpong, Karnal, Pune, Pusa (Bihar), Shimla, Katrin (Himachal Pradesh) and Wellington (Tamil Nadu). It has two regional centres at Tamil Nadu’s Aduthurai and Karnataka’s Dharwad. All these centres can also be used as storage bases, the first official said. Also Read: Comparing Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine against Pfizer/BioNTech’sWithin Union health ministry’s internal resources, super coolers such as walk-in-freezers and its mini deep freezers version offer a temperature range of -15°C to -25°C. While Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine requires ultra-cold temperature for long term storage, delivering the vaccine to inoculation points is relatively easier. “The vaccine can be stored for five days at refrigerated 2-8°C conditions,” the company said in a recent statement “After storage for up to 30 days in the Pfizer thermal shipper (its own cold box), vaccination centres can transfer the vials to 2-8°C storage conditions for an additional five days, for a total of up to 35 days. Once thawed and stored under 2-8°C conditions, the vials cannot be re-frozen or stored under frozen conditions,” the company added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/livestock-infra-could-provide-70-c-storage-for-pfizer-s-covid-vaccine/story-uVtdXitThZETzNjCpOg4bK.html
20-12-2020||India||North Kerala on high alert after shigella bacterial infection claims one life||North Kerala has been put on high alert after an 11-year-old boy died and 20 suspected cases of shigella bacterial infection were reported in Kozhikode on Saturday, said district medical officer Dr Jayashree. She said the death took place two days back and later 20 people with symptoms, mild diarrhoea and fever, have been admitted in various hospitals. Most of the infected were people who came in direct contact with the deceased.State health minister K K Shailaja said the health department will conduct a health camp in the area in a couple of days and investigation is on to locate the main source of the infection. She said health experts have said the infection spreads through water and food and keeping good hygiene was primary to check the spread.Worried health authorities have super chlorinated all water bodies in the area on Friday. Last year over 40 children of the West Lower Primary School, Keezhppayyur, were hospitalised after they complained of vomiting and diarrhoea. The presence of shigella bacteria was confirmed in the stool samples of at least two of these students, who recovered later. Later the district health department traced the presence of the bacteria from the water body in the siblings’ house. According to health experts, shigellosis is an infectious disease caused by the shigella bacteria, which triggers stomach pain, diarrhoea and fever in those who are infected. Though a worldwide problem, shigella is more often seen in developing countries, especially in crowded locations such as schools, day care centres, nursing homes or regions with poor sanitation. In some cases, people infected with the shigella bacteria do not have symptoms, but are still contagious. Besides water, there is a possibility that the bacteria spreads through contaminated food, though the chances of are less in this case, said officials. The health department has directed the community medicine department to reinvestigate each case and submit a report at the earliest. Health experts said the infection is not that deadly but if it is ignored it will aggravate health condition and patient may die of dehydration and exhaustion. “It is already been diagnosed. It is not a serious threat. We have to maintain personal hygiene” said Dr C Anoop Kumar, head of the critical care unit in Baby Memorial hospital in Kozhikode. He was one among first diagnose nipah two years ago. Deadly nipah virus cases were reported in the district two years ago but it was localized and contained effectively though it claimed 17 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-kerala-on-high-alert-after-shigella-bacterial-infection-claims-one-life/story-OyLeC16ELXHPzsFQEmnwVN.html

In all, 50.98 % polling was recorded in the state in the final phase, he added. The results for all the 280 seats will be out on December 22.Sharma said that final polling percentage for all the eight phases in J&K was now recorded as 51.76%. “The highest 74.62 % poll percentage was recorded in Reasi district of Jammu and Pulwama district in Kashmir division recorded the lowest at 6.70%.”Sharma who briefed the media about the poll percentage said that Srinagar district recorded 33.76% voting.The polling process was largely peaceful barring a couple of grenade attacks on the security forces and an attack on the Apni party candidate in South Kashmir. A personal security officer (PSO) of a former PDP leader was also killed in Srinagar during the long-drawn electoral process. Even on the last day of the polling state election commissioner, KK Sharma visited Wavora in Kupwara district. The results will be a litmus test for the PAGD, the BJP and the newly launched Apni party. With the end of polling on Saturday, the focus will shift to counting of votes and the political parties in the fray will await the results of the first electoral test of strength on the ground after the scrapping of Article 370, which removed Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and turned it into a Union territory.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ran a high octane campaign for the DDC polls while the Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration or the PAGD-- an amalgam of six political parties, mainly regional-- left the campaigning duties to their grassroots workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-local-polls-see-50-turnout-in-final-phase-results-out-on-dec-22/story-ygpa8LV8hDkdAaQJXvRc5O.html
20-12-2020||India||UP Sunni Waqf Board unveils blueprint of mosque complex||The Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) on Saturday released the blueprint of the mosque and other structures of public utility that would come up on five-acre land at Dhannipur village on the outskirts of Ayodhya.The mosque would be a zero-energy structure with modern design, to be established on around 3,500 square metre area, the board said, adding that it would have a dedicated section for female namaazis (worshippers) and a capacity to accommodate around 2,000 namaazis at a time. Other than the Dhannipur mosque, the board also released the design of other structures including a super-speciality hospital, a museum, Indo-Islamic cultural and research centre and a community kitchen.“The entire Dhannipur complex, including the mosque would be of a modern design, there would be no touch of traditional domes or arches. And above all, mosque and some part of the hospital would be a zero-energy structure,” said Professor SM Akhtar, the architect of the entire Dhannipur complex while releasing the drawings at a press conference on Saturday. SM Akhtar is a Lucknow-based architect and town planner, who is also founding dean of the faculty of architecture, Jamia Milia University, Delhi. He has been hired by Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF)—the trust formed by UPSCWB to ensure construction of the Dhannipur complex —to design the mosque complex.The complex would come up on five acres of land allotted to the board following the November 2019 order of the Supreme Court in the Ram Janmabhoomi- Babri Masjid case. The court ruled in favour of the Hindu parties to the case, and ordered the creation of a trust to build a Ram temple at the site. However, it also criticised the demolition of the Babri Masjid and said the Waqf Board would be given five acres in Ayodhya to build a mosque. The ground breaking ceremony for the Ram temple happened on August 5 this year.UPSCWB, however, made it clear that since there is no concept of a ground breaking ceremony in Islam, there won’t be any such event, while laying the foundation of the mosque that is likely to be done on January 26, 2021 or August 15, 2021.“There is no concept of ground breaking ceremony for a mosque, hence there won’t be any for the mosque. Only, the board members would formally lay the foundation of the mosque. But yes, in future, we may have ground breaking ceremony for other structures of public utility, including a hospital, community kitchen and research centre for which we can invite chief minister Yogi Adityanath,” said Athar Hussain, spokesperson for IICF. The board maintained silence on the cost of the entire project, saying, “That there is no time frame or cost estimation in such kind of projects. It would be carried out as per the situation.”Noted Indian academician and food critic Pushpesh Pant, whom IICF has appointed as a consultant curator for the food archive section of the museum, was also part of the blueprint release. He said, “Nothing excites me more than the fact that a Hindu has been appointed to give shape to the museum that will be the part of the mosque complex,” said Pant, who retired as a professor of International relations from Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, and is one of India’s leading experts on international relations as well as Indian cuisine. Elaborating on the architecture of the mosque, Professor Akhtar said, “We have studied the designs of modern mosques across the world, including the one on the coast of Arabian Sea in Karnataka, after which we concluded to the point that the structure would be a modern one. Also, there is no point in restricting Islam to a certain structure or design as things must change as per the modern requirement,” said Akhtar. The architect further said the entire mosque would be solar powered and constructed using a special construction material that is known to last long, may be for 1000 years or more. Also, he said that there will be a separate space for the female namaazis and adequate green spaces.As for the hospital and other structures of public utility, he said the other structures, too, would have a modern design.“The hospital would be around 300-bedded, four floor-super-speciality hospital that would be equipped with amenities of all sorts. It is going to be a state-of-the-art hospital since there is no good hospital in Faizabad or nearby. One has to travel to Gorakhpur or to Lucknow to avail proper health facility. I am sure this hospital would meet the requirements of the locals. We have allocated 500 square metre area for the hospital. The remaining area would be for other structures,” he added.Professor Pant said the archive would be designed in a way to highlight the history not only of Lucknow but also of the entire Awadh region. Also, he said that the archive would not only be limited to food, but also feature costumes and fragrance, kisse, kahaani, embroidery, shayari (poetry) and the rarest of the rare dishes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-sunni-waqf-board-unveils-blueprint-of-mosque-complex/story-Hg5aW9P1OOucPZPZdLETzM.html
20-12-2020||India||Farooq Abdullah’s properties worth over Rs 11 crore attached in JKCA||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday attached properties of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah valued around Rs 11.86 crore in connection with its money laundering probe linked to alleged financial irregularities in the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA), officials said on Saturday. The attached properties include three residential houses -- at Gupkar Road, Srinagar; Tehsil Katipora, Tanmarg, and one at Bhatindi, Village Sunjwan (Jammu) as well as commercial buildings in the Residency Road area of Srinagar. Besides, land at four different places in J&K has also been attached, according to a statement issued by the ED. The agency said among the attached properties, the residence and land of Dr Farooq Abdullah at Gupkar Road and commercial buildings at Residency Road were on state land obtained on lease. “The other attached house at Bhatindi, Village Sunjwan had been constructed by Farooq Abdullah after grabbing the state land and forest land,” the ED said. Reacting to the development, Farooq Abdullah’s son and NC vice president Omar Abdullah said in a tweet, “The properties attached are largely ancestral dating from the 1970s with the most recent one built before 2003. There can be no justification for the seizures because they fail the very basic test of having been acquired as the proceeds of the ‘crime’ being investigated.”“Dr Abdullah is in touch with his lawyers & will fight all these baseless charges in the one place that matters -- a court of law, where everyone is presumed to be innocent & is entitled to a fair trial unlike in the court of the media or the court of BJP managed social media,” Omar said in another tweet. Also Read| Attachment of Farooq Abdullah’s properties by ED ‘political vendetta’: National ConferenceFarooq Abdullah was questioned by the ED in July and October this year.The ED statement further said that between 2005 and 2006 to December 2011, JKCA received funding totalling Rs 109.78 crore from the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India ).“Dr Farooq Abdullah, between 2006 and January 2012 (when he was president of JKCA), misused his position and clout by illegal appointments of office bearer at JKCA to whom he gave financial powers for the purpose of laundering of JKCA funds,” the ED statement said. “Despite existing regular bank account of JKCA, six new bank accounts were opened for parking of JKCA funds and siphoning of the same. One dormant bank account in the name of Kashmir Wing of JKCA was also made operational for the same purpose,” the agency said. The ED has claimed that a total of Rs 45 crore was siphoned off, which includes cash withdrawals of Rs 25 crore “with no corresponding justification”. “Investigations disclose that for the purpose of generation of proceeds of crime, JKCA funds were layered by way of complex interbank transfers in all the bank accounts of JKCA and also by transfer to several personal bank accounts, followed by siphoning of the funds,” the ED statement added.

The CBI filed a charge sheet against Farooq Abdullah, Khan, Mirza, Mir Manzoor Gazanffer Ali, Bashir Ahmad Misgar and Gulzar Ahmad Beigh (former accountant of JKCA) for “misappropriation of JKCA funds amounting to Rs 43.69 crore” from grants given by the BCCI to the association for promoting the sport in the state between 2002-11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farooq-abdullah-s-properties-worth-over-rs-11-crore-attached-in-jkca/story-TybI4MgZTOaFNsXuwu4wlO.html
20-12-2020||India||2 men held under anti-conversion law released after court order||Two men who were arrested earlier this month under the Uttar Pradesh government’s newly enacted law against religious conversions by marriage, coercion or enticement were released on Saturday after a court order.On December 5, Rashid Ali and his wife Muskan Jahan or Pinki had gone to a court in Moradabad’s Kaanth town to register their marriage. However, a group of local Hindu activists landed at the court and forcibly took the couple to a police station. The police at the time said that the woman’s mother had accused Rashid of enticing Jahan by posing as a Hindu man, Sonu, and hiding his religious identity.Later, Rashid and his brother Mohd Saleem were booked under section 3 of the new law and Jahan was sent to a shelter home.The woman said her mother levelled fake charges against Rashid and told a magistrate that she married him and converted to Islam of her free will.“The court ordered the release of Rashid and his brother on the basis of the woman’s statement that she was an adult and had married Rashid of her own will and converted to Islam without any pressure,” Moradabad superintendent of police (rural) VS Mishra said.The two have been released on a personal bond and the case will be scrapped once police submit a report of the investigation. After her release from the shelter home on December 15, the 22-year-old woman accused authorities of medical negligence, which she said led to the miscarriage of her three-month-old foetus. The charge was denied by the state administration.“They ignored my complaint of pain in the stomach for three days and took me to the hospital only when my health deteriorated,” Jahan said.She further alleged that injections and medicines given to her in hospital were to terminate her pregnancy. This allegation was refuted by the inspector of Kaanth police station, Ajay Gautam, who described the charges as “rumour” and “fake news”.The recently promulgated Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance nullifies marriages if they are carried out for the sole purpose of religious conversion. The state government had on November 24 approved the draft ordinance, which provides for a jail term of up to 10 years for violators.It was enacted amid assertions by a section of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders that a strict law was needed against “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing activists to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women, though the courts and the Union government do not officially recognise the term.The Allahabad high court on Friday sought a response from the state government on two petitions that have challenged the constitutional validity of the controversial law, but declined to put it in abeyance through a stay order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-men-held-under-anti-conversion-law-released-after-court-order/story-wEuIU17ydYURAZXiMmMr3I.html

20-12-2020||India||Police probe in Odisha girl’s murder poor and flawed: Child rights body||Citing the “poor and flawed probe” by the police, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) on Saturday recommended that the Odisha government conduct an investigation by a central agency into the kidnap-and-murder case of a five-year-old girl in the state. Raising doubts regarding the legitimacy of the probe by the Special Investigation Team, led by senior IPS officer Arun Bothra, the commission said the statements of the minor girl’s parents were not recorded by the Nayagarh police after recovery of her body, but the police conducted the polygraph test on the girl’s parents without probing the facts in the matter.“When such serious discrepancies are present in the preliminary investigation then it becomes difficult to rely on the subsequent investigation that would be undertaken by the SIT as well. As the SIT is probing the minor girl murder case based on the preliminary investigation of the police authorities, the chances of probing the facts in this case and seeking justice is minimal,” the NCPCR said in a letter.The child rights body said in the Action Taken Report submitted before it by the SP and district collector of Nayagarh they failed to provide information regarding suspects in the case. “They subsequently misled the commission during the hearing by informing that the suspected accused had surrendered before the court,” the letter said.The commission also recommended the state government to take strict measures, including disciplinary action against the investigating officers, for dereliction of their duty and for conducting a “poor and flawed probe” which caused delays in tracing the girl before she was found dead.Meanwhile, the SIT on Saturday picked up Saroj Sethy, a college student, and his mother and sister to interrogate them in connection with the abduction and murder case of the girl.On Thursday, the youth had alleged that Bothra had offered him Rs 5 lakh to take blame for the girl’s murder before the SIT. However, the Odisha police had rubbished the allegations, saying the SIT is working diligently in the case. “Such unfounded allegations are being used to cast aspersions on the investigation agency. It may end up demotivating officers who are sincerely working to unearth the truth. It is both unfortunate and unethical,” said Odisha police in a press release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-probe-in-odisha-girl-s-murder-poor-and-flawed-child-rights-body/story-yApEn4vFxgzFOw0FSAwDTI.html
20-12-2020||India||Attachment of Farooq Abdullah’s properties by ED ‘political vendetta’: National Conference||The Jammu and Kashmir National Conference on Saturday said the attachment of Farooq Abdullah’s properties by the Enforcement Directorate was “political vendetta” and an attempt to “silence the leadership and dissuade it from voicing support to political aspirations of the people”. The ED on Saturday attached residential and commercial properties worth nearly Rs 12 crore of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Abdullah in a case of alleged money laundering. “The attachment of Abdullah’s properties by ED is political vendetta, meant to settle political scores,” senior party leaders, including two sitting MPs Mohammad Akbar Lone and Hasnain Masoodi, said in a joint statement. The leaders, who also included party general secretary Ali Muhammad Sagar and provincial presidents Nasir Aslam Wani and Devender Singh Rana and several former ministers, lambasted what they called “the series of attacks on the party leadership”. The leaders said such acts were nothing but “unwarranted and unjustified”. “There is no evidence worth the name on record to justify the order of attachment of the property. These ancestral assets had been acquired decades back, and there is no justification why there should be attached,” the leaders said. “It is nothing except political vendetta and an attempt to silence the leadership and dissuade it from voicing support to political aspirations of the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh,” the NC leaders said. They said the list of properties includes two ancestral properties in which Abdullah has a minor share. “It reveals the desperation of the BJP which is using its agencies to settle political scores.” The statement said the sudden move against Abdullah has been taken to “divert attention” from the fact that the BJP staring at loss in the District Development Council polls. “It is not a coincidence that the BJP ordered this action on the day the District Development Council polls ended because they know how badly they have fared and are now extracting their revenge in advance of the drubbing they will receive at the hands of people of J&K,” the leaders said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attachment-of-farooq-abdullah-s-properties-by-ed-political-vendetta-national-conference/story-SaeeQqRXjSwtKS7DJRcB4H.html

Addressing reporters after a meeting called by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to resolve the internal crisis, senior party functionary Pawan Kumar Bansal said no one in the party, including the dissenters, has any problem with Rahul Gandhi’s leadership. “Everyone is of the view that the party needs Rahul Gandhi’s leadership. There was no criticism and everyone supported him,” he added. A Congress functionary, asking not to be named, said the meeting saw senior leaders such as AK Antony, Ashok Gehlot, Harish Rawat, Ambika Soni, Ajay Maken and Bhakta Charan Das urging Rahul Gandhi to return to head the party and take back the resignation he gave on May 25 following the loss in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

20-12-2020||India||PM Modi stresses on India’s economic potential, defends new farm laws||India’s economic potential remains strong despite the pandemic, and that the global narrative has changed from “why India?” to “why not India?”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday while addressing business lobby group ASSOCHAM’s Foundation Week 2020, when he also defended the latest farm laws that have triggered widespread protests. The PM reiterated that farmers had benefited from a set reforms approved in June, including the three agricultural laws that thousands of farmers are protesting for weeks now. He said despite a pandemic-induced contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) of 7.5% in the July-September quarter, the country had attracted significant foreign direct investment and business activity was fast recovering. The PM called on industry heads to raise investment in research and development to achieve the goal of self-reliance. He highlighted a series of new reforms that laid a strong basis for long-term growth. These reforms had helped the world turn to India as the top business destination. Also Read| Farmers’ protest day 24: Haryana CM meets Tomar, agitation intensifies“Reforms, repealing of more than 1,500 outdated laws, ease in labour laws, red tape being replaced by red carpet and competitive tax rates and innovations have turned the past’s rhetoric of “why India?” into “Why not India?”, Modi said, addressing a gathering of industrialists. Modi appeared to stress on the importance of reforms in the farm sector set in motion by the three contentious laws to deregulate agricultural markets. allow food traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks and create a national framework of contract farming. These reforms have set off one of the largest farmers’ protest in decades. Modi also presented the “Assocham Enterprise of the Century Award” to Ratan Tata, who received the award on behalf of the Tata Group. PM said that the Tata Group has contributed to the development of the country under the leadership of Ratan Tata. Tata thanked the Prime Minister for the award and appreciated his strong leadership during the coronavirus pandemic. “In all the years that I have been in business, I have valued what our PM has been wanting to do. He has led the country through the pandemic for which we should be obliged. If we all stand together and follow what you have said and what you have shown, we will have a situation where the world will look at us and say this Prime Minister said it could happen and he made it happen,” Ratan Tata, chairman Tata Trusts said at the ASSOCHAM event. The Prime Minister set a goal of doubling down on economic growth in the next 27 years when India will celebrate its 100th years of Independence in 2047. “This is the time to plan and act and focus on nation-building as the next 27 years will decide India’s global role,” Prime Minister Modi said. Modi said India was emerging as a top competitor in key areas that will define its place in the global economy. India’s youth are making a name in startups and the country’s digital payments and other infrastructure make it a leading country in this field, Modi said. India’s startup ecosystem has showed world-beating growth. In 2019, over 1,300 startups were registered, a year when private equity investments in the sector hit a 10-year-high, attracting $17.3 billion and clocking annual growth of 60.5%.

World is heading towards another Industrial Revolution. So, from today we must plan and act on achieving our nation-building targets,” the PM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-stresses-on-india-s-economic-potential-defends-new-farm-laws/story-yByHaZ03JaOOaN8NWT5uWM.html
20-12-2020||India||Sonia Gandhi holds meeting for ‘rapprochement’||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday told a group of party colleagues that the process for organisational elections, one of the key demands of internal dissenters, had been set in motion, and brainstorming sessions on the lines of those in Pachmarhi and Shimla would be held to revive and strengthen the party, people familiar with the development said. The comments were made during a five-hour “rapprochement” meeting held in the lawns of Sonia Gandhi’s residence at 10, Janpath in Delhi, where the dissenters insisted that having representative and elected bodies from the top to bottom alone would help in the party’s revival across the country. The meeting took place following a late-night huddle between some of the dissenting leaders following comments by party general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala who said on Friday that there were no issues pending after the party kicked off the process of organisational elections. The leaders in the camp briefly contemplated whether to attend Saturday’s meeting, as Surjewala’s remarks did not go down well with them. They eventually decided to attend the meeting. Sonia Gandhi called Saturday’s meeting to discuss the way ahead and resolve the internal crisis triggered by a letter written by a group of 23 Congress leaders, also known as G-23, in August this year. None of the dissenters referred to the letter, which had sought full-time and active leadership, internal elections for every level of organisation, and introspection behind the “steady decline” of the 135-year-old organisation while outlining an 11-point action plan. Also Read: Sonia Gandhi’s letter to Uddhav Thackeray brings unease between Congress-NCP to the foreBoth sides described Saturday’s interaction as “cordial, constructive and an ice-breaker” unlike the stormy August 24 meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) where the rebels came under severe attack from Gandhi family loyalists for writing the letter. Of the 23 letter writers, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, his deputy in the Upper House Anand Sharma, former Union ministers Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor, former chief ministers of Haryana and Maharashtra Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Prithviraj Chavan respectively, and party’s legal department chairperson Vivek Tankha attended the meeting. Former Union minister Kapil Sibal had left for travel out of the country on Saturday morning. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, senior leaders AK Antony, Ambika Soni, P Chidambaram, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath, party office bearers Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Ajay Maken, Pawan Kumar Bansal, Harish Rawat and Bhakta Charan Das were also present. Congress general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal and general secretary in-charge of Karnataka and communications department Randeep Singh Surjewala were deliberately kept away as the two were considered to be “irritants” in the reconciliation process, according to people familiar with the matter. This was also the first such meeting held after the death of the party’s key troubleshooter and master strategist Ahmed Patel last month. Sonia Gandhi, according to Congress leader Pawan Bansal, told the leaders that they are “one big family” and all of them should work together and strive to strengthen the party. Bansal said Sonia Gandhi also informed the meeting the process for holding organisational polls, including to the party president’s post and the CWC has already been set in motion and the central election authority (CEA) is working on it. The dissenters thanked Sonia Gandhi for calling the meeting, consensus building and “being democratic” in the true Congress tradition, said another functionary present in the meeting. A dissenter later said there was recognition that concerns and issues raised by them were genuine and in the interests of the party and their move was not dissidence. Also Read: For the Congress, why status quo is untenableWhen Tewari urged that the Congress should hold “Chintan Shivirs” or brainstorming sessions similar to the Pachmarhi conclave in 1998 and the Shimla congregation in 2003 when the party was in the opposition, Sonia Gandhi promptly agreed and accepted his suggestion and told the leaders that there would be more such meetings in future. Tewari also talked about a blueprint for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and stressed on effective leadership, robust organisation, a counter narrative to that of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and ideological clarity. Nath and Chidamabaram raised the issue of people leaving the Congress and the sense of drift in the party. Chidamabaram also talked about restoring the parliamentary board and stressed on strengthening block- and booth-level committees. Chavan talked about elected Pradesh Congress Committees (PCCs) and an elected CWC, the party’s highest decision-making body. Azad spoke about the need to rebuild the organisation from the grassroots level and emphasised on having functional booth and district committees besides asking general secretaries and in-charges to spend more time in their respective states. The dissenters also stressed on the need to maintain the integrity and sincerity of the dialogue process. At this point, Azad without taking Surjewala’s name asked if the claim made at a news conference on Friday that all issues were sorted was true, then why was the meeting held for five hours. The meeting also discussed the ongoing farmers’ agitation, the Covid-19 situation, impact of the lockdown, the state of the economy, the collapse of institutions, the government’s move to skip the winter session of Parliament, the Congress party’s poor show in the assembly polls in Bihar and by-polls on 58 seats in 11 states apart from the setbacks in local bodies’ elections in Rajasthan, a state ruled by the party, Telangana, Goa, Kerala and Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-holds-meeting-for-rapprochement/story-WxZBZBF408MY9SHDAvSWWI.html
20-12-2020||India||Six TMC MLAs and four from Congress, Left join BJP at Amit Shah’s rally||Led by Suvendu Adhikari, six sitting legislators of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and four others from the Left and the Congress joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday afternoon in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah at a massive rally in Midnapore town in Bengal’s West Midnapore district. Among the 10 MLAs who switched sides, Adhikari is the only one who has submitted his resignation to the assembly though it has not been accepted yet on technical grounds. Crucial assembly polls in the state are due in about five months. During his visit in October, Shah declared that the BJP will come to power by winning more than 200 of the state’s 294 assembly seats. On Saturday, TMC’s Burdwan East Lok Sabha MP, Sunil Mandal; former minister Shyama Prasad Mukherjee; former Lok Sabha member from north Bengal’s Alipurduar, Dasrath Tirkey; and 15 civic body councillors of the TMC and other parties picked up the BJP flag along with at least 20 district-level leaders. While the TMC leadership targeted Adhikari, who resigned from the party earlier this week, and called the others traitors and opportunists, Shah, in his brief speech, defended the rebels. “Didi (Mamata Banerjee) you are talking of switching sides. Didn’t you leave the Congress and formed the TMC? Wasn’t it changing allegiance? Now you are accusing Suvendu bhai of changing sides. Thousands of people are waiting to join the BJP. Just wait and watch,” Shah said at the rally. “Can you see the future of millions of youths who need jobs? You can only see your nephew and want to make him the chief minister,” said Shah without naming Abhishek Banerjee, the chief minister’s nephew and a Lok Sabha member. Adhikari delivered a short but vitriolic speech. In an open letter to his followers Adhikari also said the TMC has failed to bring in any change in Bengal and the party has started to rot. The letter was released in the afternoon. “You (Mamata Banerjee) will not be number one again. You will be number two. I do not recognize anyone as my mother except the one who gave birth to me, and my country,” Adhikari said at the rally. Targeting Banerjee and the TMC for branding the BJP’s national leaders as “outsiders,” Adhikari said, “Amit Shah Ji, (BJP national president) JP Nadda Ji and the others are being called outsiders. India is one nation. I want Bengal and India to have the same government or else Bengal will not survive. There are no jobs, no progress. We have to ensure Narendra Modi’s government in Bengal.” Targeting Abhishek Banerjee and calling him a tolabaaj (extortionist), Adhikari raised the slogan, “Tolabaaj bhaipo hatao (oust the extortionist nephew).” Adhikari’s followers came from neighbouring districts in large numbers at the biggest playground in Midnapore town. The college ground, where the rally was held, is the same venue where 90 people were injured in July 2018 when the makeshift canopy set up for a rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi collapsed. Apart from Adhikari, the other TMC MLAs who joined the BJP are: Shilbhadra Dutta from Barrackpore; Banashri Maiti from the Kanthi North in East Midnapore; Sukra Munda from Nagrakata in Jalpaiguri district; Biswajit Kundu from Kalna in East Burdwan; and Saikat Panja from Manteswar in East Burdwan. The lawmakers from other parties are: Sudip Mukherjee, the Congress MLA from Purulia district; Ashok Dinda, the Communist Party of India (CPI) MLA from Tamluk; Dipali Biswas, CPI(M) MLA from Gazole in Malda district; and Tapasi Mandal, the CPI(M) legislator from Haldia in East Midnapore district. Significantly, veteran leader Bani Singha Roy from Howrah district, who is one of the founder vice-presidents of the TMC, also joined the BJP. Singha Roy spoke out against the present leadership last week for the first time. Dasrath Tirkey, former Revolutionary Socialist Party MLA who joined the TMC in 2014 and won the Alipurduar Lok Sabha, seat joined the BJP on Saturday. Tirkey lost the seat to the BJP’s John Barla in 2019. Among the others who joined the BJP are retired army colonel Diptangshu Chowdhury, who had quit the BJP in 2017 and joined the TMC. On Thursday, he stepped down from the posts of chairman of the South Bengal State Transport Corporation and advisor to the monitoring cell on programme implementation of government welfare services in the chief minister’s office. Hitting back, TMC Lok Sabha member Kalyan Banerjee said Shah’s rally was a “flop show” as people were brought from several districts to fill up the college ground. “People started to leave even before Shah began his speech,” he said at a press conference at the TMC headquarters in Kolkata.“You (Adhikari) are driven by greed. What didn’t you get in the TMC? You were a minister with three departments. You held other important portfolios. Your family is in control of two Lok Sabha constituencies and a civic body. You have no right to say that the party did not give you anything. Mamata Banerjee is a maverick leader. We will win the elections and you will be defeated too,” said Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-tmc-mlas-and-four-from-congress-left-join-bjp-at-amit-shah-s-rally/story-RFHXnmUrCOVn9swJHsf8eJ.html

20-12-2020||India||MSP only real risk protection for farmers, says new study||Farmers in fully regulated agriculture markets in Punjab got 30% more price for their produce in 2018-19 than those in totally unregulated markets in Bihar and partially regulated ones in Odisha, a study of the agri markets in three states has found, terming minimum support price (MSP) as only risk-management instrument available for farmers.The study, by the University of Pennsylvania Institute for the Advanced Study of India (UPIASI), with local research institutes in Bihar, Odisha and Punjab, attempted to understand the dynamics of three different agriculture trading systems, and comes at the time farmers from Punjab and Haryana are protesting and demanding MSP guarantee in law, and the scrapping of the three new laws that aim to liberalise the farm economy.Also Read| ‘Bow to farmers’: PM Modi backs laws, slams OppositionIn Punjab, 90% of the agri produce is traded at markets regulated under the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act by licensed commission agents. Bihar abolished the APMC Act in 2006 and traders and private players can buy produce directly from farmers. Odisha has both the market system and farm gate procurement. “We found the price gap between open market sales and public procurement was a significant 30% and deregulation of markets as in Bihar, helped traders, more than farmers as their access to produce improves,” said Shoumitro Chatterjee, co-author of the study, in a tweet. “Erstwhile [APMC] markets in Bihar still remain main produce selling markets but now unregulated and with dilapidated infrastructure whereas in Punjab markets are better,” he said in another tweet, suggesting that private sector investment has not come for agriculture infrastructure in Bihar.The study said only 5% and 11% of farmers in Bihar and Odisha, respectively, sell their produce to government agencies. Around 80% farmers in Bihar and Odisha are small and marginal, according to agriculture ministry data.The study said that despite constraints such as fewer procurement centres, delays in procurement, and payments, farmers prefer selling to the government because of the assured MSP. Also Read: PM Modi says Oppn intentionally did not work on Swaminathan Commission recommendationsIn Bihar, the farmers told the surveyors that they would like to sell maize, the flagship crop, to the government because of the MSP but there are not enough procurement centres. “The study shows that the MSP is the only risk-management instrument available to the farmers as crop insurance scheme has poor acceptability,” he tweeted. The use of crop insurance was less than 7% in Bihar and Odisha, and less than one% in Punjab. The reason is cumbersome process for claims and low insurance value of produce.The study, conducted in seven districts of Bihar, Odisha and Punjab, found that persistence of in farmer-trader relationship was weak in Bihar and Odisha, unlike Punjab. The study also found transparency in payment to farmers in Punjab. The commission agents, or arthiyas, are authorised to give cash of up to ₹10,000 only, and rest has to be transferred to the farmer. No such transparency was found in Bihar and Odisha, as unregulated small traders have replaced the licensed traders. “The study clearly outlined that marketing challenges are more pronounced in Bihar where commission charged by middlemen in unofficial markets are much higher than in the regulated markets in Punjab and Odisha,” said former Union agriculture secretary Siraj Hussain. The study, however, also said while MSP provides price assurance, it could be hindrance for crop diversification. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana, for instance, grow largely wheat and paddy though there is higher demand of cereals and pulses. R Ramakumar, professor at Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai, said: “The government needs to sit with farmers and assure them of compensation for the income loss due to diversification. This can be done through higher MSP for crop...,” he said.Punjab’s cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said farmers need assured markets to sell their produce even for diversification. “Although the government declares MSP for 23 crops, there is no assured procurement for most. If there is an assurance, farmers will be willing to diversify,” he said.An official of the Odisha food department said they are continuously upgrading facilities so that more small and marginal farmers can sell their paddy under MSP system and admitted a shortfall of regulated markets. Bihar agriculture minister Amrendra Pratap Singh, however, said: “They do not know the system. The MSP of paddy is ₹1,868 per quintal and it is transferred to farmers’ accounts. You can’t deposit less than the MSP.”(With inputs from bureaus in Patna, Chandigarh and Bhubaneswar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msp-only-real-risk-protection-for-farmers-says-new-study/story-rEKqOmbyAKLgZ3Lkw1q1UI.html
20-12-2020||Editorials||The BJP’s Bengal offensive | HT Editorial||With home minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s second most powerful leader and organiser par excellence, Amit Shah, visiting West Bengal over the weekend, the battle for the state has truly begun. Elections are scheduled for early summer next year. This is the one eastern state where the BJP was unable to make deep inroads till 2019. This is despite the fact that the founder of the BJP’s earlier avatar, Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Shyama Prasad Mookerjee was from the state; it is despite the fact that the state was witness to Partition and remains demographically mixed with a substantial Muslim population — often a ripe enough basis for the BJP to make a splash. But the three-decade long rule of the Left and then the decade-old regime of Mamata Banerjee kept the party on the fringes.But not anymore. The 2019 election result — the BJP won 18 of the 42 seats in the state, emerging as the clear opposition to Ms Banerjee — provided momentum to the party. It is now relying on a set of tested techniques to expand its hold. It is banking on anti-incumbency against Trinamool — and, remember, the BJP has proved to be an effective challenger to governments in various states. It is banking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity. It is relying on identity politics — stoking the resentment of Hindus against what it alleges to be Ms Banerjee’s “politics of appeasement” and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to win over those Hindu voters with links east of the border. It is banking on a set of defectors from the Trinamool who are deeply rooted in the state — from Mukul Roy to now Suvendu Adhikari. And it is leveraging its careful micro-caste politics within a state where various sub-castes have often felt underrepresented.All of this is happening at a time when Ms Banerjee is on the defensive. Her control of the State apparatus and her organisational machine give her an advantage. But her reliance on political consultant Prashant Kishor has antagonised older leaders; her governance, especially the handling of Cyclone Amphan, has raised questions; and she is struggling to retain both her Muslim base while assuring Hindus that she is also committed to their interests. Ms Banerjee is a political fighter and cannot be underestimated, but the Trinamool has reason to be concerned about 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-bjp-s-bengal-offensive-ht-editorial/story-ardp3jrnrOhCdMRvZj8O6J.html
20-12-2020||Editorials||On media, the Vice-President speaks up | HT Editorial||Delivering a lecture on Friday, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu became the senior-most constitutional functionary to raise an issue that lies at the heart of India’s information flows, media ecosystem, and, therefore, democratic functioning. He said that the print media is adapting to the digital medium with sincerity, but added that information generated by the print media at substantial cost was being “hijacked by social media giants”. Mr Naidu then referred to how some countries were taking steps to ensure a revenue-sharing model between print media and social media companies, and called for “effective guidelines or laws” to enable print media to get its share of the revenue. He also mentioned how democratisation enabled by social media was welcome, but there were clear downsides in the absence of regulation and protocols.It is heartening that India’s top national leadership is finally paying attention to an issue that has implications for how news is produced, how it is consumed, how narratives are formed, who become the primary players in the information theatre, and how this, then, enables citizens to access information and exercise their choice. The issue here is not about profit or loss. It is about a principle — can a few digital monopolies hide behind the pretence of being intermediaries while exercising editorial control and extract profits from work done by others? Mr Naidu has triggered an important debate and a bipartisan consensus is essential to rein in social media companies, and treat them as just that, media companies which must follow the law both in their content and their business models.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-media-the-vice-president-speaks-up-ht-editorial/story-mVjxs0IP4nqB2ELxr8Du3I.html
