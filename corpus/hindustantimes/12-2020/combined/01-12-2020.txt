01-12-2020||City||Katra-Delhi expressway: Farmers gherao Sangrur DC’s office to oppose land acquisition||Hundreds of farmers gheraoed the Sangrur deputy commissioner’s office on Tuesday to protest land acquisition for the Katra-Delhi expressway. The protesters, hailing from Sangrur and Patiala districts, blocked all three gates of the district administration complex, claiming that the government was forcefully snatching their land.The Katra-Delhi Expressway, also known as NE-05, will reduce the travel time between Katra and Delhi to six-and-a-half hours, and cover Patiala, Sangrur, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar. Jagjeet Singh, one of the protesters, said, “Many farmers are at the Delhi border to oppose the Centre’s new agricultural laws. So we will not allow any acquisition until those farmers return.”He added, “The protest is not about compensation. We have decided that farmers will not give up their land to the Centre as it will ultimately hand it over to the corporate houses. The expressway will not help farmers in any way; instead, it will only make cultivation in the area difficult.” Ranjit Singh, another protester, said, “The farmer unions held protests on the Delhi border and we staged a dharna outside the deputy commissioner’s office. We have informed the farmer unions about the situation. This land acquisition for Katra-Delhi Expressway is the first step of the implementation of the three agriculture laws.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/katra-delhi-expressway-farmers-gherao-sangrur-dc-s-office-to-oppose-land-acquisition/story-YAE1WCKXD0kk8aEyOPIguN.html
01-12-2020||Chandigarh||HC stays Chandigarh admn’s move to privatise power dept||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday stayed the Chandigarh administration’s move to privatise the power department. The high court bench of justices Jitendra Chauhan and Vivek Puri acted on the plea of UT Powermen Union, a worker’s collective that had challenged the move to privatise 100% distribution and supply functions of the electricity wing of UT’s engineering department. Even as the detailed order was awaited, by the evening, the administration said it will file a review petition. “We will first file a review in the HC, failing which we will move the Supreme Court,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida. The decision to privatise the department was taken on May 12 after directions from the Centre. An empowered committee has been constituted to oversee and implement the process. The administration has assured the Centre that the process will be completed by the end of this year. As many as 17 firms, including Adani Transmission Limited, Tata Power Company Limited, GMR Generation Asset Limited, NTPC Electricity Supply Limited and Sterlite Power, have expressed interest after the administration on November 9 invited bids for privatisation, which primarily involves the distribution of electricity supply.“The electricity department caters to a city with relatively low demand of around 400MW. If privatised, the efficiency is expected to improve, specifically of the distribution of power,” said a UT official, not wishing to be named. Not sustainable in law, argue powermenThe union had sought quashing of the decision to privatise the department and subsequent process of tendering initiated by the administration. The court was told that the administration is selling 100% stake of the government in the absence of such a provision under Section 131 of the Electricity Act, 2003. As per Section 131 (2), the power department cannot be transferred to a totally private entity with no stake or control of the government at all, the court was informed. The department is running into profits and its revenue has been surplus for the past three years, the court was told, adding that the current system is economically efficient with transmission and distribution losses less than the target of 15% fixed by the power ministry.It was pointed out that the transfer scheme has been prepared without calling for objections from all stakeholders — neither employees nor consumers. “In the absence of an advise from the advisory committee to the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) and without there being any recommendation of the JERC to that effect, privatisation of electricity wing of UT is not sustainable in the eyes of law,” it was argued. Issue has led to several protests, strikeThe power department serves 2.3 lakh consumers in the city. It has 1,780 sanctioned posts, with 1,490 approved by the JERC, though its employee strength is 1,220. Of them, 900 are regular and the remaining on contract. Powermen have been protesting the move and had even gone on a one-day strike last Thursday. Despite the administration’s warning, more than 90% of the field staff had not reported for duty, leading to major power disruptions across the city.Even the Federation of Sector Welfare Association Chandigarh, an apex RWA body, had joined their protest march last Monday, questioning the administration’s motive behind privatising a profit-making department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-stays-chandigarh-admn-s-move-to-privatise-power-dept/story-fon2WVmevwm64o4elYKqyH.html

01-12-2020||Delhi||Air quality falls as winds calm down||While the farm fires in neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab have drastically reduced -- it contributed just 4% to Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels on Tuesday, according to System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research -- the national capital’s air quality plunged further to the upper end of the “very poor” zone of the air quality index (AQI) on Tuesday. According to government agencies, it is likely to remain there throughout the week owing to the wind speed calming down and wind patterns changing in the coming days.As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI on Tuesday was 367, even worse than Monday’s 318, though both are in the very poor category. On a scale of 0 to 500, an AQI value between 300 and 400 is considered very poor, and those above 400 are considered severe.The air quality levels continued to deteriorate further on Tuesday evening, with most of the hotspots slipping into the ‘severe’ zone. By 9 pm, 11 of the 35 monitoring stations recorded ‘severe’ air quality including --- Anand Vihar (414), Ashok vihar (437), Bawana (413), DTU (409), Jahangirpuri (443), Mundka (413), Nehru Nagar (404), Patparganj (410), Punjabi bagh (405), Rohini (414) and Vivek Vihar (425). Delhi had last seen average air quality levels in the ‘severe’ zone on November 25 with an AQI reading of 413. After this air quality had improved to ‘poor’ and even recorded a ‘moderate’ air quality day on November 27, but it started deteriorating again from Monday onwards with the AQI plunging to ‘very poor’. This November saw nine ‘severe’ air quality days. According to experts, every year, after the peak pollution in November, which is mostly attributed to stubble burning, bad air episodes are seen towards end-December and early January. This is mainly because meteorological conditions are least favourable during that time, while the baseline pollution (local emissions) stays the same. According to scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the average wind speed during the day reduced to 7-8 kmph from 10-12 kmph on Monday. “The wind speed will further reduce from December 4 or 5 and the direction is likely to change to easterly, from the present north-westerly. The change in direction is due to a western disturbance that will affect Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh from the night of December 3, which will also have an impact on Delhi. Whenever there is a change in wind pattern, winds turn calm and trap pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.He said easterly winds are also likely to bring in moisture, which when combined with calm winds allow pollutants to accumulate. There is also a forecast of shallow fog on December 4 or 5. “Besides, the change in wind pattern will also lead to a rise in minimum temperature between December 4 and 7, when it is likely to remain around 10-12 degrees Celsius. Thereafter, north-westerly winds are likely to return resulting in a drop in temperature,” Srivastava further said.On Tuesday, the Safdarjung Observatory --- the official marker for the city’s weather --- recorded a minimum temperature of 8.1 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal. The maximum settled at 27.2 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal.Sagnik Dey, associate professor, IIT-Delhi, said, “In October and November, farm fires contribute about 25% to the overall pollution in Delhi. In December, we record the same pollution level even without stubble burning because of reduced dispersion of pollutants. This year, while a large section is still working from home, the benefit derived from reduced work-related travel was lost to low use/frequency of public transport,” Dey said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said at present, the only factors at play are meteorological and local pollutants. “Even though there has been a declining trend in the overall pollution levels since 2017, Delhi still has to reduce its PM 2.5 concentrations at least by 60% to mitigate these peak episodes and meet the clean air standards. Also, on-ground monitoring of waste burning and emissions from illegal industries need to be stepped up to have some real impact. If we are able to achieve all that, air quality may not touch ”severe” during December and January,” she said. The CPCB, which is now officially in charge of implementing the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) --- to combat different levels of air pollution --- in Delhi-NCR, is taking day to day measures to keep local pollution levels under control.“We are monitoring the situation closely. Measures under the ‘very poor’ zone are already being enforced. Patrolling teams are carrying field inspections regularly,” said a senior CPCB official, who did not wish to be named. Meanwhile, despite repeated attempts, MM Kutty, chairperson of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and adjoining areas, could not be reached for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/air-quality-falls-as-winds-calm-down/story-7soDdoxZVx16gAY6wGf5QK.html
01-12-2020||Delhi||North corporation employees threaten strike again over pending wages||Hundreds of North Delhi Municipal Corporation employees — including engineers, teachers, ministerial and horticulture staff — have again threatened to go on a strike later this month against non-payment of their pending salaries. The north body employees had called off their indefinite strike earlier last month after they were promised a month’s salary before Diwali, with the remaining dues — along with bonus and pension — being cleared by the end of November 2020. Representatives of Confederation of MCD Employees Union said that they were just given a month’s salary before Diwali and are yet to get paid for four months. They said that they have written to the mayor and the commissioner about the issue of non-payment and had also told them that they will be compelled to go on a strike if their demands are not met.AP Khan, convener of Confederation of MCD Employees Union — an umbrella body of civic workers in the three municipalities— said that the salary of employees is pending for August, September, October and November months for north corporation employees.“This has become a regular affair now. We were promised that pendency (of salaries) will be cleared by November end. But those promises turned out to be shallow. We had a meeting with the north corporation mayor (Jai Prakash) on Monday, where he again promised to solve the issue by the end of this week. So, we are waiting till December 4 and if our grievances are not met by then we will have no option but to go on strike again,” Khan said. He added that a decision regarding date and timing of the strike and future course of action will be decided in a meeting with the employees unions on Wednesday. There are nearly 55,000 employees in the north corporation and requires nearly Rs 360 crore to pay salaries and pensions every months. Earlier, employees of horticulture department, engineers, teachers, clerical staff, group D staff — including labourers and beldars — of north corporation had gone on strike on November 9, but the agitation was called off the next day after assurances from municipal authorities. Jai Prakash, mayor north corporation, said that strike was not a solution for payment of pending salaries. He appealed to the employees to understand the financial situation of the corporation and “have faith in the system”.“We are arranging funds to release pending salaries of employees. Salary disbursement is our top priority. But we just need cooperation from our employees too as the municipality is undergoing a financial crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-corporation-employees-threaten-strike-again-over-pending-wages/story-9vJXhfbcMv629U0tJI9GvM.html

01-12-2020||City||Device to filter fumes installed at Nigam Bodh Ghat crematorium||New Delhi: To curb local sources of pollution that usually go under the radar, the National Environmental Engineering Institute (NEERI) on Tuesday said it has designed a new device to filter fumes at crematoriums, which contribute significantly to air pollution levels. One such air pollution control (APC) system has been installed at Nigam Bodh Ghat, Delhi’s oldest and busiest crematorium.According to an analysis by NEERI, even though the annual overall contribution of fumes from the crematorium to the city’s PM 2.5 levels (the most harmful aerosols in Delhi’s air) is 0.2%-0.5%, the localised impact is high.“High pollution levels have been observed at air quality monitoring stations close to the crematorium (Nigam Bodh Ghat), where over 20,000 bodies are cremated every year, according to 2016-17 data. It is important to check these localised sources of pollution to reduce emissions in different pockets of the city, which contribute to the overall PM 2.5 levels. We have designed an air pollution control device to clear fumes at crematoriums. One such device has been installed at Nigam Bodh Ghat, which is yet to start functioning after formal inauguration,” said Rakesh Kumar, director, NEERI, during a webinar on air pollution in Delhi-NCR on Tuesday.He said for conventional cremation, around 300-400 kgs wood is required per pyre, which emits substantial fumes. “There is a need for air pollution control systems in all crematoriums in Delhi-NCR.Local sources of pollution in Delhi-NCR that do not get adequately accounted for their contribution to bad air quality include tandoors/stoves used at smaller restaurants, solid waste burning, construction dust and use of unapproved fuels by industries, among others. “There are around 35,000 open tandoors in Delhi, which use solid fuel and an ill-designed system, resulting in emissions. Besides, the use of unapproved fuels in factories and small units also add to emissions,” Kumar said.Talking of initiatives taken by NEERI to curb emissions, he said they have designed a Smart tree- Green pillar, which is an organic light tower of metal framework covered with living plants such as money plant, crassula, orchids, etc., with a controlled system of drip irrigation so that there is no wastage of water and provides a mist cooling system. “Such tree pillars can be installed at traffic junctions to curb emissions and must be experimented with in all metro cities, including Delhi,” Kumar said.The webinar was organised by the environment committee of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/device-to-filter-fumes-installed-at-nigam-bodh-ghat-crematorium/story-P0VWRrou4ARwJu9NZIns0N.html

The NCB has also challenged the magisterial order, demanding Singh and Limbachiyaa to judicial custody. The agency claimed it needed to interrogate Limbachiyaa to find out the source of drugs recovered from their premises and had sought his custody. However, the plea was rejected by the magistrate court and he, along with Singh was remanded to judicial custody November 22.The agency has now urged the special NDPS court to set aside the order remanding them to judicial custody and permit the agency to interrogate them in its custody.The plea came up for hearing on Tuesday and the special court issued notice to Singh and Limbachiyaa. The pleas would now be heard next week.NCB officers arrested Singh on November 21 and her husband Limbachiyaa the next morning, under provisions of the NDPS Act following raids at their residence and production house, seizing 86.5 gram of cannabis from both the places.The agency claimed that Singh in her statement revealed that she used to smoke cannabis purchased by her husband.Following a tip-off, the NCB also conducted raids in Khar Danda area and nabbed a 21-year-old drug trafficker in possession of various narcotics substances including 15 blots of LSD (commercial quantities) and 40 gram of cannabis and nitrazepam (psychotropic medicines).A team of NCB officers then carried out a search at the production house of Harsh Limbachiyaa located in Versova, Andheri and recovered 65 grams of dry green leafy substance which tested positive for cannabis, NCB said in its November 22nd remand application.Based on further input, another search was carried out at their residence located at Oberoi Springs, off New Link Road in Andheri (West).

The proposal regarding the shifting of dairy units has been kept on hold. Punjab Municipal Infrastructure Development Company’s CEO Ajoy Sharma gave a detailed presentation of the project. He said domestic sewage, industrial effluent, solid waste and dairy waste were prime sources of pollution in the nullah and the department had taken care of every aspect under this project, which had been planned considering the needs of the residents.Against the existing capacity of 418 megalitres per day (MLD) (excluding the 48 MLD Jamalpur STP, which is lying defunct), the department will increase the capacity to 703 MLD by upgrading the existing STPs and establishing two STPs at Jamapur and Balloke. While new STPs with 285 MLD capacity will be established at the cost of Rs 375 crore, Rs 29.5 crore will be spent on establishing an effluent treatment plant for dealing with 6 MLD dairy waste, Rs 49 crore will be spent on upgrading the existing STPs and Rs 65.5 crore will be spent on establishing pumping stations in different parts of the city. As per the information shared by officials, 625 MLD sewage is dumped into the nullah on a daily basis.Besides, there are 16 points from where sewage is getting into the nullah without any treatment.The National Green Tribunal has set March 2021 as the deadline for the municipal corporation to plug the points otherwise a monthly penalty of Rs 10 lakh for every point will be imposed.Industrialists, local bodies dept lock horns over budgetThe interactive session turned stormy after the officials of the local bodies department and representatives of industrial bodies had a disagreement over the budget of the project.President of Bahadurke Road Textile and Knitwear Association, Tarun Jain Bawa claimed that the work for establishing new sewage treatment plants (STP), upgrading existing STPs and installation of effluent treatment plants (ETPs) for dealing with dairy waste can be completed by them at a cost of Rs 325 crore, instead of spending Rs 519 crore.In response, officials of the local bodies department, including principal secretary AK Sinha and secretary Ajoy Sharma, and Ashu questioned the association on why no bids for the project were submitted by them when the tenders were floated.Ashu also expressed annoyance when industrial representatives raised questions over the bypassing of rainwater mixed with sewage into the nullah during monsoon season, and concluded the session.The industrialists had stated that in the absence of storm sewers, the STPs got overloaded in monsoon, with rainwater getting into sewer lines. As such, they should also be allowed to bypass the waste into the nullah.”A section of industry is responsible for the pollution. Rather than taking a sarcastic dig , the industry should work with the department to deal with pollution,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/650-crore-buddha-nullah-rejuvenation-project-set-to-commence-in-a-month-ashu/story-yTVgkotk1La9akbC5Ph02K.html

The victim escaped the murderous attack as the bullets hit his car.The victim, Pargat Singh, 45, of Jawandan Kalan village, Tarn Taran, said that he was commuting to Ludhiana in his Maruti Suzuki Swift Dzire car via Harike, Moga and Jagraon. On the way, he stopped at a shrine near Jagraon to pay obeisance. As he resumed his journey, he reached near Sidhwan Kalan village, where a masked suddenly came in front his car. He was wearing a “parna” on his head that he had also used to conceal his face.As he slammed the brakes, the masked man approached him and flashed a gun. Before he could comprehend what’s happening, the accused fired four bullets at him. But he dodged the shots, which hit various parts of the car. He raised the alarm which prompted the assailant to flee.Sub-inspector Kamaldeep Kaur, who is investigating the case, said the shooter was alone and didn’t rob the victim, which points at the incident being a fallout of a rivalry.A case under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 25, 27, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act has been lodged against the unidentified accused.

01-12-2020||Gurugram||Farmers on way to Delhi detained at Sohna||At least 24 farmers and members of the civil society were taken into preventive detention by the police in Sohna, on their way to Delhi to join the farmer’s agitation, on Tuesday. Nearly 300 farmers and civil society members, including members of Bharatiya Kisan Union and Mewat Vikas Sabha, had gathered at Gandhi Park in Nuh and IMT Sohna, from where to they were to proceed to Delhi to protest against the new farm laws and extend their support to their counterparts.Protesters said that they were initially stopped by the Nuh Police, but managed to reach IMT Sohna, the final meeting point. Shortly after entering Sohna, they were detained by the police near Raipur barricade. While 20-30 farmers were taken to the Sadar police station, some of them managed to cross the Gurugram border while others returned.Thousands of farmers across the country have been protesting against the three newly enacted farm laws— The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 — passed by Parliament during the monsoon session. The farmers fear that the new laws will put them at the mercy of large corporations and lead to the removal of the minimum support price they receive on important crops.“We were proceeding towards Delhi on foot and tractors when we were stopped from doing so by the police near Raipur barricade. We were rounded up in buses by the police and detained at Sohna sadar police station. The police misbehaved with us while detaining us,” said Azad Khan, Haryana vice-president, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).Salamudeen Meo, Mewat Vikas Sabha president, one of the leaders of the march, said that farmers from different parts of Nuh had assembled with the motive of joining the stir in Delhi on Tuesday but were prevented from doing so by the police. “Police tried to detain the vehicles of those who were leading the march. Around 20-30 of us are at the police station. The police is not telling us under what provision of the law we have been detained,” said Meo.Ram Kishan Mehlawat, BKU Haryana’s general secretary, who was marching towards Delhi with other farmers, was also detained. “We were stopped at the barricades near Sohna. The police impounded our vehicles but we started walking on foot. Police used force and rounded us up in buses. We have no idea where other farmers are,” said Mehlawat.He said that the police had detained farmers who were simply walking towards Delhi to raise their voice against the three farm laws that were detrimental to the interest of farmers. “These laws will hurt the farmers and benefit corporates and middlemen. There is no guarantee of minimum support price. Farmers will be left at the mercy of corporates,” said Mehlawat.Astha Modi, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said, “About 24 farmers moving in cars were stopped by the police at Sohna border after crossing Nuh jurisdiction. They were not allowed to cross following which they parked their cars and started walking. We have requested them to return and have tried to pacify them, telling them that they should not risk their lives and others as the coronavirus is on the rise and it may affect their health. We had a peaceful meeting with them,” she said.Modi refuted charges of inappropriate behaviour or use of force to prevent farmers from entering Gurugram. “No force was applied nor did the situation go out of control. No additional force was called to the spot to control the farmers. Even the farmers did not take law in hand and tried to convince the police with their point of view,” she said.Yogendra Yadav, convener, Swaraj India, criticised the Gurugram police for detaining farmers. Condemning the move, he said that the arrests were undemocratic. He also took a swipe at chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s earlier comments that farmers from Haryana were not participating in the agitation. “On one hand, chief minister Khattar says that farmers from Haryana are not participating in the movement whereas, on the other hand, they are arresting farmers,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-on-way-to-delhi-detained-at-sohna/story-E2lO9aNelLoB5ZFgdopoLM.html
01-12-2020||Gurugram||Border checks, barriers at Sirhaul and Aya Nagar lead to traffic congestion||The Gurugram Police on Tuesday placed barricades at the Sirhaul and Aya Nagar borders in order to prevent protesting farmers from reaching the national Capital, resulting in traffic congestion during peak hours. The police said they had received information that farmers from Rajasthan had entered Nuh through Rewari and Tauru and were trying to cross the Gurugram border to reach the Capital.Thereafter, Gururgam and Delhi police started checking commuters, following which vehicles started piling up. This resulted in a kilometre-long jam. The police said they had to eventually ease checking in order to decongest the stretch. Astha Modi, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said, “Traffic congestion was reported during the peak hours in the morning as we were checking suspected vehicles. The farmers were boarded in cars and had taken the Nuh route but did not cross the Sirhaul border. More than 50 police personnel were deployed at each border to ensure smooth passage for commuters,” she said. Commuters had to face inconvenience during the morning hours, but the situation in the evening was relatively better. The police teams, however, continued to periodically check vehicles throughout the day.Himanshi Mehta, a daily commuter to Delhi, said that she got stuck in a jam from Shankar Chowk to Rajokri in Delhi due to the checking by both police forces. “Only one lane was operational due to which only one vehicle could pass through the barricade at a time resulting in a jam. The journey from Gururgam to Delhi is becoming worse day by day,” she said, adding that police should make arrangements for daily commuters so that they are not stuck in traffic jams.. More than 100 personnel were deployed at the Gururgam-Delhi Expressway and kept a close watch on passing vehicles ferrying more than four passengers. According to the police, no farmer’s trolley or heavy vehicles crossed the borders. Twenty police control room van were also deployed between Kherki Daula toll plaza and Sirhaul border to check passing vehicles. As per the police, more than 100 vehicles were stopped for checking. The Gurugram Police regularly coordinated with the Delhi Police to streamline vehicular movement throughout the day. Nikita Gehlot, the deputy commissioner of police (Manesar), said that the farmers had reached Tauru through Dharuhera. “Our teams were deployed at the borders and the stretches connecting other districts. No vehicle carrying farmers tried to cross the border through any route connecting Gurugram with Manesar or KMP. There was no congestion on the stretch any time of the day and commuters had a smooth passage,” she said. According to the police, the additional forces were kept on the standby but situation at the borders remained peaceful throughout the day. An additional force of more than 100 personnel was deployed on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway as they were suspecting farmers to take that route. However, no farmers used this stretch, said police. The police said they were prepared with diversion plans and had even prepared maps for the routes, which were shared with the traffic police and police stations concerned. However, they were not required. The border routes connecting Delhi, Rewari, Rajasthan, Nuh and Jhajjar were less affected, said the police. An officer of Delhi Police said each vehicle entering the Capital was checked thoroughly, which slowed down the traffic. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said they had adequate police deployment at the borders with Gurugram and situation was peaceful throughout the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/border-checks-barriers-at-sirhaul-and-aya-nagar-lead-to-traffic-congestion/story-E4O4uB7VXzZ9M0AKvFJO7K.html

Prioritising health workers for administering Covid-19 vaccine, the state government had earlier asked the district health department to submit the details of at least 728 private healthcare units in Gurugram.Of these, only 230 units, comprising more than 20,000 front-line workers, have submitted their details so far. Health officials said that many private clinics are reluctant to share the information of their working staff. Acting on the guidelines issued by the state and central government, under which healthcare workers engaged in Covid-19 management will be covered on a priority basis for vaccination, district administration along with the health department on Tuesday held a meeting of the task force. It included representatives from Indian Medical Association (IMA) and nursing homes. “Only 31% private health care units have registered under the Covid-19 vaccination programme. Over 550 hospitals have been asked to register their workforce on the government portal in the next 48 hours,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO). “IMA and nursing homes’ associations have been directed to coordinate with private hospitals and clinics to furnish their details before the task force meets again on December 4 to discuss other planning issues related to vaccine distribution,” he said.Prashant Panwar, additional deputy commissioner, who chaired the meeting expressed concern over the delay by the private hospital and clinics in sharing the details, according to the minutes of the meeting accessed by HT. Dr Ajay Gupta, secretary, IMA, said, “It’s been an ongoing process but now the IMA has taken the task on a priority basis. Within next two days, all small clinics and private hospitals will upload information on the spreadsheet shared by the health department.” The issue of incomplete details furnished by some of the health units was also raised during the meeting. Currently, 230 health units comprising of big private hospitals, diagnostic labs, private clinics and nursing homes have registered. It involves a workforce of 20,348 healthcare workers. Dr Naresh Garg, district immunisation officer, said, “Of the 728 health care units, some private clinics are not keen to share their details as they fear coming under the scanner of the health department. It is for this reason, IMA has been asked co-ordinate with its members.” Yadav said that list of employees and workers under the health department has already been prepared. At least 4,575 people from Urban Primary Health Centres(UPHCs), primary health centres, community health centres, government dispensaries, anganwadis and Ayush department have been listed. In October, the Union ministry of health and family welfare clarified that front-line health workers like doctors, nurses, paramedics, sanitary staff, ASHA workers, surveillance officers will be considered as the priority population group to receive Covid-19 vaccine. States have been told to work on cold chain facilities and other related infrastructure at the block level for vaccine distribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-vaccination-programme-550-private-hospitals-clinics-told-to-share-details-of-staffers-by-december-4/story-EQsPZHZC3KnseLo9iXQizJ.html

Experts overseeing the trial said they will administer another 750 odd doses of the vaccine to the same number of participants by December-end, as part of the ongoing Phase 3 of the trial of the vaccine. About 25 new participants per day will be administered their first shot of the vaccine over this month, followed by a booster dose after 28 days. In Rohtak, the sample size for Phase 3 trials is expected to be around 1,000 people, officials said, while about 26,000 people will participate nationally. Covaxin is an indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, which is being developed by Bharat Biotech and ICMR’s National Institute of Virology, Pune. It is one of the two Indian vaccine candidates that have received the Drug Controller General of India’s nod to proceed with Phase 3 trials.Phase 1 of the Covaxin trials, which began at Rohtak in mid-July, involved 10 participants — all of whom were healthy adults, between the ages 18 and 55, and without any prior history of SARS-Cov-2 infection. “After we ruled out acute side effects, we proceeded with Phase 2 trials in September to test the immunogenicity of the vaccine. In this phase, we gave Covaxin shots to about 130 people between ages 12 and 65. Some also had comorbidities such as diabetes and asthma, but well within control. Now, in ongoing Phase 3 trials, we are administering the vaccine in the realm of real life,” said Dr Dhruv Chaudhury, nodal officer for Covid-19 management in the state and co-principal investigator of the Covaxin trials at PGIMS Rohtak. At least 30 percent of the Phase 3 trial’s sample population, Chaudhury said, will include people having pre-existing comorbidities and health workers. “All participants have been informed that they must continue to remain cautious and maintain social distancing even after receiving the shot, as neutralising antibodies are not produced immediately but can take up to 42 days to develop. We take blood samples at 28 days and 42 days after the first shot to check for the presence of antibodies” Chaudhury said. Chaudhury said that Phase 3 trials for Covaxin are expected to be completed by mid-January. He did not, however, comment on when interim data regarding vaccine efficacy (from Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the trial) would be shared. Covaxin is an “inactivated” vaccine, which relies on using samples of the SARS-Cov-2 virus that have been isolated at the National Institute of Virology, Pune. “The vaccines consist of virus particles which have been rendered inactive or are unable to replicate. However, the antigens will give a signal to the immune system to produce immunoglobulins or antibodies. This is different from the other Indian vaccine candidates, which does not contain any attenuated virus particles, and instead only relies on messenger RNA, or genetic code of the spike proteins of the virus, to signal our immune system,” explained another co-investigator at PGIMS Rohtak, who did not wish to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nearly-1-000-people-to-receive-doses-of-experimental-covid-19-vaccine-under-phase-3-trial/story-0skEaPcwkMV8Y4RvotOXfL.html

Data shows that 19,065 of the total infections were recorded in November – the highest-ever increase in a single month since the outbreak of the pandemic. November’s tally is nearly 52% higher than the 9,091 new cases confirmed in October and 54% higher than the 8,699 cases recorded in September. Due to the upsurge in Gurugram as well as the neighbouring National Capital Region (NCR) districts, Haryana is now among the five states in the country with the highest active case load. Health officials, however, point out that in the last three days, new infections, which was growing at an unprecedented rate since the first week of November, has come down to less than 500 a day, thereby pointing towards the fact that the infection might have reached a plateau. Officials say police enforcement on mask discipline has increased and the crowd at weddings, political and religious gatherings has also been restricted in the district to 50 people for indoor events and 100 for outdoor ones. The police have deployed 550 personnel in residential areas where maximum violations of mask rule in public places have been reported, officials.Around 2,000 people across the city have been fined for not wearing masks. According to the district health bulletin, 495 new infections of SARS-CoV-2 virus confirmed on Tuesday took the total count to 50,087. Out of these, active cases, including home isolated or hospitalised patients, stands at 6,092. The Covid-19 toll reached 297, with five people succumbing to the illness on Tuesday. In the last few days, new cases have shown a slight decline, with a corresponding dip in the test positivity rate. From 18% in the first week of November, it has come down to less than 10% in the last week of November. On an average, 635 new cases were confirmed each day in November. However, from November 29, daily figures have hovered between 479 and 495. In tackling the situation, the health department is still continuing with nearly 6,000 tests a day, with a higher percentage of gold front-line Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction(RT-PCR) test than the rapid antigen tests. Over 1.6 lakh tests were administered last month, with record 25,000 tests in single a day on November 28. Thereafter, the testing numbers have fluctuated between 5,750 and 5,504. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “We will continue with increased testing till the overall test positivity rate comes down to seven percent. Our focus is on timely contact tracing tobreak the chain of transmission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-crosses-50k-mark-in-covid-19-cases/story-W1ModR8fpfivBkdJO7GUBP.html

01-12-2020||Lucknow||A woman or her family can now fearlessly go to the police||The ordinance against unlawful religious conversions in Uttar Pradesh is largely based on the UP Law Commission’s report and draft legislation on the matter. Pankaj Jaiswal speaks to Justice Aditya Nath Mittal, the chairperson of the commission and former judge of Allahabad high court, even as the governor has given her assent to the ordinance, called the Uttar Pradesh Vidhi Viruddh Dharm Samparivartan Pratishedh Adhyadesh 2020 (UP Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance-2020).Now that the draft ordinance has been passed by the UP cabinet, how effective do you think it will be in checking unlawful conversions?It will be very effective in checking such conversions and harassment of women. It has stringent provisions. A victim woman or her family can now fearlessly go to the police.What prompted you to work on the report and draft legislation?Media reports prompted me. At that time, there were a lot of reports and incidents of such religious conversions, by deception, force, coercion, allurements, and marriage, were surfacing. So, I decided to take it up.How long did you take to make the report and draft legislation and what all did you study?It took three months of work. We studied a lot. The 268-page report, including the draft legislation, was prepared after researching pre and post-independence laws in India and the neighbouring countries like Nepal, Myanmar, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Various rulings of the Supreme Court and high courts against conversions were cited. Studied existing laws in 10 other states — Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Odisha, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. On November 21, 2019, we submitted the report to the chief minister.What happened after the submission of the report? Were you involved later?The report then went to the UP home department and while the government worked on it, the commission was consulted whenever required.What about the term love jihad?There’s no such term in the report and draft legislation.Since you became the chairperson of the UP law commission, how many reports did you submit to the government?I took over in August 2017. Since then, we submitted a total of 12 reports. Some of them are on the recovery of damages to the public and property, transgender rights in agricultural property, unlawful religious conversion, and the UP cow and its progeny bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/a-woman-or-her-family-can-now-fearlessly-go-to-the-police/story-PWuqPCeIhPRtb1egAnoLRM.html

01-12-2020||Chandigarh||No decision yet to fully reopen PGIMER OPDs||Despite the dip in the number of Covid-19 infections, full outpatient department services will not resume at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) and physical patient consultations will be limited, it has been learnt. However, the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Sector 32 will start limited physical consultation in four more departments from Thursday. PGIMER authorities had said early in November that the situation would be reviewed after Diwali since an infection surge was feared. “We have decided to wait for some more time before taking any decision on (opening the OPDs). We are expecting the number of cases fall to below 50 per day and that period will be more conducive for reopening the OPDs to full strength. For now, we may increase the number of physical consultations being provided after telephonic sessions,” said professor Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER. The OPDs were completely shut down on March 19, a day after the first Covid-19 case surfaced in the city. The institute then shifted focus to teleconsultation services.“Teleconsultations can be a part of the medical services. However, though we need to go back to the earlier system as soon as possible, we cannot risk the lives of patients as well as attendants,” prof Jagat Ram added. PGIMER provides services to patients from the adjoining regions as well, with 10,000 OPD consultations logged in a day often during normal times. The campus almost sees a footfall of around 25,000 persons daily, mainly from Punjab and Haryana. According to GMCH-32 hospital spokesperson Anil Moudgil: “Urology, neurosurgery, plastic surgery and cardiothoracic and vascular surgery will restart from Thursday, with online and telemedicine registration done from December 2.” At present, 12 OPDs at GMCH-32 that are operating with restrictions are: Paediatric, pulmonary medicine, psychiatry, radiotherapy, obstetrics, gynaecology, psychiatry, radiotherapy, physiotherapy and dermatology, surgery and medicine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-decision-yet-to-fully-reopen-pgimer-opds/story-UGqmsRwGWGXlK6hrLmnjLK.html
01-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh liquor vend extortion case: Two policemen identified in CCTV footage||After a liquor store owner in Sector 40 complained about alleged extortion by policemen and submitted CCTV footage substantiating his claims, Chandigarh police have identified the men in the video as crime branch head constables.Both men, however, have not been traced as yet even as other liquor contractors have come forward with more complaints of extortion.Confirming this on Tuesday, UT senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “Based on the video footage we have identified the cops as Anil and Pawan. Both were clearly visible in the video and we are tracking them down and will take action against them.”Officials revealed that Pawan and Anil had been missing since the liquor contractor complained to the police even though no money exchanged hands in the CCTV footage.‘Suspicious behaviour’However, police officials privy to the investigation said that the behaviour of the two policemen in question seemed suspicious. “In the CCTV footage it can be seen that the policemen are entering the liquor store multiple times on different days and the way they are speaking to the shopkeepers is suspicious. They can be seen entering other shops too and repeating this, which confirms what the complainant was saying,” said an official who wished to remain anonymous as he was not authorised to speak to the media.A case under Section 383 (extortion) of the Indian penal Code (IPC) was registered on November 29 at the Sector 39 police station against unidentified persons. Police officials revealed that although the accused had been identified in the video, the case was lodged against unknown persons as the liquor contractor hadn’t named them in his complaint.No evidenceAssistant superintendent of police (south) Shruti Arora confirmed that “around four more liquor contractors have approached us alleging extortion. However, they haven’t presented any evidence and we are verifying their complaints.”A notice will be sent to the crime branch on Wednesday to summon both the identified policemen, Arora addedThe matter came to light when the liquor contractor from Sector 40 (name withheld) approached the police with what he alleged was CCTV footage of policemen extorting money from his vends. He claimed that he was paying them Rs 96,000 per month for the past few months. Earlier too, inspector Ranjit Singh of the operations wing of the Chandigarh police had tried to extort Rs 2.5 lakh from a Sector 21 based liquor contractor. He was transferred to the police lines last week and a departmental inquiry initiated against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-liquor-vend-extortion-case-two-policemen-identified-in-cctv-footage/story-Io6uXSvzScWpYlEsMSCx5I.html

However, in its report, the HYMC mentioned that various discrepancies were found during the inspection. The information about these projects provided by the panchayat department, urban local bodies department and Haryana Sehri Vikas Pradhikaran was either not complete or incorrect. The urban local bodies department has been asked to provide names of officials, who provided misleading information, at the earliest.S Narayanan, member secretary of Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said, “ We need to collect the information from individual departments about these officials (who provided misleading information). We are also placing it as one of the agenda items for review at chief secretary level meeting which will be held soon”, he added.The committee also revised timelines for the projects of various departments which could not be completed in the action plans submitted to the National Green Tribunal.

01-12-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers’ protest: JJP suggests written assurance from Centre on MSP||The Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), the coalition partner of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana, on Tuesday suggested that the Centre should give a written assurance to the agitating farmers that the practice of procuring food grains on the minimum support price (MSP) will continue. “People holding high positions in the (Union) government have been repeatedly giving statements that the MSP regime will continue. Union agriculture minister has said so... Prime Minister has reiterated that the MSP will continue...then what is the harm in adding that line,” Ajay Singh Chautala, party chief and former MP, told reporters in Sirsa. Repeatedly referring to the farmers as “annadata” who he said is “very disturbed and sitting on the roads”, Chautala said the deadlock should be resolved at the earliest. “Everyone is facing problems, including the government, people...We have been urging the government to find out a solution to the problems of farmers,” he said. This is for the first time that the JJP, which primarily banks on the support of the farming community, has categorically demanded a written assurance from the Centre on MSP to break the logjam. Not only the farmers’ union leaders but the opposition parties too have been asking the Centre to include in the farm bills that the MSP will not be discontinued. The official stand of the JJP, so far, on the farms laws has been that there is no question of doing away with the MSP regime, that the farm laws are in favour of the peasants and that the Congress has been misleading the farmers. Right from the beginning of the unrest among the peasants over Centre’s three farm laws, the JJP has been walking a tight rope. The BJP has 40 MLAs in 90-member assembly and the JJP’s support is crucial even as there are five independent MLAs supporting the saffron party. The JJP has 10 MLAs and the pressure has been mounting on the party from its constituents the Jat community, predominantly the peasants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-protest-jjp-suggests-written-assurance-from-centre-on-msp/story-gMg3Jwlc0QTwUF0PCh7YFN.html

01-12-2020||Pune||Navale bridge accident: Drivers use neutral gear, or cut engine on slope to save fuel, observe traffic police||Pune: The Navale bridge stretch has turned into an accident prone spot as it sees a lot of speeding vehicles. The Pune traffic police have launched a study to spot check the road and come up with solutions to slow the traffic after three people died and six were seriously injured in the accident caused by a trailer whose driver lost control near the bridge on Sunday evening.The police have observed that drivers taking advantage of the slope shut down the engine to save fuel causing break failure and accidents. The authorities, a few months back, have put up roadside boards near Navale bridge alerting drivers to not shut engine or put on neutral gear. “This is a vulnerable spot as heavy vehicles speed from ‘dari pul’ bridge on the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway at Katraj and while entering the service road do not slow down as other vehicles are also moving on this stretch. One of the reasons for yesterday’s (Sunday) accident could be either shutting down the engine or driving on neutral gear. The driver finds a slope after ‘dari pul’ bridge and puts the vehicle either on neutral gear or shuts the engine to save fuel. So, when these heavy vehicles reach an exit to service road it either gets out of control or brakes don’t work leading to accidents,” said Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).Shrirame along with other senior officials of the Pune traffic police department conducted a review of the accident spot on Monday. They also spoke to the local residents.“We have installed boards appealing to drivers not to close down the engine or put on neutral gear. Now, we plan to making some changes in vehicular movement and infrastructure with the help of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on the stretch between ‘dari pul’ bridge and Navale bridge,” Shrirame said.Several residential areas, including Narhe, Ambegaon Budruk, Dhayari and Vadgaon Budruk are connected to this stretch.Nilesh Girme, Shiv Sena leader said, “Many residents pass through the service road used by the heavy vehicles. The administration should come up with a traffic solution as it has become an accident-prone spot.”Taking risk to save 3-4 litres of fuel Swapnil Pangare, area sales manager of KGP Auto Ltd, Ghatge Trucking BharatBenz said, “When a truck driver crosses the tunnel before the ‘dari pul’ bridge he puts the vehicle on neutral gear. When he nears Navale bridge, he starts applying brakes as other vehicles also enter this stretch. On neutral, the brake liners gets heated and sometimes causes brake failure. Turning engine off and on neutral gear could result into brakes getting oil drained. Power brakes will not function if the vehicle is switched off. Turning off engine can also lead to locking of steering. There is a brake control button in every heavy vehicle or truck which should be used by the driver on such slopes, but to save fuel of around three to four litres they take the risk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navale-bridge-accident-drivers-use-neutral-gear-or-stop-engine-at-slope-to-save-fuel-observe-traffic-police/story-Uwpf6fGYkuJNC3JX3Trj8I.html
01-12-2020||Pune||Pune district data: Average stay of patients on ventilators at 7.5 days, in ICU at 8.8 days||Pune: An analysis of the number of days Covid-19 patients spent on ventilators in ICUs shows that the average length of stay for patients in Pune, is higher than the state or national averages. The case fatality rate (CFR) in Pune district is similar to the national average, but lower than the state average. Doctors have said that a Covid-19 patient would probably stay longer on a ventilator in an ICU as compared to other ailments, as recovery is harder. Dr H K Sale, executive director of Noble Hospitals, said, “We have had patients who were on ventilators for almost 90 days, or in one case, for 43 days on an invasive ventilator and then 11 days on a non-invasive ventilator. The first patient could not survive while the second patient was successfully discharged. We have observed that once a Covid-19 patient enters the critical phase, it is extremely difficult for the person to recover. Initially, we also had a patient who landed at the hospital in a critical condition and had to be admitted right away in the ICU. In case of other infections, we usually have multiple sources of treatment and background information which we do not have in the case of Covid-19.” The study says that the average length of stay, in number of days, on a ventilator in Pune district is about 7.5 days; as against 5.5 days for the state and 6.9 days for the country. While for patients who are in ICU, the average length of stay, in number of days, for patients in ICU is 8.8 days for Pune district; 7.4 days for state and 8.7 days for the country. The average length of stay for patients who went into isolation is about 8.5 days in Pune, 7.8 days for the state average and 8.4 days for the country average. While for patients on oxygen-supported beds, the is 8 days in Pune which went up to 8.3 days for state average and 8.9 days for country average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/average-stay-of-covid-patients-on-ventilators-was-about-7-5-days-and-icu-was-8-8-days/story-MoLLL7NZXTS9ZTSZ7ie65I.html

The positivity rate among the migrants and refugees who returned from neighbouring city to Pune was higher than the (severe acute respiratory infection) SARI and (influenza-like illness) ILI patients found in flu clinics and who were hospitalised later. The study also found that over 40% of the symptomatic patients found in containment zones tested positive while over 56% of the symptomatic contacts of confirmed cases also tested positive for Covid. Pune had reported its first case on March 9 which was also the first case in the state of Covid. However, in the months of May and June, Mumbai reported a much higher surge in the number of cases than Pune. Pune rural which reported the first case and also the first case of local transmission also saw more newer cases coming in as migrants started returning to the city as most of the rural villages border the Pune-Mumbai highway. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO) said, “Pune rural had nominal Covid cases up until mid May, however, once the migrants started pouring in we saw newer cases coming in from the neighbouring cities, especially Mumbai, which saw a drastic rise during those months. Migrants came via road, in their own vehicles or even walking in some cases. We found that people walked the ‘kachcha rasta’ to get to their homes. Once things opened up we did not keep track of these cases as migrants or refugees.”Dr Abhijit More, public health expert said, “The health infrastructure of the city faced huge burden as the cases started spreading faster. The city’s hospitalisation could have Maharashtra’s average contact tracing for 20-25 which in Pune was only 10 for which the civic body was also rapped by the state government. Poor contact tracing even in the beginning led to the surge due to which Pune is now the worst-affected city in the country. Also, in the initial days itself experts from WHO and also our doctors from the task force warned about the upcoming threat and its intensity, but the administration chose to ignore the facts. The current huge number is because the administration did not contact trace the international passengers or the migrants.” The report also says that about 56% symptomatic contacts of confirmed cases tested positive for the infection while 22% of the asymptomatic contacts tested positive. Also indicating a higher prevalence in concentrated zones, the study states that about 41% of the symptomatic (ILI) patients in hotspot/ containment zones tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/migrants-to-pune-record-high-positivity-rate-than-sari-and-ili-patients/story-WbQ2BbFxStvSDA03Q3K26H.html
01-12-2020||Pune||Pune graduate and teacher constituency polls: Prestige fight for BJP, MVA faces its first real test||Pune: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Nationalist Congress Party-Congress-Shiv Sena alliance are all set for first major fight post formation of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government last year with both sides vying for maximum turnout. Till 10 am, Pune graduates’ constituency recorded 8.52% turnout while teachers’ constituency reported 11.38% turnout, according to the statistics shared by the administration. Among those who cast their vote in Pune was BJP Member of Parliament Girish Bapat, who claimed victory of party candidates. The Graduates and teachers’ constituency polls in Pune division as well as other parts of Maharashtra on Tuesday is a real electoral test for both the MVA constituents and the BJP, which has made the polls for five seats in the state prestigious by concentrating on the campaign, including one from teachers’ constituency in Amravati division and one each under graduate constituency in Nagpur and Aurangabad divisions. Elections for Member of Legislative Council from Dhule-Nandurbar local authorities constituency will also be held on Tuesday. Only two contestants – Amrish Patel from the BJP and Abhijeet Patil from the Congress are in the fray.For Pune graduates’ constituency polls, among 62 candidates, BJP’s Sangram Deshmukh is locked in direct fight with NCP nominee Arun Lad with backing from MVA. For Pune teachers’ constituency polls, the NCP has pitted Jayant Asgaonkar against an independent Jitendra Pawar, whom the BJP has supported. There are a total of 35 candidates in the fray for teacher constituency. The Aam Aadmi Party and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena have also nominated Amol Pawar and Roopali Patil respectively for graduate constituency polls, for which counting will takes place on December 3. A total of 5.25 lakh voters have registered for graduate constituency while 1.18 lakh will vote for teacher constituency polls.BJP’s top leaders, including former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and party state unit chief Chandrakant Patil campaigned for party candidate. “We are confident to retain the graduate constituency even as Sena, NCP and Congress have come together. For teacher constituency, we have extended support to Pawar,” said Patil, who has twice represented the seat in the past. Given that the electorate from at least four to five districts will participate for each constituency polls, the BJP has made the polls important enough to make it a verdict on the MVA as also Uddhav Thackeray’s governance. For Pune graduate and teachers constituency polls, voters from five districts – Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Solapur – will cast their votes. The BJP believes that favourable outcome in these polls will send a message that people are not supporting tripartite MVA government while the defeat of saffron party candidates’ would stave off the threat to the coalition in the immediate future, feel political observers. BJP union minister Raosaheb Danve had recently said, “The MVA government may last only for next two-three months. We are just waiting for legislative council polls to conclude.” The NCP and its allies are focusing more on rural parts of western Maharashtra to garner voter support. During the assembly polls last year, the NCP could win more seats from rural parts. NCP state unit chief Jayant Patil has personally campaigned and overseen the canvassing process for candidates with party chief Sharad Pawar and others also joining the campaign. “We are confident that both of our candidates will win the polls. The alliance with the Sena and the Congress will only prove as an added advantage,” Patil said at recent campaign meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-graduate-and-teacher-constituency-polls-prestige-fight-for-bjp-mva-faces-its-first-real-test/story-eVnUH215mXKCOWHynLBneN.html

01-12-2020||Chandigarh||Nephew, if liable to inherit property is bound to provide maintenance to senior citizen: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) has held that the nephew, who is in possession of the property of a senior citizen or liable to inherit his property, is bound to provide maintenance to him. The HC bench of justice GS Sandhawalia upheld the order passed by the Ambala deputy commissioner in the case of a 64-year-old Ambala resident, who is 100% disabled. The DC, acting as a tribunal under the Act, had dismissed the appeal of the nephew against the award of Rs 8,000 per month maintenance to the senior citizen since December 2018. The maintenance was awarded by the sub-divisional officer, Ambala, authority under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. “The factum of close relationship being a nephew has already been noticed and the fact that both the shop and house are in occupation of the petitioner (nephew). Once the petitioner is in possession of the property and liable to inherit the property after the death of the senior citizen, the section provides that maintenance can be claimed by a childless senior citizen as per Clause g of Section 2. Therefore, the argument of the counsel of the petitioner that the application was not maintainable in the absence of any relationship, is not made out,” the bench said. The petitioner nephew had approached high court in February 2020 after the DC’s order. He had argued that the tribunal be asked to pass the order afresh since he had not participated in the proceedings. It was also argued that the petitioner was not a relative being a nephew and, therefore, the tribunal could not have passed the award of maintenance. There are other relatives who are earning handsome income and the liability has only been fixed upon the nephew, the court was told. It was also informed that the uncle had shifted to Delhi and after 37 years returned to Ambala in the year 2017 and started quarrelling with them by claiming to be part of the a shop, being run by the petitioner on rent. The court found that the ancestral house was now owned by the nephew and the shop, taken on rent by the father of the senior citizen and his brother, where they too worked, and is now being run by the nephew. It was also found that the nephew was aware of the maintenance proceedings before the Tribunal in Ambala, but chose not to appear and it was decided ex-parte. The court observed that the authorities below have already found that the nephew is earning from the business of the shop. By keeping the senior citizen out of the shop, he is also debarring him from earning and getting the fruits from the said shop. Similarly, now the ancestral house was mutated in the name of the father of the nephew. “In such circumstances, the present petitioner would come under the purview of Section 2 (g) of the 2007 Act and liability to maintain the respondent No.3 (senior citizen) would fall upon him. Accordingly, the orders passed by the authorities below cannot be held to be unjustified in any manner, which would warrant interference by this Court,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nephew-if-liable-to-inherit-property-is-bound-to-provide-maintenance-to-senior-citizen-hc/story-Gh2shgeSkmRvDioGtCJQfP.html

The Ropar MLA announced his return to the party fold in Delhi where he was welcomed by AAP legislature party leader Harpal Singh Cheema, Punjab affairs in-charge Jarnail Singh and party legislators from the state. “I tender my sincere apologies to the party high command and state leadership, who were devastated by my decision to quit the AAP. I undertake to work for the party like a tireless volunteer without any ambition for party post of position,” Sandoa said in a post on social media. SAYS AMARINDER FAILED TO FULFIL POLL PROMISES Sandoa also said that he was ashamed of his decision to join the Congress in a tearing hurry. “Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has done nothing for the people of Punjab. All sections are bearing the brunt of his anti-people stance. Before assuming power in 2017, Amarinder had peddled promises, like crushing the drug mafia within weeks, ghar-ghar naukri (jobs for every household), complete loan waiver to farmers among a host of others, which have remained unfulfilled,” he said in a statement. LEFT AAP DAYS BEFORE 2019 LOK SABHA ELECTIONS Sandoa, who stayed in the party during the infighting that saw several MLAs turn against the leadership, had joined the Congress on May 4, days before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The rebel AAP MLA was welcomed into the party by Amarinder. He is the second rebel AAP MLA to return to the party. Jaitu legislator Baldev Singh, who left the AAP in July 2018, after the leadership unceremoniously removed Bholath MLA legislator Sukhpal Singh Khaira from the post of leader of opposition, also returned to the party in October last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rebel-punjab-mla-amarjit-sandoa-back-in-aap-fold/story-WVqFWoIu63C9VrfFQHhJJJ.html

Punjab’s farmer organisations are spearheading the agitation opposing the new farm laws passed in Parliament that liberalise agriculture and have descended on the borders of Delhi since November 27, seeking a repeal of the laws that they claim are not in farmers’ interest.

Rapid antigen tests, however, are often inaccurate when it comes to so-called false negatives, or giving negative results to people who may be Covid-positive.According to an order issued by Delhi’s health department, while RT-PCR tests at all private laboratories and hospitals will cost Rs 800, and home collection of samples will be conducted at Rs 1,200. Until Sunday, the cost of an RT-PCR test was capped at Rs 2,400 irrespective of whether a person visited a laboratory or opted for home collection. The changes came into effect after the order was issued on Monday afternoon, and most private labs calibrated their systems by early evening.Covid-19 tests at all government facilities in Delhi will continue to be free, the government said. “I have directed that the rates of RT-PCR tests be reduced in Delhi. Whereas tests are being conducted free of cost in government establishments, however, this will help those who get their tests done in private labs,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Monday.A record 69,051 tests, including 33,147 RT-PCR tests, were conducted on Friday. The Centre announced on November 17 that it planned to double the testing capacity to 100,000-120,000 by the month end, with a focus on increasing RT-PCR tests in the Capital. Though RT-PCR tests have consistently been scaled up in the city over the past fortnight, the plan to double testing is yet to materialise.Monday’s order mandated all labs and hospitals to display the revised rates at prominent places within their premises by Tuesday for awareness among the people. It also reminded all private stakeholders involved in Covid-19 testing to ensure that the processing of samples, sharing of reports with the clients and updating all reports in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal is done within 24 hours of the collection of the sample. On June 18, the Delhi government capped the price of all Covid-19 tests at private labs at ₹2,400. The decision was taken at a Delhi Disaster Management Authority meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, and attended by Kejriwal, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot and other top officials from the Delhi Police, administration and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Prior to the ₹2,400 cap, the cost of a Covid-19 test was ₹4,500 if the private labs collected the sample and used their own kits; ₹3,500 if the government collected the samples and the private labs used their kits to test it; and ₹2,200 if the government collected the sample and provided the test kit as well. While the government paid these charges to the private labs, residents across Delhi were charged a flat rate of ₹4,500.“The government should have consulted with the private laboratories before capping prices; we are with the government during the crisis. The prices that have been fixed are workable. The price for kits has reduced over time. Initially, when the test prices were capped at ₹4,500, there were probably five suppliers; now we have 50 and they are offering competitive prices,” said Dr Arvind Lal, chairman of the Dr Lal PathLabs.Dr Deepak Sadhwani, head of Prognosis Laboratories, said: “The prices are fair and will allow us to work with a narrow margin. The only issue that I find would be one of billing. The order says that we can charge patients ₹800 at the collection centre or at hospitals but ₹1,200 if we go home. The charges for all samples collected by the government should have been ₹800 and all samples collected privately ₹1,200; if a phlebotomist collects a sample from home and tells me it has been collected from a hospital, I will have to believe them. And, it will be a loss for the laboratories.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-lowers-cap-rt-pcr-tests-for-rs-800-at-private-labs/story-KjGKkkciQd3N3EixSFL1EK.html
01-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Meet the lonely man||From a distance, he looks like a dot in the world. The sprawling ground has only this man. He is sitting quietly on the edge of a pavement.It’s a cold, smoggy evening. The plaza facing Dilli Gate used to be filled with clusters of pigeons in the pre-Covid times. A handful of bird-food sellers would sit here and there while a continuous stream of customers would stop by to buy grains, which they would throw at the fat birds enjoying the free buffet. But now, there are no sellers and no birds. The head of a leader’s statue, standing in the middle, is bare. In better times, there would always be a bird perched on it.The man has wrapped himself in a shawl. He is unmasked. His solemn face shows great calmness, as if he were free of all worries. Which is surprising, knowing that he recently got his rickshaw stolen.“It happened a few nights ago,” mutters Sanjay. He explains that he was sleeping, as always, on a pavement near Gandhi Nagar Market while his rickshaw was parked beside him. “When I woke up in the morning, the rickshaw was gone.”Sanjay didn’t approach the cops. “I’ll have to get a new rickshaw someday soon... I don’t know how, I have no money.” He smiles faintly and turns to look at the evening rush hour traffic moving sluggishly on the road ahead. “This city has many people... I have no friend here.”And what about his other possessions? He surely has more clothes, for instance, than what he is wearing at the moment?Sanjay’s face shows no expressions.“I have my family’s phone number.” He draws out a small paper chit from his pocket. “This is my most keemti (valuable) samaan (possession).”Sanjay himself owns no mobile. “Whenever I have to talk to my family, I go to a shopkeeper in Gandhi Nagar market, who gives me his mobile phone to talk to my wife.”Sanjay’s folks live in a village near Kanpur, in UP.“Someday I will go back home to Kanpur, or I will go back sooner if I don’t find a new rickshaw.”Responding to a query he confirms he has no cash with him “but I always get lunch and dinner... there are people who distribute food for free to the needy.”He now falls quiet while a great number of mosquitoes gather upon his head. From a distance, it appears as if the lonesome man were wearing a hazy crown.Soon it gets dark, but Sanjay continues sitting on the bird-less plaza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-meet-the-lonely-man/story-K3My1O4PqHZCvqAGvi9g6J.html

01-12-2020||Lucknow||2nd ‘love jihad’ case filed in UP||Uttar Pradesh Police have lodged a second case under the new law promulgated to punish forced religious conversions in India’s most populous state.This first information report (FIR), a copy of which is in HT’s possession, was filed on Monday against a man identified as Tahir Hussain and his brothers, Sagir and Munna, under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance. The complainant is a resident of Izzat Nagar police station limits in Bareilly district.The first FIR too was lodged in Bareilly on November 28, hours after the ordinance received governor Anandiben Patel’s assent. The state cabinet cleared the ordinance earlier this month, targeting what many right-wing groups term “love jihad”, which involves Muslim men marrying Hindu women with the aim of changing the latter’s religion after marriage. According to the ordinance, such marriages will be declared null and void. Additional director general of police, Bareilly zone, Avinash Chandra confirmed that the FIR was registered at Izzat Nagar police station and an investigation was underway.According to the FIR, the victim has been in a relationship with Tahir Hussain since November 2019. They started living together after getting married in a temple, the FIR said. When the woman became pregnant in November this year, she urged Hussain to get their marriage registered in court.. The FIR also said that when the woman urged family members of Hussain to get their marriage registered in court, her husband and his brothers assaulted her on November 20, resulting in an abortion. In the FIR, the victim also alleged that Hussain told her that he did not want to marry her, but that he believed in “love jihad” and making a Hindu girl pregnant. The victim alleged that Hussain lured her by promising to marry her, but continued to rape her, the FIR said.The first FIR under the new law was lodged by Tikram Rathore against Owais Ahmad. Both belonged to Sharifnagar village of Bareilly district. Rathore had complained in the FIR that Ahmad was pressuring his daughter to convert to Islam. They were not married, but had known each other from their college days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/2nd-love-jihad-case-filed-in-up/story-yVBUc9xMU9K1WSDVGXoQ0I.html

The accused, 28-year-old Irshad Khan was arrested under sections 3, 4 and 5 of the 1968 Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act 1968 and section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (harassment or cruelty), said Mukesh Bais, additional superintendent of police. “The 27-year-old woman lodged a complaint on Sunday that she married Irshad Khan in 2018 but after two years, Khan started pressurising her to read Namaz and adapt to the Islam culture. When the woman refused to do so, Khan started physically harassing her,” said the ASP. Khan rejected the charges and said his wife was giving a communal taint to a personal issue .”Before our marriage, the woman had given a statement before the magistrate that she was aware of my religion and she wanted to marry me. We had a Nikah but now she is levelling baseless charges,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/muslim-man-held-in-mp-for-forcing-wife-to-adopt-islam/story-4IJKrZcDCSWComuBebT79K.html

President of the RWA, Colonel (retd) Gursewak Singh, said, “Even after safai karamcharis ended their strike, hardly any worker has come to our area.”Singh added that there was a dearth of safai karamcharis in their area. “A few years earlier, MHC was provided with 48 workers. Today their strength has been reduced to 30 while their area of responsibility has been increased to include Govindpura and Marriwalla town as well as the new vendor market.”General secretary of the RWA SA Qureshi added, “Even streetlights are not functioning properly and at night many patches of the area are completely dark. There is a lack of coordination among the MC, the administration and a private company over their upkeep. One agency needs to be made responsible and there needs to be one window for complaints.” The local area councillor here, Jagtar Singh Dhillon, who is also the deputy mayor of the MC, said, “From among the 30 sanitation workers, some of them have gone on leave due to Covid. I will raise this issue in the House that all 48 designated for this area be reconstituted.” He added that he will also speak to the residents regarding the streetlights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/modern-housing-complex-residents-decry-poor-sanitation-faulty-streetlights/story-lQ6YjRZ5FWLTRSWk3VoGkL.html
01-12-2020||City||Transporters, commuters on the receiving end of farmers’ protest||The continued blockade of the main highways connecting several northern states to the national capital Delhi has left commuters high and dry.Due to the farmers’ indefinite protests, most of the regular commuters are avoiding travelling to Delhi, and those who have no other option, are facing several difficulties in reaching the National Capital. Hundreds of goods carriers are lined up on the slip roads of NH-44 as the drivers are waiting for the blockade to be lifted to resume their journey. “We were taking ply-boards to Delhi from Yamunanagar. We have decided to wait here as it is difficult to travel Delhi due to the protests,” said Gurdial Singh, a truck driver sitting on a roadside dhaba near Karnal.Since there is no clarity on how long the blockade of the two main highways of NH 1 and NH 10 will continue, people are hesitant to take these routes.“On a regular day, over 40,000 vehicles pass the NH-44. But in the last three days, there has been a 50% decline in the movement of vehicles on this highway,” said an employee of Bastara toll plaza, on the condition of anonymity.He said that not only private vehicles, commercial vehicles have also been affected due to the blockade on Haryana-Delhi border.With the state government banning the movement of roadways’ buses from Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, especially at a time when the movement of trains is already restricted due to the pandemic, the regular travelers are the most affected. “Yes there is a big impact of this blockade on small traders, especially the traders of electronics goods as most electronics items come from Delhi,” said Harish Dhawan an electronics shopkeeper from Yamunanagar.Police officials deputed to monitor the traffic on highways said that due to the blockade of NH 1 from Rai in Sonepat to Singhu border, most commuters are traveling via Eastern Peripheral Expressway and Kundli Manesar Expressway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/transporters-commuters-on-the-receiving-end-of-farmers-protest/story-A4v0acdG4viE4w0BI0QTFM.html
01-12-2020||City||Ready for the long haul, say farmers at Haryana-Delhi borders||Farmers gathered at the Tikri and Kundli-Singhu borders for the last five days say they are ready for the long battle against the government if their demands are not met.Addressing a press conference at the Singhu border, farmer leaders said there is no scope for talks with the Union government until their fellows sitting at Burari ground are not freed. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni)’s Haryana unit chief Gurnam Singh Charuni said, “Earlier, the Union government had asked us to appear for talks on a conditional basis but now they are calling for unconditional talks. The government’s intention is not clear as they are not giving us anything on paper. The Prime Minister should listen to farmers’ Mann Ki Baat.”Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav said this is not an agitation of Punjab farmers alone. “Farmers from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Kerala and other states are also joining our protest. The government is making all attempts to break this agitation and even calling us middlemen. We will appear for a dialogue only after a meeting with all unions from every state,” added Yadav.The farm leaders also urged Haryana residents to block all routes to Delhi so as to stop the supply of essential goods.“We want to apologise to the residents of Delhi for planning to stop the supply of essential items. But our problem will be looked into only if we stop the supply of vegetables, milk and other goods,” the farm leaders said.Farmers have currently blocked national highway-71 near Safiyabad by parking their tractors in the middle of the road, besides another highway which connects Delhi via Gurugram. Jhajjar police have issued an advisory for commuters looking to reach Delhi. They have been asked to come via Najafgarh from Bahadurgarh, from Badsa to Ghalibpur, and via Faruknagar in Gurugram to Delhi. People have been asked to avoid the Tikri border completely.Earlier in the day, farmers offered prayers on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti and distributed ‘prasad’ among each other and security personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ready-for-the-long-haul-say-farmers-at-haryana-delhi-borders/story-efDsg6qD3WMqKoVQDwX42I.html

As far as deaths are concerned, November witnessed a dip in fatalities with Panchkula logging 14 deaths, 11% of the total death toll (127) reported so far. In October, 27 deaths were reported. Covid-19 nodal officer for Panchkula district, Dr Rajiv Narwal, said, “Due of the festive season, people didn’t follow Covid-19 norms like wearing masks and ensuring social distancing. They did not even come for testing, which allowed the infection to spread faster. Winter is also one of the reasons.”He said the health department has increased sampling. “Daily, 900-1,000 samples are taken and on Saturday, the number was more than 3,000. The purpose is to trace the hidden cases, which are now emerging,” he said. The rise in Covid cases is also causing troubles for those in need of beds. “Bed occupancy is increasing at private medical facilities. Private hospitals are almost full and in another one week, so will the civil hospital,” Narwal said, adding that in such circumstances, a “surge plan” will be implemented, wherein 150 beds out of 300 kept for non-Covid ailments will also be used for Covid patients.The weekly report of new cases shows a spike in the second week of November. However, cases witnessed a gradual decline by the fourth week. While 293 cases were reported in the first week, the count increased to 419 by second week, declined a bit to 408 in the third week and to 345 by the fourth week. The last two days of November witnessed 82 cases.Till date, Panchkula has registered 8,697 total cases, out of which 487 are active, while 127 people have succumbed to the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-cases-jump-34-in-november-in-panchkula/story-K167DmVsr8jZvx3DrOOr3L.html
01-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC’s ₹20-crore public toilet renovation project hits dead end||The dilapidated condition of public toilets, which fall under the ambit of Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC), is unlikely to improve in the near future.First, the UT administration refused to fund the ₹20-crore project involving construction of 29 new toilets and renovation of 236 existing ones. Now, with even the MC General House saying no to foot the bill for the time being, the ambitious project has hit a dead end.The MC had brought an agenda in the November 27 General House meeting seeking its approval for the release of funds sought for the project. The councillors, however, deferred the issue to “a more appropriate time in future”. The MC is facing acute fund crunch and struggling to meet its routine expenditure like paying of employees’ salaries.In bad shapeThe public toilets in many residential and market areas, constructed a long time ago, are in urgent need of renovation. Charanjiv Singh, chairman of the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, said, “The toilets require renovation on priority basis. Some having been built several years ago have broken tiles, or water leaking from the roof, or in general are in bad condition. We have taken up the issue with the MC and are pushing for renovation work to be taken up as soon as possible.”The condition of the public toilets is even worse in the city’s colonies and villages. There are no local maintenance committees in place for their routine upkeep.In addition to improving the condition of the toilets, the MC was also hoping to generate revenue through advertisements in the better-designed spaces, which could have made the structures financially self-sustainable.“One of the necessary infrastructure and regulatory conditions added this year in the ODF++ protocol, under the Swachh Bharat Mission, stipulates that there should be a sustainable financing mechanism from public toilets. MC has to make earnest efforts towards generating revenue from toilet premises. Space has to be earmarked for advertising,” said Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations (CFORWO).Pinning hopes on CSRMaheshinder Singh Sidhu, councillor and member of the sanitation committee, said, “We have suggested that the MC should explore the option of generating funds under the smart city project. The Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) has already constructed some public toilets in the city.”Though the MC commissioner and chief executive officer KK Yadav said CSCL will work on the House’s suggestion, he added that it had exhausted its funds on the issue.The House also suggested that the MC could also consider approaching business houses under corporate social responsibility (CSR). “Some companies have earlier contributed to some of the projects and the MC can again seek their help,” Sidhu added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-s-20-crore-public-toilet-renovation-project-hits-dead-end/story-K6ityZllt2A6loBBzUoR8H.html
01-12-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 situation under control, need to watch till mid-December: Mumbai civic body||A rise in infections, without a sharp spike, suggests the Covid-19 situation is in control post Diwali, say Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, however, insisting the need to watch it till mid-December. Between November 1 and 28, 23,476 cases were reported, compared to 46,620 cases during the same period in October. According to data, 3.68 lakh tests were conducted between October 1 and 28, compared to 3.48 lakh tests in the same period during November. In the same period, the case positivity rate came down from 12% to 6%. The daily number of Covid-19 cases, however, has risen to 1,000, from the range of 500 earlier this month before Diwali. “In the past 15 days, the testing has gone up, and we have also witnessed a little surge in the daily cases being reported. With the increase in testing, we will have to wait and watch at least till December 15 to understand better the post-Diwali surge,” a BMC official said. Further, the fatality rate has come down from October 1 to 28 (1,224 deaths), to 529 during the same period during November. According to BMC officials, the testing had gone down in November in the city owing to Diwali and festive mood. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, said, “The testing went down in first half of November, but has improved in the second half. The next few weeks are crucial as we aim to maximise testing by setting up 244 testing centres and taking other initiatives to test citizens. Apart from this, our surveillance at railway stations has increased. We are testing BEST drivers, offices, street vendors, which has pushed up the testing count.” However, Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based doctor, said, “Cases might have gone down because testing has also gone down. The positivity rate may have gone down due to increased use of rapid antigen kits, which have lower positivity rate in comparison to RT-PCR kits. I do not feel there is any period in the coming days that is crucial. All I can say that until we have a vaccine, everything is crucial. We have to continue with our Covid-19-appropriate behaviour.” Meanwhile, on Monday, the city reported 646 new cases, taking the tally to 283,467; 19 deaths took the toll to 10,884. Further, 256,303 patients have been discharged . The city’s discharge rate is 90.41%. The city has 15,473 active cases in Mumbai and fatality rate is 3.83%. Dharavi recorded only nine new cases. Dharavi’s tally is 3,692, of whom 3,361 have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-situation-under-control-need-to-watch-till-mid-december-mumbai-civic-body/story-WTefJxsGXKIM9Nt3j6upYN.html

01-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: BJP planning to shift Bollywood to Uttar Pradesh, says Congress||In the wake of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s proposed Mumbai visit later this week, the Congress has alleged it as Bharatiya Janata Party’s conspiracy to take Bollywood away to the northern state from Mumbai. The Congress has also alleged that there was possibility of threats to industrialists and film producers about shifting their base to Uttar Pradesh.Sachin Sawant, Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson, said that like Prime Minister Narendra Modi shifted the International Finance Services Centre to Gujarat from Mumbai, the UP CM is trying to take Bollywood away from Mumbai. “Yogiji is meeting industrialists and producers in Mumbai for investment in UP. The BJP has been trying to create fear in Bollywood by using central investigating agencies like the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for the past few months. UP CM Yogi has been on the forefront to defame Maharashtra with the help of the Central government. This is a systematic attempt of reducing the importance of Mumbai, the financial capital of the country. The Thackeray government should take steps to protect the Bollywood from the conspiracy,” he said. Sawant said the UP CM should put in efforts to make the environment in his state conducive for investment instead of conspiring destabilising other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bjp-planning-to-shift-bollywood-to-uttar-pradesh-says-congress/story-evZPQ9V8EB8x9wCS44odxJ.html
01-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body records 3% positivity rate at free Covid-19 testing centres||The 244 free Covid-19 testing centres started by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) are getting good response. Since its inauguration in November first week, more than one lakh citizens have voluntarily gotten themselves tested, of whom 3% were found to carry the pathogen of Covid-19. With the intention to bring testing facilities to the doorsteps of the citizen, the civic body started centre across all 24 wards. The addresses of the centres can be accessed by calling the toll free number — 1916 — run by BMC’s main control room, and on the dedicated Covid-19 website. The centre conducts both reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid antigen tests.Any individual who develops symptoms of Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, or has come in contact with an infected patient can undertake undergo the tests at these centres free of cost.Classical Covid-19 symptoms include fever, cough, cold, difficulty in breathing and pneumonia.“Individuals can walk-in to any nearby centre and undergo the test which is free of cost. This has encouraged people to undergo tests. But we have seen that the positivity rate is only 3%, which is much lesser than the city’s cumulative positivity rate,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.Due to the rise in the number of daily Covid-19 testing which has increased to over 17,000, the positivity rate has dropped from 16% to 15% on November 28. Health activists have welcomed the civic body’s initiative. Dr Ravikant Singh, a health activist, said, “Either civic hospitals, which provide free testing, were far off or individuals couldn’t afford the expenses at private laboratories. So, this has given an affordable solution to the people near their houses.”The state government has already reduced the rates of tests conducted at private laboratories. A test at a private lab now costs ₹1,400 while a sample taken from home is charged ₹1,800.In the next phase, BMC will start testing domestic maids, security guards, delivery boys who are most exposed, and therefore, vulnerable to the public and can turn into super spreaders. “We have already started testing public vehicle drivers along with vegetable vendors,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-records-3-positivity-rate-at-free-covid-19-testing-centres/story-el43BOq2VXLbhpuV7q7ZsI.html
01-12-2020||Mumbai||HIV screening drops by 65% amid Covid-19 pandemic: Mumbai District AIDS Control Society||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has taken a back seat. On the eve of the World Aids Day, observed on December 1, data shared by the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) has revealed that between April and October, there has been a decline of around 65% in the tests conducted for HIV infection in the city as compared to the pre-pandemic period. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, MDACS used to screen more than 32,000 people, including suspected patients and individuals from groups vulnerable to infection such as truck drivers, sex workers, prisoners, members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, for HIV infections every month. However, in the past seven months, MDACS has tested only around 11,000 people each month for the virus. Between April and October, a total of 83,190 people have been tested for HIV, of whom, 803 have been found infected with the virus. “The outpatient departments (OPDs) in hospitals were closed in the first three months of the lockdown. Only the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres and fever clinics were open. Due to the lockdown, people couldn’t visit hospitals, which led to delay in screening,” said Dr Srikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS, adding that after the relaxation of the lockdown norms, the situation has gotten better.Raising concerns over the issue, health activists have said that a delay in diagnosis can be life threatening for people living with HIV. “Due to the pandemic, the screening of suspected patients has largely been affected. But the civic-body can’t be held responsible for it. Generally, when a person develops symptoms, they go to a hospital. After preliminary examination, doctors prescribe them for the test. During the lockdown, patients couldn’t go to hospitals. Also, many avoided going to hospitals due to the fear of contracting Covid-19 infection too,” said Ganesh Acharya, who is an HIV activist. Decline in new HIV infections in 5 yearsThe city’s fight against HIV is showing results as the number of patients diagnosed with the virus has decreased drastically in the past five years.In 2015-16, as many as 7,592 new patients with HIV infection were diagnosed. However, despite increasing the annual testing from 2.8 lakh in 2015-16 to 4.8 lakh in 2019-20, the number of newly infected patients fell to 4,473.HIV causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition that weakens the body’s ability to fight infections. The virus can be transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen or vaginal fluids.So far, there is no cure for the disease. But if patients follow the antiretroviral regimens (ARVs), it can drastically lead to slowing of the progress of the illness by repairing the body’s immunity system.As per MDACS, unprotected sex is the main reason for the transmission of the virus among people.The society has started a new campaign named ‘Mitawaa’ for adolescents living with HIV.“Often children of HIV-infected parents are born with the infection. Even though we start their medicines from the first day of their birth, they begin refusing it once they start growing up. Also, they slip into depression. So we have decided to counsel the infected children regularly at ART centres,” said Dr Acharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hiv-screening-in-mumbai-drops-by-65-amid-covid-19-pandemic-mumbai-district-aids-control-society/story-ASA856horKM885vzhrvAcO.html
01-12-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena leader from south Mumbai announces azaan contest; BJP questions party over Hindutva||Shiv Sena’s south Mumbai zonal head (vibhag pramukh) Pandurang Sakpal’s announcement to hold azaan chanting competition – on the lines of Bhagvad Gita chanting competition – has stirred a controversy, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accusing its ally-turned-enemy Sena of shedding Hindutva, advocated by the late Bal Thackeray, for the sake of vote politics. Azaan is the call to ritual prayer made by muezzin from the minaret of a mosque. Sakpal, who is believed to be close confidant of party’s chief spokesperson and MP Sanjay Raut, announced the competition for school-going Muslim students from south Mumbai. He said azaan chanting sounds melodious and he always has been curious about it. “Many students from the community chant azaan very skilfully. I think the competition is first-of-its-kind. It is an age-old tradition among Muslims and nobody should oppose it. Azaan is as holy as mahaarati among Hindus,” he said. He said the competition was being organised by the Shiv Sena and prizes will be given out to the winners selected by a panel of maulanas. The BJP, however, attacked the Sena for “deviating from its ideology after forging an alliance with the Congress for the sake of power”. Leader of Opposition in legislative Council and party leader Pravin Darekar said, “Sakpal has given Balasaheb Thackeray’s reference while advocating his attempt of appeasement of Muslims. Balasaheb has always targeted minorities for their ideology. He had opposed the use of loudspeakers in masjids for namaaz. Today, the party has messed with Hindutva for the sake of vote bank. Sakpal is known to be a close confidant of Sena leader Sanjay Raut, who has been compromising with the fundamental ideology of the party just to save the government from falling.” After the backlash and criticism, Sakpal issued a statement in the evening stating, “The competition was organised by Foundation For You, one of the NGOs in Mumbadevi constituency. After the officebearer approached me, I told them to not hold the competition by congregating children as it would have led to violation of the Covid-19 guidelines. Following it, they decided to hold it online. There was no religious or political aspect to it and I do request all to not politicise it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-leader-from-south-mumbai-announces-azaan-contest-bjp-questions-party-over-hindutva/story-a3ZG0oBjZOhOBxZXILpfMI.html
01-12-2020||Delhi||As daily Covid-19 cases decline, 10k+ hospital beds free in Delhi||With the Delhi government having increased the number of beds earmarked for the treatment of patients with Covid-19 and the number of daily cases on the decline, 10,596 Covid-19 beds were vacant in hospitals across the city, according to Monday’s health bulletin. On Monday, Delhi reported 3,726 new cases and 108 deaths due to Covid-19. The number of deaths in a single day crossed the 100-mark again after five days, with 108 fatalities on the day. Even as tests dropped on Monday’s bulletin, which logs data from the previous day, on account of the weekend, the positivity rate stayed lower than 8%, in a sign that the third wave of infections may be on the wane in the Capital.Of 50,670 tests conducted on Sunday, more than half (52.6%) used the more accurate RT-PCR method, and of the total samples collected, 7.35% tested positive. This is the first time since the cheaper and faster alternative rapid antigen test had been deployed in mid-June that the ratio has tipped in favour of RT-PCR tests. “An RT-PCR is a much more sensitive test, and is likely to pick up more cases than the rapid antigen test. It is good that the government is scaling up the molecular tests, but there will always be some people — especially those asymptomatic — who will get missed out. The best way to prevent infections is to assume everyone has it and behave accordingly — wear masks, maintain social distance, and wash hands frequently. There could be an increase in cases as the temperature drop because people are likely to huddle up indoors increasing the opportunity for transmission,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious disease at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The overall number of hospitalisations on Sunday dropped to 8,098 across hospitals in the Capital. As on Monday evening, only 43% of all Covid-19 beds were occupied and almost 70% of the intensive care unit (ICU) beds were occupied, as per the government’s Delhi Corona app. The ICU occupancy had gone up to 86%, prompting the government to ask its own hospitals to increase ICU beds as well as reserving 80% ICU beds in around 75 big hospitals in the city. “The number of new admissions have started going down, especially those patients arriving in a serious condition,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak hospital, Delhi’s largest Covid-19 treatment facility. “The disease is unpredictable, but with so many people having had the infection, it is unlikely we will see such a huge surge in cases. New cases are likely to be reported from smaller pockets in the city where people haven’t had the infection so far,” he said. It will take some time for these numbers to reflect in one of the big private hospitals. “Our ICUs are still running at capacity and even the wards are full. This is because we had long waiting lists of people and we get patients referred from smaller centres as well. However, seeing that the number of cases in the city are on the decline, it is likely that we will start seeing the decline in some time too,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head of the department of pulmonology at Fortis, Shalimar Bagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-daily-covid-19-cases-decline-10k-hospital-beds-free-in-delhi/story-TQQFLmACmE1xBx9SyrSogM.html
01-12-2020||Delhi||Pollution in November 2020 up from last year, shows CPCB data||The average pollution levels this November, when air quality was a dip due to a combination of factors such as farm fires, firecracker bursting on Diwali and adverse meteorological conditions, were higher than last year during the same time.An analysis of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) air quality data shows that the monthly average air quality index (AQI) this November was 327.9, as compared to 312.2 in November 2019. However, it was slightly better than the monthly average of 334.9 in 2018, 360.93 in 2017 and 374.06 in 2016.This November saw nine ‘severe’ air quality days, as compared to seven last year. Also this year, Delhi had six consecutive ‘severe’ days from November 5-10, the longest ‘severe’ spell seen in the city since 2016. Besides, only two ‘moderate’ air days were recorded this year -- November 17 (171) and November 27 (137). In November 2019, three ‘moderate’ days were seen -- November 27 (134), November 28 (106), November 30 (193) -- as well as a ‘satisfactory’ day (84) on November 29. While the year 2018 saw one ‘moderate’ day on November 4 with an AQI reading of 171, the years 2017 and 2016 did not record a single ‘moderate’ day.On Monday, the average air quality index (AQI) plunged to ‘very poor’ after remaining in the ‘poor’ to ‘moderate’ range over the past three days. The average AQI on Sunday was 256. It was 231 on Saturday and 137 on Friday.According to experts, a combination of factors playing up at the same time was behind the high pollution levels this November, including a prolonged and intensive stubble burning season that coincided with firecracker bursting and unfavourable meteorological conditions.“This year, farm fires started early on and continued till late November. The number of fires was much higher than last year. Besides, last year, Diwali was early (October 27) as compared to this year (November 14). This season starting from October itself was drier, as compared to last year. Only one instance of rainfall was seen this November, which helped clear the post-Diwali pollution. All these factors combined contributed to higher particulate matter (PM) concentration this time,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).V K Soni of the India Meteorological department’s environment research centre, said this October -November, the number of fire counts were at least 50% more than last year. Besides, a late Diwali impacted the air quality. “All these factors, with meteorological conditions not being favourable for dispersal at the same time, did not allow the pollutants accumulated in the air to disperse. Since the accumulation was higher, it took longer to disperse, resulting in a long spell of bad air,” said Soni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pollution-in-november-2020-up-from-last-year-shows-cpcb-data/story-34vLB8FK1dAgcFazV69jEJ.html
01-12-2020||Delhi||Tihar undertrial stabbed to death after argument over watching TV||A 23-year-old undertrial prisoner at Tihar jail was stabbed to death by three others on Monday morning after an argument over watching television the previous day. Police said the man was stabbed multiple times with an improvised sharp weapon. The prisoner who died was identified as Dilsher, a resident of Jahangirpuri, who was lodged in jail number three and was under trial in a murder case. He was in jail since June 11, 2019.Police said they got information around 9:30 am that an under trial prisoner who was attacked by three others following a quarrel was pronounced dead at the central jail hospital at 7.25 am.Preliminary enquiry revealed Dilsher and the three men had fought on Sunday after an argument over watching television. “The argument was resolved on Sunday by other prisoners and jail staff. On Monday morning, the trio found Dilsher alone and attacked him with a sharp, improvised metallic weapon and stabbed him multiple times. Other prisoners alerted the jail staff. Dilsher was rushed to a hospital inside the jail where he was pronounced dead. The matter was reported to the local police,” said a senior police officer who wished not to be named. Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said all three prisoners have been booked for murder. “The crime spot was inspected. Post-mortem reports of the man are awaited,” he said.Sandeep Goel, director general, Delhi prisons, said Dilsher was an undertrial prisoner lodged in a murder case. “His family members were informed and legal action is being taken,” Goel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tihar-undertrial-stabbed-to-death-after-argument-over-watching-tv/story-9FgL4P7QHPc9uD3yJ7dozM.html
01-12-2020||Delhi||Declare results of those who were marked zero in OBE, HC tells DU||The Delhi high court has directed the Delhi University to declare results on or before December 20 of several final-year undergraduate students who had alleged that they were either marked absent, or given zero entirely in their open book examination. The court said the students must submit their application on or before November 30, in writing to the respective nodal officer in the college and inform them about the date of submission of the answer script.On November 26, while hearing a plea seeking declaration of the results, the Delhi University told the court that the students had shared answer sheets through Google Drive and they were not available with the centralised IT department as the drives required access. Hence, such students were marked absent or zero marks were awarded.The varsity told justice Pratibha M Singh that when students informed that the answer scripts were sent to the nodal officers, a notification was issued on November 19 by the Dean (Examinations) asking such students to write to the respective nodal officer in the college and inform the about the date of submission of the answer script.“It is only in the case of such students that the nodal officer would have to get the answer script evaluated and have the result of the students sent to the EDP Cell of the examination wing,” the university said.On specific query from the court, Professor DS Rawat, Dean of Examination, told the court that the evaluation of these answer scripts would have to be done immediately. He assured the court that now a specific time limit would be prescribed to conclude the evaluation, considering that almost 3-4% of students are affected, who have been either marked absent or whose result has been declared as zero. However, no date has been fixed for the declaration of their result.Following this, the court said, “Considering the timelines as communicated by Prof Rawat, it is directed that, insofar as such students who have already written to the nodal officer and brought it to their notice that they have been was marked absent or their result is awaited/declared zero, if they submit their application in terms of the November 19 notification on or before November 30, 2020, to the respective nodal officers in their colleges, their result would be declared on or before December 20, 2020”.The court directed that those students who find any discrepancy in their results can apply to the nodal officers by December 10 and within 15 days, thereafter, their results shall also be declared. The judge also asked DU to file an affidavit placing on record the course-wise list of number of students who have been marked absent/zero and whose result has now been converted to ‘awaited’ category before the next date of hearing.The high court was hearing various students’ grievances that the results of their final year exams, which were conducted in August, have not been declared yet and due to which they are unable to join higher studies. The students had also moved the court on the erroneous result given to them by the University.During the hearing, the single judge bench was informed by the university that it had declared 75 Undergraduate courses results and only four are remaining. 38 results of post graduate courses have been also declared and only 29 are pending. All these results are likely to be declared by November 30.It also said that both the two issues of students marked absent or given zero and the deadline to declare the results is already being considered by a division bench. The court posted the matter for further hearing on December 22.On November 24, the bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad had said that the varsity’s “neck is on board” if it does not meet the deadline of November 30 to declare the results of the final year undergraduate students while hearing a plea seeking a declaration of the results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/declare-results-of-those-who-were-marked-zero-in-obe-hc-tells-du/story-9rTb60PAPAKBGhIHWw9cWL.html
01-12-2020||Delhi||No toilets, a sanitation challenge at farmer agitation sites in Delhi||Farmers camping at Delhi’s borders may have stacked ration for months even as they ready themselves potentially for the long haul but they face one problem, toilets.With no toilets made available for them at the city’s borders, the farmers are compelled to either use empty plots and agricultural fields or are at the mercy of the goodwill of local residents, fuel stations owners and a few businesses that have remained open around them.While bathing and drinking water has not been a major concern for most of them, using the toilets has been.“Local residents have offered their home toilets for our use. Some residents gave us their phone numbers in case any of us needed to use the washrooms. But we know their limitations. After all, the regular houses only have 500-litre water tanks and we are thousands,” said Jasjeet Singh, a Faridkot farmer camping at the Tikri Border.The farmers here did manage to convince a local hospital to let them use the toilets, but that is hardly enough.“While travelling to Delhi, we could find hotels and restaurants that let us use their facilities, but the options around here are limited,” said Poorn Singh, a farmer from Fazilka in Punjab.The farmers, however, have found ample support from fuel station owners around the protest site. Neeraj Verma, accountant at the last fuel station in Delhi, on the Tikri route towards Bahadurgarh, said two toilets have been opened up for the farmers.“We have almost no sale for the last four days, but we have thrown open our toilets for them. But most people are forced to relieve themselves in the fields around,” said Verma.The situation was slightly better at the Singhu Border where more residents were willing to open their gates for the farmers.“If I were protesting for my rights, I would have wanted toilets. So, I have been allowing the farmers to use my facility and have been refilling the overhead tank multiple times a day to ensure no one visiting my home is turned away,” said Bharat Sharma, who lives near the Singhu Border.Farmers some residents even offered to wash their clothes. “We politely refused their offer. This is winter and we can manage with the same set of clothes without troubling them,” said Harjinder Singh, a farmer from Ropar.Some locals at Singhu Border have even drawn a pipe from their homes to the protest site and have been using their motors to supply water.Yet, there were many who complained about farmers using the fields and plots to relieve themselves. “They say they plan to continue their protest for weeks and months. The neighbourhood will get unlivable in a few days,” complained a local shopkeeper at Singhu Border.There is no arrangement by the administration to set up toilets at the protest sites.A senior police officer, who didn’t want to be identified, said while much of these protest sites are on the Haryana side of the border, there were no plans to set up toilets there. “There are all arrangements at the Burari ground,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-toilets-a-sanitation-challenge-at-farmer-agitation-sites-in-delhi/story-fQxnPKxrgtp2Y7wDksRkOJ.html
01-12-2020||Delhi||Sombre Gurpurab as farmers wait at Capital’s borders||If they were in their villages on Guru Nanak Jayanti on Monday, the Sikh farmers protesting against new farm laws at Delhi’s borders would have begun the day by wearing new clothes, visiting the local Gurdwara, reading the holy scripture, organising a langar (community kitchen) and ended the festive day by lighting lamps. At the protest sites, however, the farmers could perform only a few of these rituals and in a very limited way -- some couldn’t even find water to bathe -- but that did little to dampen their mood. A few actually managed to visit a Gurdwara. “Yes, we missed the nagar kirtan (processional singing of hymns), during which we would travel around our villages with the Guru Granth Sahib decked nicely on a vehicle ahead of us. But there we would have celebrated it only with a few hundred other villagers. Here, we have the entire Punjab and people from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for company,” Jagtar Singh, a Patiala farmer camping at Delhi’s Singhu Border, said, summing up the general mood. In the morning, at Singhu and Tikri borders, the farmers either stood in large groups or sat in their tractors and trolleys to do paath (reading of the holy text). That was followed by the distribution of prashad, and then a langar was organised even as a holy discourse was broadcast on loudspeakers.“If we were back home, we would have had a sumptuous langar comprising of kheer, pakode, many varieties of sweets, and other dishes,” said Shamsher Singh, a farmer from Amritsar. At the two border points, however, the langar had fewer options with the menu consisting of rice, roti, dal, vegetable and halwa.There are two Gurdwaras close to the Singhu border on the Delhi side. A few farmers who entered Delhi via internal roads also made it to the Gurdwaras. “I haven’t missed a Gurdwara visit on this day ever since I was a child. I didn’t miss it this time either,” said Jasjeet Singh, a farmer from Faridkot, who took a bath, offered prayers and ate at the langar of the Dera Sant Baba Resham Singh Ji Gurdwara, about two kilometres from the Singhu border. The Gurdwara authorities chose to downplay visits by the protesting farmer, lest they draw unnecessary attention. “There were many devotees we have never seen before, but we don’t ask questions of anyone visiting this Gurdwara,” said an official who didn’t reveal his identity.The Sikh farmers at the Tikri Border weren’t lucky enough to find a Gurdwara in close proximity.Farmers assembled at the Burari ground too had to be content with limited celebrations at the venue although they danced and sang together to celebrate the festive day. “We didn’t have the Guru Granth Saahib with us, but we found new people to celebrate the festival with,” said Jasvinder Singh, a farmer from Lakhimpur Kheri in UP. Many Sikh farmers said they had woken up on the festive day by 4-5 am to bathe and wear fresh clothes. “Our Diwali and Dussehra, too, was lost in the protests. So we were not very optimistic about celebrating Guru Nanak Jayanti with our families. But I had kept aside a pair of clean clothes for the day,” said Inderjeet Singh, a farmer from Tarn Taran. While farmers at the Singhu border had sufficient water to bathe, many at the Tikri border struggled to find water. Jasjeet Singh, a farmer from Faridkot, said that he decided to give the prayers a miss as he hadn’t taken a bath or changed his clothes for the past week. “But we’ll light lamps along the police barricades and outside our trucks at night. We’ll also light our vehicle headlamps and indicators at night to celebrate the festival,” he said.Sikhs in Delhi and Haryana brought milk, fresh fruits and even lamps and battery-operated lights for the farmers. “This time I have decided to celebrate the festival with my farmer brothers,” said Jagtar Singh, a Sikh businessman from Rohini in Delhi.Farmers said they missed being with their families on the festive occasion, but it was a small sacrifice, given the task ahead of them. “I have asked my wife to light an extra lamp on my behalf. She has asked me not to return until our demands are fulfilled. We’ll celebrate the festival again when we return home victorious,” said another farmer, Hardeep Singh, from Ludhiana.At the Singhu border, farmers even walked up to police personnel to offer them prashad even as the police continued to maintain physical distance because of the pandemic. “We may be on the other side of the barricades, but we are not enemies. So, we accepted the prashad and wished them,” said a policeman who didn’t want to be identified.Gaurav Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north), did not comment on the limited interaction between the Sikh farmers and the police personnel. “I wish them on the festival and urge them to proceed to the Burari ground to carry on their protest peacefully,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sombre-gurpurab-as-farmers-wait-at-capital-s-borders/story-5R14B8guWdFK6MNxw5fp3N.html
01-12-2020||Delhi||On the border of resistance, farmers stay put and police remain alert||At the Singhu Border where protesting farmers either had a choice to shift to the Burari ground in north Delhi or stay behind the Delhi Police barricades since Friday, a few hundred farmers on Monday made slight inroads into the national capital by driving their tractors and trolleys on alternative routes to occupy a few streets in the capital.Until Sunday evening, the protesters had stayed in Haryana, but by Monday, the police barricades and barbed wires over them did not really mean much. Hundreds of farmers occupied the main crossing of the Singhu Border even as they parked their vehicles on the adjoining roads in Narela -- almost 200 metres from the point they were earlier stopped. “The police weren’t allowing us beyond the barricades. So, we drove on the inner roads and reached this point,” said Jasvinder Singh, a farmer who arrived from Ludhiana.So, unlike earlier when there were farmers on the Haryana side of the barricades and police on the Delhi side, the scenes have now changed. Now, there are farmers behind the barricades, then police for the next 200 metres of stretch, another smaller group of farmers occupying the Singhu intersection behind them, and another cordon of the police. Gaurav Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north), acknowledged the further push by the farmers and said that they were anyway invited to protest in Delhi. “We are ourselves asking them to go to Burari ground to protest peacefully,” said Sharma.In contrast, at Tikri Border, the barricades have become more impenetrable and the credentials of people are being checked before they enter or leave the Delhi side. The farmers there have remained strictly behind the barricades and there is limited interaction between them and the police. A Koan, DCP (outer) did not comment on the situation.At the Sant Nirankari Samagam ground in Burari, the arrangements for protesting farmers were enhanced by setting up tents on a large section of the ground. But they have mostly remained unused as less than a thousand farmers have chosen to shift to Burari. The situation at the two border points has remained peaceful after clashes between farmers and police on Friday. The police said there was no trouble at the Gurgaon and Faridabad borders even as the public continued to face inconvenience at the Jharoda Kalan Border near Dwarka.The farmers had announced on Sunday that besides the two border points, they will also block the highways from Hapur, Gurugram and Faridabad. RP Meena, DCP (south-east), said that while checking was on at the Faridabad and UP borders connecting his district, there were no farmers attempting to enter the city from any of those points. Ingit Pratap Singh, DCP (south-west), too said that the situation at the borders connecting Delhi and Gurgaon were incident-free. “There is no gathering at any of these borders,” said Singh. But the Jharoda Kalan Border continued to be under strict vigilance. “We are allowing traffic out of Delhi, but anyone entering the city using that route will be inconvenienced as strict checking is being enforced,” said Santosh Kumar Meena, DCP (Dwarka). The problem persisted there because the Rohtak Flyover on which farmers are moving towards the Tikri Border is just 200 metres from the Jharoda Kalan Border, said the DCP.The checking of those entering the Burari ground as well as those leaving it too continued to be very strict as the police took down names and phone numbers of those entering the ground as well as checked the credentials of those leaving. But Vijayanta Arya, DCP (north-west), said that this was nothing unusual and were general crowd control mechanisms. “People have been coming and going as per their wish. There is a floating crowd at the ground,” said Arya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-the-border-of-resistance-farmers-stay-put-and-police-remain-alert/story-FjTi0QkcFkvr3K2SKMVwuL.html

Kejriwal also urged the Centre to hold talks with protesting farmers at the earliest.In a video message extending his greetings on Gurupurab, Kejriwal said, “On this occasion, I appeal to all Delhiites to do whatever they can for the protesting farmers in all possible ways.”“I hope that the Centre holds talks with the farmers as soon as possible and agrees to their demands. The farmers are braving the cold and holding their protest. AAP volunteers, MLAs and members are helping the farmers in all possible ways, whether it is food, medical aid, water etc,” he added. Following Kejriwal’s appeal, senior AAP leader and Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha inspected the protest site at the Singhu border and distributed blankets. He said the DJB is ensuring the availability of drinking water for farmers protesting there.“We have arranged for portable toilets at the back, and have also deployed an ambulance to arrange for medicines, first-aid, blood pressure checking facilities, and other treatments, etc for the farmers. The Delhi government and Delhiites welcome the farmers from across the country. The Central government should not make it a battle of their egos. The Centre should talk to the farmers without any conditions, listen to them, and accept their demands,” Chadha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chief-minister-kejriwal-appeals-to-delhi-residents-to-help-protesting-farmers/story-f03110fBe7c0Rtc3WwcdsK.html
01-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers at Ghazipur announce section 288 against police’s 144||Taking a jibe at Delhi police for imposing section 144 at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border in Ghazipur, disallowing the gathering of more than three people, farmers protesting at the spot on Monday said they had imposed “section 288” of their own. Farmer leaders said 288, which is double of section 144, is symbolic in nature and essentially means the entry of anyone other than farmers in that area is restricted, and, most importantly, that the police and farmers will not interfere in each other’s business.The announcement came after police increased its presence at the Ghazipur border in the afternoon and placed concrete barricades when the situation heated up briefly as farmers started raising slogans against the new farm laws. There was no untoward and the groups were calmed down by their leaders.Chaudhry Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union, who is camping at the Ghazipur border since Friday with hundreds of other farmers, said, “We’ve imposed 288, but it does not mean any disrespect to our country’s law. It is just symbolic and means that entry of anyone other than a farmer in our protest is restricted. It is also to disallow anti-social elements from getting into our groups,” he said.Tikait said hundreds of farmers at camping at the Ghazipur border from various parts of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. “We are peacefully protesting. We are in touch with other unions and farmer groups in Haryana and Punjab and our next move will be decided on December 3,” the farmer leader said.The farmers put up notices and wrote on the main Ghazipur Road, which is blocked, saying “section 288 of the Bhartiya Kisan Union is in effect here. No one apart from farmers are allowed here.”Rapid Action Force, Border Security Force along with Central Armed Reserve Force and Delhi Police personnel in riot gear were deployed at the barricades to prevent the farmers from entering Delhi.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said the farmer gathering at Ghazipur has been peaceful since Friday. “At times, they did climb up the police barricades but were convinced to retreat by their farmer leaders. We have adequate arrangements and deployment in place to ensure law and order,” Singh said.Farmers from parts of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand are camping at Ghazipur since Friday, when they were marching to Delhi but were restricted from entering the Capital.The same day, farmers from Haryana and Punjab, who had reached Singhu border, clashed with Delhi police when stopped. Later, the police allowed them to camp at Sant Nirankari ground in Burari but turned down their proposal to some to Ramlila Maidan. On Sunday, farmers had announced that apart from Tikri and Singhu borders that they have blocked since Friday, three more highways connecting Delhi with Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Gurugram will be blocked completely. Hours after the announcement, on Monday morning, cement barriers were placed at the Ghazipur border along police barricades to prevent farmers from barging in with vehicles.In contrast, the Chila border, which connects Noida with Mayur Vihar in Delhi, remained unaffected. However, as a precautionary measure, paramilitary and Delhi Police officials remained deployed at both sides of the border for the fourth consecutive day.DCP Jasmeet Singh said situation at the Chila border is normal. “Traffic is normal there. We are in regular touch with Noida Police and the situation is being closely monitored with sufficient force in place,” he said.Police said traffic was not affected much at the Ghazipur border as the farmers have gathered under the elevated highway that connects Delhi and Ghaziabad. “The service lane has been completely blocked by farmers since Friday but we have diverted traffic to the elevated road. Because of this, commuters are not facing much traffic issues,” said Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-at-ghazipur-announce-section-288-against-police-s-144/story-db39iyIRfxo9TEoXHD78qL.html

The case is related to the alleged murder of a man by a riotous mob.Justice Suresh Kait released Shahrukh alias Rinku for a bail bond of Rs.30,000 with one surety of the like amount, saying co-accused Anwar Hussain, Kasim and Khalid Ansari have been already released on bail even though their offences are “graver” than those of Shahrukh.“It is not in dispute that accused Anwar Hussain, Kasim and Khalid Ansari have been released on bail and as per the charge sheet, the role of the said accused persons is graver than the petitioner (Shahrukh)….,” the court said in its order of November 27.“The other co-accused, who are on bail, are seen in CCTV footage and their CDR matched with each other whereas in the case of petitioner (Shahrukh), neither his CDR matches nor is he seen in CCTV,” the judge added.Shahrukh, lodged at Mandoli jail, was arrested on April 3. According to the prosecution, he was a part of a riotous mob that was behind the death of one Deepak. The police said one of the eyewitnesses, Sunil, had claimed he had seen Shahrukh inflicting injuries on the deceased.The court said the statement of Sunil was recorded on June 25 and that of others who claimed to be eye-witnesses was recorded on March 12, whereas the incident took place on February 25.“In view of the above, without commenting on the merits of the prosecution case, on parity, this court is of the view that the petitioner deserves bail,” the court said.Communal riots had broken out in February in north-east Delhi, claiming 53 lives and leaving over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/not-in-footage-call-records-do-not-match-delhi-high-court-grants-bail-to-man-in-delhi-riots-case/story-JTc5Dk0mkWevm9KworYXAI.html
01-12-2020||City||Delhi: Families facing income crunch,100k+ kids turn to anganwadis||Over 100,000 children have enrolled in the city’s anganwadi centres over the course of the pandemic, official data shows, as families whose incomes have been severely hit over the past few month move their children from private institutions in search of nutritious food and with an eye on savings.These anganwadi centres, part of the central government’s Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme, provide supplementary nutrition diets to children up to age six, as well as pregnant and lactating women. They also provide these children with pre-school education, health education, immunisation, and medical check-ups.While the city’s 10,700 anganwadi centres have been physically shut since March, the Delhi government’s department of women and child development (WCD) has been providing children supplementary nutrition - including dalia, black chickpea (chana), jaggery, and roasted chickpea - through door-to-door services on a fortnightly basis. According to data shared by the department, around 560,000 children were enrolled in Delhi’s anganwadi centres before the lockdown was enforced in March, a number which has since shot up. “This number has increased to 680,000 in the last few months. A majority of the recently admitted children used to study in budget private schools. But since the schools are now shut and many people have lost their livelihoods, parents have enrolled their kids at anganwadi centres in order to get a regular supply of nutrition,” a senior official at Delhi’s WCD department said.WCD minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said there were two reasons behind the increased enrolment. “The first is the closure of schools and the second is financial crises faced by people amid the pandemic. Besides, people now know that we are delivering nutritious food on a regular basis and have registered their children,” he said.Gautam added that the department was preparing, and even welcomed, further enrolments.A senior official at the WCD department said the ministry has made budgetary provisions to ensure a regular supply of nutrition to the newly enrolled children. “There has been a 20% increase in the budget for nutrition… We expect the number of beneficiaries to increase further if schools stay shut for the next few months.”Some anganwadi workers said the number of beneficiaries nearly doubled in the past few months. An assistant Child Development Project Officer (CDPO), who looks after 28 Anganwadi centres in north Delhi, said, “For instance, in one of our anganwadis, there were 50 registered child beneficiaries till March, and this has now crossed 110,” she said.HT had in July reported that many budget private schools in Delhi witnessed mass withdrawals amid the pandemic. Padma, an anganwadi worker in east Delhi, said, “Many of the new beneficiaries are from municipalities or government schools as well. They were earlier getting mid-day meals and now since the schools are shut, their parents have enrolled them in the anganwadi. They do not have to come here every day since we have not resumed classes but they receive dry ration regularly.”Dilshad, who worked at a garment store in Lakshmi Nagar but lost his job in April, recently registered his children in a local anganwadi centre. “My children, a four-year-old son and a five-year-old daughter - were enrolled in a private school in Seelampur. I had to withdraw them after not being able to pay the fees July. I am still out of work and we are struggling to afford daily meals. I enrolled them in an anganwadi in August and they are at least getting some dry rations now,” he said.Sheela Devi, a resident of Trilokpuri, said she registered her children - who are enrolled in a government school - in an anganwadi in June. “We are not able to provide nutritional food to our children regularly even though we got some money as mid-day meal allowance in their bank account. My husband [a daily wage labourer] has hardly earned anything in the last few months. Someone suggested that we enrol kids in the anganwadi so that at least they can get nourishment regularly,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/families-facing-income-crunch-100k-kids-turn-to-anganwadis/story-1bLorNRQMmDSykh6mDFdMO.html
01-12-2020||Education||Under new regime, DU promotions in fast lane||The Delhi University has cleared 800 pending promotions and cleared 37 recruitments at several departments ever since the President suspended vice-chancellor Yogesh Kumar Tyagi on October 28 over “dereliction of duties and lack of commitment” after a bitter spat between two factions led to an unprecedented administrative crisis at the institution. Officials confirmed to HT that besides files pertaining to appointments and promotions being cleared, several committees related to teachers welfare and promotion of non-teaching staff have also been set up. According to the October 28 suspension order issued by the Union education ministry, the Centre had pointed out several shortcomings in the functioning of the university under Tyagi’s tenure with pending recruitments being one of the major issues. It pointed out how several key posts including that of the Registrar were being managed with ad-hoc arrangements and posts of teachers and other staff were not being filled despite clear orders and follow ups by the education ministry. Pro vice-chancellor PC Joshi, who was appointed acting V-C, said, “In the past four years, many things had been stalled and there had been minimal administration. We are trying to clear that backlog, including the ones on promotions. The philosophy of the new administration is that deserving teachers should get a timely promotion. We are working on recruitments as well as complaints against the university officials that had been raised in the previous years. We are addressing all the problems that were pointed out in the President’s order.” In October, a faction led by Tyagi -- who was on medical leave since July and is due to retire in March -- overrode the recommendations of the executive council (EC), the highest decision making body of the varsity, to first appoint a new registrar and then a new pro V-C. The group led by Joshi had appointed Vikas Gupta as the Registrar, an appointment that was ratified by the EC. For a brief period, the university had two registrars and two pro V-C’s. The President had nullified all orders, appointments made by Tyagi. Taking stock of the work done in the past one month, EC member Rajesh Jha said, “In addition to promotions and departmental recruitments, the communication between the new administration and teachers is also better. We recently had an academic council meeting after more than a year. The new administration seems to be in action mode and we can see things moving.”Jha, however, opposed the formation of a new committee to implement the new education policy, saying it was formed without due discussion. Enlisting priorities for the new administration, Jha said, “The new administration has to look into several other areas like restarting research and development grant and innovation projects and problems faced in the centralised admission process and online open-book exams.” Several principals have also acknowledged that works are being expedited under the new administration. Manoj Sinha, general secretary of DU principal’s association, said, “There was no logical reason for promotions to be pending for over a decade in colleges. Things are now moving due to a certain push by the new administration. The process of recruitment has also started. This has caused excitement among stakeholders since things had been stagnant for a long time. The new administration has also looked into the promotions of non-teaching staff, rules for which were revised nearly two years ago but had not been implemented until now.”A principal at a DU college, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the administration will have to ensure that promotions are done according to the pace of recruitments. “Though they have been going ahead with the promotions if we don’t carry recruitments at the same pace, the gap between temporary and permanent teachers will widen. While we welcome the promotions, the administration has to communicate with all principals and listen to us. Constitution of governing bodies is pending in so many colleges and that has to be looked at immediately as it affects the ability to make everyday decisions.” Across colleges, these governing bodies (GB) take all decisions for the smooth functioning of a college, including the appointment of teaching and non-teaching staff.Reacting to the responses, the acting V-C said that the issue of constituting GBs has been resolved in the past one month. “While it (constitution of GBs) was an issue, we have managed to resolve most of these cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/under-new-regime-du-promotions-in-fast-lane/story-Nh8cI5qaxUTlqlEhMNqXjI.html
01-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: IITs set to start virtual interviews in first phase of placements from Dec 1||Virtual interviews, written exams and group discussions will replace the in-person interviews at the much-awaited placements in the premier Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) that kick off on December 1. Most institutes have already finished training their students in advance to ease into the virtual-mode in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic this year.“The format of interviewing will be through online software via video conferencing and in some cases telephonically,” said BV Ravishankar, training and placement officer, IIT-Bombay. Over 1,700 students from various programmes of the institute will seek employment through the placement drive this year. Most other IITs confirmed to HT that their placements will be done online this year in the interest of health and safety of students.HT has previously reported the surge in pre-placement offers (PPOs) across IITs compared to 2019. Earlier this month, most IITs had managed to bypass the total PPOs received last year, bringing cheer and hope to students in general. “This entire virtual interview concept is new and while our placement cell has encouraged us to attend virtual workshops to understand the concept, we’ll know more only once the interviews begin. Most of us are anxious about it,” said a final-year BTech student of IIT-Bombay.The first phase of placements across IITs commences on December 1 and continues for a week or two depending on registration of companies and students opting for placements. Last year, three students from IIT-Roorkee had bagged an annual salary package of ₹1.54 crore each. The same company had offered similar package to students at IIT-Bombay, Kanpur and Madras as well.This year too, students are expecting annual packages for domestic as well as international job offers to match up to previous few years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-iits-set-to-start-virtual-interviews-in-first-phase-of-placements-from-dec-1/story-U5P7JRrP0JcCMsPZjcMAvO.html
01-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CET results out: Twelve from city get the perfect score||Results for the common entrance test (CET) cell, engineering exams were announced late on Saturday night. As per the information shared by the state CET cell, 41 students have scored a perfect 100 percentile this year—22 in the physics-chemistry-maths (PCM) group and 19 in the physics-chemistry-biology (PCB) group. This year, Sanika Gumaste topped the exam in the PCM group while by Anish Jagdale topped the PCB group, both from Pune.Of the 1.74 lakh students who attempted the exam this year in the PCM group, 22 students managed to score 100 percentile, including eight students from Mumbai. Similarly, of the 2.11 lakh students who attempted the exam in the PCB group, 19 students scored 100 percentile including four students from Mumbai suburban and city.Seventeen-year-old Nishtha Pandey, a resident of Kandivli, who was one of the eight students from the city to top the exam, said, “I spent the last two years preparing for competitive exams and while I appeared for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains as well, my focus was always on CET.” She now hopes to bag a seat in the computer science (CS) department of Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), Matunga.Rishabh Bali, 18, not only managed the perfect score in CET exams but also scored 91.2% in his Class 12 board exams. “CET was my focus, but I made sure I was well prepared for Class 12 exams as well. While I’m still unclear about which institute I’ll choose for Bachelors in Technology, I am sure of taking up computer science (CS),” said Bali, a resident of Borivli.Experts feel that the decision of the state CET cell to award marks to students for errors in questions asked during the exam this year has boosted the overall performance of students.Earlier this week, the CET cell had released a circular on their website revealing that of the many objections raised by students against questions asked in the CET exams held in September and October this year, many have been accepted. This means that all students who appeared for the exam received full marks for at least 29 questions.The previous circular shared by the CET cell, mentioned a total of 65 questions against which objections were accepted. Maximum questions that have been awarded full marks are either due to an error in the question itself or the errors in the options provided per question. It further explains each unique question ID across the four sections (physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics) for which objections were raised by students and accepted by an expert committee put together by the CET cell.This year, results for the MHT-CET exam were delayed by several hours on Saturday, leaving students on edge all day. Originally supposed to be announced before 1pm, the results were finally announced post 11.30pm on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cet-results-out-twelve-from-city-get-the-perfect-score/story-fCsbpQT9rbEii5t8aVOuIJ.html

I was feeling very sad, just like him.”“Eventually he felt better and he stopped crying,” Varon told CNN on Monday, which he said was his 256th consecutive day of work.“I don’t know why I haven’t broken down,” the doctor said. “My nurses cry in the middle of the day.”Varon said the isolation of the Covid unit was difficult for many patients, particularly the elderly.“You can imagine,” he said. “You are inside a room where people are coming in spacesuits.“When you are an elderly individual, it’s more difficult because you are alone,” he said.“Some of them cry. Some of them try to escape,” he said. “We actually had somebody who tried to escape through a window the other day.”Varon said the elderly man in the picture is “doing much better.”“We are hoping that before the end of the week he’ll be able to get out of the hospital,” he said.Varon also had a message for people who are not taking precautions amid the pandemic.“People are out there in bars, restaurants, malls,” the doctor said. “It is crazy. People don’t listen and then they end up in my ICU.“What people need to know is I don’t want to have to be hugging them.“They need to do the basic things -- keep your social distance, wear your masks, wash their hands, and avoid going to places where there are a lot of people,” he said. “If people would do that, healthcare workers like me could hopefully rest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/photo-of-texas-doctor-comforting-elderly-covid-patient-goes-viral/story-fOyGiKqLAhknFBtjR5ZmsM.html
01-12-2020||World||Biden assembles administration as Trump cries foul in another call-in||US President-elect Joe Biden continued assemble his administration and prepare to take over in January as Arizona and Wisconsin certified their results, making his victory official and delivering another snub to President Donald Trump’s efforts to cling on to the presidency citing baseless poll fraud claims.Biden will introduce his economic team comprising nominees for treasury secretary and director of the Office of Management and budget Janet Yellen and Neera Tanden on Tuesday, after his daily intelligence briefing, which he began receiving on Monday as part of a delayed transition process.Biden also announced his presidential inauguration committee with Maju Varghese, an Indian American, as executive director. Tony Allen, the African American CEO of a Delaware university, will head it as CEO.Trump remains dug in, refusing to accept the result. With Republican-ruled Arizona and Democratic Nevada certifying Biden’s victory, all six swing states that Trump have now made their election outcomes official: Biden wins with 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232.The Trump campaign has continued to file lawsuits, none of which withstood even the most cursory scrutiny in courts, and lobby Republican-controlled legislatures in these states to reject the outcome and send their own list of electors, who, according to the plan, will vote for Trump on December 14, and not for Biden as they should in the winner-takes-all system of electoral college voting.Trump called into a briefing his lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis gave Republican legislators of Arizona, which has been wrongly portrayed as a “hearing”, as he had in Pennsylvania last week.“What they did is they played game, and games like nobody has ever seen before,” Trump said on the call, referring to Democrats. “This is the first time that Republicans or the first time anyone has fought back.” He went on to falsely claim he actually won the swing states that have certified Biden the winner.Meanwhile, Melania Trump, the first lady, unveiled season decorations for what will be the family’s last Christmas in the White House. “During this special time of the year, I am delighted to share “America the Beautiful” and pay tribute to the majesty of our great Nation. Together, we celebrate this land we are all proud to call home,” she wrote in a tweet with a one-minute video of the decorations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-assembles-administration-as-trump-cries-foul-in-another-call-in/story-sSu4gDSCcXId2e853yOCDM.html

01-12-2020||World||Russia deploys advanced S-300 missiles to disputed islands near Japan||Russia said on Tuesday it had deployed a number of its new S-300V4 missile defence systems for combat duty on a disputed chain of islands near Japan, a move that is likely to anger Tokyo.The Russian Defence Ministry’s Zvezda TV station said the mobile air defence system designed to counter ballistic and aerial attacks was on Iturup, one of four islands held by Russia that Japan claims and calls the Northern Territories.“Short-range anti-aircraft missile systems are already on duty on the island of Iturup in Sakhalin Region. Now the air defence ‘heavy artillery’ has arrived. The so-called large air defence system: the S-300V4,” Zvezda said.The Soviets seized the islands, known as the Southern Kuriles, at the end of World War Two and a territorial row over them has prevented the two sides signing a formal peace treaty since and strained relations for years.Japan is highly sensitive to military moves by Russia on the strategically important chain of islands that stretch northeast from Japan’s Hokkaido to the Russian Far East region of Kamchatka.Russia said in October it planned to deploy the missile system on the islands for the first time, but that the move would be part of military drills and not for combat duty.The deployment comes not long after former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who mounted a push to resolve the dispute and tried to win over Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced he was stepping down in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-deploys-advanced-s-300-missiles-to-disputed-islands-near-japan/story-NVqkx0T2D2DgJZJBSminlI.html
01-12-2020||World||From hate speech to nudity, Facebook’s oversight board picks its first cases||Facebook Inc’s independent Oversight Board announced on Tuesday the first six cases where it could overrule the social media company’s decisions to remove certain pieces of content from its platforms. The board, which Facebook created in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content, said it had received 20,000 cases since it opened its doors in October.Three of the six cases involved content that Facebook removed for breaking hate speech rules.An Oversight Board spokesman said hate speech cases had been “the most significant proportion” of appeals received.“Hate speech is an especially difficult area,” Jamal Greene, one of the board’s co-chairs and a professor at Columbia Law School, told Reuters in an interview. “It’s not that easy ... for an algorithm to get the context of” such speech.In November, Facebook for the first time disclosed numbers on the prevalence of hate speech on the platform, saying that out of every 10,000 content views in the third quarter, 10 to 11 included hate speech.The global board’s other chosen cases involved content removed from Facebook or Instagram for violating rules on adult nudity, dangerous individuals and organizations, and violence and incitement. Greene said they raised “important line-drawing questions.”One case was submitted by Facebook itself. The company said this case highlighted the challenge it faced when dealing with the risks of offline harm caused by misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic.Facebook can also ask the board for non-binding policy recommendations, but Greene said it had not yet done so.The board has opened a week-long public comment period on the first cases, which will be reviewed by five-member panels. There is a 90-day deadline for decisions on the cases to be reached and for Facebook to act on them.The board, which has been criticized for its limited remit, aims to start hearing cases from users in early 2021 about content that has been left on the site or taken down. This week, a group of Facebook critics dubbed “The Real Facebook Oversight Board” said it would hear three cases not yet eligible for users to take to the official oversight board, including a dispute about the Facebook account of Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump’s former adviser.Asked about this group, a spokeswoman for Facebook’s Oversight Board said: “Lots of people have opinions about Facebook. The Oversight Board is focused on making binding decisions and issuing policy recommendations that will hold Facebook to account.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-hate-speech-to-nudity-facebook-s-oversight-board-picks-its-first-cases/story-GT7sUrsWXJlMPOVqqPZJ5I.html

We have dramatically changed that proposition,” Levey told Reuters.Diem, which means “day” in Latin, now aims to initially launch a single dollar-backed digital coin, he added. He declined to comment on timing for the launch, which the Financial Times reported last week could be as early as January, saying only that it would only go ahead after approval by the Swiss markets watchdog.Facebook, which changed the name of its payments unit Calibra to Novi Financial in May, remains one of 27 members of the Diem Association, formerly the Libra Association. Novi’s head, David Marcus, is one of Diem’s five board members. “They are a critically-important member of the association,” said Levey of Facebook’s continuing involvement.“We are not trying to cut all ties, by any stretch. It (the name change) is to signify that the association is operating autonomously and independently,” he added.Diem aims to set itself apart from others by its focus on aspects of concern to regulators and western governments, including sanction controls and financial crime, Levey said. The project has said it would develop policies on anti-money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions compliance and has ditched earlier plans to allow anyone to join its network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-backed-digital-coin-libra-renamed-diem-in-quest-for-approval/story-N3PU0c7XZl1Pz3tx2uFFqN.html

But people’s curiosity has since peaked. Melania Trump seems to have finally got the hang of holiday decorations and the New York Times went so far as to declare this year’s theme, ‘America the beautiful’ to be “strikingly normal”.The history of Christmas celebrations at the White House has evolved over the years, and each first couple has left their unique imprint on the celebrations, marked by the presence of a German tradition in the First House of America.Richard Nixon and the Pageant of PeaceThe annual tree lighting ceremony in the White House, where the president turns on the lights of the Christmas tree was known as the Pageant of Peace. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued former president Richard Nixon over the display of a Nativity Scene on White House grounds, stating that it amounted to ‘government sponsorship of religion’. The lawsuit was discarded later by the US Court of Appeals.Jacqueline Kennedy and the Nutcracker ChristmasJacqueline Kennedy is credited with commencing the first themed Christmas celebration in the White House, an example her successors would dutifully follow. She decorated the Christmas tree with figurines of the sugar plum fairy, ornamental birds, toys, and angels modelled after Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker Suite ballet. She reused these decorations for Christmas next year.Michelle Obama’s environmentally-conscious Christmas decorations‘Reflect, Rejoice, and Renew’ was the environmentally-conscious theme Michelle Obama went for in her first White House Christmas celebrations. The trees were lit with low energy consuming LED lights, and six of the trees were replanted by the National Parks Service after being displayed.A military ChristmasObama’s 2011 theme of ‘Shine, Give and Share’ cherished military families and their contributions. Children of military parents sent cards and toys for decorations; the Christmas tree was decorated with medals of military veterans. They repeated this tradition in 2014 and 2015 by inviting military families to tour the decorated White House grounds.Trump’s Rose Garden ChristmasA curious addition to Melania Trump’s Christmas this year is the addition of the Rose Garden to the White House-themed gingerbread house. The Rose Garden, where the announcement of Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court was made, was the scene of a super-spreader event during which both Donald and Melania Trump, their son, and numerous high-profile guests are said to have contracted the coronavirus disease. Commentators and critics have come up with hilarious speculations for this addition but official White House sources have clarified that it was added because the First Lady recently took part in its renovations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-christmas-decorations-over-the-years/story-0QewMc5VarnNu0PGNLN6TO.html

But we still see that a shortage for the network remains, and so we are working with the trade and industry ministry on additional deliveries from abroad,” he said.New daily infection numbers, which stood at 26,402 on Tuesday, have been gradually decreasing since hitting a record high on Nov 27. Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, said the growth of the disease was slowing.However Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said the situation remained quite tense in many of Russia’s more than 80 regions.In 17 regions, hospital bed capacity was less than 5%, said Murashko, with the Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad and St Petersburg presenting the greatest cause for concern.Russia has resisted imposing lockdowns during the second wave of the virus, preferring targeted curbs.With 2,322,056 infections, Russia has the fourth-largest number of Covid-19 cases in the world behind the United States, India and Brazil. It has recorded 40,646 deaths related to Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-tries-to-import-covid-19-drugs-as-deaths-hit-high/story-2V1mptvw0ZBmQT3dkLkXoO.html
01-12-2020||World||Biden plan to end US fossil fuel subsidies faces big challenges||President-elect Joe Biden’s promise to end US fossil fuel subsidies worth billions of dollars a year for drillers and miners could be hard to keep due to resistance from lawmakers in a narrowly divided Congress, including from within his own party.The challenge reflects just one of the obstacles that Biden will need to overcome as he seeks to usher in sweeping measures to combat climate change and transform the nation’s economy to net-zero emissions within three decades. Biden has said axing fossil fuel subsidies will generate money to help pay for his broader $2 trillion climate plan.While Biden can take executive action to reverse President Donald Trump’s rollbacks of rules meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reforming tax breaks that allow companies to produce oil, gas and coal more cheaply will require Congress to pass legislation. Doing so could be hard, even though Biden spent 36 years in the Senate where he is known as a dealmaker.“It’s dead on arrival in the Senate,” said Gilbert Metcalf, a former deputy assistant secretary for environment and energy at the Treasury Department under former President Barack Obama, referring to any standalone legislation ditching the tax breaks if Republicans maintain control of the chamber. Even if two of Biden’s fellow Democrats win runoff votes in Georgia on Jan. 5, bringing the Senate to a 50-50 split with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris acting as tie breaker, chances of passing a tax package are slim, experts said.That is because moderate Democrats from fossil fuel producing states, like Senators Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, could stymie the effort. “In states like New Mexico, where senators might be green enough to support a climate bill ... a measure that merely strips tax provisions looks like a non-starter,” said Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners. Neither Manchin’s office, nor Heinrich’s responded to requests for comment.Obama also wanted to ditch tax breaks for fossil fuels to send a signal to the world that the United States was serious about speeding a transition away from fossil fuels to tackle climate change. But even with a commanding Democratic majority in the Senate in Obama’s first six years in office, he was unable to kill the subsidies.The Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Doing away with tax breaks on producers of fuels that emit greenhouse gases would fit neatly with Biden’s pro-climate agenda, which marks a reversal from Trump’s efforts to roll back climate regulations while boosting fossil fuel output. It would help establish the United States as a global leader on climate, potentially helping convince other big emitters to axe fossil fuel subsidies. Leaders in the G20 resolved in 2009 to ditch the subsidies but have made little progress.“It’s harder for us to get a country to do something if we’re not doing it ourselves,” said Metcalf. Estimates of the value of fossil fuel subsidies, which mainly take the form of tax breaks, vary.Bob McNally, the president of the consultancy Rapidan Energy Group, estimates they run $15 billion a year. The nonprofit Environmental and Energy Study Institute puts them at $20 billion annually. Estimates that consider the health care costs linked to pollution from fossil fuels put the subsidies even higher.One U.S. tax break, called intangible drilling costs, allows producers to deduct a majority of their costs from drilling new wells. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan panel of Congress, has estimated that ditching it could generate $13 billion for the public coffers over 10 years.Another, the percentage depletion tax break which allows independent producers to recover development costs of declining oil gas and coal reserves, could generate about $12.9 billion in revenue over 10 years, according to the panel.Biden and Congress will be under pressure to reduce the federal deficit by cutting such tax breaks. But wider tax reforms will also take up debate such as corporate tax rates and boosting taxes on the biggest earners, some of which might take priority. Any bill to alter the tax provisions for the fossil fuel sector will also face heavy resistance from lobbyists, some of whom may point out that solar, wind and other non-fossil energy sources also receive substantial taxpayer support.The American Petroleum Institute, the country’s biggest oil and gas lobby group, will “advocate for a tax code that supports a level playing field for all companies regardless of economic sector,” said Frank Macchiarola, a senior vice president at the industry group.API will push for “pro-development policies that sustain and grow the billions of dollars in government revenue our industry generates at the state and federal level,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-plan-to-end-us-fossil-fuel-subsidies-faces-big-challenges/story-WfXDX0XD1gOktUaNS5OTUJ.html

The WHO guidelines stipulate that victims can be “buried or cremated.” UN Rapporteurs and international rights watchdogs had urged the Sri Lankan government to review the decision and respect the Muslim community’s burial rights.The court decision came as the country is currently gripped in a second wave of the pandemic. The number of cases and deaths has increased six times since the early October.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, Sri Lanka has reported 23,987 cases and 118 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-s-highest-court-rejects-petitions-from-muslims-against-covid-19-cremations/story-Ycfwp9DREqw1ihAWJwx7tJ.html

However, experimental screening of drug combinations is very slow and expensive, and therefore, often fails to discover the full benefits of combination therapy, they said. “The model gives very accurate results. For example, the values of the so-called correlation coefficient were more than 0.9 in our experiments, which points to excellent reliability,” Rousu said. In experimental measurements, a correlation coefficient of 0.8-0.9 is considered reliable, the researchers said. The model accurately predicts how a drug combination selectively inhibits particular cancer cells when the effect of the drug combination on that type of cancer has not been previously tested, they said. “This will help cancer researchers to prioritise which drug combinations to choose from thousands of options for further research,’ said Tero Aittokallio from the University of Helsinki in Finland. The researchers noted that the same machine learning approach could be used for non-cancerous diseases. They said, in that case, the model would have to be re-taught with data related to that disease. For example, the model could be used to study how different combinations of antibiotics affect bacterial infections or how effectively different combinations of drugs kill cells that have been infected by the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus, according to the researchers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-ai-model-may-help-treat-cancer-more-effectively-study-says/story-lP9ihoN20tJUXaw45UlyBP.html
01-12-2020||World||South Korea passes law allowing BTS to postpone mandatory military service||South Korea’s parliament on Tuesday passed a bill to allow globally recognised K-pop artists such as BTS to postpone their mandatory military service to age 30.All able-bodied South Korean men aged between 18 and 28 must serve in the military for about two years as part of the country’s efforts to guard against North Korea.The amendment to the Military Service Act was designed to provide exceptions for K-pop megastars who improve the country’s cultural status and boost the economy.South Korea allows eligible students to defer their duties up to age 28 and has granted exemptions for high-profile classical musicians and athletes who won Olympic medals or a gold at the Asian Games, including Tottenham Hotspur forward Son Heung-min.No K-pop stars had received exemptions but the new bill will ensure entertainers recommended by the culture minister can defer their service to age 30.The oldest member of BTS, 27-year-old Jin, is nearing enlistment at a time when the seven-member boy band is rewriting K-pop history.Since launching in 2013, BTS has driven the global K-pop craze with catchy, upbeat music alongside lyrics and social campaigns aimed at empowering young people.It recently notched a first ever No.1 hit single on the US Billboard charts with the song “Dynamite”, and bagged an unprecedented Grammy nomination as a K-pop band.“Pop artists tend to make their highest achievements in their 20s but many of them had to pursue a graduate degree to delay their service,” said Jeon Yong-gi, who co-authored the bill.BTS’s management, Big Hit Entertainment, did not respond to a request for comment on the legislative change, but Jin and other band members have previously said they would fulfil their duties as required.Military service is a contentious issue in South Korea. A poll released last month by local news outlet E-Today showed some 53% of respondents supported special treatment for BTS, while 47% opposed it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-passes-law-to-allow-bts-to-postpone-mandatory-military-service/story-Kpx0NpxsuXl1YEEBQi1B6N.html

01-12-2020||World||Nirav Modi’s UK jail remand extended again||The Westminster Magistrates Court on Tuesday further extended the prison remand of diamantaire Nirav Modi, who is facing a trial for extradition to India to face charges of major financial offences linked to a Mumbai branch of the Punjab National Bank (PNB).The remand needs to be extended every 28 days, which means he will remain in the Wandsworth jail in west London at least until December 29, when it is likely to be extended again.Concluding statements in the ongoing extradition trial are due to be made on January 7 and 8 by the Crown Prosecution Service on India’s behalf and by Modi’s lead lawyer, Claire Montgomery.At the last hearing on November 3, citing the December 2018 judgment on the extradition of businessman Vijay Mallya, the court had rejected objections by Modi’s defence team on admitting evidence submitted by the Indian government in the latter’s extradition case.District judge Samuel Goozee said he was bound by the Mallya judgment delivered by chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot, who also dealt with the issue of admissibility of India’s evidence and decided to accept them. He said he would adopt the “approach taken in Mallya”.Statements of several witnesses to Modi’s alleged fraud are part of India’s documentation in the case, including individuals who alleged that they were threatened at the behest of Modi.Modi is the subject of two extradition requests; one processed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the other by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Charges against Modi involve the PNB’s Mumbai branch that extended his companies loans worth over Rs 11,300 crore. The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/ loan agreements); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case, relating to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (“criminal intimidation to cause death”).The magistrates court had cleared Mallya’s extradition in December 2018. His appeals in the high court were also turned down, but the extradition currently awaits resolution of a legal process, widely believed to be an application for asylum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirav-modi-s-uk-jail-remand-extended-again/story-CndLxUmq0dEY0JqHdpCn7L.html

The UK government said that the winter plan will minimise damage to the economy and society, jobs and livelihoods.In its winter plan summary, the government has stated that lifting national restrictions have become possible because the ongoing restrictions have slowed the spread of the virus and eased the pressure on the National Health Service (NHS). On December 2, shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector will reopen regardless of tier.The winter plan also provides for the resumption of collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports. According to the plan, the stay-at-home requirement will end and travel will be allowed, subject to the guidance in each tier. However, the government cautioned that the coronavirus pandemic is still present and that’s why a regional, tiered approach will be introduced.Also Read | Boris Johnson defends ‘tough’ England tiers to buy time for Covid vaccinesWhile Tier 1 indicates ‘medium alert’, Tier 2 and Tier 3 indicate ‘high’ and ‘very high alert’ respectively.

The society is a fellowship of many of the world’s most eminent scientists and is the oldest scientific academy in continuous existence. The new president is statistician Adrian Smith.Delivering the anniversary day address 2020, Ramakrishnan, 68, dwelt on various issues, focusing on the impact of Brexit on science and the ways in which the UK government dealt with the pandemic.He said, “It is not surprising that in this rapidly evolving situation, there were missteps and mistakes. Despite a pandemic being the No. 1 item on the national risk register, we were poorly prepared. We did not take the virus seriously enough, early enough.”“It does not strike me as a coincidence that in January and perhaps even part of February, we were distracted by Brexit and our main focus was on plans for a post-EU Britain. We did not have the PPE needed; we were slow to go into lockdown; we spread infection from our hospitals to our care homes; we did not have the procedures in place to stem infections in hospitals; our understanding of who was being impacted the most was hindered by a failure to gather and understand data – that left some groups more exposed; we had insufficient testing capacity; and we likely went into a second lockdown too late as well, despite scientific advice to the contrary,” he added.Ramakrishnan, who will return to his research role in the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, is a member of the UK government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies that is key to decisions on dealing with the pandemic. He also led groups in Royal Society on issues related to Covid-19.On the impact of Brexit on the UK’s position in science, he said it was vital that London retains highly-skilled scientists working and ensures that talented people from around the world still choose to come and contribute to the country’s globally competitive science. The establishment of the global talent visa has been a significant step, he added.Recalling that he thought of himself as an “unlikely choice” when he was elected president of the society in 2015, he noted the turn of history that eventually led to an Indian-origin scientist leading it.“When I was approached, I must confess I thought of myself as an unlikely choice and made that clear. Ironically, the first fellows to come into contact with India were colonisers like Robert Clive and Warren Hastings, or colonial administrators like Thomas Macaulay and Richard Temple. They certainly did not regard Indians as their equals in any way, and would frankly have been astonished that one day, someone born in India would go on to become a fellow, let alone a president of the Society.“I came to Britain relatively late in life, and spent much of the time since in the confines of the LMB in Cambridge working on ribosomes. I had neither the large networks of someone who grew up here, nor indeed any familiarity with the British establishment.”“So it was particularly broad-minded and generous, and perhaps a bit foolish of you to have entrusted me with this position. I was very touched that you did so, and in turn, I have given it my best in what has been an exceptionally challenging and turbulent five years. Perhaps being a somewhat naïve outsider who tried to see both sides of issues may actually have helped make the case to people of divergent political persuasions,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-was-poorly-prepared-for-covid-19-pandemic-says-venki-ramakrishnan/story-Ma2wHetkT4lllr4Fk98q9H.html
01-12-2020||World||Germany says emergency Covid-19 aid can’t continue indefinitely||Germany can’t continue compensating businesses for lost sales beyond next month and more targeted measures will be needed instead, according to senior officials in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government.Germany has been in partial lockdown since the beginning of November, with restaurants, bars, gyms and cultural venues shut to try to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The restrictions are likely to remain in force into next year, but Economy Minister Peter Altmaier suggested the emergency compensation, which is costing at least 15 billion euros ($18 billion) a month, won’t be extended beyond December.“We certainly won’t be able to continue with these very broad packages which compensate for lost sales,” Altmaier said Monday in an interview with DLF radio. He noted that the government has extended so-called bridge aid for companies until the end of June, which will help pay for fixed costs such as rent and heating.“The state is in a position to act now as we made provisions in the good times, but it’s also true that we can’t continue with these policies for years,” he added. “And we won’t have to, as we’re all hoping that the vaccines are rolled out next year.”Merkel and regional leaders agreed on the latest shutdown measures to try to stem a surge in infections that has taken the total number of cases well beyond 1 million, with more than 16,000 deaths. Cases have almost doubled since the start of November, stretching capacity in intensive care units.Some officials at the federal level have been arguing that the 16 states should make more of a contribution to funding aid measures, a dispute that bubbled to the surface Monday at a meeting of Merkel’s CDU leadership.Ralph Brinkhaus, the head of Merkel’s caucus in the lower house of parliament, had a heated exchange on the issue with Volker Bouffier, the premier of the state of Hesse, according to an official familiar with the discussion who asked not to be identified.Merkel also criticized some state leaders for opening hotels over the Christmas period. The clashes underscore tensions between national policy makers and regional officials about Germany’s strategy in dealing with the virus.‘New Impetus’Altmaier said that the current virus trend is “not the one that we would have liked” and that around 85% of districts still have numbers which are “much too high” to allow for effective contact tracing.Helge Braun, Merkel’s chief of staff, was quoted as saying Monday that support for businesses needs to be more targeted from January and compensating for sales can’t be a long-term strategy.“The decision for November aid was an ad-hoc measure,” Braun said in an interview with Handelsblatt newspaper. If necessary, the government will provide “new impetus” for the economy next year, he added.“We will have to see in the summer,” he said. “If we can get through the winter safely, and a vaccine is available for many people in the spring, then that could boost the economy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-says-emergency-covid-19-aid-can-t-continue-indefinitely/story-b0ioUmuKfALQzhTv2BzhAI.html
01-12-2020||World||Pennsylvania Supreme Court to hear appeal of Bill Cosby’s 2018 sexual assault conviction||The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday will hear a two-pronged appeal of Bill Cosby’s 2018 sexual assault conviction, with the disgraced entertainer’s lawyers asking the justices to either grant him a new trial or drop the case.Cosby’s lawyers blame his conviction in part on the national fervor in 2018 surrounding the #MeToo movement, which sought to hold powerful men accountable for unpunished sexual assaults. Cosby was the first celebrity convicted of sexual abuse after the start of the movement.“The American criminal justice system was designed to convict defendants based upon their conduct - not on their general character,” Cosby’s lawyers argue in their brief. “The fervor of the #MeToo movement rendered this cherished constitutional tenet obsolete at Cosby’s trial.”Cosby, a comedian and actor best known as the lovable father from the 1980s TV hit “The Cosby Show,” was convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault after drugging a former friend, Andrea Constand, in January 2004 at his suburban Philadelphia mansion. At the time Constand was director of operations of Temple University women’s basketball team. Cosby is serving a three-to-ten-year sentence in a state prison near Philadelphia.One prong of Cosby’s appeal, which will be heard virtually by the seven justices because of pandemic restrictions, attacks the decision by Montgomery County Judge Steven O’Neill to allow testimony at the trial by five “prior bad act” witnesses.Prosecutors hoped the testimony of five women who over the years have also accused the entertainer of sexual assault, would show a pattern of behavior by Cosby of befriending younger women with promises of career help and then drugging and raping them.They were among some 50 women who accused Cosby, now 83, of sexual assaults going back decades, though all the accusations but Constand’s were too old to prosecute.Cosby’s legal team, led by Jennifer Bonjean, a Brooklyn lawyer, will argue that the five women’s claims are too dissimilar to Constand’s complaint to have been allowed.His lawyers will also argue that Cosby was given immunity from prosecution by former Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce Castor in 2005 in return for his deposition in Constand’s civil suit.Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele’s legal team, led by Adrienne Jappe, an assistant prosecutor at the 2018 trial, disagrees on both counts.“The trial court properly denied the non-prosecution claim. Its credibility determination and factual-finding that there was no promise is supported by the record. Even if it existed, the district attorney lacked the authority to grant non-statutory immunity,” they write in their brief.Prosecutors note that testimony by the five women and the invalidity of Castor’s supposed non-prosecution agreement with Cosby passed muster both with O’Neill and the Pennsylvania Superior Court, the state’s intermediate appellate court.In December 2019, a Pennsylvania appeals court dismissed Cosby’s bid to overturn his conviction. It is unlikely that the Supreme Court will render a decision on Tuesday. It typically takes weeks or even months to hand down rulings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pennsylvania-supreme-court-to-hear-appeal-of-bill-cosby-s-2018-sexual-assault-conviction/story-I4LBvp6ylwLBn11q9NbSgO.html
01-12-2020||World||Iran’s parliament advances bill to stop nuclear inspections||Iran’s parliament Tuesday advanced a bill that would end UN inspections of its nuclear facilities and require the government to boost its uranium enrichment if European signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal do not provide relief from oil and banking sanctions.The vote to debate the bill, which would need to pas through several other stages before becoming law, was a show of defiance after the killing of a prominent Iranian nuclear scientist last month. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has the final say on all nuclear policies.The official IRNA news agency said 251 lawmakers in the 290-seat chamber voted in favor, after which many began chanting “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel!”The bill would give European countries three months to ease sanctions on Iran’s key oil and gas sector, and to restore its access to the international banking system. The US imposed crippling sanctions on Iran after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear agreement, triggering a series of escalations between the two sides.The bill would have authorities resume enriching uranium to 20%, which is below the threshold needed for nuclear weapons but higher than that required for civilian applications. It would also commission new centrifuges at nuclear facilities at Natanz and the underground Fordo site.Parliament would need to hold another vote to pass the bill, which would also require approval by the Guardian Council, a constitutional watchdog. Lawmakers have pressed for a more confrontational approach since the US withdrew from the nuclear agreement in 2018.Cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei acknowledged the limitations of such an approach on Tuesday, saying the nuclear file is under the authority of the Supreme National Security Council, and “nobody can work on it independently.” President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, heads the council, which answers to the supreme leader.The bill was first tabled in parliament in August but gained new momentum after the killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who headed a program that Israel and the West have alleged was a military operation looking at the feasibility of building a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency says that “structured program” ended in 2003. US intelligence agencies concurred with that assessment in a 2007 report.Israel insists Iran still maintains the ambition of developing nuclear weapons, pointing to Tehran’s ballistic missile program and research into other technologies. Iran long has maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.Iran has blamed Fakhrizadeh’s killing on Israel, which has long waged a covert war against Tehran and its proxies in the region. Israeli officials have declined to comment on the killing, and no one has claimed responsibility.Some Iranian officials have suggested that the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has been regularly inspecting Iran’s nuclear facilities in recent years as part of the 2015 agreement, may have been a source of intelligence for Fakhrizadeh’s killers.Iran began publicly exceeding uranium enrichment levels set by the nuclear agreement after the US restored sanctions. It currently enriches a growing uranium stockpile up to 4.5% purity.That’s still far below weapons-grade levels of 90%, though experts warn Iran now has enough low-enriched uranium to reprocess into fuel for at least two atomic bombs if it chose to pursue them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-parliament-advances-bill-to-stop-nuclear-inspections/story-KpOucLEXSCA8tyGgsU8hWL.html
01-12-2020||World||Brexit from January 1: UK’s new points-based visa system opens||A month before the UK completes the Brexit process and begins a new phase from January 1, 2021, a new points-based immigration system that treats professionals from EU countries at par with those from India and other countries opened on Tuesday.Under the new set-up, designed along the lines of Australia’s points system, points will be awarded for a job offer at the appropriate skill level, knowledge of English and for a minimum salary of £25,600 per year. Skilled worker visas will be awarded to those who gain enough points.When the UK was a member of the EU - it formally left in January this year and is in the transition period - citizens from member-states were able to move and work in the UK under the “freedom of movement” facility. This facility ends with the completion of the Brexit process and the end of the transition period on December 31 this year, making it mandatory for EU citizens to go through the same visa rules as applicable to others.The UK’s home office said that applications can be made online, with decisions expected within three weeks. Applicants will need to have enough money to pay the application fee (ranging from £610 to £1,408), the healthcare surcharge (usually £624 per year), and be able to support themselves (usually by having at least £1,270 available). The visa lasts for up to five years before it needs to be extended.UK home secretary Priti Patel said, “This government promised to end free movement, to take back control of our borders and to introduce a new points-based immigration system. Today, we have delivered on that promise.“This simple, effective and flexible system will ensure employers can recruit the skilled workers they need, while also encouraging employers to train and invest in the UK’s workforce. We are also opening routes for those who have exceptional talent or show exceptional promise in the fields of engineering, science, tech or culture.”Besides the skilled worker visas, other visas also opened on Tuesday, including global talent visas for people who can show they have exceptional talent or exceptional promise in the fields of science, engineering, humanities, medicine, digital technology or arts and culture.Also open are innovator visas for persons seeking to establish businesses in the UK based on innovative, viable and scalable business ideas, and start-up visas for persons seeking to establish businesses in the UK for the first time.The student route and child student route opened on October 5, 2020 to eligible international students from across the globe, the home office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-from-january-1-uk-s-new-points-based-visa-system-opens/story-u15vNPTRlCjFNzpaD2iPGO.html
01-12-2020||World||China #MeToo case heads to court after two year delay||Zhou Xiaoxuan’s says her prestigious internship with Chinese state TV soured after a popular host forcibly kissed her.Outraged, Zhou took the previously taboo step of filing a lawsuit in 2018, joining the global #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. But the ruling Communist Party dislikes such grassroots activism and offers few ways to pursue complaints. Zhou waited two years for a hearing, while the host fought back by filing a defamation lawsuit.On Wednesday, Zhou’s case goes to trial in Beijing, highlighting the growing willingness of Chinese women to speak up about sexual harassment despite official resistance and censorship that eroded #MeToo’s impact.“There are very few sexual harassment cases who have a court hearing,” Zhou said. “We hope each individual case can be a type of push forward.” The ruling party, whose late leader Mao Zedong famously declared, “women hold up half the sky,” has improved their legal and social status but is far from delivering on its promise of equality. In some areas, conditions are deteriorating: Women have disappeared from leadership roles over the past three decades.#MeToo’s global spread helped to encourage activism in China. But that came at a time when President Xi Jinping’s government is tightening controls and stamping out dissent.Women who complain face censorship and official resistance. It was only in 2019 that sexual harassment was added to court regulations as grounds for a suit.Zhou accuses CCTV host Zhu Jun of groping and forcibly kissing her in 2014. She is asking for a public apology as well as 50,000 yuan ($7,600) in damages.In a series of social media posts, she said she was alone with Zhu in his dressing room for a few minutes. She said he tried to reach into her dress and drag her onto himself, and then forcibly kissed her. The posts were shared widely and reposted by many on the Chinese internet and prompted a great amount of media coverage.When Zhou filed suit in 2018, such complaints were treated as labor disputes or under other laws that didn’t relate directly to sexual harassment. Zhou’s was termed a “personality rights dispute.” Her lawyers have asked for it to be heard under the new legal provision that explicitly cites sexual harassment.Zhu, the CCTV host, has denied the allegations. A call to his phone wasn’t answered. A person who answered at the number in public records for the law firm that represents him said the firm had moved and had no new number.Zhu has a countersuit pending against Zhou asking for damages of 650,000 yuan ($100,000).Zhou expressed hope her case will show “there are problems in the legal process.” The movement took off in 2018 in China when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual harassment.In a rare victory, a woman who used the alias Liu Li won a sexual harassment suit against her former boss in July. The boss, a social worker in the western city of Chengdu, was required to issue a public apology but no damages were awarded.Activists want more legislative changes and legal tools.“No matter what the result is, we feel that doing this has meaning,” Zhou said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-metoo-case-heads-to-court-after-two-year-delay/story-uDOEKg0ccxgepy7zDdH6qK.html
01-12-2020||World||On World AIDS Day, South Africa finds hope in new treatment||Health officials are hoping that new, long-acting drugs to help prevent HIV infection will be a turning point for the fight against a global health threat that’s been eclipsed by the coronavirus pandemic.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa highlighted the new drug in a weekly newsletter, saying the long-term acting and injectable HIV drug has “the potential to significantly strengthen our response to the epidemic.”The region is especially hard-hit. South Africa has the biggest epidemic in the world with 7.7 million people living with HIV, according to UNAIDS.In separate studies of men and women earlier this year, including one by the HIV Prevention Trials Network and the Reproductive Health and HIV Institute (RHI) at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa, the drug — Cabotegravir — had successful trials. The shot given every two months has been proven to be 90% more effective than the daily pill known as PrEP.Ramaphosa’s message noted, however, that South Africa’s battle against HIV had suffered because of the coronavirus pandemic and the resultant strain on health services, a situation repeated in many countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS.In her World AIDS Day message, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima lamented the fact that more than 12 million people are still waiting to get on HIV treatment, while 1.7 million people were infected with HIV in 2019 because of lack of access.She called on companies to “openly share their technology and know-how and to waive their intellectual property rights” so that the world can produce vaccines, including for Covid-19, at the scale required. There is no vaccine for HIV.She also stressed that the global AIDS response was off track even before Covid-19 and the world needed to reset its targets if it is to meet the goal of ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.The response against Covid-19 has shown what can be achieved by working together, UNAIDS said.Fears that the world is losing focus on the AIDS epidemic were reflected by figures in South Africa that showed 225,000 HIV/AIDS patients in the country’s largest province of Gauteng had discontinued their vital anti-retroviral treatment this year, partly but not only because of difficulties accessing care during the virus pandemic.Yet, amid the stark figures, health officials and women, hold onto hope that cabotegravir could mean less visits to health centers as many look to reduce exposure to Covid-19.Dr. Sinead Delany-Moretlwe, director of research at the Johannesburg-based RHI, said women in sub-Saharan Africa, who are disproportionately affected, were among those who will benefit significantly from the drug.Some research suggests women may be at greater risk of getting HIV through sex than men are, but Delany-Moretlwe added that social issues also contribute significantly to their increased risk.“Women do not always have power in relationships, and up until fairly recently, negotiated condom use was a challenge particularly in relationships where women rely on their partners for financial support or where the threat of violence is enough to keep women quiet,” said Delany-Moretlwe.Women such as 26-year-old Khanyiswa Kwatsha, who is currently taking the daily PrEP pill and promotes it among young women, are eagerly anticipating access to the new treatment, saying it will be much easier for them to protect themselves with an injectable drug they only have to take every eight weeks.“I am very happy because drinking a pill every day is not easy, while you know that you are not sick but you are drinking it to protect yourself,” Kwatsha said. She said that while PrEP has been pivotal, this new injectable drug will make life easier.The clinical trials were conducted among more than 3,200 women at research sites in South Africa, Uganda, Eswatini, Kenya, Malawi, Botswana and Zimbabwe.Cabotegravir is being developed by ViiV Healthcare, which is mostly owned by GlaxoSmithKline, with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited. The study was sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and ViiV. The drugs were provided by ViiV and Truvada’s maker, Gilead Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-world-aids-day-south-africa-finds-hope-in-new-treatment/story-MwoYG7oNiizoLZbUvfe8xM.html

01-12-2020||World||Cambridge’s chemistry department named after Indian scientist Yusuf Hamied||The department at the University of Cambridge where Indian scientist Yusuf Hamied, chairman of pharma major Cipla, studied has been named the Yusuf Hamied department of chemistry until 2050, the university announced on Tuesday.Hamied, 84, who was a student at Christ’s College, has retained close links with Cambridge over the past 66 years, the university said, adding that in 2018, he endowed one of the world’s oldest academic chairs in chemistry, now known as the Yusuf Hamied 1702 chair.The naming of the department follows a “generous benefaction” from Hamied, whose father, K A Hamied, started Cipla in Mumbai. He has pioneered the supply of HIV/AIDS medicines to developing countries at lost cost.He said, “Cambridge gave me the foundation of an education in chemistry, taught me how to live and showed me how to contribute to society. As a scholarship student myself, I am delighted to be able to support future generations of students. I will always be indebted to this great institution and everything it stands for.”The university said that Hamied’s gift endows both a fund to attract and support the world’s brightest academic talent in chemistry, including exceptional early career researchers in disciplines such as synthetic organic chemistry, and outstanding doctoral students from the UK and around the world through the new Hamied Scholars Programme.Vice-chancellor Stephen J Toope said, “Yusuf Hamied has demonstrated an unequivocal commitment to changing and improving lives since his time at Cambridge. I am profoundly grateful for his remarkable gift to the department of chemistry, which will benefit generations of students and researchers.”Hamied’s honours include an honorary fellowship of Christ’s College in 2004; the Padma Bhushan in 2005; an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2012; and an honorary Doctorate of Science from the University of Cambridge in 2014. In 2019, he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy.Head of the chemistry department James Keeler said, “We are extremely thankful to Dr Hamied for his visionary support for Chemistry at Cambridge, which will allow us to respond flexibly to future opportunities. His gift will ensure we continue to attract outstanding scientists who will make the discoveries that help tackle some of the most pressing challenges in global society.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cambridge-s-chemistry-department-named-after-indian-scientist-yusuf-hamied/story-iJCd5JzG4HvijmGrY7wQcL.html
01-12-2020||World||‘Google map of universe’: Australian scientists map millions of galaxies||A group of Australian scientists have mapped around three million galaxies in just 300 hours to create a “new atlas of the universe”, said a new study. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) said on Tuesday that its new telescope, Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), conducted its first survey of the entire southern sky in “record speed and detail.”CSIRO, the national science agency, said in a statement that the survey is like a “Google map of the Universe” in which most of the star-like points are distant galaxies. The design and initial results of the study has been published in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia. CSIRO chief executive Dr Larry Marshall said ASKAP generate more raw data at a faster rate than Australia’s entire internet traffic.“In a time when we have access to more data than ever before, ASKAP and the supercomputers that support it are delivering unparalleled insights and wielding the tools that will underpin our data-driven future to make life better for everybody.Also Read | NASA shares pic of nebula taken by Hubble telescope. Can you spot something else in it?According to CSIRO, the new data will enable astronomers to study and analyse the huge number of galaxies the same way social scientists use information from a national census. David McConnell, the lead author and CSIRO astronomer, said that the astronomers from around the world will be able to use the survey to explore the unknown and study how galaxies and their supermassive black holes evolve and interact.“For the first time, ASKAP has flexed its full muscles, building a map of the Universe in greater detail than ever before, and at record speed. We expect to find tens of millions of new galaxies in future surveys,” McConnell said in a statement.What is ASKAP?ASKAP is a new type of radio telescope, designed and built by CSIRO, which makes images of radio signals from the sky, enabling astronomers to view the universe at wavelengths that our eyes cannot see. CSIRO’s telescope is a collection of 36 dish antennas spread out over six kilometres in remote outback Western Australia. The telescope creates high-resolution images by combining the signals from 36 smaller dish antennas at a much lower cost than using a single large dish antenna, said the agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-map-of-universe-australian-scientists-map-millions-of-galaxies/story-3sHa1CHoeoQPap6kyB6ByI.html
01-12-2020||World||Brexit talks still stuck because EU is asking too much, UK says||Brexit trade talks are stuck on fishing, governance rules and dispute resolution because the European Union is asking too much of Britain, a senior member of the British government said on Tuesday.Just 30 days before Britain leaves the EU’s orbit following a transition period since it formally quit the bloc, the sides are trying to agree a trade deal to avoid a turbulent rupture that could snarl almost $1 trillion in annual trade.With each side urging the other to compromise, a French official said Britain must clarify its positions and “really negotiate”, and cautioned that the EU would not accept a “substandard deal”. Even if a trade accord is secured, it is likely to be just a narrow deal on goods, and some disruption is almost certain as border controls are erected between the world’s biggest trading block and Britain.Talks have snagged on fishing in Britain’s rich waters, on what EU rules London will accept and on how any dispute might be resolved.“The EU still wants to take the lion’s share of the fishing in our waters - which is just not fair given that we are leaving the EU,” Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and a senior ally of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, told Sky.“The EU still want us to be tied to their way of doing things,” Gove said. “The EU are at the moment reserving the right, if there is any sort of dispute, not quite to rip everything up but to impose some really penal and tough restrictions on us, and we don’t think that’s fair.”A trade deal would not only safeguard trade but also buttress peace in British-ruled Northern Ireland, though some disruption is almost certain at the busiest EU-UK border points.Failure to secure a deal would snarl borders, spook financial markets and disrupt delicate supply chains that stretch across Europe and beyond -- just as the world grapples with the vast economic cost of the COVID-19 outbreak.Gove said the process was close to conclusion but avoided repeating an earlier prediction of a 66% probability of a deal. He declined to put a figure on the probability.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe’s most powerful national leader, has said some of the EU’s 27 member states are getting impatient. “The priority is for the British to clarify their positions and really negotiate to find a deal,” a French presidency official told Reuters. “The EU also has interests to fight for, those of a fair competition for its businesses and those of its fishermen.”“The Union has made a clear and balanced offer for a future partnership with Britain. We will not accept a substandard deal which would not respect our own interests,” the official said.Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said a deal could be done this week.“There is a landing zone for an agreement,” Martin told the Irish Times in an interview. “We are now really in the endgame if a deal is to be arrived at this week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-talks-still-stuck-because-eu-is-asking-too-much-uk-says/story-oaSk3C1Snq1cVKpWnNUPCI.html
01-12-2020||World||China’s fight with Australia risks backfiring as Biden era nears||China’s economic offensive against Australia is partly designed to warn countries against vocally opposing Beijing’s interests, particularly with Joe Biden looking to unite US allies. Yet it’s already showing signs of backfiring.China last week imposed anti-dumping duties of up to 212% on Australian wine, the latest in a slew of measures curbing imports from coal to copper to barley. Tensions escalated further on Monday after a Chinese Foreign Ministry official tweeted a fake photo of an Australian soldier holding a knife to the throat of an Afghan child.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison quickly called on China to apologize for the “repugnant” tweet. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, in turn, questioned whether he lacks “a sense of right and wrong” and said overall ties deteriorated because Australia “took wrong measures on issues bearing on China’s core interests.”To Beijing, the attacks on Australia are meant to deter others like Canada, the European Union and Japan from joining a U.S.-led campaign to counter China’s rise. Communist Party officials see Morrison’s government as one of their most vocal critics, and an easy target: China accounts for about 35% of Australia’s total trade, three times more than the next highest country, Japan. Australia accounts for less than 4% of China’s commerce.“It is only natural that China wants to sound some precautionary alarm” to warn countries off building an anti-China alliance, said Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at Nanjing University. “After all, confrontation is the least wanted by the world now.”China is betting that most Western countries will avoid provoking Beijing and risking the kind of trade retaliation Australia is suffering, particularly with their economies weighed down by the pandemic. At the same time, it has sought to strengthen ties with Japan, South Korea and nations in Southeast Asia, in part by offering more trade, investment in 5G networks and access to Covid-19 vaccines.Yet China’s moves are adding to worries about its use of economic coercion, and could end up pushing middle powers closer to the US camp. President-elect Biden has vowed to rebuild relationships with allies damaged by Donald Trump’s “America First” policies, which in turn would make it more palatable for some allies to align more closely with his administration.“Biden is planning is to resume US international policy after a four-year hiccup,” said Jeff Moon, the US’s assistant trade representative for China for part of the Obama administration, adding that the scope of China’s actions against Australia was “breathtaking.”“The leverage is to work together,” he added. “That is what they most fear, and they see that coming.”While it’s still unclear how exactly that would work, several key groupings including the Quad -- the US, Japan, Australia and India -- as well as Five Eyes -- the US, Australia, UK, Canada and New Zealand -- have been revived in recent years. New initiatives have also been floated, including one that would give countries an alternative to Huawei Technologies Co. for 5G networks and another that would find alternative supply chains to China.The Wall Street Journal reported in November that the Trump administration was formulating a joint retaliation plan that would allow the West to push back against the kind of economic coercion China is inflicting on Australia. The European Union also plans to call on the US to seize a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to forge a new global alliance that would counter China, the Financial Times reported Monday, citing a set of draft policy proposals.For its part, the Trump administration is continuing to pressure China with moves to prevent some of its biggest companies from accessing American technology. Senior officials have also stepped up visits to Asia ahead of the planned inauguration for Biden on Jan. 20: Following a visit to Japan in November, National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said leaders in Tokyo saw the Quad as a “game changer.”“China against any individual country, including quite powerful countries like South Korea or Thailand or even Japan, China would be dominant,” said Malcolm Rifkind, a former British foreign secretary. “But in the real world when you have such a situation, your potential victims join up to ensure a collective and coordinated response.”‘Evil’ AustraliaPart of China’s aggressive response is for a domestic audience. State news agency Xinhua carried a commentary that called Morrison’s request for an apology “utterly absurd,” while the Communist Party’s Global Times called Australia “evil” in an editorial. Social media users on Weibo and Wechat commended Hua, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, for exuding the “style of a great power” in her responses to repeated questions by foreign journalists.Still, in an early sign that Beijing’s Afghan tweet may have galvanized some of Australia’s partners into responding, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that her own diplomats had directly registered concern with Chinese authorities over the “unfactual post.” China rejected that, with Hua telling reporters in Beijing that she was “astonished” to hear about New Zealand’s comments.Lawmakers in the U.K. also condemned China’s actions, with former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith urging Britain to do more to stand with Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. A group he’s a member of consisting of lawmakers from a range of countries released a video urging people to drink Australian wine to stand up to China’s bullying.Beijing has also sought to distinguish between countries that step out of line, in effect playing them off each other. Earlier this year the Global Times said China should deliver “public and painful” retaliation to the U.K. for banning Huawei but avoid a full-fledged confrontation because it saw Britain as the “weak link” in the Five Eyes.In a phone call with his EU counterpart Josep Borrell last week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also signaled the bloc should think twice before strengthening ties with the incoming Biden administration, as the two sides look to complete an investment treaty by the end of the year. “Strategic autonomy is a necessary character for staying independent,” Wang said, adding that it involves “opposing man-made ‘decoupling’, opposing confrontation among different blocs and a new ‘Cold War.’”Australia, on the other hand, has faced China’s unabashed wrath ever since Morrison’s government called for Beijing to allow independent investigators into Wuhan to discover the origins of Covid-19. Chen Hong, director of the Australian Studies Centre at East China Normal University who said he had his visa to Australia revoked this year because he was labeled a national security risk, said Australia’s actions differentiated it from New Zealand, which maintained relatively good ties with Beijing.“Australia has been purposefully echoing the Washington’s anti-China policy and coordinated with Trump’s strategic intentions,” Chen said.Call for TalksIn Canberra, Australian officials have said Morrison’s government is speaking out for its own interests regardless of the U.S. on issues like China’s increasing grip over Hong Kong and assertiveness in the South China Sea. Morrison himself has also sought to portray Australia as stuck in the middle of the U.S. and China -- a view also shared by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who said in an interview in November that many nations in Asia aren’t keen to join an anti-China bloc.Even after he called on China to apologize for the Afghan tweet on Monday, Morrison again sought to restart talks with Beijing without conditions. The next day he also warned government lawmakers against further amplifying the fight over the image, according to Australian Associated Press.“Countries around the world are watching this, they are seeing how Australia is seeking to resolve these issues and they are seeing these responses,” Morrison told reporters on Monday. “This impacts not just on the relationship here, but with so many other sovereign nations not only in our own region, but like-minded countries around the world.”The spat has only hardened attitudes toward China within Australia, to the point where even business groups have stopped pushing for warmer ties, according to Natasha Kassam, a former Australian diplomat who worked in China and is now a research fellow at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute. At the same time, she said, it’s “impossible to imagine” China apologizing to Australia.“While there may be an emboldening of countries in the region responding to China,” she said, “it’s equally likely that a number of countries will see the way in which Australia’s export industry has been punished and think twice about making their own criticisms.”(Updates with comments from Chinese spokeswoman in 16th paragraph, reports about PM Scott Morrison in fourth-to-last paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-fight-with-australia-risks-backfiring-as-biden-era-nears/story-04Cav1b8izS6RytXuzIcMP.html

The proposal still requires final approval by parliament and the Guardian Council that vets laws.In accordance with the multi-party nuclear pact struck five years ago, Iran agreed to give United Nations inspectors more intrusive access to atomic sites.Also Read | Air strike kills Iranian commander at Iraq-Syria border: OfficialsThe draft legislation would also revive the mothballed core of a contentious reactor and increase Iran’s stockpile of uranium enriched to 20%, which could then be purified to weapons-grade material at short notice.The legislation was first proposed in early November as a signal to the US ahead of its presidential election, but the conservative-majority parliament fast-tracked it after a top Iranian nuclear scientist was assassinated on Friday in an attack Iran blamed on Israel.US President-elect Joe Biden has said he aims to rejoin the agreement President Donald Trump quit two years ago, provided Iran returns to the full compliance it abandoned in response to the US withdrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-moves-ahead-on-bill-that-could-end-nuclear-inspections/story-Cjfh7c4ljDIdBVbrgBTvbL.html

Despite the high deficit, the government is preparing to spend up to an additional C$100 billion ($77.2 billion) to boost an economy that has been impact by the coronavirus crisis.“This recession is worse than 2008,” the statement said, adding, “It stands to reason we will need to invest more, not less.”The deficit is expected to touch C$381.6 billion by March next year. It could, however, increase as the country is now in the grip of a second wave of infections, sparking fresh curbs in some provinces.An official statement issued by the country’s finance department said that once the virus is under control, the government will “invest in a growth plan” of about 3-4% of GDP, between up to C$70-100 billion over a period of three years to “jump-start” the country’s “recovery”.“Time-limited investments will build Canada out of this recession towards an economy that is cleaner, more inclusive, more innovative and more competitive,” the statement added.The statement quoted Freeland as saying, “We will do whatever it takes to help Canadians through this crisis. We will invest in every necessary public health measure. We will support Canadians and Canadian businesses in a way that is targeted and effective. And we will ensure the Canadian economy that emerges from this pandemic is greener, more inclusive, more innovative, and more competitive than the one that preceded it, with a stronger, more resilient middle-class.”According to projections, the fiscal deficit will not return to pre-Covid-19 levels till 2026. It has also far outstripped the deficit recorded during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Canada rose by 6,103 to reach 377,806, while the death toll is at 12,130.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-effect-canada-facing-all-time-high-deficit-of-c-381-billion/story-PIH4A301Hgy0NeIuTurrcK.html

The 44 in their name stands for the fourth letter in the alphabet, DD, and is an abbreviation for Division Dirlewanger. Oskar Dirlewanger was a known Nazi war criminal and commander of a Nazi SS special unit.The far-right group was founded in 2016. It is known for possessing illegal weapons and members have participated in far-right protests.Earlier this year, the German government banned other far-right groups including the Combat 18 and the Nordadler, dpa reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-bans-far-right-pro-nazi-group-police-raid-homes/story-F318ldWzmCfRxogwGErDRN.html
01-12-2020||World||Nobel laureate says pandemic raising violence, trafficking||Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nadia Murad said the coronavirus pandemic has increased trafficking of women and gender-based violence, leaving the health and safety of women “on the line.”The 27-year-old activist, who was forced into sexual slavery by Islamic State fighters in Iraq, said curfews, lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed by governments to slow the spread of the virus “have had unintended consequences on women worldwide.”“Rather than reducing human trafficking and gender-based violence, the pandemic has increased the risk of exploitation and brutality against those most vulnerable,” she said. “Numerous countries have seen increases in reports of domestic violence since the pandemic began.”Murad said domestic tensions have intensified in confined living spaces, and stay-at-home orders “are increasing human trafficking farther underground, out of sight of law enforcement.”“The few resources designated for prevention, rescue and rehabilitation are being stretched thin,” she said. “As a result, women’s health and safety are on the line. It is now difficult for many women to access psychological support (and) health care.”A member of Iraq’s Yazidi minority, Murad was among thousands of women and girls who were captured and forced into sexual slavery by Islamic State militants in 2014. Her mother and six brothers were killed by IS fighters in Iraq. She became an activist on behalf of women and girls after escaping and finding refuge in Germany and shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018.Also Read | Covid-19 crisis widens gap between Russia’s richest and poorest regionsMurad spoke virtually at a UN meeting Monday titled “Locked Down and Locked-In: Standing Against Sexual Violence and Human Trafficking during the Covid-19 Pandemic.” It was organized by Nadia’s Initiative, the nonprofit organization she founded in 2018 that advocates for survivors of sexual violence and aims to rebuild communities in crisis, along with UN Women and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).Murad, a UNODC goodwill ambassador for trafficking survivors, noted that Monday was International Women Human Rights Defenders Day, and expressed hope that the spotlight would “amplify the urgent need to combat gender-based violence and human trafficking.”Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the head of UN Women, said 72% of trafficking victims detected globally are women and girls -- and 77% of identified female survivors were trafficked for sexual exploitation.The Covid-19 pandemic will push 47 million more women and girls into extreme poverty, she said, “but business is booming for the traffickers.”“During pandemic lockdowns, two-thirds of anti-trafficking workers reported seeing an increase in online recruitment by traffickers for the purpose of sexual exploitation online,” Mlambo-Ngcuka said.She said the pandemic has reduced access to health care and compromised the capacity of governments and the United Nations “to report on violations, provide protection and combat impunity.”Mlambo-Ngcuka called for urgent and coordinated global action and cited one promising response -- 146 countries answered UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ call for measures to prevent violence against women and girls and promote “peace in the home” as part of their plans to tackle Covid-19.Actress and activist Ashley Judd, a UN Population Fund goodwill ambassador, criticized “the toxic masculinity” taught to men and boys who attack and sexually exploit women.“I am looking forward to the day when we have no sexual and gender-based violence, especially under Covid, from which to be resilient,” she said in a virtual speech.Germany’s Foreign Office Minister of State Michelle Müntefering said the coronavirus makes fighting for gender equality even more important.“We will not allow sexual and gender-based violence and human trafficking to slip into the shadow,” she said, pledging support to Murad and others “who fight for just and equitable societies every day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-laureate-says-pandemic-raising-violence-trafficking/story-2pZdONF3wMBvjK6nGvo0uM.html

The situation is concerning,” he said, in the first comments his government has made on the issue.“Canada will always be there to defend the right to peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns,” he added.Trudeau said it was understandable that there were members of the Sikh community in Canada who were concerned about their friends and family in India, which was a “reality” for many of them. He made these remarks during the event that also featured all three Sikh ministers in his Cabinet, diversity, inclusion and youth minister Bardish Chagger; innovation, science and industry minister Navdeep Bains; and defence minister Harjit Sajjan.Trudeau’s comments followed statements made in Canada’s House of Commons by MPs who criticised “violence” in India against the protesting farmers, who are mainly from Punjab. Among those that spoke in this context were Liberal MP Ruby Sahota and Conservative MP Tim Uppal.This came after the leader of the opposition New Democratic Party Jagmeet Singh had remarked that the “violence perpetrated” by the Indian government against “peacefully protesting” farmers as “appalling”. He said that he stood in “solidarity” with the farmers and called upon the Indian government to “engage in peaceful dialogue” with them.Indian officials have not formally reacted to the statements coming out of Canada, and from the country’s prime minister. However, the Twitter handle for the Indian High Commission in Ottawa posted a set of infographics, saying, “Busting some myths around the farm bills. Don’t fall for fake information!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farmers-protest-in-india-is-concerning-says-canadian-pm-justin-trudeau/story-t7FUtuEoLD7vzpmzBEGwdK.html
01-12-2020||World||Thousands flee as activity in Indonesian volcanoes increases||Indonesian authorities are closely monitoring several volcanoes after sensors picked up increased activity in recent weeks, prompting the evacuation of thousands of people.Hot ash tumbled as far as 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) down the slopes of Mount Semeru early Tuesday, triggering panic among villagers, said Raditya Jati, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman. Falling ash and sulfur blanketed several villages around its slopes.The 3,676-meter (12,060-feet) mountain in Lumajang district is the highest volcano on Indonesia’s most densely island of Java.Jati said authorities are still trying to evacuate about 550 people living on the mountain’s slopes. There were no reports of injuries or serious damage, he said.Indonesia’s Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center did not raise Semeru’s alert status, which already was at the third-highest level since it began erupting in May. Villagers and tourists are advised to stay 4 kilometers (2.4 miles) from the crater, the agency said.Tuesday’s eruption came two days after Mount Ili Lewotolok shot out columns of hot clouds as high as 4,000 meters (13,100 feet) into the sky. More than 4,600 people were evacuated from the slopes of the mountain, located on Lembata island in East Nusa Tenggara province.The volcanology agency raised Ili Lewotolok’s alert to the second-highest level on Sunday after sensors picked up increased activity. The 1,423-meter (4,660-foot) mountain has been rumbling since October 2017.The Transportation Ministry said a flight warning was issued after the eruption and a local airport was closed as ash rained down on many areas of the island.In another part of Java island, authorities have evacuated more than 1,800 people living on the volatile Mount Merapi volcano’s fertile slopes since early November following an increase in volcanic activity.Local administrations in Central Java and Yogyakarta provinces are closely monitoring the mountain after the geological agency raised Merapi’s alert to the second-highest level and people were advised to stay 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the crater.The 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) mountain is about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Yogyakarta city center. About a quarter million people live within a 10-kilometer (6-mile) radius of the volcano.Merapi spewed ash and hot gas as high as 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) into the sky in June, but no casualties were reported. Its last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people and caused the evacuation of 20,000 villagers.Authorities in North Sumatra province are also closely monitoring Mount Sinabung after sensors picked up increasing activity since August. Villagers were advised to stay 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the crater and be aware of the peril of lava.Mirzam Abdurrahman, a volcanologist from the Bandung Institute of Technology, said volcanic activity can increase relatively simultaneously in the different mountains with the same triggers, because the volcanoes are in the same Sunda Arc which covers the islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara.The mountains are among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines around the Pacific Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-flee-as-activity-in-indonesian-volcanoes-increases/story-ht9WnuM4iLq6DMJ5ptMJeN.html
01-12-2020||World||New Zealand joins Australia in denouncing China’s tweet||New Zealand has joined Australia in denouncing a graphic tweet posted by a Chinese official that shows a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child’s throat.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday that New Zealand has voiced its concerns directly with Chinese authorities.“This is an image that wasn’t factual. It wasn’t correct. And so in keeping with our principled position where images like that are used, we will raise those concerns and we’ll do it directly,” Ardern told reporters.China has not backed down from the tweet and said there will be no apology.Ardern’s criticism was more muted than Australia’s. She faced an awkward choice of how far to get involved in a conflict between New Zealand’s closest ally, Australia, and its biggest trading partner, China.Also Read |  ‘Need to know origin of novel coronavirus, let’s not politicize probe’: WHO chief TedrosAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday called the image “repugnant” and demanded an apology from the Chinese government. The post took aim at alleged abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.The incident is further souring already tense relations between Australia and China.The image, which appeared to show the soldier slitting the child’s throat, was posted by Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry. He wrote a caption with his tweet: “Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.” He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia’s military earlier this month which found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the Afghanistan conflict. The report recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.Asked about the issue at a daily briefing, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying cast blame on the Australian side.“What Australia should do is to reflect deeply, bring the perpetrators to justice, make a formal apology to the Afghan people, and solemnly promise to the international community that they will never commit such terrible crimes again,” Hua said.Morrison said Zhao’s tweet was “utterly outrageous” and a terrible slur against Australia’s military.It “is truly repugnant. It is deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform,” he told reporters in Canberra. “The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world’s eyes.” Morrison said his government contacted Twitter asking it to take the post down. The post had a warning tag on it on Tuesday but could still be viewed. Zhao’s account comes with a Twitter label stating that it’s a Chinese government account.Despite China blocking Twitter and other US social media platforms within the county, Chinese diplomats and state media have established a strong presence on them.Zhao was criticised by the US in March after tweeting a conspiracy theory that US soldiers may have brought the coronavirus to China. He is considered a leading representative of China’s high-pitched new strain of assertive foreign relations.Morrison acknowledged there were tensions between China and Australia.“But this is not how you deal with them,” he said. “Australia has patiently sought to address the tensions that exist in our relationship in a mature way, in a responsible way, by seeking engagement at both leader and ministerial level.” The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-joins-australia-in-denouncing-china-s-tweet/story-gQKZcIqasNunpEmc3fkaPN.html

01-12-2020||World||UN warns the Coronavirus pandemic will fan ‘darkest’ surge in humanitarian needs in 2021||The United Nations(UN) humanitarian office says needs for assistance have ballooned to unprecedented levels this year because of Covid-19, projecting that a staggering 235 million people will require help in 2021.This comes as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and global challenges including conflicts, forced migration and the impact of global warming.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, expects a 40% increase in the number of people in need of such assistance in 2021 compared to this year — a sign that pain, suffering and torment brought by the coronavirus outbreak and other problems could get worse even if hopes of a vaccine are rising.OCHA made the projections in its latest annual Global Humanitarian Overview on Tuesday, saying its hopes to reach 160 million of those people in need will cost $35 billion. That’s more than twice the record $17 billion that donors have provided for the international humanitarian response so far this year — and a target figure that is almost certain to go unmet.“The picture we’re painting this year is the bleakest and darkest perspective on humanitarian needs we’ve ever set out, and that’s because the pandemic has reaped carnage across the most fragile and vulnerable countries on the planet,” said UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock, who heads OCHA.“For the first time since the 1990s, extreme poverty is going to increase, life expectancy will fall, the annual death toll from HIV, tuberculosis and malaria is set to double,” he said. “We fear a near doubling in the number of people facing starvation.”Lowcock told a UN briefing in New York on the overview that he thinks the UN appeal will probably raise a record $20 billion by the end of the year -- $2 billion more than last year. But he said the gap between needs and funding is growing and the UN is looking to “new players” coming on the scene in 2021, including US President-elect Joe Biden’s new administration.The UN aims to reach about two-thirds of those in need, with the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations trying to meet the rest, Lowcock explained.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said humanitarian aid budgets are now facing dire shortfalls as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to worsen, and said extreme poverty has risen for the first time in more than a generation.“The lives of people in every nation and corner of the world have been upended by the impact of the pandemic,” he said. “Those already living on a knife’s edge are being hit disproportionately hard by rising food prices, falling incomes, interrupted vaccination programs, and school closures.”The overview, which is billed as one of the most comprehensive looks of the world’s humanitarian needs, has put together nearly three dozen individual response plans for a total of 56 “vulnerable” countries.Lowcock said the biggest problem is in Yemen where there is danger of “a large-scale famine” now, saying a prime reason is lack of funding from Gulf countries that were major donors in the past which has led to cuts in aid and the closing of clinics.He said the biggest financial request is for the Syrian crisis and its spillover to neighbouring countries where millions of Syrians have fled to escape the more than nine-year conflict.OCHA said other countries in need include Afghanistan, Congo, Haiti, Nigeria, South Sudan, Ukraine, and Venezuela. Newcomers to this year’s list are Mozambique, where extremist activity has increased in the north, Pakistan and Zimbabwe.Lowcock said it’s not the pandemic, but its economic impact that’s having the greatest effect on humanitarian needs.“These all hit the poorest people in the poorest countries hardest of all,” he said. “For the poorest, the hangover from the pandemic will be long and hard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-the-coronavirus-pandemic-will-fan-darkest-surge-in-humanitarian-needs-in-2021/story-ckG4YBQVOUssIYT1QZDI5J.html

The latest to keep the buzz alive is a mysterious structure’s existence and retreat.This structure - a monolith - was detected in the US desert of Utah weeks ago. But now, in an interesting turn of events, the structure has disappeared from Utah and a similar monolith has surfaced in Romania. The monolith’s mystery has made the brains of conspiracy theorists run amok. Speculations that celestial creatures are behind this phenomenon is all over the internet.The Daily mail reported that the 13 ft-metallic pillar in a triangular shape was found close to an archaic landmark Petrodava Dacian Fortress in Romania’s Piatra Neamt.The newly discovered monolith in the heritage part of Romania has a mirrored surface and appears to be adorned graffiti as well. So the #Monolith first appeared in #Utah and then disappeared yesterday. Then seemingly instantly appeared on the other side of the globe in less than 24 hours in #Romania ?!?!? pic.twitter.com/MrgG3La5vEThe ‘first’ monolith that was discovered in the remote desert went viral due to its sparkling resemblance to the work of the artist John McCracken that made its cameo in the ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’.On the disappearance of the quirky geological structure, the US Bureau of Land management in a statement said that the monolith was removed by an “unknown party”.The monolith’s appearance has also baffled Romania’s authorities. “It is on private property, but we still don’t know who the monolith’s owner is yet. It is in a protected area on an archaeological site. Before installing something there, they needed permission from our institution, one that must then be approved by the Ministry of Culture,” Neamt Culture and Heritage official Rocsana Josanu told The Daily Mail.Such bizarre mysteries have been generating a lot of comments on Twitter and other social media platforms.“No one else thinks that it is noteworthy that on the same night that Darth Vader died, the recently-discovered mysterious 12 foot tall metallic monolith, that had been anchored 3 feet deep into a base of solid bedrock in the remote Utah desert disappears?” one user tweeted.Others were disheartened by the disappearance of the monolith from Utah. “Well this made me absolutely cry. Can we not have nice things?!? Must 2020 take away even the small glints of joy?!? tweeted another user.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/monolith-appears-in-romania-after-a-suspenseful-disappearance-of-the-structure-from-utah/story-MWmzYYZziaPpIDNQxhSHZO.html

01-12-2020||World||Canada PM Trudeau expresses concern at farmers’ protest; India says remarks ‘unwarranted’||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday that Ottawa has conveyed its concerns about the protest by Indian farmers to New Delhi, but the external affairs ministry dismissed his remarks as “unwarranted” as they pertained to the country’s internal affairs. Trudeau made the remarks while participating in a Facebook video interaction organised by Canadian MP Bardish Chagger to mark Guruparb or the 551st birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion. The event was joined by Canadian ministers Navdeep Bains and Harjit Sajjan and members of the Sikh community. In his opening remarks during the interaction, Trudeau said: “I would be remiss if I didn’t start also by recognising the news coming out of India about the protest by farmers. The situation is concerning and we’re all very worried about family and friends. “I know that’s a reality for many of you. Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the right of peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns.” Hours later, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in a brief statement: “We have seen some ill-informed comments by Canadian leaders relating to farmers in India. Such comments are unwarranted, especially when pertaining to the internal affairs of a democratic country.” Also read | Farmers’ protest: All you need to knowSrivastava added, “It is also best that diplomatic conversations are not misrepresented for political purposes.” People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Trudeau’s comments appeared to be aimed at Canada’s influential Indian-origin diaspora. Trudeau also referred to the Covid-19 pandemic and said this “is a moment for all of us to pull together”. He added, “We’re going to be there to continue to work together as we are there to help each other out.” He also said it was important to remember Guru Nanak’s teachings of compassion, equality and selfless service, which are at the heart of both Sikhism and Canadian values. Trudeau is probably the first world leader to comment on the protest by Indian farmers, which entered its fifth day on Monday. The protest is aimed at against a set of laws to liberalise farm trade and open up agricultural markets. The Union government has offered talks to the protestors camping at New Delhi’s borders, but they have insisted on the repeal of the laws. The comments weren’t seen favourably in New Delhi, especially at a time when both India and Canada have been taking steps to restore normalcy to bilateral ties that were hit by Trudeau’s perceived softness on pro-Khalistan activists in Canada during his first term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farmers-protest-canada-pm-trudeau-expresses-concern/story-TIi2M7BnDN9NCqlhUddV1K.html

Here is everything you need to know about Biden’s possible pick: Who is Rahm Emanuel?Emanuel, a former three-term congressman who served as Barack Obama’s first White House chief of staff and was a senior adviser in Bill Clinton’s administration, has been a significant force in Democratic Party politics for much of the last three decades. He also turned reviving Chicago’s ragged public transportation system and overhauling the city’s two busy, worn airports into a top issue during his eight years as mayor. Why is Emanuel considered as a controversial pick?Emanuel announced in September 2018 that he would not run for a third term as Chicago mayor, citing a desire to step away from the hectic life of elected office. The decision came as he saw his popularity erode in the city’s large African American community following the McDonald police shooting. The death of McDonald, who was shot 16 times, became a touchstone moment in the ongoing national conversation about racial injustice. He faced rebuke from some Black leaders in the city who accused him and his administration of covering up the shooting. Emanuel denied the coverup allegations but did not run for office again. What has the Democrat party said about Emanuel’s candidacy?His candidacy threatens to pull at the divisions among Democrats that Biden has largely managed to avoid as he begins to fill out his administration. Progressive leaders, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have been especially vocal in criticizing the prospect of Emanuel joining the Cabinet because of the controversies that have surrounded him. “What is so hard to understand about this? Rahm Emanuel helped cover up the murder of Laquan McDonald. Covering up a murder is disqualifying for public leadership,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted last week. “This is not about the ‘visibility’ of a post. It is shameful and concerning that he is even being considered.” What is so hard to understand about this?Rahm Emanuel helped cover up the murder of Laquan McDonald.

The theme is a tribute to the United States.“During this special time of the year, I am delighted to share “America the Beautiful” and pay tribute to the majesty of our great Nation. Together, we celebrate this land we are all proud to call home,” Melania posted from her official Twitter handle FLOTUS. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, is still not accepting defeat and has over several weeks laid out allegations of voter fraud across states (many of them found baseless) which led to many Republicans breaking ties with him.“From coast to coast, our country is blessed with boundless natural wonders. The timeless treasures represented in this year’s holiday showcase remind us of the true American spirit. Together, we celebrate this land we are all proud to call home,” a release issued by the White House stated.The White House has been decorated keeping in view the country’s history, art and culture, landscapes and the fallen heroes.

Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) expects temperatures to break records in the coming days due to the heat wave, which has been building across much of the country’s outback interior over the last week.“While bursts of heat and heat wave are normal for this time of year, what’s making this burst of heat exceptional is temperatures up to 18 degrees (Celsius) above average,” BoM Meteorologist Dean Narramore said.People flocked to beaches and pools to cool off after a slight reprieve from the heat when temperatures stayed in the mid-20s on Monday. “It’s been a long time since anyone had to deal with that sort of heat and when it comes and it hits you like that, not fun for anyone,” Louis Chris, cooling off in Bronte Baths near Sydney’s iconic Bondi beach, told Reuters.The heat wave, which is now slowly moving to the northeast, has also elevated the risks of fires.More than 30 fire crews are trying to contain a massive blaze at world heritage listed site Fraser Island off the coast of Queensland. The fires have razed nearly half of the popular tourist island’s land area, authorities said. Total fire bans have been enforced across the east amid the first major heat wave of Australia’s fire season, which usually runs from late southern hemisphere spring through summer.Last summer’s bush fires - which Prime Minister described as Australia’s “black summer” - killed 33 people and billions of native animals but the risk this year is from grasslands, which are expected to dry soon and spark fires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heat-wave-returns-to-australia-on-first-day-of-summer/story-dFeKitKPXmI0NpwmDhMTuJ.html
01-12-2020||World||When and which Covid-19 vaccines are likely to be available in Asia||Moderna Inc applied for US and European emergency authorisation of its Covid-19 vaccine based on full results from a late-stage study showing its vaccine was 94.1% effective with no serious safety concerns. On the other hand, trial data from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc and AstraZeneca Plc have shown their experimental vaccines are effective in preventing coronavirus. India’s Serum Institute (SII) will also apply for emergency license of Covid-19 vaccine in the next two weeks. As countries race towards finding a vaccine for the coronavirus disease, here’s a look at where things stand in Asia in terms of supply deals and clinical trials: IndiaThe head of the Serum Institute of India, which makes the AstraZeneca vaccine, said on November 23 the positive late-state trial result of the candidate will allow it to seek emergency use approval by year-end, before securing the OK for a full rollout by February or March. India is also conducting a late-stage trial of Russia’s Sputnik V.ChinaChina has not announced supply deals with Western drugmakers, which instead have partnered with private companies. AstraZeneca’s vaccine may be approved in China by mid-2021 and its Chinese partner Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products plans annual production capacity of at least 100 million doses by end-2020. For the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, a unit of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group plans a Phase II trial. Tibet Rhodiola Pharmaceutical Holding is bringing in Russian vaccine candidate Sputnik V and plans early and mid-stage trials in China. China has also approved three vaccine candidates developed by Sinovac and state-owned Sinopharm for emergency use, and Sinopharm hopes its two candidates will get conditional approval for general use this year.Click here for complete coverage of Coronavirus pandemicBangladeshBangladesh signed a deal with India’s Serum Institute to buy 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. It also expects to receive 68 million doses from GAVI at a subsidised rate, a senior health ministry official said. JapanJapan has deals to buy 120 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech in the first half of next year and 120 million from AstraZeneca, the first 30 million of which will be shipped by March 2021, and 250 million from Novavax. It is also in talks with Johnson & Johnson and has a deal with Shionogi & Co. Experts said vaccine makers would need to conduct at least Phase I and II trials in Japan before seeking approval.South KoreaSouth Korea aims to secure vaccines for 10 million people from COVAX and for 20 million more from separate deals with drugmakers by year-end. It has an “optional purchase” arrangement with COVAX to select vaccines from specific makers. The timing of procurement and the amount depend on the output schedule of those vaccines, say health officials. Inoculation is likely to start in the second quarter of next year to allow time to observe possible side effects.TaiwanTaiwan aims to secure around 15 million doses initially, both via the COVAX scheme and by directly purchase from manufacturers, and may buy an additional 15 million doses. The government has said it hopes to begin vaccinations in the first quarter next year.MalaysiaIt agreed to buy 12.8 million doses of Pfizer vaccine, becoming the first country in Southeast Asia to announce a deal with the U.S. drugmaker after some expressed reservations over the need for ultra-cold storage. Pfizer will deliver the first batch of 1 million doses in the first quarter of next year.The PhilippinesIt announced a deal on November 27 for 2.6 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and is discussing a possible 1 million more, covering about 1% of a population of 108 million. It is also seeking 20 million to 50 million doses from Sinovac and is in talks with others, including Pfizer. Vaccine makers can seek approval from Philippine regulators even if no clinical trial is done there.IndonesiaGrouped among 92 low- and middle-income economies, it is entitled to access vaccines through COVAX for a fifth of its population, or about 106 million to 107 million doses, if each person gets two injections. Indonesia is testing Sinovac vaccine and preparing mass vaccination for medical staff and other frontline workers to start as soon as late January.VietnamA government official COVAX vaccines would cover only 20% of the population and the country is likely to have a chance to secure separate deals soon, as demand is very high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/when-and-which-covid-19-vaccines-are-likely-to-be-available-in-asia/story-3oDD8LDUDQUKzjzslH7ZWJ.html

The protests on Saturday drew huge crowds -- as many as 300,000 by some estimates -- and though largely peaceful at the start, violence broke out in pockets later on in the day, with groups of individuals dressed in black attacking police and reports of officers beating protesters.The mood on the streets of France has soured since a video was posted on social media last week showing three police officers beating Black music producer Michel Zecler during an arrest at the entrance of his Paris studio on Nov. 21 while a fourth throws a tear-gas canister through the window.The footage contradicted the officers’ account of the events, French media reported, and opponents of Macron’s plan say that it would allow such brutality to go unchecked and infringe on civil liberties.Also Read |  Uproar in France over proposed limits on filming policeIn an interview with the Journal du Dimanche published Sunday, Veaux said he and all his colleagues were shocked by the images, while warning that increasing numbers of officers are themselves victims of violence. Three officers were charged late on Sunday, with two of them placed in custody while the investigation continues into the alleged assault of the music producer.Government U-TurnOn Monday, the French government announced that it will rewrite Article 24 of the “global security law” that would have made it a crime punishable by a year in prison and a 45,000-euro ($54,000) fine to publish the face or any other identifying feature of a police officer with intent to cause them “physical or psychological harm.”In announcing the rewriting of article, Christophe Castaner, head of Macron’s ruling party in the parliament, said the provision will be entirely redrafted, while insisting that the aim remains to better protect the police and to defend freedom of the press both for professional journalists and for citizens posting images on social media.“France should be the country of no violence or any infringement of any freedom whatsoever,” he said.Macron has been trying to position himself as the law and order candidate in a country where campaigning for presidential elections in two years time has already begun.In the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 16 beheading of a teacher by an Islamist militant he saw a bounce the polls, but enthusiasm for his tough stance was short lived and Macron is now under fire on multiple fronts as he tries to respond to the resurgence of jihadism and contain the spread of the coronavirus.Also Read | 4 French cops held after black music producer beaten, abusedMacron had sought to douse the anger over the video on Friday, asking his government to come up with proposals to restore the public confidence in the police. He said the beating of Zecler “shames us,” and condemned violence both against and by the police, but he and Darmanin have repeatedly denied systemic racism with the security forces.Officers who use force in a disproportionate way “must be punished and have no place in the police,” Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told lawmakers at the National Assembly on Monday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-s-u-turn-leaves-french-police-chief-to-take-heat-over-abuse/story-mxkXXiQYaTm6rjWh8QTy8I.html

The threat of digital services taxes has prompted threats of trade retaliation from outgoing US President Donald Trump’s administration.The new tax would come into effect on Jan. 1, 2022, and remain in place until a common approach is agreed upon. The measure would raise federal revenues by C$3.4 billion ($2.6 billion) over five years, starting in the 2021-22 fiscal year.Also Read | Coronavirus: Canada extends travel restrictions for those entering the country“Canadians want a tax system that is fair, where everyone pays their fair share,” Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland told legislators in the fall economic update.“Canada will act unilaterally, if necessary, to apply a tax on large multinational digital corporations, so they pay their fair share just like any other company operating in Canada.”Foreign-based vendors with no physical presence in Canada will also have to start collecting sales taxes on products such as mobile apps, online video gaming and streaming. The measure should raise C$1.2 billion over five years.Ottawa also plans to oblige people renting out short-term accommodation to charge sales taxes, saying popular digital rental platforms do not currently have to impose the taxes. That puts hotels at a disadvantage, it added.The government is also clamping down on the award of stock options to prevent “high-income individuals employed at large, long-established, mature firms” from taking unfair advantage. From now on, a C$200,000 annual limit will apply to stock option grants for those people. Ottawa did not provide a definition of high-income individuals or mature firms.The rules will not apply to startups or emerging companies, which often cannot afford to pay competitive salaries and instead offer stock options. The new rules will generate about C$200 million in federal revenues, the Finance Department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-plans-digital-tax-in-2022-on-global-tech-giants-such-as-facebook-google/story-Ch3imnZPPAad9g8nMg6hoM.html
01-12-2020||World||Indian national gets 20-year jail for running call centers that defrauded US citizens||A US court Monday sentenced an Indian national to 20 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release for his role in operating and funding India-based call centers that defrauded American people of millions of dollars between 2013 and 2016.Hitesh Madhubhai Patel (44) of Ahmedabad was sentenced by US District Judge for the Southern District of Texas David Hittner. He was sentenced for the charges of wire fraud conspiracy and general conspiracy to commit identification fraud, access device fraud, money laundering, and impersonation of a federal officer or employee. Patel was also ordered to pay restitution of USD 8,970,396 to identified victims of his crimes.“The defendant defrauded vulnerable US victims out of tens of millions of dollars by spearheading a conspiracy whose members boldly impersonated federal government officials and preyed on victims’ fears of adverse government action,” said Acting Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. For years, Patel preyed on the fears of his victims to perpetuate a global scheme to manipulate US institutions and taxpayers, said Special Agent in Charge Mark B Dawson of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Houston.According to admissions in his plea agreement, Patel and his co-conspirators perpetrated a complex scheme in which employees from call centers in Ahmedabad impersonated officials from the IRS and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and engaged in other telephone call scams designed to defraud victims throughout the country. US victims were threatened with arrest, imprisonment, fines or deportation if they did not pay alleged monies owed to the government. Those who fell victim were instructed how to provide payment, including by purchasing general purpose reloadable (GPR) cards or wiring money. Upon payment, the call centers would immediately turn to a network of “runners” based in the United States to liquidate and launder the fraudulently obtained funds, federal prosecutors alleged.In his plea, Patel admitted to operating and funding several India-based call centers from which the fraud schemes were perpetrated, including the call center HGLOBAL. Patel corresponded by email and WhatsApp messaging frequently with his co-defendants to exchange credit card numbers, telephone scam scripts, and call center operations instructions. The scripts included IRS impersonation, USCIS impersonation, Canada Revenue Agency impersonation, Australian Tax Office impersonation, payday loan fraud, US Government grant fraud, and debt collection fraud.Patel was prosecuted in the United States after being extradited from Singapore in April 2019 to face charges in this large-scale telefraud and money laundering scheme. Singapore authorities apprehended Patel at the request of the United States pursuant to a provisional arrest warrant in September 2018, after Patel flew there from India.The indictment in this case, which was unsealed in October 2016, charged Patel and 60 other individuals and entities with general conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. A total of 24 domestic defendants associated with this transnational criminal scheme were previously convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment of up to 20 years in the Southern District of Texas, District of Arizona and Northern District of Georgia. The defendants were also ordered to pay millions of dollars in victim restitution and money judgments and to forfeit seized assets. Some defendants were ordered to be deported based on their illegal immigration status, with another defendant having his U.S. citizenship revoked due to a separate conviction for immigration fraud. Charges remain pending for other India-based defendants.

01-12-2020||World||Fake news on Covid-19 vaccines a ‘second pandemic,’ says Red Cross chief||The head of the world’s largest humanitarian network is urging governments and institutions to combat “fake news” about COVID-19 vaccines which has become “a second pandemic” and start building trust in communities around the world about the critical importance of vaccinating people.Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a virtual briefing to the U.N. Correspondents Association on Monday that “to beat this pandemic, we also have to defeat the parallel pandemic of distrust.”He said there is “a growing hesitancy about vaccines in general, and about a COVID vaccine in particular” around the world, pointing to a recent Johns Hopkins University study in 67 countries that found vaccine acceptance declined significantly in most countries from July to October this year.In a quarter of countries, Rocca said, the study found that the acceptance rate for a vaccine against the coronavirus was near or below 50 percent, with Japan dropping from 70 percent to 50 percent acceptance, and France dropping from 51 percent to 38 percent acceptance.He stressed that the lack of trust “is by no means a Western phenomenon,” citing the federation’s research in recent months in eight African countries -- Congo, Cameroon, Gabon, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Lesotho and Kenya -- which showed a steady decline in the perceptions of the risk of COVID-19 infection.A growing number of people indicated the virus doesn’t affect young people or Africans, that the disease doesn’t exist now but did exist and the pandemic has ended, he said. “In several African countries, we have seen a common skepticism towards vaccines in general, with a common belief being that foreigners use Africa as a medical ‘testing ground.’”Surprisingly, Rocca said, some typically vulnerable and marginalized groups aren’t even aware of the pandemic, pointing to a federation survey in Pakistan which found 10 percent of respondents didn’t know about COVID-19.“We believe that the massive, coordinated efforts that will be needed to roll out the COVID vaccine in an equitable manner need to be paralleled by equally massive efforts to proactively build and maintain trust,” Rocca said.This will require the same kind of sustained community engagement that recently defeated Ebola in Congo, he said.The federation operates in 192 countries with almost 14 million volunteers and painstaking community outreach and engagement are at the heart of its COVID-19 response, Rocca said.So far, Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, with federation support, have reached 243 million people with COVID-19 activities including tracking community perceptions, responding to questions and suggestions, “and providing accurate and timely information in local languages through diverse channels,” he said.Rocca said he has watched with concern in recent weeks “as the imminent arrival of a possible vaccine has, at least in some countries, washed away the commitments that were made over the summer to ensure an equitable distribution of vaccines between and within countries.”He said “politicizing the vaccines is a huge mistake” and strongly backed the international initiative to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to countries worldwide known as COVAX as “the correct approach both for rich countries and the rest of the world.”“If a few wealthy nations insist on a `vaccine nationalism’ approach, then many other countries — maybe even most other countries — will not be able to access them, both because of exclusive deals between wealthy countries and pharmaceutical companies and the inevitable lag in manufacturing enough doses,” he said..”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fake-news-on-covid-19-vaccines-a-second-pandemic-says-red-cross-chief/story-evVn5BwypGVaMnLwiZ5aTL.html

Atlas confirmed the news in a Monday evening tweet.Atlas joined the White House this summer, where he clashed with top government scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, as he resisted stronger efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 267,000 Americans.Atlas has broken with government experts and the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community to criticize efforts to encourage face covering to slow the spread of the virus. Just weeks ago on Twitter he responded to Michigan’s latest virus restrictions by encouraging people to “rise up” against the state’s policies.His views also prompted Stanford to issue a statement distancing itself from the faculty member, saying Atlas “has expressed views that are inconsistent with the university’s approach in response to the pandemic.”“We support using masks, social distancing, and conducting surveillance and diagnostic testing,” the university said Nov. 16. “We also believe in the importance of strictly following the guidance of local and state health authorities.”Atlas defended his role in his resignation letter, saying, “I cannot think of a time where safeguarding science and the scientific debate is more urgent.”Atlas was hired as a “special government employee,” which limited his service to government to 130 days in a calendar year — a deadline he reached this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-science-adviser-scott-atlas-leaving-white-house-job/story-IqAHjpKH5r5wDQSPFCT7BM.html

He expects to issue a decision in the next day or two.Last week he ordered a daily curfew barring social gatherings and other non-essential activities across most of the state between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. daily.Newsom, who has largely banned indoor dining in the state, has apologized after photos surfaced of the first-term Democrat eating dinner with 11 other people, including a prominent lobbyist, at a French restaurant near Napa. None wore masks.Also Read: Americans face new coronavirus restrictions after ThanksgivingMore than 4.2 million new Covid-19 infections and 36,000 Covid-19 related deaths were reported across the United States in November, according to a Reuters tally. Hospitalizations are at a pandemic high and deaths the most in six months.Nearly 93,000 Americans are currently hospitalized with Covid-19, up 11% from last week and double the number reported a month ago, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county public health reports. Americans who have endured eight months of restrictions, lockdown and business closures in the face of the pandemic are pinning their hopes on vaccines developed by drug companies Pfizer Inc and Moderna that are awaiting US government approval for emergency use.VACCINES BY CHRISTMAS?US Health Secretary Alex Azar said Pfizer’s medication could be authorized and shipped within days of a Dec. 10 meeting of outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration.Moderna’s vaccine could follow a week later, Azar said, after the company announced on Monday it would apply for emergency authorization both in the US and Europe.“So we could be seeing both of these vaccines out and getting into people’s arms before Christmas,” Azar said on CBS’ “This Morning.”Health officials in many states say that even after the vaccines are approved the rollout to Americans nationwide could be slowed by shortages of personal protective equipment and other factors.The non-partisan Government Accountability Office reported on Monday that some diagnostic test kits and accompanying reagents, as well as PPE are hard to come by “due to a supply chain with limited domestic production and high global demand.”In Los Angeles, health officials on Friday banned all public and private gatherings for at least three weeks and urged residents to stay home as much as possible.In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday ordered all elective surgeries to cease in one county and told hospitals statewide to plan on increasing their capacity by 50% if necessary or set up and staff field hospitals. “Hospital capacity is the top concern,” Cuomo said. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said that as of Saturday he was re-tightening the limit on most outdoor gatherings to 25 people.Murphy, who has brought back a series of Covid-19 restrictions in recent weeks, also said all indoor youth and adult sports will be put on hold from Dec. 5 through Jan. 2, 2021, also with exemptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-at-covid-tipping-point-as-trump-admin-hopes-for-vaccines-by-christmas/story-W3cXGxPrqmdqybgwyUfe3M.html

There is no possibility that humans will contract bird flu from eating poultry or eggs, the ministry said.Japan’s worst outbreak since at least 2016 started last month in Kagawa prefecture on Shikoku island, which is adjacent to Kyushu island.The 40,000 chickens at the Miyazaki farm will be slaughtered and buried, while exports in a 3 km (1.8 mile) radius around the farm will be restricted.The new action means more than 1.8 million chickens will have been culled since the latest outbreak began.Japan’s last outbreak of bird flu was in January 2018, also in Kagawa prefecture, when 91,000 chickens were culled.The last big outbreak was between November 2016 and March 2017, when a total of 1.67 million chickens were culled due to the H5N6 strain of bird flu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-bird-flu-outbreak-spreads-to-farm-in-fourth-prefecture/story-U2Gc61fDzKJMxTIeeKURGO.html

01-12-2020||World||Moderna files for US vaccine authorization, will seek EU nod||Moderna Inc said on Monday it has applied for US emergency authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine after full results from a late-stage study showed it was 94.1% effective with no serious safety concerns.The US Food and Drug Administration said an advisory committee would meet to discuss the request on Dec. 17, making Moderna’s candidate the second highly effective vaccine likely to receive US regulatory backing and a potential roll out this year.A shot developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE that was 95% effective in its pivotal trial is set to be reviewed by a panel of outside experts a week earlier. The FDA will decide on the emergency use authorizations (EUA)after the advisers make their recommendations. Also Read: Dictionary.com picks ‘pandemic’ as its 2020 word of the yearModerna, which also plans to seek European approval, reported that its vaccine’s efficacy was consistent across age, race, ethnicity and gender demographics as well as having 100% success in preventing severe cases of the disease that has killed nearly 1.5 million people worldwide.“We believe that we have a vaccine that is very highly efficacious. We now have the data to prove it,” Moderna Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks said. “We expect to be playing a major part in turning around this pandemic.”Of the 196 people who contracted Covid-19 out of over 30,000 trial volunteers, 185 had received a placebo and 11 the vaccine. Moderna reported 30 severe cases, all in the placebo group. Moderna shares rose 3% in extended trading after closing up 20%. They have gained about 700% this year.“As the numbers of cases reported grows, confidence grows that this amazing protection will be maintained in a product that can be rolled out to protect the public,” said Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at Britain’s University of Reading.In addition to filing its US application, Moderna said it would seek conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency and continue to talk with other regulators doing similar rolling reviews.“Although we await the full details of these results in published form, we can now assume that this vaccine will be approved for use in December,” said Gillies O’Bryan-Tear, chair of policy and communications at Britain’s Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine.He expected Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to approve the vaccine within two weeks.‘JUST OVERWHELMING’Moderna said it was on track to have about 20 million doses of its vaccine ready to ship in the United States by the end of 2020, enough to inoculate 10 million people.Switzerland’s Lonza Group , which has a contract with Moderna to supply ingredients for the vaccine, rose 4.4%.The vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech use a new technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) whereas others, such as AstraZeneca’s , employ more traditional methods.AstraZeneca has announced an average efficacy rate of 70% for its vaccine, and as much as 90% for a subgroup of trial participants who got a half dose, followed by a full dose. Some scientists have expressed doubts about the robustness of the 90% efficacy figure for the smaller group. Also Read: PM Modi to chair all-party meet to take stock of Covid-19 pandemicModerna’s final efficacy result was slightly lower than an interim analysis released on Nov. 16 of 94.5% effectiveness, a difference Zaks said was not statistically significant.“At this level of effectiveness, when you just do the math of what it means for the pandemic that’s raging around us, it’s just overwhelming,” said Zaks, who said he cried when he saw the final results over the weekend.Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines proved more effective than anticipated and far superior to the 50% approvable benchmark set by FDA.The past few weeks of positive vaccine results have ignited hopes for an end to a pandemic that has battered economies and come as new infections and Covid-19 hospitalizations are at record levels across the United States. Almost immediately after receiving an EUA, Moderna expects its vaccine to be shipped to distribution points across the United States by the government’s Operation Warp Speed program and drug distributor McKesson Corp.Distribution is expected to be less complicated than for Pfizer’s vaccine. While it needs to be stored in a freezer, it does not require the ultra-cold temperature or specialized equipment needed for Pfizer’s vaccine.CONSISTENT ACROSS AGE AND ETHNICITYModerna said the 196 Covid-19 cases in its trial included 33 adults over 65 years old and 42 volunteers from racially diverse groups, including 29 Latinos, 6 Blacks, 4 Asian Americans and 3 multiracial participants. There was one death related to Covid-19 in the placebo group during the trial.“This is as black and white as an effect on a population will be. Your chances of actually being sick if you’ve been vaccinated are decreased 20-fold,” said Moderna’s Zaks.Moderna reported no new side effects since its interim analysis, the most common of which were fatigue, injection site redness and pain, headache and body aches, which rose after the second dose and were short-lived.Zaks said the vaccine caused significant flu-like symptoms in some participants which, “goes hand-in-hand with having such a potent vaccine.” But it has not caused any significant safety concerns so far, he said.Moderna plans to start a new trial to test the vaccine in adolescents before the end of the year, followed by another in even younger volunteers early in 2021. It hopes to have the vaccine available for adolescents by September, Zaks said.Other vaccine makers have said they are studying their vaccines in younger people as well..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-files-for-us-vaccine-authorization-will-seek-eu-nod/story-TwMtgMMWSitZtGZLdxOY0J.html
01-12-2020||World||Taliban-Afghan government agreement marred by document’s wording||A breakthrough on an initial agreement reached between Taliban and government negotiators has been held up at the last minute after the insurgent group balked at the document’s preamble because it mentioned the Afghan government by name.Teams representing the Taliban and the Afghan government have been negotiating in the Qatari capital since September to reach a consensus on the modalities of peace talks, moving forward to help end decades of war in Afghanistan.“The negotiating teams have so far agreed on all 21 articles that provide guiding principles for the negotiations,” Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said in a statement on Monday. “At this time, they continue to debate the preamble, in which some issues need further clarification”. Government and diplomatic sources told Reuters that when it came to signing the document in November, which was to include references to the “Islamic Republic of Afghanistan” - the official name of the Afghan government, - the Taliban backed off.The Taliban refuse to refer to the Afghan negotiating team as representatives of the Afghan government, as they contest the legitimacy of Ghani’s election. “(The government and Taliban) prepared to sign the agreement,” a diplomat in Kabul familiar with process told Reuters, adding that the chief Afghan government negotiator was to sign the agreement as “chief negotiator for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan”. “The Taliban refused to accept that,” the diplomat said. The Taliban did not immediately respond to request for comment on the specific incident but had earlier told Reuters that their stance was to negotiate with Afghans broadly and would not recognise them as negotiators representing the government.“We are ready to take the talks forward with the current team as Afghans; we don’t know them as a government team,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters on Monday. Mujahid said the Taliban’s stance, from day one, was that they did not recognise the government.Another diplomatic source said there had been ongoing discord over the term “republic” and the Taliban’s reference to itself as an “Islamic Emirate,” which underscored the differences between the warring sides.“The differences over the words “republic” and “emirate” triggered a deep suspicion between the negotiators,” he said. “The problem is complex as it leads to (implications over) the vision and aspiration of a country and how it wants to projected and perceived.”The Afghan government side took the Taliban’s reservations to Ghani who said he will not agree to such a demand, according to two well-placed government sources.One source said the Taliban’s insistence was based on its desire to have Ghani’s elected government replaced with a caretaker administration once the peace process begins. “The Taliban from day one have tried to delegitimise the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and are pushing a vague title of “Intra-Afghan” (talks) to undermine the legitimacy of the government,” the source said.The U.S.-Taliban agreement, signed in February, does not mention the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by name either and envisages the formation of a “new post-settlement Afghan Islamic government as determined by the intra-Afghan dialogue and negotiations”.It also refers to the peace talks as “Intra-Afghan” talks. One Afghan government source said the Afghan delegation will not walk away from talks, but feared the consequences of the new standoff would be “bitter for both sides,” including a further escalation of violence on the ground in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-afghan-government-agreement-marred-by-document-s-wording/story-DSPG3ZFmGupRSuc6iUCSoJ.html
01-12-2020||World||Americans face new coronavirus restrictions after Thanksgiving||Americans returning from Thanksgiving break faced strict new coronavirus measures around the country Monday as health officials brace for a disastrous worsening of the nationwide surge because of holiday gatherings over the long weekend.Los Angeles County imposed a stay-at-home order for its 10 million residents, and Santa Clara County, in the heart of Silicon Valley, banned high school, college and professional sports and decreed a quarantine for those who have traveled more than 150 miles outside the county.In Hawaii, the mayor of Hawaii County said trans-Pacific travelers arriving without a negative Covid-19 test must quarantine for 14 days, and even those who have tested virus-free may be randomly selected for another test upon arrival. New Jersey is suspending all youth sports.“The red flags are flying in terms of the trajectory in our projections of growth,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom. “If these trends continue, we’re going to have to take much more dramatic, arguably drastic, action.”Health experts had pleaded with Americans to stay home over Thanksgiving and not gather with anyone who didn’t live with them. Nevertheless, almost 1.2 million people passed through US airports Sunday, the most since the pandemic gripped the country in March, and others took to the highways to be with family and friends.Now they’re being urged to watch for any signs of illness and get tested right away if they experience symptoms.Some families are already seeing the fallout from Thanksgiving gatherings.Jonathan Eshnaur lugged his 32-inch TV to a Thanksgiving Day family gathering at his sister’s home in Olathe, Kansas, so he could watch football outside. He wore a mask and only went into her house for the prayer and to use the bathroom.One day later, his father began feeling terrible and tested positive. His mother now is showing symptoms, and the six others at the gathering are concerned that they caught it, too.“I think we all have a tendency to think it won’t happen to me,” said Eshnaur, a 34-year-old special education teacher. “But that is kind of the issue with these kinds of viruses is it does happen, especially when we have widespread community spread that is going on.”Priya Patel, 24, is isolating at her parents’ home in San Antonio after visiting friends over the weekend and coming down with a sore throat.Patel, who works in public health in New York City, said she had been careful, wearing masks in public and staying out of restaurants and bars. But she spent time at a friend’s home in Texas over Thanksgiving.“I’m an extremely extroverted person, and there is just so much time I can spend with my parents at home,” said Patel, who will stay away from her parents, both of whom have preexisting medical conditions, and wear a mask inside their home for the next 14 days.Health officials are urging people to remain vigilant until a vaccine becomes widely available, which is not expected to happen for at least a few months.On Monday, Moderna Inc. said it will ask US and European regulators to allow emergency use of its Covid-19 vaccine as new study results confirm the shots offer strong protection. Pfizer is also seeking approval for its vaccine and hopes to begin administering shots in the US in December.The virus is blamed for over 267,000 deaths and more than 13.4 million confirmed infections in the US The country on average is seeing more than 160,000 new cases per day and over 1,400 deaths — a toll on par with what the nation witnessed in mid-May, when New York City was the epicenter.A record 90,000 people were in the hospital with the virus in the US as of Sunday, pushing many medical institutions to the limit.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said hospitals across the state will reduce elective surgeries to ensure there is room for coronavirus patients. The number of people hospitalized with Covid-19 jumped 29% in the past week. In Kansas City, Kansas, hospital and nursing officials said they fear there will not be enough nurses to staff new hospital beds in the metro area if Covid-19 cases continue unchecked. Health officials on Monday added 4,425 confirmed infections and 87 hospitalizations to the state’s pandemic tally since Friday.Rhode Island’s hospitals reached their Covid-19 capacity on Monday, the same day the state’s two-week pause took effect. Under restrictions announced by Gov. Gina Raimondo, some businesses will be required to shut down, while others are restricted. Residents are also asked to limit their social circles to people in their household.“This will not be easy, but I am pleading with you to take it seriously,” Raimondo said in a statement.In suburban St. Louis, a hospital official warned that hospitalizations could double in two to three weeks if people don’t quarantine after Thanksgiving gatherings. SSM Health DePaul Hospital in Bridgeton, Missouri, last week brought in a morgue trailer to store the dead, canceled elective surgeries and doubled up patients in rooms.“We will be absolutely overwhelmed,” said Shelly Cordum, vice president of patient care services and chief nursing officer. “I can’t even imagine what we are going to be facing in three weeks if we stay on this path.”Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s foremost infectious-disease expert, warned on ABC over the weekend that the country could see a “surge upon surge” of infections tied to Thanksgiving. And White House cornonavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx told CBS that people who traveled should “assume that you were exposed and you became infected,” and get tested if they experience symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-face-new-coronavirus-restrictions-after-thanksgiving/story-8MTYBV68RTiKnuRHkHwPgO.html
01-12-2020||World||Did pollution kill Brit girl? Inquest to find out||The mother of a nine-year-old girl who died from acute respiratory failure after repeated asthma attacks on Monday said she hoped a coroner’s inquest would conclude that air pollution played a role in her death.Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah died in February 2013 after nearly three years of repeated attacks, which saw her being taken to hospital 30 times.But a specialist in 2018 noticed a “striking link” between levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and harmful particulate matter at the times she was admitted for treatment.A ruling that air pollution was a factor in her death would be a legal first in Britain.“I hope, and I’m keeping my fingers crossed that the coroner, after hearing all the evidence, will come to the conclusion that air pollution either caused or contributed to her death, and that’s all I’m asking for,” Ella’s mother Rosamund said.“I will finally have the reason why she passed away on her birth certificate,” she told AFP.“All children have a right to breathe cleaner air and I’ll keep on saying that because children shouldn’t die from asthma.”The first coroner’s inquest in 2014 determined that Ella died of acute respiratory failure brought on by severe asthma. But the ruling was set aside after the specialist’s report.The second hearing, which is due to last 10 days from Monday, will examine the levels of pollution the young girl was exposed to.The family lived less than 30 metres (100 feet) from the South Circular, a busy and regularly congested arterial road, in Lewisham, southeast London.Coroner’s inquests are held in England and Wales in the event of a sudden or unexplained death. They establish the causes and circumstances of deaths on the balance of probability.They do not determine criminal or civil liability, guilt or blame, but set out facts in the public interest.The lawyer representing the family, Jocelyn Cockburn, said reaching the second inquest was a “significant achievement”.“Rosamund’s account of Ella’s struggle is very powerful and illustrates the human suffering behind the statistics,” she said.Since her eldest daughter’s death, Rosamund Addo-Kissi-Debrah has campaigned for improvements to air quality and awareness of asthma, particularly in children.She said the pollution near the family home was “definitely not visible”, but the government needed to clean up the air, given the number of people who live near busy roads.“There are thousands of children all over the UK with asthma and every time there’s a spike in air pollution, some of them will end up in hospital,” she said.According to figures from the Mayor of London, World Health Organization (WHO) recommended limits for air pollution are broken in 99% of the British capital.The WHO says air pollution kills some seven million people across the globe every year and nine out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds guideline limits on pollutants.Low- and middle-income countries are worst affected and the problem contributes to premature deaths.Last month, the executive director of the Clean Air Fund, Jane Burston, said children in London were “4.2 per cent more likely to be hospitalised for asthma on days with high NO2 pollution”.Also in October, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan released figures showing improvements in air quality due to changes made since his election in 2016. These measures have included the introduction of an “ultra low emission zone” which requires drivers of the most polluting vehicles to pay a daily tax when entering central London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-pollution-kill-brit-girl-inquest-to-find-out/story-GdA48uhZrak5EBcY5HvVZL.html
01-12-2020||World||Shipping Covid vaccines: Global airlines face ‘mission of century’||In cooled warehouses on the fringes of Frankfurt airport, Deutsche Lufthansa AG is preparing its depleted fleet for the gargantuan task of airlifting millions of doses of the vaccines meant to end the global pandemic.Lufthansa began planning in April in anticipation of the shots that Pfizer to Moderna and AstraZeneca are developing in record time. A 20-member task force is at work devising how to fit more of the crucial payload onto the airline’s 15 Boeing Co 777 and MD-11 freighters, along with hold space in a vast passenger fleet now flying at just 25% of capacity.Laid low by a Covid-19 outbreak that’s decimated passenger demand, airlines will be the workhorses of the attempt to eradicate it, hauling billions of vials to every corner of the globe. It’s an unprecedented task, made more difficult by the carriers’ diminished state after culling jobs, routes and aircraft to survive a crisis that’s reduced air traffic globally by an estimated 61% this year.“This will be the largest and most complex logistical exercise ever,” said Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive officer of the International Air Transport Association, the industry’s chief lobby. “The world is counting on us.” IATA estimates that the equivalent of 8,000 loads in a 110-tonne capacity Boeing 747 freighter will be needed for the airlift, which will take two years to supply some 14 billion doses, or almost two for every man, woman and child on Earth. It’s a tall order, given about one-third of the global passenger fleet is still in storage, based on data from Cirium.Katherine O’Brien, the World Health Organization’s head of immunisation, likens the task of distributing the vaccines after the months-long development sprint to summiting Mount Everest having reached base camp.“The climb to the peak is really about delivering the vaccines,” she said on November 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shipping-covid-vaccines-global-airlines-face-mission-of-century/story-6TuISRDii9R2JxDEpKXyFK.html
01-12-2020||World||Indian-American Neera Tanden named in Joe Biden’s top economic team||US President-elect Joe Biden on Monday named Neera Tanden director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that oversees the administration’s budget and federal agencies, making her the first Indian-descent American to be appointed to a federal cabinet in a Democratic administration.Biden also named former Fed Chair Janet Yellen as secretary of treasury, making her the first women to hold that position, and Cecilia Rouse, a labor economist from Princeton University economist, as the first African American to chair the Council of Economic Advisers. Tanden is the first woman of color and South Asian to head the OMB. Yellen and Tanden will need to be confirmed by US senate.“As we get to work to control the virus, this is the team that will deliver immediate economic relief for the American people during this economic crisis and help us build our economy back better than ever,” President-elect Biden said in a statement announcing the new appointments.“This team looks like America and brings seriousness of purpose, the highest degree of competency, and unwavering belief in the promise of America. They will be ready on day one to get to work for all Americans.”President-elect Biden, who injured an ankle playing with one of his dogs Sunday, also announced a path-breaking all-female press team for his White House with Jen Psaki as the most visible face of the team as press secretary. She is a veteran from the Obama administration.Biden made history earlier when he chose Kamala Harris his running mate. She is now the first woman, first black and first American of Indian, Asian and South Asian descent elected vice-president.Though the first Indian American in the cabinet of a Democrat president, Tanden will be second overall for the community. Nikki Haley was the first of Indian descent to be named to the federal cabinet as President Donald Trump’s US ambassador to the UN, a cabinet-rank position that was downgraded for her successors.“Big job and a real important first in the Cabinet. She has a great story (single mother, knows what it is to be poor) but went to Harvard and is the most well-versed person in progressive economics I have ever met,” said Shekar Narasimhan, a top fundraiser for Biden and a and close adviser to the campaign and the transition team. “I am (a) huge Neera fan!” Narasimhan, who has known Tanden for a long time, confessed.Tanden studied law at Yale and served as senior adviser for health reform in the US Department of Health and Human Services developing policies and provisions of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature law that is now called Obamacare. She was born in Massachusetts in 1970 to parents from India, who divorced when she was five. Tanden and her brother were brought up by their mother. Tanden has spoken of her family banking on food coupons to get by.“On the heels of Kamala Harris set to become the next Vice-President, it is great to see another well qualified Indian American woman be nominated for a Cabinet level position,” said MR Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, an advocacy group for the community. “It is gratifying to see someone who has dedicated herself to public service be recognized for this important role to manage the budget of the country.”Two more Indian Americans are in the mix of names speculated about for other cabinet positions. Vivek Murthy, a physician and former surgeon general, is a leading contender for secretary of health and human services, a possibility that has been boosted by his appointment by Biden as co-chair of his advisory board on combatting Covid-19, which, the president-elect has said will be his first task after assuming office in January. Others in the race are Michelle Lynn Lujan Grisham, the Hispanic governor of New Mexico, and Jeffery D Zients, director of President Obama’s National Economic Council.The second Indian American among cabinet potentials is Arun Majumdar. He is reported to be in the running for secretary of energy, to head a department whose key mandate includes the upkeep — not deployment or use — of America’s nuclear arsenal; the department traces its origin to the Manhattan Project.Majumdar, an alumnus of IIT Bombay, heads Stanford University’s Precourt Institute for Energy and is up against Ernest Moniz, Obama’s energy secretary who played a leading role in the shaping of the Iran nuclear deal, a signature foreign policy achievement of the Obama-Biden administration that President Trump has sought to wreck by pulling the US out of it. Biden may revive it if, as his aides have indicated, Iran covenants compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-neera-tanden-named-in-joe-biden-s-top-economic-team/story-2fQdhy9HDELx75oBFiXzbL.html
01-12-2020||India||SC angered after man appears shirtless during online hearing||Upset by a bare-chested lawyer adjusting the camera during a hearing by videoconferencing on Tuesday, the Supreme Court remarked that lawyers cannot afford to be so reckless because it has already been eight months since the apex court has been hearing cases in the virtual mode amid the Covid-19 pandemic.The incident happened in the Supreme Court virtual courtroom presided over by justice LN Rao. The judge was hearing a suo moto {of its own accord} petition on the condition of Child Care Homes during the pandemic when suddenly an image flashed on the screen of a bare-chested person adjusting the camera of the standing counsel for the Kerala government, G Prakash.The bench called out to the lawyer appearing on the screen, “Someone is standing beside you who is shirtless.” There was no response from the other end and the next moment, the link with the lawyer could not be established. The bare-chested person was also a lawyer, ML Jishnu, who is related to Prakash.Upset by the behaviour of the lawyer in question, the bench, also comprising justice Hemant Gupta ,said: “Even after seven to eight months of telling lawyers to be careful during videoconferencing, you (advocates) are so reckless.”“I was not able to hear or see the courtroom. Before the hearing started, the link was connected but later it disappeared. It was during that time somebody was helping to fix the system for me. But I was fully dressed up in my advocate robe and because my device faced technical glitch I was unable to hear or see what happened in the court,” Prakash told HT.This is the second instance in two months of a lawyer appearing without a shirt during a virtual hearing at the Supreme Court. On October 27, another lawyer appeared shirtless during the hearing of a case before a bench presided over by justice DY Chandrachud. The judge had then remarked, “Some decorum has to be maintained by lawyers while appearing before us. Caution must be taken in future.” Even solicitor general Tushar Mehta called the behaviour “unpardonable”.The lawyer who was involved then was MS Suvidutt who wrote to th solicitor general snd the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association president that he was attending the Vidyarambam (initiation of education) ceremony of his niece with his camera off. He expressed regret and apology for his inadvertent act. Since the videoconferencing proceedings started in March this year, lawyers across high courts too have been caught eating food and appearing casual dressed, lying on the bed, and even chewing gutka. In May this year, the Supreme Court secretary general Sanjeev S Kalgaonkar issued a notification allowing lawyers to shun their long robes and coats while appearing before the court through videoconferencing. The notification said, “The advocates may wear plain white-shirt/white-salwar-kameez/white saree, with a plain-white neck band’ during the hearings before the Supreme Court of f India through Virtual Court System till medical exigencies exist or until further orders.” A lawyer found smoking in the car during a virtual hearing before the Gujarat high court was fined Rs 10,000 for his conduct. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan faced an embarrassing moment when he was found smoking a hookah during the hearing of an important case before the Rajasthan high court. He escaped the eyes of the judge, though. In June, the Supreme Court hauled up a lawyer for appearing in a T-shirt, lounging on his bed. A bench remarked: “Minimum court etiquette in terms of what can be considered a decent dress, background, etc should be followed given the public nature of the hearings.” The lawyer was let off on offering an unconditional apology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-angered-after-man-appears-shirtless-during-online-hearing/story-EYhDM7yvSXADgnp6L1GJHP.html
01-12-2020||India||NSCN (IM) accuses Nagaland Governor of planning to hijack peace talks||Nagaland Governor RN Ravi’s message to the people on the eve of Nagaland’s 58th statehood day, hailing the 16 Point Agreement which led to the formation of Nagaland state has riled the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) and the influential Naga Students’ Federation (NSF).The two organisations have separately condemned the governor’s statement by saying that the Naga people have rejected said agreement.The 16 Point Agreement, signed between the Naga People’s Convention (NPC) and the government of India in 1960, had led to the formation of the state of Nagaland in 1963.“His (Ravi’s) statement reminds the Naga people once again of how under the leadership of AZ Phizo the war of resistance of the Nagas against the Indian colonialists were manipulated by the IB (Intelligence Bureau) officials who roped in some of the treacherous Naga individuals, mostly Indian government employees that formed a superfluous body called the NPC. The NPC came out of nowhere and signed the 16 Point Agreement where the Naga solution was hijacked and a state under the Indian Constitution was accepted giving a foothold to the Indian government to claim that from thence Nagas were a part of India,” the NSCN (IM) said in a statement on Tuesday.The NSCN (IM), which has been holding talks with the central government for the past 23 years, alleged that the statement by Ravi, who is also the Centre’s interlocutor for the Naga peace talks, clearly exposed that another NPC was in the making.“His assertion that some of the civil societies under his payroll are the main stakeholders on the Indo-Naga issue and therefore their decision must be supreme is farce. This is the same RN Ravi who was a signatory to the 2015 Framework Agreement signed between the government of India and the NSCN representing the Naga people, and also signed with the 7 NNPGs in 2017,” the group said.It maintained that the Centre and the Naga people were fully committed to resolve the protracted issue through peaceful means and for which, the talks were at a concluding stage. However, the organisation accused Ravi, who is an ex-IB officer, of planning to hijack the 23 years of peace talks in the same style of the NPC.On the governor’s statement that India as a nation has a sovereign territory and can have only one constitution and one national flag, the NSCN (IM) asserted that in the same breath Nagaland too must have sovereign territory, one constitution and one national flag within which the two must share sovereign powers and coexist peacefully as two entities as agreed upon in the framework agreement where Ravi himself is a signatory.The NSCN (IM) advised the governor “not to bite off more than he can chew as far as the Indo-Naga Issue is concerned” and said was undeterred by his threat.The NSF, an influential students’ body in the region, also denounced the governor’s message glorifying the l6 Point Agreement when in reality the Naga people have disowned it as it only sowed the seed for division. The NSF said Ravi’s statement was a shallow attempt to mislead the Naga people.“....governor’s claim that it has been the best thing to happen to the Naga people only reveals his shallow understanding of the Naga history and also the narrow walls within which he has been trying to solve the vexed Indo-Naga political issue,” the NSF stated.It reminded the governor that the obvious failure of the impugned agreement to solve the Naga political issue had led to the ceasefire and political dialogue with the Naga National Council in 1964 followed by the endless political dialogue leading to the present day.“The federation appeals to the interlocutor to refrain from furthering the old ‘carrot and stick’ policy and adopt a more pragmatic approach in-order to ensure that the interests of the two entities are upheld through the political solution,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nscn-im-accuses-nagaland-governor-of-planning-to-hijack-peace-talks/story-x7Q8sVGjvqYNF691NP8NKN.html

01-12-2020||India||CSIR chief slams ‘faulty’ Chinese report on Covid-19 origin||Slamming a recent Chinese research report which claimed that Covid-19 had origins in India or Bangladesh, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Director-General Dr Shekhar C Mande on Tuesday said that the study was shoddily done and was riddled with errors.“There is a paper which is under consideration of publication in Lancet. It has not been peer-reviewed yet, so we can’t say what the peer review system will do to it. But it claims that the origin of the SARS-CoV2 virus is in India, and having read the paper myself fully and thoroughly understood what it says, the study is very shoddily done. The analysis was very badly done, and I don’t think it will stand the scrutiny of a peer review system,” Dr Mande told ANI.Dr Mande further said that the Chinese reported a high monkey-human interaction in India, which had nothing to do with the virus.“The combination of methodologies that they have used to show that the virus originates in India or Bangladesh is quite faulty, it is not right. For example, they have taken sequences from one database. That database has only selective sequences that have been submitted. So it is not a random sample of sequence,” he said.He further informed that there were too many loopholes in the study and therefore its veracity could not be confirmed, adding that it can be comfortably said that the study is wrong.During a media briefing on Monday, World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that some countries are politicising the origin of the virus.“We’re doing everything to make sure that we know the origin. Some have been politicising this. Our position is very clear that we’ll start the study from Wuhan, know what has happened there and based on findings, to explore if there’re other avenues,” said Ghebreyesus.Commenting on Ghebreyesus’ statement, Dr Mande said: “WHO goes very rationally about finding these things. We don’t need to bring any political angle to it, what we want is to go to the bottom of the truth and there is science behind it. Scientifically, we explore every question and try to see where the origin of the virus is, and today the consensus is that the origin of the virus is in Wuhan province of China. So there is a general consensus in the world and it is what we would like to trust,” he further said.Taking to Twitter, Dr Mande shared the link of the study, saying: “Plenty of glaring errors in the study. I’ve pointed out in a series of my tweets that the study design, conduct and analysis are faulty. Hopefully the scientific world will reject the hypothesis.”According to South China Morning Post, a paper from researchers in China proposed that the first transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place on the Indian subcontinent.The report was based on research into strains of the virus provided by 17 countries and regions, and claimed to trace the earliest outbreak to India or Bangladesh.The deadly virus which emerged in China’s Wuhan province has now infected more than 63 million people worldwide, and claimed the lives of more than 1.4 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/csir-chief-slams-faulty-chinese-report-on-covid-19-origin/story-7gEug1ku07Xu5EhqEXc4HL.html

01-12-2020||India||With govt’s pro-farmer image under fire, BJP wants amicable end to farm protests||The Bharatiya Janata Party leadership is pushing for an early, amicable resolution to the farmers’ protest as the ongoing agitation threatens to derail the party’s expansion plans in Punjab, and weakens the Union government’s “pro-farmer image”, said people aware of the details. Even as the meeting between the government and the farmers’ representatives remained inconclusive on Tuesday, BJP functionaries remained optimistic that the logjam will be resolved. The next round of talks between the government and the farmers’ representatives will now be held on Thursday.A senior party functionary, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement on Monday that the laws are beneficial for the farmers is an indication that the government is ready to address their concerns. But a rollback may not be on the cards, the functionary added. “The genuine grievances of the farmers will be addressed. They have concerns over some aspects such as whether the government will continue providing MSP (Minimum Support Price). We are ready to answer those concerns. The demand for a rollback is based on rumours and fear stoked by the opposition,” the functionary said. On Tuesday, Union ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Piyush Goyal attended a meeting over the farmers’ protest at BJP chief, JP Nadda‘s residence. The party has also stepped up efforts to reach out to farmers’ groups, sending out senior functionaries to set the “record straight”. “From ministers to MPs to functionaries at the block level, everyone will act as an emissary of the government and clear the misconception of the farmers,” said a second functionary. Pro-farmer image To ensure that its pro-farmer image is not tarnished, the party is reiterating the measures taken to improve the lot of the farmers. “It was the BJP government that announced schemes such as soil health cards, facilities for micro irrigation, irrigation in every field, 95% of the Swaminathan report has been implemented, farmers are getting cash benefits from the Kisan Saman Nidhi. But the opposition has created fear that the government will not support MSP,” the second functionary said. Party leaders have also been pointing out that the protests being limited to Punjab and parts of Haryana is proof of the Congress misleading farmers. “Farmers elsewhere have understood how small and marginal farmers stand to gain from the new laws. It is only in Punjab where the Congress government has created fear in their minds. In states such as MP, UP and Gujarat farmers have faith in the Modi government,” the second functionary said. Punjab prospects The political ramifications of the protest are another area that has the party worried. After the Shiromani Akali Dal ended its alliance with the BJP over the new farm laws, the saffron party has been trying to expand its footprint in the state. “There is a vote bank that is neither Akali nor supports the Congress; these are non Panthak voters who the party can count on for support,” said a third functionary. The BJP has already begun preparations for the 2022 Punjab assembly polls that it plans to contest on its own. It has deployed its cadre to undertake a membership drive at the booth-level and set up party offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-govt-s-pro-farmer-image-under-fire-bjp-wants-amicable-end-to-farm-protests/story-l73sxS1QXYsoqAStsEA0qI.html
01-12-2020||India||Covid+ patients treated as untouchables once posters outside homes, says SC||Pasting posters outside Covid-19 positive homes is causing such patients to be treated as untouchables, remarked the Supreme Court on Tuesday while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a ban on this practice.“The hard reality that exists on ground is that if you are pasting such posters outside the homes of Covid positive persons, they are being treated as untouchables,” said a three-judge bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah to a PIL filed by Kush Kalra.The Centre informed the apex court that such a practice has not been approved under any guideline issued by the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW).The ministry, through an affidavit, informed the top court that on November 19, all states and union territories have been strictly informed that “MoHFW Guidelines do not contain any instructions or guidelines regarding affixing of posters or other signage outside the residences of those found Covid positive.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre, told the bench, “We have not prescribed that posters have to be affixed. Perhaps states may have issued it on their own.”The petition by Kalra stated that such an exercise undertaken under the Disaster Management Act, stigmatised persons suffering from the disease and infringed their privacy and right to live with dignity protected under Article 21 of the Constitution.Mehta said, “If something is pasted that causes anyone to be maligned or stigmatised, it should be avoided. But the logic seems to be that any unknown person should not inadvertently enter the home.”It was Kalra who had earlier approached the Delhi High Court that led the Delhi government to discontinue the practice of affixing posters outside Covid-19 infected persons or persons in isolation. He sought similar orders for the entire country as he said that such a practice commenced during the plague epidemic in the 1730s.“Circulation of such names in WhatsApp groups leads to stigmatisation of such persons in their neighbourhood and community,” the petition stated. The bench posted the matter for hearing on December 3 as it was yet to go through the affidavit of the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-patients-treated-as-untouchables-once-posters-outside-homes-says-sc/story-Uc5kiHlfCLEt7K6XEjLFLK.html
01-12-2020||India||In battleground Bengal, data becomes key weapon for BJP, TMC||The campaign for next year’s assembly election in West Bengal is witnessing for the first time a more focused battle in which data is the principal weapon as the ruling Trinamool Congress and the BJP spar on social media. In their extensive social media campaigns, the parties are dishing out statistics, videos and photographs to counter each other’s claims on sector-wise development and social welfare measures. In the past, only the Communist Party of India (Marxist) focused on statistics in poll campaigns but social media was in its infancy when the party was in power. “The data war intensified about two weeks ago when Amit Malviya, head of the BJP’s national information and technology (IT) cell, was given additional charge of Bengal by Union home minister Amit Shah and party president J P Nadda,” said a senior state BJP leader who did not want to be named. “IT cell members compiling data and experts in the multimedia teams have their hands full. Current and old recordings of speeches of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and senior TMC leaders are being played back and forth so that short clips can be made out of selected portions and used with data in social media posts. These have an impact on people,” the leader added. The TMC, on the other hand, is focusing on statistics not only on social media but at special press conferences being held every afternoon for the last two weeks. “Unlike Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we are open to questions. A senior MP or minister focuses on a specific area and speaks for 20 minutes. This is followed by a 15-20 minute interactive session with journalists. We will do this till Mamata Banerjee completes her third term in office,” Derek O’Brien, TMC Rajya Sabha member and national spokesperson told HT. O’Brien is also leading the TMC’s data war on social media. “Mitron, Modi-Shah and their tourist gang are photo-op know-alls in Bengal. But data shows how BJP’s governance is anti-Dalit. 2019 saw 62% increase in deaths due to manual scavenging (Swachh Bharat?!) States with highest deaths 2019: UP: 21, Maharashtra: 17, Gujarat: 16.” O’Brien tweeted on Tuesday. The Dalit vote bank, incidentally, is crucial for the BJP in Bengal. On November 27, Abhishek Banerjee, Lok Sabha member and Mamata Banerjee’s nephew targeted the Prime Minister with a tweet comparing the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat healthcare scheme with the state’s Swasthya Sathi programme. He posted a chart showing that while the entire cost of treatment is borne by the Bengal government the Centre bears only 60 % under Ayushman Bharat. “It is indeed high time that @narendramodi ji starts taking governance lessons from @MamataOfficial!...” tweeted the young TMC leader.The BJP quickly posted a counter tweet, referring to him as bhaipo (nephew in Bengali) and the chief minister as pishi (aunt in Bengali). “Will Bhaipo explain to people of Bengal why he and Pishi opt to get treated at a multispeciality hospital that has refused to come under Swasthya Sathi? Or is it that Bengal’s poor don’t deserve to get treated at Kolkata’s top hospitals under Pishi’s scheme?” the BJP tweeted.Incidentally, Malviya refers to Mamata Banerjee as pishi in almost all his tweets even if they are not related to Abhishek Banerjee. “Election campaign and media outreach programmes are intertwined. Social media posts are necessary for remaining in focus all the time. It is not that these will increase vote share but some posts get tremendous response. Malviya’s tweet on Tuesday on Bengal’s debt burden is a good example. I got calls from two media houses,” said BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar. O’Brien, however, did not want to link the posts to the polls. “We are not into this campaign for the elections or counter the BJP’s fake posts. Our intention is to focus on the positive aspects of governance. The BJP leaders camping in Bengal are tourists. They will enjoy local vegetarian food for five months and leave. We will win the elections,” said O’Brien.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-battleground-bengal-data-becomes-key-weapon-for-bjp-tmc/story-3GafkNJ4VqElbsqGCawQAL.html

In September, the Uttar Pradesh government had revised the rates for Covid-19 tests conducted by private labs from Rs 2,500 to Rs 1,600.According to the government, if a patient gives sample at the laboratory or the sample is collected by a hospital and sent to the lab the fee for the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test will be Rs 700. And in case the lab gets their sample collected by its staff the rate will be Rs 900. These rates are inclusive of Goods and Services Tax (GST). Government hospitals are providing these tests free of cost, including RT-PCR and antigen tests.Also read | Delhi lowers cap, RT-PCR tests for Rs 800 at private labsThe RT-PCR test was initially priced at Rs 4,500 and the rates were gradually brought down to Rs 2,500 and on September 10, the government decide the rate for private labs will be Rs 1600.RT-PCR tests are accurate but have so far remained costly, and with higher turnaround times than rapid antigen tests. On the other hand, rapid antigen tests are often inaccurate when it comes to so-called false negatives, or giving negative results to people who may be Covid-19 positive.Uttar Pradesh’s Covid-19 caseload reached 545,545 on Tuesday after 1,703 fresh cases were reported across the state and 29 more deaths pushed the toll to 7,788.

Instead, he got into the film industry as a camera attendant. He did a few films as cinematographer before becoming a director and producer. When I grew up, I knew without a doubt that I have to become an actor and fulfill my father’s long-lost dream. When I was all set to act, he planned to produce and direct a Bhojpuri film ‘Sugna’ for me. Luckily, the film was a super hit and helped me to establish myself in the industry,” said the young actor. Aditya has already worked in dozens of Bhojpuri films. “I’m in no hurry. Bhojpuri industry has given me all love and support. I’m slowly expanding my wings. Like any other actor, I too want to try my luck in Hindi films but for now, its TV that is on the cards.”Aditya is happy to make his TV debut . “When I got through auditions for my first TV show, I knew it will be a right move to take up this role in the show ‘Namak Issk Ka’ where I play the lead. The show will also help me to break stereotyped image of Biharis on television. We too have advanced with time. We have mastered English as a language but still love to remain attached to our mother tongue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/wish-to-break-stereotype-image-of-biharis-in-the-industry/story-GvpqbZJB6md87KkfKuzSvI.html

Besides, both seasons of ‘Mirzapur’, he shot for ‘Toilet Ek Prem Katha,’ ‘Kanpuriye’ recently released ‘Bicchoo ka Khel’ and yet to release ‘Brahmastra’ along with ‘Assi Nabbey Pure Sau’. “As I hail from Delhi, I had to work hard to play characters from UP. In ‘Mirzapur,’ ‘Kanpuriye’ or ‘Toilet…’ they belonged to a particular region but then you need to make your accent and body language believable without extra effort. For that, you have to train more, work hard and research well.” On use of excessive expletives in his dialogues, he justifies. “If I talk about Delhi and surrounding region the language is a bit harsh but here even use of abuses is very lyrical. Besides, we just maintained the flavour and kept a universal language so that people can understand it all over. Also, bringing different flavours from the place makes it all the more special.” Divyenndu has shot for film ‘Mere Desh ki Dharti’. “It will be a theatrical release. Besides, I am starting with some very interesting projects soon,” he shared. Talking about his journey he says, “Unlike others my struggle started after I became successful. ‘Pyar ka Punchnama’ gave me instant recognition and reward then ‘Chasme Badoor’ became a bigger hit. Then the challenge was to break the cute-boy image. To break the image, I had to say no to many powerful projects and good money. As an artiste, I’m all raring to do more,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/artistic-expression-that-one-craves-for-gets-it-in-up/story-vSeZM8WYYQhzuNj3jpQPwL.html

You just read it. The public won’t get to see it. Only a few people know this. Earlier it was a practice in the USA and the UK. Now we are seeing it in India,” CM Banerjee said while speaking to reporters at the state secretariat. The Bengal CM said that she learnt Vietnamese on a tour to that country and knows a bit of Russian because she had visited the country thrice. She also claimed to know Naga, Manipuri, Assamese, Odia, Punjabi, Marathi, Urdu, Gorkha and Nepali apart from Bengali, Hindi and English. “There is no need to do publicity. Whenever I visit any state I speak in their language. I have seen enough of this drama. I never show off. I feel proud because I can raise their issues and speak for them,” the CM said. On Sunday, PM Modi had cited a Bengali verse to highlight the significance of his government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat and vocal for local campaigns, while recalling the revolutionary-turned-philosopher Aurobindo Ghosh’s views on Swadeshi. A challenge The Bengal CM also threw a challenge at the BJP-led centre, saying that they may deploy as many investigating agencies and central forces as they want but it would be hard to defeat her party - the Trinamool. “They are targeting Bengal because elections are coming. But no matter what you do, the people of Bengal will not allow an inch of their land to go without a war. Be prepared. You can send as many central agencies and send people to jail,” Banerjee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-never-show-off-mamata-banerjee-on-pm-modi-reciting-bengali-verse/story-okGxfmsGTYQZp0jdWYQVfP.html

01-12-2020||India||Hyderabadis remain lukewarm to GHMC polls, only 42% turn out to vote||Notwithstanding the high decibel campaign by major political parties in the elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polling for which was held on Tuesday, voters of Hyderabad once again remained nonchalant about voting. At the close of polling at 6 pm, only around 42% of the 74.67 lakh voters exercised their franchise, according to tentative estimates of the Telangana State Election Commission authorities. “By 5 pm, the recorded polling percentage was as low as 36.73 and it went up by another 5-6 per cent in the next one hour. We are awaiting final figures from the divisions, as there were still some voters in the queue in some divisions at the time of scheduled closure of polling hours,” a GHMC official familiar with the development said. Moreover, polling was held only in 149 out of total number of 150 divisions in the GHMC, as the SEC cancelled the polling in Old Malakpet division following a complaint from the Communist Party of India (CPI) candidate that his party symbol was missing in the ballot paper. On verification, it was noticed that in the ballot papers, the symbol of CPI (M) party -- hammer, sickle and star was printed, instead of CPI party symbol of ears of corn and sickle. Following a report from the local authorities, the SEC ordered for repoll in all 69 polling stations of Old Malakpet division on December 3. The commission also banned telecast and publication of all exit polls in the GHMC elections till Thursday evening. “If the polling in Old Malakpet division is also taken into consideration, the overall poll percentage might go up further slightly,” the GHMC officials said.’ Yet, the percentage of polling in the GHMC elections this time will be lesser than that in 2016, when it was around 45.27 per cent. In 2009, when the GHMC faced the first elections after its formation in 2007, too, the polling percentage was only 42.04. “Fear of Covid-19 might have forced many people to stay away from polling, because day in and day out, the health department has been cautioning the people about the spread of the virus in public places,” said political analyst and Osmania University professor K Nageshwar. He said lakhs of people who were eking out their livelihood in Hyderabad had returned to their native places due to lack of job opportunities. Thirdly, many others like software professionals who had been given the option of work from home might have gone back to their native places, he said. Telangana Information Technology Association (TITA), a body of software companies, pointed out that most of the 5.82 lakh techies in Hyderabad had gone out of station. “Nearly 80% of software engineers did not take part in voting,” TITA global president Sandeep Makthala said. BJP state president Bandi Sanjay accused the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi of deliberately ensuring low polling percentage hoping to get advantage. “But I am sure the people have reposed their faith in our party,” Sanjay said. Pradesh Congress party working president Ponnam Prabhakar blamed it on the TRS, BJP and Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen parties for the low polling percentage. “They ignored the real issues of people and talked about non-serious issues, as a result of which the voters did not evince much interest,” he said. TRS working president K T Rama Rao, who made an appeal to the people to turn up in large numbers for voting, did not make any comment on the poor turnout. He, however, thanked all those who had voted for the TRS in the elections. The polling went on peacefully, barring minor incidents of clashes among the activists of the TRS, BJP and MIM. Incidents of minor clashes were reported from Azampura, Ghansi Bazaar, Jangammet, Uppuguda, Karwan and Puranapul division in the old city, besides in areas like Hastinapuram, Alwal and Kukatpally. The police quickly brought the situation under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabadis-remain-lukewarm-to-ghmc-polls-only-42-turn-out-to-vote/story-RVBk9fYGa0urI8ExFoYr9I.html

The government has suggested setting up a committee to look into the issues raised by farmers protesting against the new farm laws, but it was rejected by the representatives of 35 agitating organisations during their marathon meeting with three Union ministers. Here’s who said what during the meeting at Vigyan Bhawan:1. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar told the media after Tuesday’s talks that the government was keen on a group being formed but farmers’ leaders wanted that the talks should be held with everyone. 2. “The meeting was good and we have decided that the talks will be held on December 3. We wanted a small group to be constituted but farmers’ leaders wanted that the talks should be held with everyone, we do not have a problem with it,” the minister said.3. Tomar also appealed to the farmers to suspend the protests saying, “We appeal to the farmers to suspend the protests and come for the talks. However, this decision (of suspending the agitation) depends on farmers’ unions and farmers.”4. Bharat Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) President Joginder Singh Ugrahan said the meeting remained inconclusive.5. “The farmer’s organisations rejected the government’s proposal to form a five-member committee to look into the issues related to the new farm laws,” Roopsingh Sanha, member of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), told PTI. 6. “The government asked us to give names of 5-7 members to form a small committee for better discussion, but we rejected it. We said we all will be present. The government is insisting for a small group because they want to divide us. We are very well aware of the government’s tricks,” BKU (Dakaunda) Bathinda district president Baldev Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-agreement-during-farm-unions-govt-meet-who-said-what/story-SBX2Ltco8xe3RORF7vqOVO.html
01-12-2020||India||TN CM forms panel to gather caste-wise data even as PMK pushes for 20% quota for Vanniyars||Tamil Nadu Chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami announced on Tuesday that a commission will be formed to gather caste-wise data for the state after meeting Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) leader and MP Anbumani Ramadoss whose party is demanding 20% reservation in government jobs and education for the Vanniyar community.Earlier in the day, PMK workers pelted stones on a moving train and blocked roads leading to Chennai near Perungalathur when police prevented them from entering the city. Traffic came to a standstill on Grand Southern Trunk, a national highway. The party workers were coming to Chennai from different districts such as Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri to partake in the first day of their protest.“Around 2,000 people have been detained across 65 places,” said assistant commissioner of police, M S Bhaskar citing violation of Covid-19 pandemic norms. There was heavy police deployment across Chennai and its borders. PMK workers were seen removing barricades to make way for their vehicles. Ramadoss who also participated in the protest in Chennai appealed to his party workers to not indulge in unrest. “I request police to allow party workers into Chennai. We want to protest peacefully,” he said. “We had announced that we will protest from December 1 two months ago and reiterated it during our recent general council meeting. This isn’t a caste issue but a developmental issue where backward communities like Vanniyars should grow for the overall progress of Tamil Nadu.” The PMK has been demanding the reservation for four decades without justice, he added. The PMK and its parent outfit, Vanniyar Sangam have revived this old demand ahead of the 2021 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu. PMK and AIADMK are allies in the state. Similar agitations fizzled out in the late 1980s after the Most Backward Category (MBC) was created in which Vanniyars were among the 108 other caste groups that were included. But PMK leaders say that their assessment shows that there are only 4 to 6% of beneficiaries from the Vanniyar community.PMK founder S Ramadoss had lamented in their general council meeting that though they were in alliance with the ruling AIADMK, it was of “no use”. Ramadoss warned that if their demands weren’t met, they would intensify the protest similar to reservations based agitations led by Patidar in Gujarat and Gujjar in Rajasthan. He added that they were also let down by former DMK patriarch and late chief minister M Karunanidhi on this issue.The PMK has often switched their partnership between the DMK and AIADMK. “Ramadoss is one of the finest weathercocks in Tamil Nadu politics. He’s testing waters to increase his stake,” said Ramu Manivannan, head, politics and public administration, University of Madras. “He is useful as a share of vote transfer. The AIADMK needs his support which is why they go out of their way to deal with him whereas the DMK has considerable Vanniyar leaders within their fold. Karunanidhi consciously cultivated that kind of resistance for Ramadoss within the Vanniyar community.”Despite its poor show in the electoral fray in the past decade, PMK retains clout amongst the Dravidian majors. In the 2019 parliamentary elections, PMK’s vote share was 5.4% higher than their ally BJP’s 3.6%. In 2016 assembly elections, the party went solo projecting their leader and former union minister Anbumani Ramadoss as their chief minister candidate but it drew a blank with a 5.3% of vote share.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-will-consider-pmk-s-demand-for-20-quota-for-vanniyars-tamil-nadu-cm/story-tXHU8UyEMTfMLgIk8C2eRI.html

01-12-2020||India||Election Commission proposes extending postal ballot facility for NRIs||The Election Commission has proposed to the government to extend the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System (ETPBS) facility, so far available to service voters, to eligible overseas Indian voters.In a letter to the legislative secretary in the law ministry on November 27, the Commission said with the successful execution of ETPBS in case of service voters, it is now “confident” that the facility can also be extended to the overseas electors. “The Commission is technically and administratively ready to extend this facility in general elections to legislative assemblies of Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,” the poll panel said. Elections in these state are due sometime in April-June next year.It said the poll panel has been receiving several representations from Indian diaspora residing abroad to facilitate voting through postal ballots since such overseas electors are not in a position to be present in their polling area as travelling to India for this purpose is a costly affair and otherwise also, they cannot leave the country of their residence owing to specific compulsions of employment, education or other engagements. “Due to protocols associated with Covid-19, problem further gets compounded,” the letter to the law ministry said.The Commission observed that Section 62 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 envisages right to vote for every citizen registered in the electoral roll who is not subject to disqualification for voting. “Therefore, it is necessary to explore all avenues to enable exercise of a franchise by all eligible electors,” it said.As of now, overseas Indians are free to cast their votes in constituencies they are registered.Unofficial data with the EC shows that only 10,000 to 12,000 overseas voters have exercised their franchise because they do not want to spend foreign currency to come to India and vote.Under ETPBS, postal ballot is send electronically to a service voter. The service voter downloads it and uses a specific envelope to return it to the returning officer of his constituency. The postal ballot should reach the returning officer by 8.00 am on the day of the counting. Counting of votes begin with counting of postal ballots at 8.00 am.Personnel of armed forces posted outside their constituencies in forward areas, personnel of central armed police forces posted in outside their constituencies state police personnel posted on poll duty, embassy staff are considered as service voters. The EC has suggested amending the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 to extend ETPBS for overseas electors. The rules wre amended in October, 2016 to allow service voters use ETPBS.ETPBS has nearly halved the time in sending and receiving postal ballots from far-flung areas.The Conduct of Election Rules were also changed to allow those who are 80 years of age or above and those with disabilities to use postal ballot to cast vote. The same facility was extended for Covid-19 patients. But this postal ballot facility is different from ETPBS. For overseas electors, EC has said the voter will have to intimate the returning officer that he r she wants to use postal ballot. The returning officer will then electronically transmit the ballot paper to the voter by means specified by the EC.The Commission requested the government to make necessary amendments at the earliest “which will go a long way in not only facilitating exercise of right of overseas electors but also further boosting image of the country internationally.” A bill to extend the facility of proxy voting to overseas Indians had lapsed following the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha in 2019.The bill had proposed that overseas Indians, who are entitled to vote in India, can appoint a proxy voter to cast the ballot on their behalf.An expert committee of the Election Commission, working on the issue, had in 2015 forwarded the legal framework to the Law Ministry to amend the electoral laws to allow the overseas Indians to use proxy voting.The bill said the necessary provision of coming to India to cast ballot caused hardship for overseas electors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-proposes-extending-postal-ballot-facility-for-nris/story-s6r1puoQcBf3M635ca4k7M.html

The project is estimated to benefit 70 million people in 46,000 rural villages, ADB said.It will also finance the construction of a parallel network of 11-kilovolt feeders with a total length of 17,000 km to separate the distribution of electricity between residential consumers and agriculture consumers. This will facilitate the use of solar energy to meet the agriculture demand, increase in electricity supply duration to rural residential consumers, and energy and water conservation. In addition, the project will improve the gender inclusivity, corporate governance, and financial management capacity of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL). “Reliable and sustainable power distribution and service is an important aspect to India’s growth and development. This project fully supports the Government of India’s vision of ‘Power for All’ in a sustainable and inclusive way in the largest and one of the poorest states in India,” said ADB Principal Energy Specialist for South Asia Pradeep Perera. Existing rural power distribution networks will be upgraded to enable the provision of reliable supply to customers in rural Uttar Pradesh in a financially sustainable manner, he said.ADB said the MFF is complemented by a USD 2 million technical assistance (TA) grant from the ADB TA Special Fund and the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction to strengthen the gender inclusivity and institutional capacity building of Uttar Pradesh power sector. The TA will pilot test innovative bill collection strategies involving rural women self-help groups, pilot test gender-sensitive workplace practices, provide capacity building for improved financial management, gender-inclusive workplace practices, and strengthen project management and safeguard compliance capacity of UPPCL.The funding to Meghalaya will be used for construction of 23 sub-stations; renovate and modernise 45 sub-stations, including provision of control room equipment and protection systems.Also, it will install and upgrade 2,214 km of distribution lines and associated facilities covering three out of the six circles in the state. Installation of smart metres will benefit about 1,80,000 households, ADB said.The loan will be supplemented by a USD 2 million grant from ADB Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.The project will help develop a distribution sector road map and a financial road map for the Meghalaya Power Distribution Corporation Limited (MePDCL). These road maps will strengthen the capacity of MePDCL to operate and manage the distribution networks, said the Manila-headquartered global funding body.It said though Meghalaya has achieved 100 per cent electrification, remote rural areas in the state suffer from frequent power interruptions due to overloaded distribution networks and sub-stations that use outdated technology, resulting in high aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses. The Government of India and the state government of Meghalaya embarked on a joint 24x7 Power for All Meghalaya initiative to provide uninterrupted, quality, reliable, and affordable power supply to all electricity consumers, ADB said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adb-to-provide-usd-563-million-loan-for-power-projects-in-up-meghalaya/story-6d95cLbhHcOkmWDY3cz7BI.html

We will again meet on December 3. We suggested to them to form a small committee, but they said they all will be present in the meeting. So, we agreed to that,” Tomar told PTI after the meeting.Asked why the government was holding a separate discussion with Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Rakesh Tikait, the minister said, “They have come to us, so we are discussing with them also. We are ready to discuss with all farmers.”Asked when the deadlock will end, he said, “The time will decide.”On the protesting farmers insisting on the repeal of all three farm laws, Tomar said, “We have asked them to come with specific issues in the laws and we are ready to discuss and address their concerns.””If they have any specific issue with any clauses, let them point out. Let them put their views, we will look into them,” he added.Enacted in September, the laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector by removing the middlemen and allowing farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have been worried that the new laws will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price and scrap away mandis that ensure earning.After the meeting, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) said in a statement that the talks remained inconclusive and the government’s proposal was not acceptable to farm unions.It further said protests will now intensify across the country until their demands are met.The 35 farm leaders had met a ministerial delegation that included Agriculture Minister Tomar, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, to press for their demands around the repeal of three central farm acts and withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020.While 32 of the farm leaders were from Punjab unions and one from Haryana, two were from national farmer alliances -– AIKSCC and RKMS.The talks ended inconclusively and will resume the day after on December 3.The farmer leaders rejected the government proposal to form a five-member committee to look into the objections and study the concerns. They told the government that such committees have led to no results and outcomes in the past.The government also asked the farm unions for their detailed critique to be provided in the statutes, and to articulate the objections in detail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-government-notifies-one-farm-law-examining-the-other-two/story-L0UjW2AtRtTNif4EXi9yCO.html

The government also gave a detailed presentation to the farmers’ leaders on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act during the meeting.The protesting farmers are apprehensive that the Centre’s farm laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.At the nearly three-hour-long meeting at Vigyan Bhawan, Tomar was accompanied by railways and commerce and industry Minister Piyush Goyal and minister of state for commerce Som Parkash, also an MP from Punjab.Also read | Delhi government notifies one farm law, examining the other twoAfter the meeting, Bharat Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said it remained inconclusive and the government has called for another meeting on December 3. Ugrahan, the leader of one of the largest blocks of farmers who have been protesting against the new laws, said the government will arrive at a solution after hearing the representatives of the farmer organisations. “The farmer’s organisations rejected the government’s proposal to form a five-member committee to look into the issues related to the new farm laws,” Roopsingh Sanha, member of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), told PTI.The government was, however, firm in its stand that a high-level committee must be formed to look into the issues and wanted the farmer representatives to further consider the proposal. PTI reported citing sources that the ministers were of the view that it was difficult to reach a decision while interacting with such large groups and therefore they suggested meeting with a smaller group, but the farmer leaders were firm that they would meet collectively only.Union leaders said they feared the government might be trying to break their unity and the momentum of their protest. “The government asked us to give names of 5-7 members to form a small committee for better discussion, but we rejected it. We said we all will be present,” BKU (Dakaunda) Bathinda District President Baldev Singh said. “The government is insisting for a small group because they want to divide us. We are very well aware of the government’s tricks,” he alleged.Also read | Trudeau expresses concern at farmers’ protest; India says remarks ‘unwarranted’After the meeting held at Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan, a member of the farmers’ delegation said that their movement against the three farm laws will continue. “We will definitely take back something from the government, be it bullets or a peaceful solution. We will come back for more discussions with them,” Chanda Singh said according to ANI.News agency PTI reported citing officials that another round of meeting was held later in the evening at the agriculture ministry with representatives of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). BKU leader Naresh Tikait also said another delegation of farmers’ leaders was meeting the government at 7pm. He said issues other than the recently enacted farm laws are also likely to be discussed, and mentioned power tariffs for farmers among the probable talking points.The meeting was expected to be attended by representatives from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Uttarakhand, Tikait told reporters at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border while on his way for the meeting. This meeting began soon after the end of the first one with a much larger group at Vigyan Bhawan, where the farmer representatives were unanimous in seeking repeal of the three laws that they have been terming as being against the interest of the farm community.The opposition parties too have stepped up the pressure, asking the Centre to “respect the democratic struggle” of the farmers and repeal the laws.An earlier meeting on November 13 had failed to reach a breakthrough and the next one was originally scheduled for December 3, but it got advanced due to the ongoing protests on Delhi borders. Peaceful sit-ins by farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, continued at the Singhu and Tikri borders with no untoward incident reported after Friday’s violence, while the numbers of protestors swelled at the Ghazipur border on Monday.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meeting-between-farmers-leaders-govt-inconclusive-next-round-on-dec-3/story-vAJL2ziPSsPsagOM7fvFBI.html

The SIT was headed by additional chief secretary Sanjay Bhoosreddy.The SIT was set up to probe different aspects of the ambush case in which eight policemen, including deputy superintendent of police Devendra Mishra, were allegedly shot dead by Dubey and his aides when a police team raided his house in Bikru village of Kanpur on July 3. The SIT had earlier recommended action against 90 officials, including 41 policemen, and other government employees from rural development, food and revenue departments for allegedly helping the gangster. “While recommending an ED probe into the gangster’s property, SIT also recommended registration of FIRs against all those officials who had helped Dubey and his gang in the past many years,” said the government official who did not wish to be named. .He said the SIT report also recommended that these officials be given punishment, ranging from severe to mild, for remaining in constant touch with Dubey and helping him. According to the official, the report, which was submitted in October, said the officials did not attend to complaints against the gangster and issued licensed weapons, SIM cards and passports to him and his gang on the basis of fake documents and false details.He said the SIT in its 3,100 page report recommended strict action against officials who had helped the gang procure licensed weapons and ammunition. The state government had earlier suspended senior IPS officer of DIG rank Anant Deo after the SIT probe pointed to a nexus between Dubey and the police. Deo was SSP of Kanpur for several months before being transferred as deputy inspector general (DIG) of the Special task Force (STF) only a few days before the ambush.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-recommends-ed-probe-into-150-cr-property-of-slain-gangster-vikas-dubey-aides/story-7wAuPRJJv2QJhMCF52avAO.html

01-12-2020||India||Govt never spoke about vaccinating the entire country, says health ministry||The government said on Tuesday it has not talked about vaccinating the entire population of the country against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as India reported 9,462,809 infections and 137,621 related deaths so far.“I just want to make this clear that the government has never spoken about vaccinating the entire country. It’s important that we discuss such scientific issues, based on factual information only,” Rajesh Bhushan, the secretary of the Union health ministry said.Bhushan also said that the average daily positivity rate in India has been 3.72 per cent and with 211 cases per million, India has the lowest cases per million count “among all the big nations.” While data from the past seven days indicate that cases are increasing in European nations, the cumulative positivity rate has decreased in India, he noted. The cumulative positivity rate fell from 7.15 per cent to 6.69 per cent between November 11 and December 1. The number of recoveries had exceeded the number of new Covid-19 infections in India in the month of November, Bhushan added.When asked about the allegations against Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine, the health secretary said that the vaccine timelines in India will not be affected in any manner by adverse events. Recently, a volunteer from Chennai had served a legal notice to SII stating ‘sudden collapse of medical condition’ after vaccination, which the SII has denied, saying Covishield is “safe and immunogenic.” Both parties have now served legal notices regarding the issue.Bhushan said that all subjects sign a consent form before the trials that detail all the possible adverse effects of the vaccine inoculation. The government has also appointed an Institutional Ethics Committee that functions independent of the government and the vaccine manufacturer. This is done to ensure the safety of vaccines since the trials happen over various sites and locations.The health secretary noted that the ethics committee will submit a report to the central authority, that is Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in case of any adverse events.He also said that the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) monitors the clinical trials on a “day-to-day basis” and reports all adverse events. The DCGI then analyses the reports and would then establish if there are any “one-to-one correlation” between the vaccine and the adverse event, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-never-spoke-about-vaccinating-entire-country-health-ministry/story-RpzmIJ46RlDnMxnmyeKnLP.html

01-12-2020||India||More than one-third of kids with Covid-19 show no symptoms, says study||More than one-third of kids infected with the novel coronavirus are asymptomatic, according to a study which confirms that children diagnosed with Covid-19 may represent just a fraction of those infected.The research, published in the journal CMAJ, analysed results for 2,463 children in Alberta, Canada, who were tested during the first wave of the pandemic -- March to September -- for Covid-19 infection. “The concern from a public health perspective is that there is probably a lot of Covid-19 circulating in the community that people don’t even realise,” said Finlay McAlister, a co-author of the study from the University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry in Canada. “When we see reports of 1,200 new cases per day in the province of Alberta, that’s likely just the tip of the iceberg -- there are likely many people who don’t know they have the disease and are potentially spreading it,” he said. Of the 2,463 children, 1,987 had a positive test result for Covid-19 and 476 had a negative result, and of those who tested positive, 714 -- about 36 per cent --reported being asymptomatic. Due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease in up to one-third of children, McAlister said closing schools for a longer period over Christmas was the right decision. “As far as we know, kids are less likely to spread disease than adults, but the risk is not zero. Presumably asymptomatic spreaders are less contagious than the person sitting nearby who is sneezing all over you, but we don’t know that for sure,” he added. The researchers also found that cough, runny nose and sore throat were three of the most common symptoms among children with Covid-19 infection -- showing up in 25, 19 and 16 per cent of cases respectively. However, they said these symptoms were slightly more common among those with negative Covid-19 test results, and therefore not predictive of a positive test. “Of course, kids are at risk of contracting many different viruses, so the Covid-specific symptoms are actually more things like loss of taste and smell, headache, fever, and nausea and vomiting, not runny nose, a cough and sore throat,” McAlister said. “Some people with Covid feel well and don’t realise they have it so they socialise with friends and unintentionally spread the virus, and I think that’s the big issue,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/more-than-one-third-of-kids-with-covid-19-show-no-symptoms-says-study/story-gkhqCpMeu4uMIKu2oBT9qI.html

Sushil Rohella, a senior scientist from WIHG studying seismic activities, said that the entire Himalayan terrain falls under Zone V and Zone IV of Earthquake Zoning Map of India that divides the Indian landmass into four distinct risk zones.“This particular region lies in Zone IV, where such small magnitude earthquakes are expected. A big tectonic feature also passes from this region. We are currently looking at this earthquake from WIHG data and gathering more details.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/earthquake-hits-haridwar-after-40-years-seismic-activity-being-studied/story-dbtaZdo9tN8R9vVzaphEnL.html

Does anyone know about the future of these funds? Where are the lakhs of crores of money gone? Why was no audit done? The Centre is lecturing us. What have they given us to combat the Covid pandemic,” she told a press conference after a cabinet meeting.Charging the Centre with targeting West Bengal as elections are approaching, the Trinamool Congress supremo claimed that law and order situation is better in the state than many other states of the country.“The Centre is using agencies to bulldoze and threaten us. We are not afraid of them. They (BJP) are not a political party but garbage of lies,” she said.Elections to the 294-member West Bengal Assembly are due in April-May next year.About the on-going farmer’s protest in north India, she claimed that no other political party supported the BJP on the issue of farm laws but the saffron party is adamant on bulldozing it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-has-pm-cares-fund-money-gone-asks-west-bengal-cm-mamata/story-owr31o4EDqcV343vzsI4GJ.html
01-12-2020||India||Ahead of Yogi Adityanath’s visit, Uddhav Thackeray says Maharashtra won’t allow anyone to ‘forcibly’ take business away||Ahead of his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath’s visit to the financial capital, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday warned he will not let anybody “forcibly” take businesses away from the state. He made it clear that Maharashtra is not “jealous” about someone’s progress if it happens on the basis of fair competition. Adityanath is arriving late this evening in Mumbai and slated to meet industrialists and film personalities during the visit. As per reports, Sachin Sawant, a spokesperson for the Congress party, a part of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, has alleged a conspiracy to shift Bollywood, the Hindi film industry, out of Mumbai. “We are not jealous if someone progresses, we do not have any problem with someone’s progress if one competes. But if you are going to forcibly take anything away, then of course, I won’t let it happen and you (industrialists) will not be willing to go,” Thackeray said at an event organised by IMC, a small businesses-focused lobby grouping, here. Drawing from the tag line ‘Magnetic Maharashtra’ used by his state while pitching to investors, Thackeray said Maharashtra has strengths including its culture and institutions. “Some people are coming today, they will also meet you all and ask you to come (for investments). But they do not know the magnetic strength (of Maharashtra), it is so powerful that forget people going from here to there, it should not so happen that somebody from there comes here,” Thackeray said.Thackeray said the economy, which had suffered reverses because of the pandemic, is slowly coming back as the unlock process gets underway. Unlike the demonetisation, which had led to “disappearance” of money, Thackeray said the stress caused by the pandemic is not permanent and the money will come back into circulation once economic activity resumes. He said of the Rs 60,000 crore of investment tie-ups with companies announced earlier, work on 70 per cent of them is underway through land allotment or other permissions. Helping a common man’s purchasing power by creating jobs is necessary for overall development, Thackeray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-yogi-adityanath-s-visit-uddhav-thackeray-says-maharashtra-won-t-allow-anyone-to-forcibly-take-business-away/story-gC6ZPdIMVNzqRnXNfit1iN.html
01-12-2020||India||ICICI bank fraud: Court refuses bail to Deepak Kochhar||A special court on Tuesday refused bail to Deepak Kochhar, the husband of former ICICI Bank managing director Chanda Kochhar, in connection with the money laundering case against him.His lawyers cited a recent order of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act Adjudicating Authority’s refusal to confirm attachment of the flat owned by the couple, saying it was not the proceeds of crime. In this backdrop, Deepak Kochhar claimed there was no evidence of money laundering against him.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) opposed the plea and claimed the order of Authority has nothing to do with the proceedings before the court. In any case, the agency said, they were in a process of challenging the order.ED said between June 2009 and October 2011, ICICI Bank sanctioned six high value loans to various Videocon Group companies. In August 2009, Rupee Term Loan (RTL) of Rs300 crore was sanctioned to Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL) in contravention of the bank’s rules and policy.Also read | PMLA adjudicating authority dismisses attachment of assets of Kochhars“As per the structure created by/on the directions of the accused [Deepak Virendra Kochhar], part of the amount which was taken as loan by VIEL from ICICI Bank with an interest liability of more than 12% per annum was paid/transferred to NRPL without any security and without any interest payable by them. This amount of Rs 64 crore is proceeds of crime that is transferred by Videocon Group/ Mr. V. N. Dhoot to NRPL, a company beneficially owned and controlled by Deepak Kochhar,” the ED said in its reply.“The said amount Rs64 crore has been utilised for purchasing properties [Wind farm projects of 33.15 MW capacity].” ED said the proceeds of crime amounting to Rs 64 crore were not intended to be returned to VIL. “... because the company of Videocon Group namely M/s Real Cleantech Private Limited [RCPL, which was part of structure created for holding the proceeds of crime], was allowed silent death i.e. it was struck off in 2018 and the link for return back of funds to Videocon Group was broken.”ED said the flat located at CCI Chambers acquired by family trust of Chanda Kochhar from Videocon Group for a minuscule amount is also a part of proceeds of crime. “Chanda Kochhar and the accused were associated with Mr. V. N. Dhoot/Videocon Group since 1994-95. The accused floated M/s Vikvin Finance Private Limited (VFPL) with his Mother [Late Mrs. Vinodini Kochhar] on 18.03.1992 which was later renamed as M/s Credential Finance Limited (CFL) on 27.09.1994,” the agency said.It added Chanda Kochhar was allotted 1890 equity shares of CFL in 1993. “Further, in 1994-1995, Dhoot through M/s Videocon International Limited, had also invested approximately Rs10 crore in CFL. The flat was the asset of CFL and was purchased after the investment of Dhoot.”The agency said in 2016, through various layered transactions, the flat was transferred to the family trust of Chanda Kochhar set up by her mother for the benefit of her children and Deepak Kochhar is its managing trustee.Deepak Kochhar earlier sought bail saying the ED had failed to file a charge sheet against him within the stipulated 60 days of his arrest. He argued therefore he was entitled to be released on bail. The special court rejected the argument last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icici-bank-fraud-court-refuses-bail-to-deepak-kochhar/story-tTvJUa5hTWZXO7odfhZ1HO.html

Though the DG BSF didn’t say anything on the operational part of it.The tunnel was detected in a joint operation by Border Security Force (BSF) and Jammu and Kashmir police.“It seems terrorists involved in Nagrotra encounter used this 150-metre long tunnel as it’s a fresh one. We believe they had a guide who took them till highway,” BSF Jammu frontier, Inspector General, NS Jamwal had said.The tunnel exit was in thick bushes carefully concealed and meticulously covered with soil and wild growth. The mouth of the tunnel was strengthened and reinforced by the sandbags with markings of Karachi, Pakistan. It was a freshly dug tunnel and appears to be used for the first time.

01-12-2020||India||Rajasthan police officer suspended for allegedly demanding Rs 2 cr bribe||The Rajasthan government has suspended a police officer facing corruption charges after he allegedly demanded a bribe of ₹2 crore from an office bearer of a cooperative society.The suspended officer, Satpal Midha, posted as deputy commandant in Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC), was booked by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) in July on charges of corruption when he was handling the economic offences wing of the Special Operations Group. The accused officer was allegedly demanding ₹2 crore as bribe on behalf of additional director general of police (ADGP) Anil Paliwal to settle a case related to a cooperative society fraud. “A case has been registered against Rajasthan Police Services officer Satyapal Midha, the then addl SP, SOG, by ACB under Prevention of Corruption Act and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code. Hence, using the powers provided under Rajasthan Civil Services Rules, Midha has been suspended. During the suspension period Midha will report to the police headquarters,” said the order issued by the home department on Monday evening. An ACB official said that in April an investor had filed a complaint with the SOG against an office bearer of a cooperative society, alleging that he was duped into depositing ₹25,000 in the society. The complaint was being investigated by Midha. In June, the accused additional SP allegedly demanded ₹2 crore from the office-bearer as a bribe on behalf of ADGP Paliwal. “In the beginning of June, the victim had approached the ACB and filed a complaint that Midha and some of his colleagues were demanding ₹2 crore for not registering an FIR in a case of cheating,” the ACB official said. The ACB official added that between June 2 and June 30, the accused and his subordinates made the victim meet a person in Tammanah towers, located in Vaishali Nagar area of the city and introduced him as Anil Paliwal. The victim expressed his inability to pay the hefty amount and finally approached the ACB, following which an investigation was launched into the case and evidence against Midha obtained. ADGP Paliwal refuted the allegations that he had asked Midha to collect a bribe on his behalf. “I can only say that I had no involvement in the bribery case. The ACB is investigating the charges,” Paliwal said. Midha had also refuted the ACB’s allegations.“I am innocent. All the allegations levelled against me are fake,” he had said when he was booked by the ACB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-police-officer-suspended-for-allegedly-demanding-rs-2-cr-bribe/story-hJni0bFSHuoXfvz1XOhu0N.html

Earlier in the day, PMK workers pelted stones on a moving train and blocked roads leading to Chennai near Perungalathur when police prevented them from entering the city. Traffic came to a standstill on Grand Southern Trunk, a national highway. The party workers were coming to Chennai from different districts such as Salem, Dharmapuri , Krishnagiri to partake in the first day of their protest demanding 20% reservation for vanniyar community. “Around 2,000 people have been detained across 65 places,” said assistant commissioner, M S Bhaskar, adding that there was violation of Covid-19 pandemic norms. The officer said that further course of action will be updated. There is heavy police deployment across Chennai and its borders. PMK workers were seen removing barricades to make way for their vehicles. Ramadoss who also participated in the protest in Chennai appealed to his party workers to not indulge in unrest but protest peacefully. “I request police to allow party workers into Chennai,” he said. “We had announced that we will protest from December 1 two months ago and reiterated it during our recent general council meeting.” PMK has been protesting for this reservation for four decades, he added. “This isn’t a caste issue but a developmental issue where backward communities like vanniyars should grow for the overall progress of Tamil Nadu,” said Ramadoss. PMK and their parent outfit, Vanniyar Sangam are holding protests demanding a 20% sub quota reservation for the vanniyar community in the state’s educational institutions and government jobs-- an old demand that the party has revived in recent months ahead of the 2021 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu. PMK and AIADMK are allies in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmk-leader-ramadoss-to-meet-tn-cm-after-workers-stir-over-20-quota/story-evpj2fYTJ1LIb0L1aiSxyJ.html

01-12-2020||India||Nirav Modi’s remand extended in UK, final hearings in 2021||Nirav Modi, wanted in connection with the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, was further remanded in custody on Tuesday by a court in London hearing India’s extradition request for the diamond merchant The 49-year-old appeared on Tuesday via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London, dressed in a maroon sweater and sporting a full beard, for his regular 28-day “call-over hearing” at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, where Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot extended his remand for another 28 days until December 29.“It will be another short videolink call-over hearing and then there is just over a week before closing submissions in the case,” she told Modi, who spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth.The final hearings in the extradition case are scheduled over two days, on January 7 and 8 next year, when District Judge Samuel Goozee is scheduled to hear closing arguments from both sides before he hands down his judgment a few weeks later.At the last hearing in the case on November 3, Judge Goozee heard the arguments for and against the admissibility of certain witness statements provided by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) and ruled that the evidence to establish a prima facie case of fraud and money laundering against the fugitive diamantaire is broadly admissible.He concluded that he considered himself “bound” by the previous UK court rulings in the extradition case of former Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, had stressed that the evidence, including witness statements under Section 161 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), meets the required threshold for the UK court to determine whether Modi has a case to answer before the Indian judicial system.“The argument that this is a very specific case, distinguishable from Mallya is frankly nonsense,” said CPS barrister Helen Malcolm.That Mallya has a case to answer in India in his fraud and money laundering case has cleared various levels of the UK judicial system and is currently undergoing a “confidential” legal issue before UK Home Secretary Priti Patel can consider signing off on his extradition.Modi’s barrister, Clare Montgomery, who was also the defence counsel in Mallya’s case, however, disputed that the Section 161 witness statements qualify as similar.“The government of India case is not as strong as it was in Mallya,” said Montgomery, as she also raised a specific issue over a witness who was said to speak no English in his testimony for the CBI but signed a statement in English for the ED.Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of “Letters of Understanding” (LOUs or loan agreements), and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud. He also faces two additional charges of “causing the disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death” added to the CBI case.The jeweller has been in prison since he was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard and his attempts at seeking bail have been repeatedly turned down. The charges against him centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by PNB or LoUs.The CPS, on behalf of India, have told the court during the course of two separate set of hearings in May and September that a number of PNB staff conspired with Modi to ensure the LoUs were issued to his companies without ensuring they were subject to the required credit check, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions.Modi’s defence team has sought to counter allegations of fraud by deposing witnesses to establish the volatility of the gems and jewellery trade and that the LoUs were standard practice. His severe depression has also been raised as part of the arguments against extradition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-s-remand-extended-in-uk-final-hearings-in-2021/story-aRdyHWLZgt0ruqIKz9CyXM.html

It also refused to allow the prayer for an inquiry by a retired judge or Central Bureau of Investigations into the allegations against Ramana. Reddy accused Ramana of influencing the listing of cases against him with a view to destabilise his government in a letter to Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on October 6.The bench sent another petition on the issue to be heard along with Andhra Pradesh government’s pending appeal against a separate Supreme Court order lifting the media gag on reporting contents of a First Information Report (FIR) lodged in connection with a land allotment scam at Amravati. Certain relatives of Ramana have been named in the FIR.Also read | Law should not be used to selectively harass people: SCIn the second petition, advocate Sunil Kumar Singh has questioned Reddy’s constitutional propriety in going public with his allegations.

Among all the big nations in the world, cases per million in India are the lowest. The last seven days trends show that European nations are witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases,” said health ministry secretary Rajesh Bhushan.Bhushan said India’s cumulative positivity rate has decreased from 7.15% to 6.69% during November 11-December 1 period. “In November 2020, the number of recoveries has been more than the number of new cases,” Bhushan said.A total 12,78,727 cases were reported in November, a decrease from October’s 18,71,498, accounting for about 13.51 per cent of the total Covid-19 infections reported so far. A total of 88,89,585 people has recovered from the infection so far, pushing the national recovery rate to 93.94 per cent.The health ministry official also confirmed that adverse events are unlikely to impact the delivery timeline of Covid-19 vaccine. “Whenever clinical trials start, subjects are expected to sign a prior informed consent form. This is global practice; it happens across all countries. The form tells the subject about possible adverse events that may happen in case one decides to participate in the trial,” Bhushan explained.India on Tuesday recorded 31,118 fresh cases of the coronavirus disease, pushing the country’s tally to 94,62,809 and the death toll climbed to 137,621 after 482 new fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours.

01-12-2020||India||Odisha: Three elephants die within 12 hrs; two of electrocution||Three elephants died within 12 hours in Odisha, including two of electrocution, in three separate incidents as they fell prey to bushmeat poachers who had laid a trap with high tension 11 KV wires to kill wild boars.In Kadala village under Hindol range of Dhenkanal district, a full grown 35-year-old makhna (tuskless male elephant) was found electrocuted along with a wild boar this morning by locals. Dhenkanal divisional forest officer Prakash Chand Gogineni said late on Monday evening, the lone elephant was passing by the village when it was tracked by elephant trackers and an official of power distribution compnay TDCCOL was asked to switch off power to avert electrocution.“However, he did not listen to us, saying the lines were insulated. But poachers had already cut through the insulation and dangled electric wires which killed the wild boar first and the elephant later. We would write to the distribution company with all the records, seeking departmental action against the junior engineer for not paying heed to to our requests. We are also trying to apprehend the person who laid the live wire,” said Gogineni.Also read | Skeleton of elephant, unidentified animal found at metro construction site in MaharashtraSimilarly, late on Monday night, a 12-year-old tusker in Sambalpur district was also found electrocuted at Jadu Loisingha village after it came in contact with an electric wire connected to 11 KV line.Sambalpur divisional forest officer Sanjeet Kumar said the tusker may have died after coming in contact with the live wire laid for poaching wild boars. “It has been a common practice for some hunters to lay electric wires to prevent their crops from being destroyed by pachyderms and other wild animals. And this caused the death of the tusker. Exemplary punishment will be handed down to the culprits found,” said the DFO.The elephant, part of an 18-member herd, was seen on Sunday night among paddy crops at Basiapada and Bargetikra in the area. There, the people drove the herd away into the forest. Samples have been collected for lab tests from the carcass which bore no injury marks. The DFO said he has ordered a probe into the incident and directed assistant conservator of forest to submit a report in this connection within three days.Wildlife activists demanded that forest department should take immediate steps to stop rampant poaching of wild boar throughout the state and ensure all power lines in forest areas are insulated cables.In a separate incident, a four-month-old elephant calf died after being stuck in mud at Lauguda under Seragada block of Ganjam district on Monday night. Forest officials had launched an operation to rescue the animal, but could not rescue it well in time. The officials have recovered the carcass for autopsy.Since April 1 this year, 40 elephants have died in the state due to electrocution, poaching or after getting hit by running trains and trucks. Similarly, 64 people have died in human-elephant conflict while 71 have been injured in 111 encounters. Wildlife activists said the casualties in elephant and human beings would increase in the next few months as paddy harvest season is about to start.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-three-elephants-die-within-12-hrs-two-of-electrocution/story-zmD9V74RpUuIrzmmlBlmyL.html

Emergency services including casualty, Labour rooms, emergency surgeries will function along with ICU’s, CCU’s but no elective surgical case will be posted,” the statement said.Talking about the protest, Dr Rajan Sharma, national president of IMA said, “The notification of the amendment to the CCIM Act on Postgraduate Ayurveda surgery and the entitlement to study and practice independently have to be seen as another step in advancing and legitimising mixopathy.”“In fact, the purity and identity of Ayurveda stands equally challenged. That the council prescribed modern medicine textbooks and Ayurveda institutions practiced surgery with the assistance of modern medical doctors cannot be reason enough to legitimise encroachment into the jurisdiction and competencies of modern medicine,” he added.Adhering to Covid protocols, public demonstrations will be held in small groups of 20 participants between 12 noon to 2 pm on December 8, and all the participants will wear white aprons and sport a stethoscope, along with showcasing placards with slogans against mixopathy.Also Read |  NMC member writes to chief, criticises nod to Ayurveda doctors to perform surgeriesThe medical body added that the objective of these demonstrations is the withdrawal of CCIM order on the surgical disciplines of Modern Medicine and withdrawal of the four committees of NITI Aayog mixing all systems of medicine.Dr RV Asokan, Honorary Secretary General of IMA appealed to the government on the medical body’s behalf to consider the sensitivity of the medical fraternity and take appropriate steps in the matter.“IMA will be constrained to intensify the agitation until the steps towards implementing mixopathy are abandoned. IMA has appealed to all the sister professional speciality organisations, the organisations of medical college teachers, Government Doctors, Resident Doctors Associations apart from medical students and Hospitals Associations to support its cause to retain the separate identity and existence of modern medicine,” said Asokan.“Today India remains the frontier of modern medicine in both evidence-based and clinical streams. Advanced and sophisticated surgeries and procedures are done at a fraction of the cost than in the West. Indian doctors are supporting Health Systems globally,” IMA added in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayurveda-surgery-row-ima-threatens-to-suspend-non-covid-non-essential-services-on-dec-11/story-mx7InipXoJmeQM5dunbebP.html

Anyone whether a terrorist, separatist, politician or Tukde Tukde gang leaders like Shehla Rashid will be dealt with sternly,” Raina said in a statement. The BJP leader’s remarks came a day after Abdul Rashid Shora, the estranged father of student activist Shehla Rashid, levelled serious allegations against her, demanding that a probe be initiated into her NGOs and also accused her of having taken a huge amount of money for joining politics in Kashmir, a charge denied by her. Shehla termed her father’s statement “absolutely disgusting and baseless” and said this was his reaction after a court barred him entry into their Srinagar house on November 17 in response to a complaint filed by the family against him for alleged domestic violence. Raina alleged, “Hurriyat Conference, Tukde Tukde gang’s Shehla Rashid, (former MLA) Engineer Rashid and (businessman) Zahoor Watali  and some other political leaders have been running their ‘shop of death’ in Jammu and Kashmir over the past 30 years. “They have bled Kashmir at the behest of Pakistan from whom they are taking money and their hand is behind the killing of innocent people.” He said they are not leaders or well-wishers of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. “They stand exposed today.

Alleged nepotism and malpractice by the ruling Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) panchayat leaders involved in the distribution of compensation had turned into an issue in poll-bound West Bengal. “A division bench of the high court directed the CAG on Tuesday to do a financial audit and a performance audit of the distribution of relief and compensation after cyclone Amphan and submit a report within three months,” said Shamim Ahmed, the advocate who filed the case on behalf of two farmers’ organisations in south Bengal. Amphan hit West Bengal on May 20, killing 98 people and damaging more than a million houses and croplands. While the state government had announced a relief of Rs6,250 crore, the Centre announced a relief of Rs1,500 crore. “The case was filed in August. At least five cases were filed in connection with corruption charges. The high court was hearing all the cases. Earlier, it had asked the state disaster management department to submit a report. The department’s secretary was also asked to remain present in the court,” said Shamim. Later in the day, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said even though distribution of relief materials after Amphan has had come under the scanner, no audit was done for the PMCares fund set up by the Centre to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. “I am not saying anything against the court. I am just asking as a citizen. Even though questions are being raised against distribution of relief materials and compensation in post-Amphan period, not a single audit has been done to find out where lakhs of crores of rupees are going from PMCares fund. Why such double standards?” she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-hc-directs-cag-for-audit-of-distribution-of-relief-materials-in-aftermath-of-cyclone-amphan/story-7SVozRbTfEEqvUrftFtJ0O.html

01-12-2020||India||28 years of NACO: How India battled AIDS/HIV||India diagnosed its first cases of AIDS in 1986 under the guidance of Suniti Solomon, a teacher at Madras Medical College. Before Solomon decided to track the advent of AIDS in India, it was largely considered to be a disease that only affects homosexuals.When she took on this mammoth task, India did not have the required technology to carry out Western Blots, the technique preferred for HIV diagnosis across the world. The samples had to be sent to Johns Hopkins University in the US.In 1992, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) was launched in India along with the Phase I of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), funded with the help of a World Bank loan. After many trials and tribulations, India was able to record success in controlling the advent of AIDS during the Phase III process of the NACP.NACP III was launched in July 2007 with ‘the goal of Halting and Reversing the Epidemic by the end of project period’ according to NACO. And for the first time, indigenous and grounded ways were developed by the experts at NACO to halt and reverse the spread of HIV epidemic in India over a five-year period by targeting High-Risk Groups (HRG). Involving activists who lived with HIVNACO involved people who had been living with HIV, many of whom had already worked as activists, to target High-Risk Groups. This ushered in a new era of cooperation between the community and the government. To reach the people living on the margins of society who were part of the HRGs grassroots activists played the most significant role, right after donors.Educating HRGs on use of protectionNACO activists worked with sex workers, long haul truck drivers, rural migrants, transgender individuals, and homosexuals to educate them on the need for protection during sexual intercourse. This was the first known movement in India that openly talked about the importance of condoms, without ostracising them. The grassroots activists carried the community work forward with their lived experience.Innovative and effective campaigningNACO was able to track and trace the advent of HIV in drug users through needle sharing. A specially designed campaign was launched in Manipur to educate drug users on the negative side effects of needle sharing, grassroots activists took great care in making the targeted population involved and included. NACO also partnered with many NGOs like the Naz Foundation to increase impact. A special train filled with literature on HIV awareness was flagged off from Delhi. It travelled all over the country to distribute reading material and raise awareness of HIV.Road aheadNACO, for the most part, has functioned as an autonomous body but over the years successive experimentations have taken its toll on its effectiveness. With significant fund cuts, NACO has started to lag behind in its efforts to combat the epidemic. The United Nations has warned the world that this ongoing coronavirus pandemic will take its toll on programs like HIV prevention as nations go through fund crunch.“In the light of all these challenges, the Centre needs to seriously rethink its position on committing funds for priority public health programmes like AIDS,” JVR Rao, former head of NACO and health secretary, also pointed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/28-years-of-naco-how-india-battled-aids-hiv/story-qXoOM5C8wfV4shIDa4k1RP.html

Not even a single incident of violence took place.“But water cannons and teargas shells were used against them when they were going to Delhi.

It was 15.26 per cent on November 7. There has been a reduction of nearly 55 per cent since then.

RT-PCR test turnaround time is 24 hours. Since, the labs are fully used, so more time is being taken by labs to process (the samples)”. “The Centre had said some special labs will be allotted. ICMR controls all such labs.

In a letter to the Union law ministry, the EC cited a successful implementation of Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System (ETPBS) for service voters and added it is confident that the facility can also be extended to overseas electors.“After an amendment in Rule 23 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, the Commission has now implemented Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System (EPTBS) for service voters,” the letter said. “This system is completely secure and functioning satisfactorily.”Voters living outside India can currently vote only in their respective constituencies. There are around 12.6 million Indian passport holders, who ordinarily reside in over 200 countries, according to the government.Also read | Plea in SC to direct EC to nullify election if NOTA gets most votesLok Sabha in October 2018 passed a bill to allow NRIs to vote through proxies. The bill lapsed pending approval by the Rajya Sabha before the dissolution of the lower House.The EC, in its letter, a copy of which HT has seen, said it has received several representations from the Indian diaspora to facilitate voting through postal ballots. It added overseas electors are not in a position to be present in their polling areas as travelling to India for this purpose is a costly affair. EC said job compulsions have kept the voters from travelling for voting. It added the problem has been further compounded due to the Covid-19 pandemic.A panel formed in 2014 to assess the matter proposed an amendment to section 60 of the Representation of People’s Act to allow NRIs to vote via postal ballots or through proxies. The proposal is pending before the law ministry and will require parliamentary approval.EC requested the government to make necessary amendments at the earliest. “[The extension of the facility to NRIs] will go a long way in not only facilitating the exercise of the right of overseas electors but also further boosting the image of the country internationally.”Former chief election commissioner S Y Quraishi said the problem remains the differentiation between the domestic and international migrants. “The problem with postal ballots for NRIs is that we cannot pick and choose between domestic and international migrants. How can those, who migrate from Bihar to Delhi for work, not be allowed but those moving from Delhi to the US [be allowed to vote via postal ballots]?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-proposes-postal-ballot-for-nris-asks-government-to-amend-law-at-earliest/story-RdBYMVsHLlalkSKJlSRHVP.html

If you (RBI) have imposed the restrictions, then you have to apply your mind. You cannot accept what PMC bank says as gospel truth. You cannot leave it to PMC bank to decide to whom it will disburse funds.” said a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan.“This is not satisfactory. You cannot leave it to the PMC bank to decide. There has to be some way to monitor it. something independent of the administrator (appointed by RBI),” the bench added.The court was hearing an application by consumer rights activist Bejon Kumar Misra seeking directions to the RBI to consider other needs of PMC bank depositors such as education, weddings and dire financial position, not just serious medical emergencies as being done at present.The application was filed through advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi in Misra’s main PIL seeking directions to the RBI to ease the moratorium on withdrawals from PMC Bank during the coronavirus pandemic.During the hearing on Tuesday, the bench told RBI that “there should be a valve open so that depositors can access their money” and asked it to consider gradually increasing the cap on withdrawals from its present limit of Rs 1 lakh per account.The bench also told RBI that there should be a grievance redressal mechanism in place to address grievances of depositors who are not satisfied by the decision taken by PMC bank or the administrator appointed by the top bank.The court also told Misra that while the depositors need to have some recourse, the restrictions on withdrawals cannot be removed as then PMC bank would go under and then no one will get any money.“We have to strike a balance. There is limited corpus available with PMC bank. Therefore, there has to be a gradation of the difficulties being faced by the depositors,” the bench said.The court gave RBI four weeks time to file its reply to the application and listed the matter for hearing on January 4, 2021.The court on May 28 had asked the Centre, the RBI and PMC Bank to appreciate the difficulties faced by the depositors on withdrawals during COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-pulls-up-rbi-for-leaving-it-to-pmc-bank-to-decide-depositors-requests-for-money-in-emergencies/story-UsujDIQ5k5gFZcROzx798L.html

All those who are eligible for the schemes will get the benefits. For example, Swastha Sathi (health scheme) will cover the entire population of the state,” Municipal Affairs Minister Firhad Hakim said while inaugurating a ward office here.The 11 schemes will be made available to the beneficiaries through camps set up for the purpose, he said.The camps will be functional from 10 am to 4 pm every day, an official said.The schemes include globally acclaimed ‘Kanyashree’, a cash transfer programme aimed at retaining girls in schools and preventing their early marriage, ‘Khadya Sathi’ which aims at ensuring food security for 90 per cent of the population and ‘Sikhashree’, a one-time grant to SC and ST students studying in classes 5-8 to reduce their dropout rates.Other schemes include ‘Rupashree’, a one-time grant of Rs 25,000 to poor families during their daughter’s marriage, ‘Jai Johar’ for the betterment of STs, ‘Taposili Bandhu’ pension scheme for SCs and ‘Aikyashree’ scholarship programme for students from minority communities.State BJP chief Dilip Ghosh, however, alleged that the TMC government kicked off its election campaign using public money.“They are using public money for the election campaign. After 10 years, if the state government has to launch a campaign to ensure everybody gets the benefits, then the TMC leaders should be ashamed of themselves,” Ghosh said.Hakim, while reacting to the allegations, said Ghosh should first answer about the amount of public money spent by the BJP-led government at the Centre on its publicity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-kicks-off-massive-duare-sarkar-outreach-campaign-ahead-of-polls/story-QIr489Ik46HwKgrmuvLPIP.html

01-12-2020||India||China-made drones are the new weapon in Pakistan’s jihadi arsenal: Intel||Pakistan-backed terrorist groups and its Inter Services Intelligence have started using bigger drones to expand its capacity to smuggle arms and ammunition across the border in India’s Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir, people familiar with the matter said.Counter-terror officials in Delhi said the terrorist groups and the ISI, which had been using drones for arms trafficking at a small scale over the past few years, had procured upgraded versions of the drones that can carry much larger quantities of firearms in every sortie.The increased capacity, one official said, was crucial since the high mountain passes on the Line of Control (LoC) are all snowed in to make jihadist infiltration difficult in Jammu and Kashmir. There are multiple intelligence reports, he said, that the Pakistani deep state is using weapon drops in Punjab, which are meant for terrorists operating in Jammu and Kashmir.Latest reports also indicate that Pakistan-based Khalistani groups are also being pushed by their handlers to exploit the farmers’ agitation in Punjab as part of its continuing effort to revive militancy in the border state. These suspicions have been communicated to the Centre and internal security agencies by the State Police time and again.In Punjab alone, officials said, there have been four Chinese drone recoveries by Punjab Police along with weapons since 12 August 2019 apart from other aerial movements.But Chinese commercial drones being used to ferry firearms is only one part of the problem. Intelligence agencies have also alerted security forces to stay alert to the threat of the drones capable of carrying loads being used to bomb targets close to the border. Pakistan’s ISI, inspired by the success of using cheap drones to carry out small bomb attacks, has been exploring this option for terrorist groups. The ISI had laid out its plan first at a meeting with senior Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed commanders in Punjab province’s Taxila in April this year. There was a follow-up meeting the next month at the brigade headquarters in Kotli district of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, according to an intelligence report reviewed by Hindustan Times in October.Officials said while India is pushing hard to build its anti-drone capacities, the coming two winter months with fog along the border in Punjab and J&K will test the Indian security agencies hard as more drone drops are expected. Border Security Force director general Rakesh Asthana alluded to the challenge at the raising day event of the force on Tuesday, pointing that the BSF had intercepted a drone with a huge payload of weapons and ammunition in Jammu’s Kathua sector on 20 June this year.The BSF, he said, is also working to find technical solutions to counter drone infiltrations on the western border.Punjab Police, on its part, has asked the Centre as well as the Indian Air Force (IAF) to deploy low-level radars along the border to detect the drones and destroy them. Even the BSF, which mans the international borders, is now rushing to procure anti-drone systems as apart from weapons, drugs are also being dropped to raise terror funds within the two Indian territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drones-imran-khan-bsf-punjab/story-MCIN6IXmarR7ic9D5YHTkL.html

The KMSC is one of the 32 Punjab farmers’ bodies invited for talks with the Centre. “A committee of several farmers’ bodies has not been invited and moreover, the prime minister is not holding this meeting. Because of these reasons, KMSC is not going to attend the meeting,” KMSC general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said. Pandher accused the government of trying to divide the protesting farmers by not inviting all the farmer unions. “If 32 Punjab-based farmers’ bodies have been invited (for talks), a committee representing around 500 farmers’ organisations is also there which should have also been invited,” he said. “By not inviting all farmers’ bodies, an attempt is being made to divide the farmer organisations. If we attend the meeting, it will be presumed that this agitation (against farm laws) is only taking place in Punjab which could be the conspiracy of the Centre,” he claimed. Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that these farm laws are in the interest of the farming community, Pandher said, “He (the PM) has already given his decision before the meeting. And now, no minister can go against the PM.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-based-farmers-body-accuses-government-of-dividing-the-movement-refuses-to-attend-meeting-with-centre/story-QchM50qrw1rzoV3bu8QluO.html

In its affidavit, MoRTH also mentions that before the SC’s September 8 order, “12m formation cutting has already been carried out in 537km out of the total sanctioned length of 662km… Thus, where hill cutting has been done on the basis of 12m formation and a 10m tarred road has already been laid down or yet to be laid down, a substantial reduction in the width of the road to 5.5m in terms of the 2018 circular at this stage will result in non-uniform carriageway width varying from 10m to 5.5m in short stretches.” “This sudden change in road width in a short road length is not desirable from road users’ safety perspectives and may lead to the formation of black spots and spurt in road accidents.” HT has a copy of the affidavit signed by Dharmananda Sarangi, additional director general, MoRTH. Also read | Don’t undermine SC on Char Dham planOn September 8, the apex court had upheld the recommendation of the minority members of the High-Powered Committee (committee formed to assess environmental damages of Char Dham Road) and asked the implementing agencies to reduce the width of the road to 5.5m for the whole project. This order was based on a March 2018 circular released by MoRTH laying down guidelines for road construction in hilly terrains in the country. A senior official from the regional office of MoRTH in Uttarakhand, requesting anonymity, said, “All we are trying to say is that reducing the road length is not advisable in this situation as a broad length road is already running and all of a sudden, it will be reduced, which will give rise to accident spots in between.” He added, “In future (15 years estimated design life of Char Dham Road), traffic will increase on these roads and the need for a two-lane paved shoulder road can arise, when cutting the hills again will be problematic. So, we are requesting the court that if not 12m, we should at least be allowed to make 10m of road.” Further citing strategic importance of the roads leading to the Indo-China border, the affidavit mentions that the March 2018 circular of MoRTH, “…is general in nature based on Passenger Car Unit traffic and applicable to all the hilly areas in the country. The same did not have in mind the strategic requirement for movement of military vehicles with heavy equipment especially in the Himalayan region leading to International Borders/ Line of Actual Control as well as for roads identified as economic corridors.” Reacting to the arguments of the affidavit, Hemant Dhyani, member of HPC from minority group said, “First, environment impact assessment was deliberately by-passed, then several violations with regards to forest clearances have been done, hill cutting and tree felling continued unabated despite HPC’s request to wait for its recommendations.” “MoRTH’s own 2018 circular for hilly terrain was kept concealed from the court and the HPC and now to say that since they have done all this work, therefore they should be allowed to continue, even in opposition to court’s order will be like rewarding and legitimising wrong actions,” added Dhyani. Mallika Bhanot, an Uttarakhand-based environmentalist, said, “There is no notification which says that strategic roads should be of double-lane paved shoulder. The Centre is saying that there has been no fresh hill cutting, but when we go on ground, the reality is different. They are misleading the court by making such claims. Moreover, when they (MoRTH) are saying that sudden shortening of road will lead to accidents, it is true; the implementing agencies should have followed their own guidelines of March 2018 and not done excess hill cutting. The SC and the HPC had also repeatedly said that no new hill cutting should be done till their report is submitted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/char-dham-project-sudden-change-in-road-width-may-lead-to-spurt-in-accidents-centre-tells-sc/story-feKuOStkyQgIyHCHkD8gIM.html

01-12-2020||India||Covid-19: IIT-B study confirms social distancing norms, effectiveness of face mask||Highlighting the importance of social distancing to contain the spread of Covid-19, a new study at IIT Bhubaneswar has found that small droplets released during a sneeze can travel up to 25 feet without protective measures like a face mask and tiny particles can also escape through such gears.The study said protective measures like face mask and face shield effectively reduce the leakage and reach of the sneeze within 1ft3ft. However, they do not completely stop the leakage of smaller droplets, it said.Hence social distancing is equally important. The study recommends using the elbow or hand to prevent droplets leakage even after wearing a mask during coughing and sneezing, IIT Bhubaneswar said in a statement.Noting that controlling the virus from spreading has been a major challenge, it said the study was conducted on the efficacy of various non-standard and standard face masks under the act of sneezing.The study, conducted by Dr Venugopal Arumuru, Assistant Professor, School of Mechanical Science (SMS), and his team, confirmed that without protectives measures like a face mask, the smaller droplets expelled during a sneeze can travel up to 25ft in a stagnant environment.It confirms and also recommends a social distancing of 6ft from all orientations to prevent transmission of Covid- 19.“In the Covid-19 scenario, the present study will improve the understanding of smaller droplets/particles dynamics in turbulent flows, which causes transmission of the virus. These visualisation results will bring awareness to wear a mask and maintain social distancing for the general public,” it said.Click here for complete coverage of Coronavirus pandemicProf R V Raja Kumar, Director, IIT Bhubaneswar, said the faculty and students groups of the Institute have worked tirelessly during the Covid-19 pandemic by coming up with technology development and research studies of high societal relevance.Congratulating the team for conducting such focused studies on present societal relevance, Prof Raja Kumar said the current study is a step in this direction. “As well known, the spread of Covid-19 infection is mainly through droplets ejected during coughing, sneezing, and talking. The present study shows how smaller droplets can leak through various protectives measures. The importance of social distancing is clearly evident from this study,” he added.These results will not only spread awareness but will motivate researchers to bring innovation to face mask design.I would like to reiterate that our researchers at IIT Bhubaneswar will continue to focus on Covid-19 related research and development to help mankind in the ongoing fight against the pandemic,” Prof Raja Kumar said.Prof Sujit Roy, Dean R & D, IIT Bhubaneswar says, “The finding by the IIT Bhubaneswar team is expected to create new awareness on Covid-19, which will further help in preventing its transmission via community spread.” Dr Mihir Kumar Pandit, Head of School of Mechanical Sciences, IIT Bhubaneswar says, “The present study has come out very nicely in visually highlighting the escape of droplets from various non-standard masks, which is widely used. Hence, the results will bring awareness to the common public.” Dr Arumuru said “Our flow visualisation study shows how smaller particles escape from the various face masks and how far they travel during sneezing. The importance of social distancing is visually evident from this study, which will educate the general public on the importance of the face mask and social distancing to prevent transmission of Covid-19.” He said “Our proposed simple experimental setup can be used to test new face mask designs. The sneeze is simulated at the exit of the nose of a standard mannequin, using air and tracer particles.” The peer-reviewed article has been selected as a “Featured Article” in Physics of Fluids Journal by the American Physical Society, the release added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-iit-b-study-confirms-social-distancing-norms-effectiveness-of-face-mask/story-TUevtG4GKNcLKTD8jukqLN.html

Around 7am, the traffic police posted the first tweet and said that the Singhu border was closed from both sides.“Singhu border is still closed from both sides. Please take alternate route. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba Chowk & GTK road. Traffic is very very heavy. Please avoid outer ring road from the signature bridge to Rohini &Vice versa, GTK road, NH 44 & Singhu border,” the traffic police tweeted.About the Tikri border, the police first issued an alert, saying that the border is closed for any traffic movement.

It also listed other borders points for commuters to Haryana such as Kharida, Dhaana, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera.As soon as the police posted the advisories, many began posting their queries about the traffic disruptions and sought suggestions regarding their planned journeys.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-singhu-tikri-border-points-remain-closed/story-z0mVa7gC9A8PjIyKjOBHxL.html
01-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest: All you need to know||Three laws were enacted in September to allow agri businesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions. They permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Here is why the laws have triggered protests, their repercussions and what the government is doing about them: --Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s Minimum Support Price system that offers cultivators assured prices from the government.--They say the laws will help corporate players and will eventually be detrimental to the farm sector, which supports nearly half the country’s population.

He was 64. He is survived by a son and two daughters. Narasimhaiah, who represented Nagarjunasagar assembly constituency in Telangana’s Nalgonda district, suffered from Covid-19 and was in hospital for over a month. Though he tested negative for the virus later, he was still suffering from breathing problems. At about 3 am on Tuesday, he complained of chest pain and was immediately shifted from his residence at Old MLA Quarters to Apollo Hospitals at Hyderguda. He breathed his last while undergoing treatment in the hospital at around 5.30 am, the family members said. Born in an agriculturists’ family at Palem village of Nakrekal mandal of Nalgonda district, Narasimhaiah had been associated with Communist Party of India (Marxist) since childhood because of the party’s influence in the area. While doing his under-graduation and masters in law at Osmania University, Narasimhaiah actively took part in the Student Federation of India (SFI) activities and later became a member of the CPI (M). He practised as an advocate in Nakrekal and Nalgonda. Later, Narasimhaiah entered active politics and was elected president of Nakrekal block parishad. He got elected as an MLA twice on CPI (M) ticket from Nakrekal assembly constituency in 1999 and 2004 and was the party floor leader in the assembly in the combined Andhra Pradesh state. Differing with his party, Narasimhaiah took active part in separate Telangana movement and in 2013, he came out of the CPI (M) to join the TRS. He lost to Congress candidate Kunduru Jana Reddy from Nagarjunasagar in 2014, but won the seat against the same leader in 2018 assembly election with a margin of over 7,771 votes. Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao expressed grief over the death of Narsimhaiah. He said the senior MLA would be remembered as leader who worked for the welfare of the people. Stating that Narasimhaiah’s s death was a big loss to the TRS as well as the people of Nagarjunasagar asembly Constituency, the chief minister conveyed his condolences to the members of the bereaved family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trs-lawmaker-nomula-narasimhaiah-dies-of-cardiac-arrest-after-post-covid-19-complications/story-uzByle8xJiTJ1tjUmS6CiK.html
01-12-2020||India||Four sites in India get World Heritage Irrigation Structure tag||Four sites in India have received the World Heritage Irrigation Structure (WHIS) tag this year. The sites are Cumbum Tank, Kurnool-Cuddapah Canal, Porumamilla Tank (Anantharaja Sagaram) in Andhra Pradesh and 490-year-old Dhamapur Lake in Maharashtra’s Sindhudurg district. In 2018, Pedda Cheru Tank in Kamareddy district and Sadarmat Anicut in Nirmal district, both in Telangana, were named as WHIS sites.The International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID), a global network of irrigation, drainage, and flood management experts, annually recognises irrigation structures of international significance on the lines of World Heritage Sites recognised by the UNESCO.Rishi Srivastava, director, Central Water Commission (CWC), said they were notified earlier this month about the declaration. “It is a prestigious moment for India as these structures are now of international significance. These structures, when they were built, were ahead of their times in terms of their technology. State governments will get more incentive and motivation to maintain them and ensure they are functional for years to come based on this recognition.”Also read | Goa leader calls international cultural community for help to save UNESCO Heritage SiteOther recognised sites this year globally included four structures in China, two from Iran, three in Japan.So far, Japan (42) has the highest number of WHIS sites followed by China (23). India, Iran and Sri Lanka have 6 each.Every country has a national committee and they share the information about their sites with ICID, which then passes it to an international jury. “Major criteria for WHIS entails that a structure should be more than 100 years old, should be functional, achieving food security and have archival value. Each site is evaluated based on its merits first by the state government. The proposal is then sent to the Centre and a team from CWC carries out an on-ground survey to verify details. Findings are presented before the national committee, which finally submits the proposal in the prescribed format (with Central government inputs and on-field photographs) to the international jury,” said Srivastava.The Dhamapur Lake irrigates 237 ha land every year. There are 64 streamlets that feed it. Two outlets emerging from Kavadewadi dam and Guramwadi dam also feed water to it. The site was built in 1530 by villagers of Dhamapur and Kalse.“Size of these lakes or dams is not a criteria for WHIS as Dhamapur is much smaller than other dams that have been awarded this recognition this year or in the past but what is most astonishing is this lake is almost 500 years old. It was and continues to be a technology marvel that stood through time,” said Srivastava.Sachin Desai, a local resident, said the Dhamapur Lake stands as an example of community participation in the past and present. “It displays the wisdom of our ancestors. The recognition saves the area from unplanned development and also creates history. This shows that learned citizens should come forward for documentation of heritage and natural assets of our country.”The CWC plans to nominate more sites this year. “For 2021, we have written letters to all state principal secretaries to identify and propose such ancient structures before the next meeting scheduled this time next year. Owing to Covid-19, the entire process was slightly delayed this year. However, we want at least 8-10 worthy proposals if not more by early 2021, so that we have time to evaluate them on the field,” said Srivastava.Nomination forms are to be submitted to ICID by June 30 every year.Srivastava said countries like Pakistan were earlier awarded WHIS for structures built well over a 100 years back. “While those structures might be located in present-day Pakistan, they were actually built in India. This is when we began the process and wrote to various states asking them to propose such structures showcasing our rich heritage,” he said.The Dhamapur Lake is one of the top 100 wetlands in India identified by the Union government for rapid restoration and improvement. It is expected to be proposed as a Ramsar site (wetland of international significance) by the Maharashtra government. There are 193 floral and 247 faunal species in this wetland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-sites-in-india-get-world-heritage-irrigation-structure-tag/story-n8P4HNaHuPdQQXT8VKQGyJ.html

The Covid-19 growth trajectory, which had taken a sudden turn in August and attained its peak in September, bent southward beginning October. Since then, the number of cases has been declining significantly. According to the latest data released by the health department, the monthly detection of cases in November declined to 7,390 from 18,110 detected in October. This accounts for a 59.19% dip. Covid-19 testing too declined to over 26.56% in November in comparison to the previous month. While 11,11,955 samples were tested in October, as many as 8,16,521 samples were tested in November.The disease’s positivity rate--the number of cases reported among the total samples tested--in these two months, however, indicated that the spread of the infection slowed down further in November. It dropped to 0.90% in November from 1.62% in October.According to health experts, the fewer detection of cases in November was due to a decline in testing.State epidemiologist Dr Praveen Karn said that overall testing in the state dropped in November due to festivals and some technical snags developed in one of the laboratories. “But, it will be improved further in coming weeks,” he said.Karn explained that the declining positivity rate was good news for Jharkhand“The state’s overall positivity rate at present is 2.43% meaning thereby that out of 100 samples tested, 2.43 positive cases are detected. However, if we see the monthly positivity rate of the last four months, we can notice a continuous decline. From 4.85% in August, it came down to below one percentage in November. Besides, Jharkhand reported a recovery rate as high as 97.26%,” he said.Earlier in August, the monthly detection of cases stood at 30,455. It went further up with the discovery of 41,882 cases in September.The state, however, heaved a sigh of relief only from the beginning of October when the daily detection of Covid-19 cases gradually declined. According to the health department’s bulletin of November 30, Jharkhand has so far reported 1,09,151 positive cases including 2016 active cases, 1,06,171 recoveries and 964 deaths. These cases were discovered after testing over 4.17 million samples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-logs-nearly-60-decline-in-detection-of-covid-19-cases-in-november/story-yFlAByvXlZ9Gm5kNWW36WJ.html

At least four camps would be set up in every village and civic body across all 344 blocks in the state between December 1 and January 28. At these camps, officials would help people with various government facilities, like MGNREGA job cards, health cards, caste certificates and ration cards. The Mamata Banerjee-administration has already directed the district administration to stress on the Bangla Sahayata Kendra, a chain of centres at the grass root level for free information about various government schemes. Also read | TMC MPs, MLAs ready to join us, say BJP leaders in Bengal“The state government has deployed more than 6,800 people across 3,400 such centres to provide information to the people about government projects and facilities and help them access those,” said a senior official. People can get information of around 240 public services from around 38 departments from these centres, free of cost. The Bharatiya Janata Party has criticised the state government over the Duare Sarkar scheme, asking it to clarify if it is a government programme or an outreach programme of the TMC ahead of the elections. The ruling TMC is likely to face a stiff challenge from the BJP which won 40% of the vote share in 2019 Lok Sabha elections and bagged 18 out of the 42 seats in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-bengal-assembly-polls-tmc-government-launches-its-biggest-outreach-drive-today/story-TUAg1sBQmOP4Oj95mK2UCL.html

He said he was there to listen to what the party functionaries had to say and convey that to Sonia Gandhi. People aware of the matter said the message was clear that Rahul Gandhi was only carrying out Sonia Gandhi’s orders and his return as Congress president after he resigned from the post last year was not to be taken for granted.Speculation about Rahul Gandhi’s return as the Congress chief has renewed since Sonia Gandhi left for Goa on the advice of her doctors for health reasons because of growing pollution in Delhi. The party is also committed to conducting elections for the post of the party president by January. The announcement was made after a Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting in August when 23 leaders wrote a letter asking for internal polls.Also read | Congress launches social media campaign to garner support for agitating farmersKC Venugopal, Mukul Wasnik, Ambika Soni, and Randeep Surjewala, who are part of the team set up to assist Sonia Gandhi, attended Monday’s meetings.

CWC member P Chidambaram, Dinesh Gundu Rao, and Manickam Tagore were among others who attended the meetings.A functionary, who attended the meetings, said they lasted for two hours and Rahul Gandhi emphasised how the Congress’s relationship with Tamils differed from that of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). “While the RSS is repressing the Tamil culture, the Congress believes in bridging it with the rest of the country,’’ the functionary quoted Rahul Gandhi as saying.The functionaries assessed Congress’s alliance with Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu and noted how 5-7% vote share can be contributed in the state. “He [Rahul Gandhi] told us to play a positive role and work hard in our seats,’’ said another leader. Rahul Gandhi warned of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s attempts to polarise voters ahead of next year’s assembly polls in Assam. In his meeting with the leaders from Assam, he asked the state unit to be prepared to face the ruling BJP head-on. “We were told that the BJP would try to muddy the scenario by polarising voters on communal lines and instructed to be prepared for it in the coming weeks leading to the polls,” said a third Congress leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-presides-over-meetings-to-discuss-assam-tamil-nadu-polls/story-RldaPn9CE47ajkM7XgdXBI.html

01-12-2020||India||India performed 140 million Covid-19 tests in past 11 months, says government data||India has conducted 140 million tests to detect Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the past 11 months, of which 10 million tests were performed during the past 10 days alone, government data shows.The first test to diagnose Covid-19 in the country was performed on January 23, and on Monday, India performed about 900,000 tests in a single day.On average, at least a million tests are conducted each day from across the country in 2,165 Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved laboratories for Covid-19 testing, with a capacity of testing at least 1.5 million samples daily.India started its Covid-19 testing facility with just one laboratory: ICMR- National Institute of Virology in Pune, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and now also performs TrueNat and CBNAAT tests that were used for tuberculosis testing originally, but have been repurposed and approved for Covid-19 testing in the country by ICMR.ICMR, country’s top biomedical research body, has been spearheading the Covid-19 testing initiative in the country, and has been able to significantly increase the testing laboratory network across the country in such a short span of time, to meet the country’s testing needs.Also read | Centre’s new Covid-19 guidelines come into effect today: Here’s what’s allowed, what isn’tAs a result, the testing numbers went up exponentially -- from 10,000 Covid-19 tests at the end of April, 5 million in June, 10 million in July, and 50 million in September, to 100 million in October and 140 million till November-end. The quicker Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) has also been deployed in a big way, especially at places that require mass testing that has helped in increasing India’s overall daily Covid-19 testing capacity.“At places where large scale testing is required with quick results, RAT is recommended. However, there are certain conditions that need to be met, like getting a confirmatory test done though RT-PCR in cases of symptomatic RAT negatives etc. Because of its ability to accurately detect true positives, it is an effective tool in quickly picking up early infections,” said an ICMR official, requesting anonymity. The Centre has asked states to conduct saturation testing to detect Covid-19 in places where people are likely to gather in large numbers, such as workplaces, religious places and markets etc. Saturation testing, where everyone is tested for the disease, will augment random testing being done to control the spread of the viral infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-performed-140-million-covid-19-tests-in-past-11-months-says-government-data/story-hjOLka4LP3lXQ7r4nMXlJN.html
01-12-2020||India||NMC member writes to chief, criticises nod to Ayurveda doctors to perform surgeries||National Medical Commission (NMC) member Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh has written to its chairman Dr Suresh Chandra Sharma, protesting against the permission to Ayurveda graduates to perform different surgical procedures. In his letter dated November 28, released to the media on Monday by the Bihar chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Dr Singh urged Dr Sharma to “consider the gravity of the matter and rectify the above decision”. “You being an ENT surgeon know it well that performing cataract surgery is not Ayurvedic graduates domain. Even other surgeries need proper training, expertise, infrastructure and a surgical setup. Most of them need anesthesia, which is delivered by qualified doctors. You know about the scarcity of anesthetists in India. Under the circumstances, permitting Ayurvedic graduates for surgery is detrimental to public health,” said Dr Singh in his letter. He called for a “proper consultation and consideration by all NMC members in an actual emergency meeting (not virtual)”. The IMA-Bihar, meanwhile, praised Singh for the bold step he had taken to decry the recent guidelines to allow Ayurvedic practitioners to perform certain surgeries. It is well known that none of the Ayurvedic medical colleges have facility to teach and train its graduates about surgery and they were not doing them in college. Under the circumstances, it will be harmful to the people if an “untrained and uneducated” Ayurvedic graduate performs various surgical procedures, IMA-Bihar secretary Dr Sunil Kumar said in a statement issued on Monday. “All the doctors are now optimistic that there will be a relook into this aspect and proper rectification in the above clause will be done at the earliest,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nmc-member-writes-to-chief-criticises-nod-to-ayurveda-doctors-to-perform-surgeries/story-Ugwhyh0Zcmw0YQg5CICxDJ.html
01-12-2020||India||From RTGS to PNB’s cash withdrawal, new rules that will come into effect from December 1||The commencement of a new month brings with it a set of new rules. The beginning of the month of December on Tuesday also brings with it some new rules which will directly impact the common man. From new Real-time Gross Settlement (RTGS) guidelines to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinder price revision, here are some new rules that will come into effect from December 1, 2020:1. RTGS to be available 24x7: RTGS is a popular online fund transfer system to transfer money from one bank account to another. Before December 1, the facility was available for use between 7am and 6pm on all working days except second and fourth Saturdays, and Sundays. However, in his monetary policy announcement in October, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das announced that starting December 1, the RTGS facility would be available round-the-clock on all days of the year.2. PNB’s OTP-based cash withdrawal: The Punjab National Bank (PNB) will launch its one-time password (OTP)-based ATM cash withdrawal facility on Tuesday. This facility can be used between 8pm and 8am for transactions above Rs 10,000. PNB account holders will thus need to carry their mobile phones as the OTP will be sent on their registered mobile phone number.3. LPG cylinder price revision: The prices of LPG cylinders are reviewed on the first of every month. These may be increased, decreased or kept constant. As of November 2020, the price of a 14.2 kg LPG cylinder stood at Rs 594 in Delhi and Mumbai, Rs 620.50 in Kolkata and Rs 610 in Chennai.4. More trains to commence operations: From December 1, Indian Railways will run some more trains. Train services were suspended in March when the first nationwide lockdown was announced in March to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, since then, several special trains have been pressed into service. From Tuesday, trains like 01077/1078 Pune-Jammu Tawi-Pune Jhelum Express and 02137/2138 Mumbai Ferozepur Punjab Mail special trains will be run everyday.5. Insurance policy to continue: If one has not been able to pay their instalments, their insurance policy will not get lapsed. Under new rules, which will come into effect from Tuesday, policy holders will be able to reduce premium by 50% and continue the policy with half the instalment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-rtgs-to-pnb-s-cash-withdrawal-new-rules-that-will-come-into-effect-from-december-1/story-W5mAx6FPOdLGbR8B38MZZN.html
01-12-2020||India||Centre’s new Covid-19 guidelines come into effect today: Here’s what’s allowed, what isn’t||As the number of cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continue to rise across the country, the Centre has issued a fresh set of guidelines which will come into force from today. These guidelines will remain in force till December 31.Though the spread of the infection has slowed down, the Union home ministry is still concerned about states where Covid-19 is still posing a challenge. It issued a set of protocols for states and union territories to check the spread of the disease.Additionally, the Union health ministry too has released a list of recommended measures to ensure compliance to Covid-appropriate behaviour in markets.Here is the list of Covid-19 guidelines released by home ministry which comes into effect from December 1:• The Centre has allowed states and union territories to impose local restrictions, such as night curfew, based on their assessment of the situation. However, they cannot impose any local lockdown outside the containment zones without prior consultation with the Centre.Also Watch l How long to control Covid-19 pandemic? Top doctors respond on #HTLS2020 • The home ministry also said that state governments can consider implementing staggered office timings and other suitable measures in cities where the weekly case positivity rate is more than 10 percent so that the number of employees attending offices at the same time can be reduced.• It said that local district, police and municipal authorities shall be responsible to ensure that the prescribed containment measures are strictly followed.• The Centre has also given freedom to the state governments to take administrative action against people not following the basic Covid safety measures. These actions include imposition of appropriate fines on persons not wearing face masks or following social distancing in public and work spaces.• The home ministry guidelines said that there shall be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods, including those for cross land-border trade under treaties with neighbouring countries. No separate permission/approval/e-permit will be required for such movements.• The latest set of rules emphasise on “surveillance, containment, and caution”. Hence, the home ministry order said that in containment zones, surveillance teams will conduct intensive house-to-house surveillance and quick isolation of Covid-19 patients shall be ensured in treatment facilities or home.• Covid-19 rules and containment measures prescribed by the health ministry strictly need to be followed in demarcated containment zones. There shall be strict perimeter control to ensure that there is no movement of people in or out of these zones, except for medical emergencies and for maintaining supply of essential goods and services, the home ministry guidelines said.The fresh guidelines come at a time when India’s Covid-19 tally has surpassed 9.4 million. Apart from the home ministry, the health ministry too has released its set of guidelines for behaviour in crowded places like markets. Here’s a look at those guidelines:• The standard operating procedures (SOPs) for markets issued by the health ministry on Monday stated that online booking of groceries and doorstep delivery of those must be encouraged while incentives or discounts for those who shop during non-peak hours may be considered.• The SOPs further outlined that market places in containment zones shall remain closed. Shop owners and employees living in containment zones shall not be allowed entry into marketplaces, it stated.• Covid-appropriate behaviour in marketplaces may be regulated by market associations through a number of measures, including creation of a sub-committee for each market to facilitate and monitor implementation of such behaviour in marketplaces, the ministry said.• It also suggested setting up mask dispensing kiosks at government-approved rates at entry points of markets and parking lots, establishing hand washing stations in public utility areas while recommending use of foot operated taps and contactless soap dispensers.• Mass thermal screening at the entry and access points to the market, thermal guns, sanitisers and placement of signages regarding Covid appropriate behaviour at prominent locations are the other measures mentioned by the health ministry in its guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-s-new-covid-19-guidelines-come-into-effect-today-here-s-what-s-allowed-what-isn-t/story-I44VbVzQSV268umGWKN4MI.html

The protesters had asked for a location in central Delhi.Though the sit-in, which entered in its sixth day on Tuesday, has been peaceful, it has affected traffic movement in both these areas. Long queues of vehicles choked the roads as the Delhi Police kept the Singhu and Tikri borders closed.Tractor-trolleys have occupied over a 10-km-long stretch along the Ambala-Delhi national highway.Many protesters have cushioned their trolleys with layers of straw and laid mattresses over them to protect them from the cold. Night temperatures over the last few days have been settling at around 9 degrees Celsius.Among the protesters are men and women aged over 70 years.Flags of various farmers’ outfits from Punjab and Haryana can be seen fluttering atop the tractors, some of which are fitted with loudspeakers and used by the leaders of peasants’ bodies to address the gatherings.Experts have warned that the agitation could turn into a Covid-19 superspreader event as there have been few signs of social distancing during the protests that started last week with the farmers, banded under various organisations, leaving their homes and moving towards Delhi.The farmers are protesting against the three laws - Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 - that took effect from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind’s assent.The farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre’s farm laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates.The government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. It has also invited farmer unions for talks on December 1, two days ahead of a scheduled meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singhu-and-tikri-borders-closed-for-traffic-due-to-farmers-protest-delhi-traffic-police-issue-advisory/story-WNfl9UPAD3cckCegWe2H2O.html

01-12-2020||India||November was coldest in 71 years, shows IMD data||November 2020 was Delhi’s coldest in 71 years, with global weather phenomenon such as La Nina and the absence of western disturbances, as well as local ones such as less rain in September and the absence of cloud cover, contributing to a mean minimum temperature of 10.2 degrees Celsius. Typically, mean minimum temperatures in November are around 12.9 degrees, according to the India Meteorological Department. It wasn’t just November, though — Delhi also experienced its coldest October in 58 years with the mean minimum temperature dipping to 17.2 degrees Celsius. To find a lower October mean temperature, one will have to travel back in time to 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius, according to IMD data.And it will likely get worse, with IMD’s seasonal forecast on Sunday predicting a colder winter (“below-normal minimum temperatures”) in New Delhi, and parts of north and north-west India. Monday was the coldest day in Delhi in November with the minimum temperature falling to 6.9 degrees Celsius. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC), attributed the colder November to “ a combination of factors including global conditions such as La Nina” and local ones such as “an absence of cloud cover ...; whenever there are clear skies, the minimum temperature drops.” He added that the minimum temperature will remain between 7 degrees and 8 degrees over the next few days, a degree or two degrees below normal — but that the maximum temperatures would be marginally higher than normal. La Nina is a climate phenomenon that sees cooler ocean temperatures in the Pacific — which has a strong correlation with wetter monsoons and colder winters in India. It also has a significant correlation with the number and strength of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. Cyclone Nivar crossed the Tamil Nadu coast last week, bringing widespread rain to the region and causing some damage. IMD has predicted that another cyclone is set to cross the Sri Lankan coast in early December, bringing more rain to Tamil Nadu. The Capital has also experienced four cold waves this month — on November 3, 20, 23 and 24. The last time Delhi saw multiple cold waves during November was in 1964 when three such occurred. Significantly, the last time Delhi saw a cold wave in November was back in 2014. The all-time low mean minimum temperature in November was recorded in 1930, at 8.9 degrees Celsius.DS Pai, climate head of climate research and services, IMD Pune, said that in addition to La Nina and other factors, the absence of western disturbances too resulted in a variation in temperature. He explained that these disturbances — storms originating in the Mediterranean — usually result in a rise in temperature. IMD director-general M Mohaptra said that while global factors like La Nina have previously made their effect felt, this is magnified when local and regional factors also contribute, resulting in extreme weather such as what Delhi has seen this November. He also pointed to the dry September the capital saw this year as another reason. “... means there was less moisture and the atmosphere was mostly dry resulting in clear sky conditions. Clear skies allow more radiative cooling, which means the heat dissipates fast making the night cooler, which leads to a dip in minimum temperature.” Meanwhile, lower minimum temperatures and a slight reduction in wind speed resulted in air quality deteriorating to the “very poor” zone on Monday. The average air quality index (AQI) was 318, up from Sunday’s 256. There’s bad news in store on that front too. “The winds will turn calm from December 4-5 and the air quality may deteriorate further, as both low temperature and absence of winds will not allow dispersion of pollutants,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/november-was-coldest-in-71-years-shows-imd-data/story-O5gohBY8vkTiylJWcOYoiM.html
01-12-2020||India||‘Love jihad’ law goes against freedom of choice: Lokur||A recently passed ordinance in Uttar Pradesh outlawing forced conversions by marriage, coercion or enticement is unfortunate because it puts freedom of choice, dignity and human rights on the back seat, former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur said. Delivering a public lecture on Sunday, Lokur said that laws punishing interfaith marriages violated jurisprudence developed by the Supreme Court protecting freedom of choice and human dignity. “Giving a back seat to freedom of choice, dignity and human rights, a stringent ordinance related to marriage and forcible conversion has recently been passed in Uttar Pradesh…Are we as a society prepared for this,” Lokur said. “What happens to the law declared by the Supreme Court in 2018 in the Hadiya case?” he asked, referring to the top court’s verdict recognising an adult woman’s choice to convert to Islam and marry a man of her choice.His comments came days after Uttar Pradesh promulgated the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance-2020 that outlawed religious conversions by marriage, coercion, deceit or enticement, and prescribed up to 10 years imprisonment for those found guilty. The law includes a provision to void a marriage if it is solemnised primarily to convert a woman’s faith. The burden of proof is on the person who converted, and those who performed the conversion. The former judge, delivering the Sunil Memorial Lecture, recalled that in 2018, a similar law was introduced by Uttarakhand legislature, called the Freedom of Religion Act, where marriages performed with the sole purpose of religious conversion were declared null and void. “The purpose of these laws is to prohibit what is commonly known as ‘love jihad’ which has no clear definition…The carefully drafted dignity jurisdiction assiduously developed over the years by the Supreme Court is slowly being given an undignified cremation of the Hathras kind and might reach a point of no return if so called anti-love jihad laws are passed or extended to other communities,” he said, referring to the forced cremation of a Dalit woman, a rape victim, by local authorities in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/love-jihad-law-goes-against-freedom-of-choice-lokur/story-Y07QJ3XfMYrCYxl272CmMO.html
01-12-2020||India||PM’s fresh appeal but farmers harden stand||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said farmers were being misled on three recently enacted laws aimed at liberalising the sector, and reached out to the agricultural community for the second time in two days, but protesters camping at Delhi’s borders seeking the repeal of the legislation insisted there was no turning back and stressed that their demands were “non-negotiable”.On a day the agitation by cultivators at two key entry points to Delhi entered its fourth day, and continued to impact traffic movement to and from Haryana, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar announced that the government invited leaders of the agitation for talks on Tuesday, advancing by two days a proposed meeting between central functionaries and the farm community. The previous round of talks on November 13 involved farm leaders, Tomar, and railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal. Before that, another meeting was held on October 14.“It was decided that next round of talks will be held on December 3, but farmers are agitating, it’s winter and there’s Covid-19. So, the meeting should be held earlier.Farm leaders — present in the first round of talks — have been invited at Vigyan Bhavan on December 1 at 3pm,” he told news agency ANI.His announcement came hours after Modi termed the contentious farm laws “historic”, and reiterated that his government at the Centre was committed to increasing farmers’ incomes. “The farmers are being deceived on these historic agriculture reform laws by the same people who have misled them for decades,” Modi said in his Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi, apparently referring to opposition parties. He, however, did not name anyone. “These same people have in the past played tricks with farmers in the name of MSP (minimum support prices), loan waiver and fertiliser subsidy,” Modi said, while strongly backing the new laws.At the border points near Delhi, farm leaders appeared to have hardened their stand, asserting they marched to the Capital for a “decisive battle” against the laws, which they say will adversely impact the MSP system that offers cultivators assured prices from the government, and help corporate players. “Our demands are non-negotiable... We have come here to fight a decisive battle,” Balbir Singh Rajewal of the Bharatiya Kisan Union said at a press conference at the Singhu border, which opens into Sonepat and is one of the two key points blocked by the farmers. He said the ruling party “will have to pay a heavy price” if it did not pay attention to farmers’ concerns. Another farmer leader, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, said the stir will continue until their demands were met.On the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti, demonstrators offered prayers and distributed “prasad” to each other and also to security personnel guarding the borders at Singhu and Tikri (it opens into Bahadurgarh).Thousands of protesters, especially from food bowl Punjab, have stayed put at the two border points since November 27. The police have denied them entry into the Capital and placed multi-layer barricades at the borders. Tractor-trolleys have turned into temporary shelters with farmers spending chilly nights under tarpaulin in their vehicles as temperatures plummet. Many have brought ration and other essentials to see themselves through this period.On Sunday, farm leaders spearheading the agitation set fresh terms for talks with the Union government, demanding the Centre name and authorise a Cabinet Committee or a Group of Ministers for future discussions. They also rejected Union home minister Shah’s offer to advance the date for the next round of talks and said the home ministry should not lead the discussions as agriculture was outside its jurisdiction.Shah and Tomar met earlier on Monday, the second such meeting in a span of 24 hours, to discuss their course of action. And at night, Tomar announced that a section of farm leaders were called for talks on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the Delhi Traffic Police advised commuters to take alternative routes to enter and exit Haryana, with the border points at Singhu and Tikri being blocked. Apart from traffic movement, the protest has already hit the supply of goods from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir, leaving fruits and vegetable traders in the city worried.The Delhi Police placed concrete barriers and bolstered security at the Ghazipur border with Uttar Pradesh as the number of protesters swelled there too. Barricades were also in place at the Noida border.A small group that reached the Nirankarai Samagam Ground in Burari on Saturday continued its demonstration there under the police’s watch. Farm leaders on Sunday said they will not move to the Burari protest site in north Delhi, as suggested by the Centre, and threatened to block all five entry points to the city after a meeting of over 30 groups.A large section of farmers has demanded the repeal of the three laws enacted by Parliament in September, which, together, allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power, weaken the government’s MSP system, and will eventually be detrimental to the farm sector, which supports nearly half the population.The government has sought to allay the concerns with PM Modi taking the lead.In his Varanasi address on Monday, Modi said farmers who wanted to follow the old system of trading – referring to the “mandis” where they can get the MSP – were still free to do so. The three laws gave farmers new options, he said. “Earlier, transactions outside the market were illegal. Now the small farmer can also take legal action on every deal that is out of the market,” Modi added. He said whenever new laws were enacted, questions were bound to be asked. “But presently a new trend is being seen in the country. The protests are based on creating doubts through misinformation.” A day ago, he said in his Mann Ki Baat radio address that the legislation added “new dimensions” to agriculture and related activities and broke decades-old “shackles”.Notwithstanding Modi’s attempts at reaching out to farmers, the opposition Congress party on Monday launched a social media campaign to muster support for the cultivators who are up in arms against the liberalisation move. “The Modi government has persecuted the farmer — first it brought black laws and then used lathis against them, but it forgot that when the farmer raises his voice, it resonates throughout the country. You also raise your voice against the exploitation of farmers and join the #SpeakUpForFarmers campaign,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.Ashok Maheshwari, a political scientist with Institute of Development Studies in Jaipur, said the government underestimated the farmers’ opposition to the laws from the very beginning. “...The government has said the laws bring freedom from middlemen, but the farmers see intermediaries as necessary service providers. So, the government does seem to have underestimated the role of very entrenched political-economy forces in the farm trade,” Maheshwari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-s-fresh-appeal-but-farmers-harden-stand/story-KVVnxuYdtKH0mUTYwLmvHJ.html
01-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||In the first 29 days of November, India recorded 1,248,778 (approximately 1.25 million) Covid-19 cases and 15,020 deaths. Both numbers are low enough to be comparable to those in July – when the country saw 1,109,138 (approximately 1.1 million) cases and 19,140 deaths. In fact, even the June deaths (12,081) are comparable to the November number, and they came on the back of far fewer cases (only 394,867). With the caveat that deaths in a particular month do not always correspond to cases that month – the norm, globally, has been to assume a two-week lag, but even this is an approximation because sometimes people succumb to the disease in days, and sometimes hang on for months – this is a good indication of how progressive case fatality rates have declined in India, much like they have in other parts of the world. India’s stated objective, articulated by the health ministry, is to reduce this number (a proportion of those who die from Covid to those infected) to below 1%. Since June, when it was 3.06%, the monthly case fatality rate has declined – to 1.73% in July, 1.45% in August, 1.26% in September, 1.25% in October (September and October were the months when India saw the peak of the first wave of the coronavirus disease), and 1.2% in November.With the trajectory of the pandemic remaining flat (for now), it is likely that December – at least the first half of the month – will see a further fall in the case fatality rate. The number of active cases, as on November 29, was under 450,000. The corresponding figure, at the end of October (on October 31) was around 570,000, and it was around 940,000 on September 30. In two months, India has halved the number of active cases, something that has also been reflected in the easing of some of the strain on hospitals – other than in Delhi, where a sudden surge in cases during the third wave (which the Capital seems to have put behind it) saw a shortage of critical care or intensive care unit (ICU) beds. As I’ve previously written, if India manages to go through this week without showing an appreciable increase in cases on account of the festivities and celebrations two weeks ago, it can expect the coronavirus disease trajectory to settle into a long plateau as the second wave begins.That means the central government as well as state governments can start considering the resumption of more activities and easing some of the restrictions that remain. It is important that governments prioritise what is important. India has prioritised agricultural and industrial activities, political activities (replete with large-scale public meetings and rallies), and recreational activities. It is time it looked seriously at education in terms of ensuring that admissions to colleges for the 2020 academic year are complete (they still aren’t in some states); resuming school education; and planning for admissions to colleges in the 2021 academic year. The 2020 academic year has already been disrupted significantly, and if the Centre and states do not act soon, 2021 could see some disruption too.Many states have started discussing a large-scale reopening of schools (currently, some states have reopened schools for high-school students). Some want to do this in January, others as early as December. This is understandable, but there is need for an overarching plan, and protocols on how schools and colleges (and the cities and districts where they are located) will deal with the localised outbreaks that will likely follow a reopening. Unfortunately, India does not seem to have a plan yet, and this is an area on which it comes off very poorly in a global comparison. In many other countries, schools were the last to shut during lockdowns, and the first to reopen – and even many of these countries have been criticised for prioritising industrial, economic, and recreational activities over education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-efT6P8i2gPxXo6IfNIHpxO.html
01-12-2020||India||Oppn rallies behind farmers, slams govt||The Congress has lodged a campaign called Speak Up for Farmers, that aims to mobilise workers in solidarity with those protesting on the streets. As part of the campaign, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi asked his party workers to ensure that they should help protesting farmers and provide them with food in their own areas. “Farmers are the strength of the country and yet why are they on the streets having walked so far? If these farm laws are in their favour, why is the farmer so angry? These laws are for 2-3 friends of Narendra Modi. These laws aim to rob farmers,’’ he said in a video message.Meanwhile, his colleague and Lok Sabha MP Adhir Chowdhary wrote to the Prime Minister proposing that farmers who have taken Kisan Credit Card loans should be allowed to renew on payment of interest and not of principal too. “These feudal mindsets of bankers which are putting stumbling blocks for securing the farmers’ financial assistance should be abdicated,’’ said Chowdhary in the letter.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), too, attacked the Centre’s handling of the crisis. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said, “Modi government has spoilt the Diwali of the farmers -- the farmers are scared for the prices that their produce will get... the farmer is braving cold water jets and police action. Meanwhile the Prime Minister is marking Dev Dipawali....’’The BJP’s Amit Malviya said the AAP government already implemented the farm laws in Delhi. “Now that the Khalistanis and Maoists have stepped in to oppose. It was never about farmers. Just politics,’’ he tweeted. AAP responded by saying: “The notification by Delhi government allows farmers to sell their crops anywhere... we have not dismantled mandis...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-rallies-behind-farmers-slams-govt/story-yHQNBOOdgn0sZjSsp84XhK.html
01-12-2020||India||New storm may hit south coast||A low pressure system over the Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify into a depression by Monday night and a cyclone by the next morning with winds gusting up to a speed of 80 km per hour, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Once it intensifies into a cyclone, it will be named Burevi. The cyclone comes on the heels of the severe cyclonic storm Nivar that made landfall in Karaikal, Puducherry on November 25. It was the third named cyclone to hit the Indian coast in 2020 -- the first was super cyclonic storm Amphan in May and severe cyclonic storm Nisarga in June. The storm is located 680 km southeast of Trincomalee in Sri Lanka and 1,090 km to the east of Kanyakumari. The IMD has forecast that the cyclone will continue to move northwestwards and cross the Sri Lankan coast in the evening or night of December 2. It is likely to continue its Westwards movement to reach the Indian coast the next morning. “Currently, we are focussing on the impact of the cyclone in Sri Lanka, we have not yet predicted where the cyclone will make landfall in India. However, the system will bring rain to some southern states and the seas will be rough. The fishermen have been advised to suspend fishing activities for now,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at National Weather Forecasting Centre, IMD. Squally winds will reach speeds of up to 65 km per hour on the Tamil Nadu and Kerala coasts on December 2 as the system nears India. According to the forecast, the system will bring heavy to very heavy rainfall to Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, south coastal Andhra Pradesh and Lakshadweep over the next two days. It is likely to bring extremely heavy rainfall to parts of south Tamil Nadu and south Kerala on December 3 when it is likely to reach the Indian coast. A Red alert has also been issued for four southern districts in Kerala as chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan urged people to be extremely vigilant.The sea conditions will be rough to very rough from Monday through December 4, with the government advising a complete suspension of fishing in the region. The fishermen have been advised to return to the shores by Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-storm-may-hit-south-coast/story-A0Vw8laMASqOjGlicImHoM.html

01-12-2020||India||After pitched campaigns, Hyderabad local body polls to be held today||Following a high- decibel campaign over the last 12 days, elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) was set to get underway on Tuesday.The polling for the fifth largest metropolitan city area in the country will begin at 7 am and close at 6 pm. As many as 7,467,256 voters will vote, with 1,122 candidates in the fray for 150 seats, each representing one division of the GHMC.Unlike the previous polls, the traditional ballot papers have replaced the electronic voting machines. “The counting of votes will take place on December 4 and the results would be declared by the same evening,” state election commissioner C Parthasarathy said on Monday. As part of Covid-19 measures, authorities have sanitised polling stations and made it mandatory for voters to use sanitiser before entering the booths. Authorities have also marked the area at the polling stations to ensure social distancing in queues.The local body polls have become a prestige battle for major political parties contesting the elections. The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is contesting in all the 150 divisions, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 149, Congress in 146, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 106 and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) in 51 divisions. In the 2015 elections, the first after the formation of Telangana, the TRS had won 99 out of the 150 seats, dislodging the Congress which won only two seats. AIMIM, which contested the elections in alliance with the TRS, had won 44 seats, while the BJP-TDP alliance won five seats.The BJP, buoyed by its recent victory in the by-elections to Dubbak assembly seat, is hoping to emerge as a major contender before the 2023 state assembly elections. The party brought in senior leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah, to campaign, prompting AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi to say, it seemed the “people are going to pick a new wazir-e-azam (Prime Minister).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-pitched-campaigns-hyderabad-local-body-polls-to-be-held-today/story-kguK2TN16xQfd0leQZdm8O.html
01-12-2020||India||Baba Amte’s kin dies by suicide||Social activist Sheetal Amte-Karajgi, 42, granddaughter of legendary social activist Baba Amte, died allegedly by suicide at her Anandwan residence in Chandrapur district, around 125km from Nagpur, on Monday. A medical doctor specialised in disabilities, Amte-Karajgi was the chief executive officer and board member of one of India’s leading non-profit groups, Maharogi Sewa Samiti, Warora. The samiti, founded by Baba Amte, has created livelihood opportunities for several marginalised people, especially for those afflicted with leprosy, orthopedically handicapped, vision and hearing-impaired individuals and primitive tribal populace since 1949. “We are in deep shock. There was a disagreement among trustees of Anandwan ashram. But we had come up with a solution, which was also agreed upon by Sheetal. Her taking the extreme step is unfortunate,” said Magsaysay award winner and Amte-Karajgi’s uncle, Dr Prakash Amte. Amte-Karajgi had recently raised some questions about the functioning of Anandwan ashram and levelled allegations about the certain “irregularities” in Maharogi Sewa Samiti, controlled mostly by her family members, particularly her father, Dr Vikas Amte, and Dr Prakash Amte. She had uploaded a video on Facebook last week talking about the “irregularities”, but removed it within two hours. A few days ago, the samiti’s trustees removed her from the board. According to people in the know, the members were opposed to Amte-Karajgi’s and her husband Gautam Karajgi’s ideas of “bringing in a corporate culture”. Last week, trustees of Maharogi Sewa Samiti — Dr Vikas Amte, Dr Prakash Amte (both sons of Baba Amte) and their wives — issued a clarification, saying all allegations levelled by Amte-Karajgi were baseless and misleading. They also claimed that Amte-Karajgi was “mentally stressed and frustrated”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baba-amte-s-kin-dies-by-suicide/story-c0QXjrObmQyZV1diNG48dM.html
01-12-2020||India||MPs want more checks on govt||Several MPs cutting across political lines want the government’s powers under the proposed data privacy law to be curtailed, recommending in a joint parliamentary committee that principles of necessity and proportionality – part of the draft released by an expert committee but dropped in the bill introduced in Parliament – be restored under sections in which the government can access personal data without a person’s consent.Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh, Manish Tewari and Gaurav Gogoi, Trinamool’s Derek O’Brien and Mahua Moitra, Biju Janata Dal’s Bhartruhari Mahtab and Amar Patnaik, Bahujan Samaj Party’s Ritesh Pandey, and Shiv Sena’s Shrikant Shinde, are in favour of limiting the government’s access to personal data. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Rajeev Chandrasekhar, on the contrary, wanted new grounds to be added for the government to process such personal data. The concerns relate to clause 35 of the bill, which allows the central government, where it “is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient” to access people’s data over reasons such as safeguarding national security. This section drew a large number of amendments, HT has learnt. A total of 228 amendments, mostly by Opposition members, have been submitted to the joint panel reviewing the bill. These include renaming the bill as Protection of Privacy of Personal Data Bill, a timeline for enacting the law, and keeping anonymised personal data out of the purview of the bill. Some of the key concerns raised by the members relate to Clause 35 of the bill, which lays down the ground for powers to the government to access people’s data over reasons such as safeguarding national security. This section drew a large number of amendments, HT has learnt. According to this clause, no other part of the law – which deals with how personal data should be handled, the rights of the individual over this data and the punishment for violators -- shall apply, and the Centre can process personal data “in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order” and other related reasons. Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi proposed that amendments be such that the Centre can process personal data “...where (it) is satisfied that it is necessary for, and proportionate to, achieving, the security of the State, it may, by order, for reasons to be recorded in writing.” Ramesh, too, said the government’s processing of personal data shall be “proportionate and least intrusive”. He also said “the public interest in granting the exemption outweighs, to a substantial degree, any interference with the right to privacy of data principals that could result from such exempted processing, PROVIDED THAT no processing can be exempted from Section 4 and 5 of Chapter II and Section 24 of Chapter VII of this Act.” The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 will underpin India’s first legal framework to protect privacy after it was held as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court in 2017. But there have been differences over clauses such as those that exempt government agencies and mandates companies to share anonymised data with authorities. The bill was sent to a JPC over these differences. The bill is based on a draft prepared by an expert committee headed by retired justice BN Srikrishna.In the amendments recommended by BJD’s Amar Patnaik, the exemption should be allowed in cases “where the Central Government is satisfied that it is necessary, proportionate and legitimate”. O’Brien and Moitra proposed that processing in the interests of the security of the State “shall not be permitted unless it is authorised pursuant to a law, and is in accordance with the procedure established by such law, made by Parliament and is necessary for, and proportionate to, such interests being achieved” be substituted.” Congress’s Tewari said there should be no such exemption for the government “till the time it is judicially determined by the Appellate Tribunal” and any person shall have the right to access the Tribunal. “The said exemption must be vide a reasoned order and duly notified so as to ensure that the remedy available under Clause 75 can be exercised by the concerned,” Tewari’s amendment said. BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab demanded that ‘public order’ as a ground for government’s access should be omitted. BSP’s Ritesh Pandey says it must be a “clearly defined purpose, which is just, fair, and reasonable.” Mahtab also recommended that the word “irreversible” be added to sections that allow anonymised data to be accessed by the government. Shortly after the bill was introduced, experts said the law gives the government a wide berth on surveillance. “The new draft appears to remove the ‘fair and reasonable processing’ obligation in the Srikrishna Committee draft that applied when personal data is accessed for purposes such as national security and to comply with court orders. In the new version, the government can process personal data on the grounds of national security (Section 35), or for purposes relating to crimes or court orders (Section 36), and the only obligation that would apply would be that it needs to have a specific, clear and lawful purpose,” Rahul Matthan, a partner-lawyer in technology and media practice at the law firm Trilegal, told HT at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mps-want-more-checks-on-govt/story-QEJ8kKjkAekKv6DIUeTa9J.html
01-12-2020||India||India condemns terrorism in all manifestations: Naidu||India on Monday launched a thinly veiled attack on Pakistan for using terror as an instrument of state policy during a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) council of heads of government, calling for collective efforts to combat the menace. Vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu, who chaired the virtual meeting, indirectly criticised Pakistan for attempting to use SCO to raise bilateral matters and said this went against the grouping’s charter, which safeguards the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member-states. In his opening remarks, Naidu pointed to the importance of efforts to boost economic recovery amid the Covid-19 pandemic and took a tacit swipe at China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), saying trust alone determines sustainability of global trade and countries must demonstrate their compliance with the rules of multilateral trade.  The council is SCO’s second-highest body and is responsible for handling the economic agenda and approving its annual budget. This was the first time India hosted a meeting of the body since it was admitted into the grouping in 2017. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan didn’t join the virtual meeting. Pakistan’s participation was at the lowest level – it was represented by parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs Andleeb Abbas – and Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan were represented by their prime ministers. Naidu said trade can flourish only in an environment of peace and security, and the most important challenge faced by countries in the region is cross-border terrorism. He described terrorism as “the enemy of humanity” that needs to be combated collectively. “India condemns terrorism in all its manifestations. We remain concerned about threats emerging from ungoverned spaces and are particularly concerned about states that leverage terrorism as an instrument of state policy,” he said, without naming Pakistan. Naidu said SCO is key to cooperation based on universally recognised norms, rule of law, openness, and it is “unfortunate ...that there have been attempts to deliberately bring bilateral issues into SCO and blatantly violate the well-established principles...safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of SCO member states”. Secretary (West) Vikas Swarup of the external affairs ministry told a news briefing after the meeting that it is up to Pakistan to join initiatives proposed by India, but the SCO charter includes a provision that one country cannot hold up cooperation, and also allows other members to take cooperation forward “with the exclusion of the country which is opposing it”. “If SCO member-countries have the will, I’m sure we can all find common ground and that is why the SCO charter specifically prohibits bilateral issues from being raised in SCO forums,” he added. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said, “When India joined as an observer in 2005, there was optimism about India-China ties, Today, we are de-coupling with China. Pakistan and China have an unholy alliance that will thwart Indian initiatives,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-condemns-terrorism-in-all-manifestations-naidu/story-sWDogEt6fJcp1vHKqRg7LK.html

01-12-2020||India||India giving befitting reply to expansionist forces: PM Modi||India has given a befitting response to expansionist forces, infiltrators and those trying to break the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday in Varanasi where he attended Dev Deepawali celebrations and inaugurated infrastructure projects.For the PM’s visit, 84 ghats on both sides of the Ganga were lit with 1.1 million earthen lamps and ornamental lights to mark the beginning of celebrations for Kartik Purnima. Modi, who is also the local MP, delivered two speeches through the day, took a boat ride, lit an earthen lamp and ended the day by watching a laser show. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath accompanied him. “Be it attempts of infiltration from across border, the audacity of expansionist forces or conspiracies for attempting to break the nation, India is giving a befitting reply to all,” the PM said at Raj Ghat. Paying tribute to martyrs, he added, “I bow to the soldiers who sacrificed their lives.”He said that the country lit the lamps of transformation to end the “darkness of poverty, injustice and discrimination” and hailed the return of an old sacred idol from Canada to India. “Today is another special occasion for Kashi. The idol of Mata Annapurna that was stolen from Kashi more than 100 years ago is now coming back....For us, heritage means the country’s heritage, while for some people, inheritance means their family, their family name, idols and photos of their family,” he said.Modi hailed Guru Nanak and said the founder of Sikhism was the biggest symbol of reform. “We have seen when changes begin in the interest of the nation and society, voices of unintentional opposition arise. But when the significance of those reforms comes to the fore, everything goes well. This is the lesson we get from the life of Guru Nanak Devji,” he said. Earlier in the day, while inaugurating a six-lane section of National Highway 19, PM said UP could now be referred to as Express Pradesh because the pace of infrastructure projects had picked up since Yogi Aditynath became the CM in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-giving-befitting-reply-to-expansionist-forces-pm-modi/story-mvZUIM1ZSnLO1OJhYt6FRO.html
01-12-2020||India||Paper argues against censorship||A policy paper authored by Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) chief Shekhar Kapur and censor board member Vani Tripathi Tikoo has argued against censorship of content on over-the-top (OTT) platforms, and instead advocated industry-led benchmarks to preserve creative freedom.The paper, published by Delhi-based think tank Esya Centre, comes roughly three weeks after the Centre brought news and entertainment websites, including platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, under the purview of the Union Information & Broadcasting ministry. The move was seen as paving the way for regulation of online content and bring it on par with print and electronic media that are regulated by established bodies under law.“We need to promote creative freedom, which can be done through industry-led standards, as is the practice in countries around the world. This will require active and continued engagement by the industry, as well as recognition and support from the state,” read the 30-page report, also authored by lawyer Akshat Agarwal and public policy expert Vivan Sharan. Currently, there is no direct body or mechanism for online content regulation. The authors clarified that their paper had nothing to do with the government but aimed to provide an understanding of the OTT space.Kapur, an internationally acclaimed director, took over as the FTII chief in September. Tikoo, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is a board member of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). “You can’t put the lens of film certification on OTT platforms,’’ said Tikoo, who felt that the traditional role of a censor board was over. “Understanding of the space is important for everyone. If we don’t step up, technology will take over,” she added. The report titled “Embracing Non-Linearity: The Future of India’s Entertainment Industry” also recommended that Indian content makers focus on “telling our own stories’’ and highlight Indian values. “Its [India’s] cultural heritage is ancient and diverse, and remains underrepresented on the world stage. It is also well suited to the non-linear entertainment of future, as it contains many traditions of oral storytelling that yield multiple threads from a common recognisable narrative,” the report said. In a section titled Creative Freedom, the authors emphasise on the content creators’ freedom to tell stories in whatever manner they wish, resulting in an ecosystem with great diversity of content. “In the context of OTT, the industry should be encouraged to come together and standardize, to ensure consumers have all the information and technological controls they need, for making informed decisions about the content they consume,” the report said. At present, the Press Council of India looks after print media, television news channels come under purview of News Broadcasters Association. The Advertising Standards Council of India regulates advertisements and CBFC certifies films. The Supreme Court last month sought the Centre’s response on a PIL for regulating OTT platforms by an autonomous body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paper-argues-against-censorship/story-Uw4Tz16cC9scZKfKR5W0WP.html

01-12-2020||India||Govt to hold talks with farmers today as protests intensify||The Union government has invited farmers’ representatives for the next round of discussions on Tuesday (December 1), as farmers protesting a set of laws enacted recently to liberalise the farm sector intensified their agitation. The next round of talks was originally scheduled for December 3. The decision to advance the talks came after home minister Amit Shah and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar met twice in a span of 24 hours on Monday to discuss course of action. Thousands of farmers, who are marching from various states toward the national capital to protest against new farm legislation they say will hurt their interests, appeared to harden their stand. They threatened to block all entry points to New Delhi, demanding a repeal of three farm laws. “On November 13, during our last meeting, we decided to conduct next round of talks on December 3. However, farmers have continued their protests and with the Covid situation and the cold wave, we decided that we needed to talk before December 3,” agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar told reporters after sending the invitation late on Monday evening. The discussions will be held at the capital’s Vigyan Bhawan at 3 pm. The agriculture ministry has prepared a fresh set of presentations and videos on the farm reforms, an official said. The government is expected to have a few economists from the Niti Aayog to join the discussions. “We have not closed our doors for discussions. The talks should be without any condition, sincere and inclusive. We are not interested in going left or right, we are saying ‘repeal these laws’. At least, the government should make clear that it will rethink the laws,” said Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, one of the leaders spearheading the farmers’ agitation. On Sunday, farm leaders had rejected an offer from home minister Amit Shah to advance the date of talks scheduled for December 3, saying they would not accept the government’s condition that farmers first move to their allotted protest site in Burari on the capital’s outskirts. Monday was the fifth day of farmers protesting a set of laws, approved by Parliament in September, to allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farm leaders say the new changes will leave them at the mercy of private buyers and vulnerable to exploitation. On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking in Varanasi, slammed Opposition parties for misleading farmers and defended his farm laws as “historic”. He said the opposition has created unfounded fears in the minds of the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-hold-talks-with-farmers-on-december-1-as-protests-intensify/story-caNKEKvCJIfmPXrBkChBoI.html
01-12-2020||India||My soul still inside Bihar govt, says former Deputy CM Sushil Modi||Bihar’s former deputy chief minister and BJP nominee for the Rajya Sabha, who will file his nomination papers on December 2 has said that his soul dwells inside the Bihar government despite not being a part of it. Modi, who was replaced by Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi as two deputy chief ministers of state, opened up for the first time since his removal from the post and said, “Our party BJP is like one-way traffic, you can come here but can’t go from here. Those who leave BJP never live in peace. Though I’m not part of the Bihar government, my soul dwells inside the current government. We shouldn’t let our party become weak ever,” the BJP leader said while speaking at an event held late Sunday evening. Modi went on to say that the NDA government in Bihar will last full term. “Those challenging that the government won’t last five years, I challenge them that nobody can topple this government and there is no possibility of a mid-term poll either,” he said. “I will not take any step that will weaken the party,” he added. Modi, who was instrumental in formation of NDA government in Bihar in 2005, had earlier served as deputy chief minister in the Janata Dal (United)-BJP government till the assembly polls. However, BJP has decided to field Modi for the Rajya Sabha bypoll in the state. The seat fell vacant following the death of Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan in October. The bypoll is scheduled for December 14 and counting of votes will be done on the same day. The last date to file nominations is December 3. The JD (U), in the meantime, extended its full support to Modi for his candidature for Rajya Sabha. “Our good wishes are with him. Even if opposition fields a candidate, he will be elected. Wherever he will be, he will excel,” said JD (U) state president Bashistha Narain Singh, who went on to laud one of the trusted friends of the JD (U). “He has done wonderful work as deputy CM and has a very good knowledge of financial aspects,” he added. Sushil Modi is likely to win the Lok Sabha election uncontested since the Opposition has not yet fielded its candidate. If the Opposition fields its own candidate, the elections will be held on December 14. The opposition Grand Alliance is still to decide on the candidate but a section of its leaders indicated that it was not willing to give a walkover to the NDA. In a statement, the RJD’s spokesman Shakti Yadav had said “Had the late Ram Vilas Paswan’s party been allowed to contest, we would have considered supporting their candidate even though his party is not our alliance partner”. Meanwhile, sources in the Grand Alliance said the feelers have been sent to Lok Janshakti Party chief Chirag Paswan that he consider fielding his mother Reena Paswan from the seat and assured him of its “full support”. On Saturday, Chirag had said that it was for the BJP to decide a candidate for the Bihar Rajya Sabha elections 2020. “The seat belonged to the BJP and it is for the party to decide which candidate from which party to field in the bye-election,” the 37-year-old leader told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/my-soul-still-inside-bihar-govt-says-former-deputy-cm-sushil-modi/story-IAnVxG9lltzILfJEbR3lyM.html

01-12-2020||Editorials||The perils of UP’s approach | HT Editorial||The Uttar Pradesh (UP) Police has lodged the first case under the just-promulgated UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance against a person in Bareilly — a Muslim man, accused of seeking to coerce and convert a Hindu woman in order to marry her. News reports present a complicated picture, with the woman’s father alleging the accused had threatened the family for opposing conversion; the woman’s brother claiming that the entire episode took place a year ago, the matter had been settled, his sister was now married to someone else, and the police took the initiative of lodging the case; others suggesting that the relationship was consensual; and the family of the accused arguing that this was a false case. If the multiple versions of this story present a somewhat complex picture, it is because the truth about relationships between young people in a patriarchal set-up in general, and about interfaith relationships in a set-up where religious prejudices are deep in particular, has many layers. Young people, even when they are in consensual relationships, often keep it under wraps for fear of parental recrimination; families try to end such relationships, when it goes against their beliefs and they fear social sanction. In the backdrop of a political climate where a certain type of relationship — between Muslim men and Hindu women — is stigmatised and now made legally difficult, the ability to exercise autonomy and be truthful about it is even more difficult.As this newspaper has consistently argued, the UP legislation as well as the proposed legislations in other states — based on the flawed theory of “love jihad” — stems from patriarchy and bigotry. Unless there is criminality and conversion due to inducement, coercion, allurement or fraud — which is covered by other laws — matters of the heart are best left to individuals. Instead, what has happened is first, an attempt to politically deepen the distrust about interfaith relationships, and second, an attempt to address this through laws. Irrespective of the truth of the case in Bareilly, the state is making a mistake. It should avoid interfering in the personal realm, and its current social outlook could increase the possibility of the law being implemented in a discriminatory manner. UP should review the law which could deepen existing fractures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-perils-of-up-s-approach-ht-editorial/story-kASKJTzqMgBpBm5b9VCsaL.html
