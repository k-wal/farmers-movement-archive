But it would be a mistake to see him as only a genre writer of spy thrillers. Through the grey world of espionage, Le Carré wrote about the human condition. In his own words: “Out of the secret world I once knew, I tried to make a theatre for the larger worlds we inhabit.”Le Carré was working in MI6, the British foreign intelligence service, when he began writing fiction under an assumed name. His third book, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, became the breakthrough novel propelling him to worldwide attention. I read the book while at college. It was a revelation and opened new insights into the shadowy world of espionage in the Cold War period. Unlike the glamourised life of spies pictured in Ian Fleming’s novels and James Bond films, Le Carré dealt with the real world where agents and double agents operate. In his work, vanity and petty ambition, love and betrayal, deception and intrigue, moral confusion and other foibles of human nature, unfold.Though opposed to Communism, his novels about spying during the Cold War, showed the moral ambiguities and darker aspects of both sides.His trilogy of novels — Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley’s People — is a classic. The central character is George Smiley who is searching for a “mole” within the Circus (Overseas Intelligence Agency). Smiley is quiet, unassuming, portly and brilliant but an unlikely hero. He is one of the most remarkable characters in British fiction in the post-war period. One can read the Tinker Tailor trilogy again and again to understand some of the great issues and moral questions which were pervasive in those times. Apart from Smiley, there are other unforgettable characters. Connie Sachs, the arthritic, wheelchair bound brilliant researcher with a long memory at the archives of Circus; Toby Esterhase, the debonair head of the surveillance team; and, of course, Karla, the enigmatic head of a KGB counter-intelligence department. As Smiley tells Karla when they meet, “We are not so different you and I”.With the end of the Soviet Union and the Cold War, many wondered what Le Carré would write about. The oeuvre for his writing seemed extinguished. But Le Carré surprised us all. A series of books emerged which took up the injustices of our times. Le Carré had a clear eyed view of the wrongs perpetrated by predatory capitalism. The Constant Gardener was a brilliant and searing indictment of Big Pharma and its unethical practices and exploitation. An earlier book, The Little Drummer Girl, was a complex novel, that showed deep empathy for the plight of the Palestinian people. Absolute Friends is a ferocious attack on the war on Iraq. Le Carré’s opposition to the war on Iraq and his disillusionment with Tony Blair and New Labour are evident in these books. A Most Wanted Man is an indictment of the war on terror, extraordinary rendition and the use of torture. A Delicate Truth unravels the nexus of government and shadowy arms dealers in an increasingly privatised defence sector.These books of the post-Cold War period caused unease among some of his admirers. They and some critics felt he had taken a turn to the Left and was putting things in stark black and white terms. But this is precisely why I admire his later books, for their forthright positions against the exploitation of Africa by multinational companies, the sharp practices of the moneyed cliques, drug-running, imperialist wars, and Islamophobia.We should rejoice that David Cornwell, a mid-level intelligence officer, decided in 1961 to become a writer and transformed into John Le Carré. He will be remembered as one of the finest novelists of post-war Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/le-carre-captured-the-human-condition-in-the-cold-war-and-beyond/story-fwLs3H1nCYGUxZ7bDSObPL.html
17-12-2020||News||A four-point action plan to improve Delhi’s air||The deteriorating air quality in Delhi has led the Centre to set up the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas. Every year, as the air quality reaches dangerous proportions, emergency measures are taken to ease the situation. However, in the absence of a long-term strategy, the problem recurs every winter. The new commission, it is hoped, will initiate a comprehensive, multi-sectoral action strategy. The causes of poor air in the National Capital Region (NCR) range from stubble-burning in neighbouring states to construction dust, industrial pollution, localised bonfires to meet the heating needs of the poor and emissions from motor vehicles. Transport remains a consistent and significant contributor to pollution across all seasons and time frames. Several source apportionment studies carried out variously by the Central Pollution Control Board, IIT, Kanpur and TERI have shown that on-road vehicular exhaust emissions account for nine per cent to 38% of particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere. Reducing vehicular emissions alone could positively impact the air quality of NCR. Short-term interventions like the odd-even scheme have yielded temporary relief. Some significant initiatives to convert the state’s bus and para-transit fleet to run on Compress Natural Gas (CNG) have also resulted some results, despite the substantial cost. A sustainable plan to reduce emissions from the transport sector requires a comprehensive and multi-year effort. A four-pronged approach could help. One is deployment of clean technologies; electric mobility is a rapidly-growing choice, globally. India is focused on this sector, having formulated a National Electric Mobility Mission Plan and has instituted programmes that offer financial incentives for electric buses and other vehicles. However, effective deployment requires a comprehensive and actionable road map involving all stakeholders which has not been put in place. A phased road map stretching over 10-15 years needs to be prepared to raise the stakeholders’ confidence. This road map must cover supply- and demand-side interventions – mandating purchase of Electric Vehicles (EVs), establishing charging and swapping stations, awareness campaigns, setting standards and incentives to vehicle and component manufacturers. It should establish the way forward for registering Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs), increasing its share on roads by 50% or more (of all vehicles) and mandating that all buses, locally- operated freight vehicles, auto rickshaws and taxis in NCR become ZEVs by 2035. Hydrogen Fuel Cell vehicles (HFCs), though not yet commercialised, are said to be a fitting complement to EVs, especially to cover long distances of freight and passenger commute. A second is adopting shared and non-motorised transport. The key to effecting a modal shift is to persuade people to move from personal motor vehicles to either shared modes, like buses, metro rail and shared taxis or to non-motorised modes, like cycling and walking. Unfortunately, the quality of India’s public transport systems – especially our city buses – have discouraged private vehicle commuters from making a shift. To date, our city bus systems are primarily designed for affordability, not quality. Affluent commuters seek high-quality options, featuring door-to-door travel, greater comfort, less crowding, and tracking and smart ticketing choices. They are willing to pay higher fares for such services. To earn their buy-in, public transport should incorporate a variety of premium services that ensure quality even if it means steeper ticket prices. A strong push for premium, vastly improved last-mile connectivity options, to and from the Delhi metro would ensure ridership. Meanwhile, Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is an emerging concept in some European cities that allows transportation services to be available on demand and as per need, through a mobile app. Identical to the app-based taxi services in India, MaaS cuts across modes of transport to offer multi-modal trip options based on willingness to pay, time availability and other parameters. In India, MaaS can revolutionise daily commutes and offer the much-needed solution for a modal shift. To promote non-motorised modes, NCR must invest in well-planned and safer infrastructure for cycling and walking. Developing bicycling and pedestrian masterplans and implementing them effectively could be key. For shorter commutes, these can be important modes of travel. A third is improving traffic flow. If traffic congestion is reduced and vehicles move seamlessly, then vehicular pollution will diminish. This is because moving vehicles will disperse the emissions effectively, ensuring they don’t get locked up in one location. Staggering peak time travel could be a solution to distribute the movement of traffic over a longer period of the day. Offices and commercial establishments can adopt staggered and flexible timings for employees. A fourth is reducing travel demand. Improving online delivery of public services can help reduce the average number of trips people make. Policies and supporting infrastructure that allow citizens to work from home and shop online will help this effort. Likewise, mixed land-use planning could reduce trip lengths. Newly-developing areas should co-locate offices, commercial and residential addresses to minimise long commutes. These actions to reduce vehicular pollution could begin the process of improving NCR’s air quality. However, the need of the hour is a focused, comprehensive, systematic and multi-year effort across sectors. Today, Delhi looks up to the commission to develop a scientific plan with a long-term vision, be adequately resourced and empowered to implement it. This holds out a glimmer of hope that people can breathe easy in future winter seasons. Dr. OP Agarwal is CEO, WRI India.

17-12-2020||Mumbai||Will declare you fugitives if you fail to appear: Court to Iqbal Mirchi’s family||The special court under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act (FEOA), 2018, asked Junaid and Asif Memon, sons of late gangster Iqbal Mirchi, as well as his widow Hajra, to appear before the court by February 16, failing which it would declare the three as fugitive economic offenders. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had on December 4 approached the special court to declare the three as fugitive economic offenders as they had failed to respond to warrants issued against them and have not returned to India despite repetitive summons and warrants. The court accepted the agency’s argument. The agency had initiated a money laundering investigation against Mirchi and his family on September 26, 2019. While probing the matter, ED had provisionally attached assets worth around ₹798 crore linked to the family in India and abroad under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002. The central agency officers had also arrested five accused including Dewan Housing Finance Corporation’s (DHFL) Kapil Wadhawan, Dheeraj Wadhawan and Humayun Merchant in the case. ED’s probe has revealed that DHFL had allegedly extended loans to a firm, Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd, which purportedly routed money to Mirchi. An aide of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim, Mirchi had died in the United Kingdom (UK) in August 2013. DHFL came under ED’s scanner when the agency was examining properties linked to Mirchi in Worli. The three properties have already been attached by ED under PMLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-declare-you-fugitives-if-you-fail-to-appear-court-to-iqbal-mirchi-s-family/story-Cszgrm8AjjlUtM1X6ztTlJ.html

17-12-2020||Chandigarh||50 swachhata monitors to safeguard Ludhiana’s Buddha Nullah||In a bid to discourage residents from polluting the Buddha Nullah — a seasonal stream that drains into the Sutlej — the civic body has decided to deploy a dedicated team of 50 swachhata monitors who will fine violators and ensure residents’ compliance. A trial for the same will be conducted on Friday and teams will be permanently deputed on the site from Monday. The teams cover the entire stretch, spanning 14-km, within the city. The staff will work in two shifts from 6 am to 6pm. The police will mediate any disagreements between staff and residents. Stopping residents from dumping waste into the nullah has proved to be a Sisyphean task for the municipal corporation so far. The monitoring committee of the National Green Tribunal had also directed the MC to rectify the problem. Clumps of waste can be seen accumulated at different points in the sullied rivulet, whose stench is unbearable. The civic body has also started surveying industrial units situated on the banks of the nullah, to keep a check on dumping of industrial waste, especially hosiery waste, into the rivulet. Efforts are being made to ensure door-to-door lifting of garbage from houses situated in the vicinity of the stream. Officials, on condition of anonymity, said the MC will also start a project to install iron fencing alongside the stream under the smart city mission. MC health branch nodal officer Ashwani Sahota said the MC had also involved traffic marshals for conducting awareness drives. The marshals have also been organising awareness drives in areas alongside the rivulet for the last few days. Violators may be fined upto ₹5,000 MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “The state government is already working on a ₹650 crore project to clean Buddha Nullah but the civic body has decided to stop residents from dumping waste in the nullah first. MC employees will be deputed along the banks of the nullah and challans of upto ₹5,000 will be imposed on violators as per the solid waste bylaws notified by the local bodies’ department.”Swachh Bharat Mission state project director Puran Singh, who has been in the city for the last two days, has been chalking plans to stop the residents from dumping waste in the nullah. Singh also visited schools and colleges to involve students and National Cadet Corps (NCC) cadets in the awareness drives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/50-swachhata-monitors-to-safeguard-ludhiana-s-buddha-nullah/story-YQa6xx6g1JDdAUKvCQNw4O.html
17-12-2020||Chandigarh||Third sero-survey to begin next week in Ludhiana||With both the cold wave and Covid cases intensifying in the state, the health department will conduct the third sero-survey to assess public exposure to the deadly virus next week. Teams from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will visit Ludhiana to collect samples, which will be checked for presence of Covid antibodies. A flurry of activity was witnessed in the health department on Thursday as officials compiled a list of existing and new Covid hotspots in the city and rural areas of the district ahead of the survey.Confirming the same, state epidemiologist Rajesh Bhasker said, “In the last two surveys, the ICMR team had carried out sampling in 12 districts, including Amritsar, Ludhiana, Patiala, SAS Nagar, Jalandhar, Ferozepur, Moga, Faridkot, Sangrur and Bathinda. Ludhiana with 54.6% total positivity and 71.7% urban positivity was found to be the worst hit, followed by Ferozepur, Jalandhar and Mohali.” The health department had also predicted that the district would be hit by a second wave of infections in the second week of December. However, no surge has been witnessed so far. Health and family welfare special secretary Amit Kumar said, “Delhi and parts of Haryana have been hit by consecutive wave of Covid, but we have managed to flatten the curve in Punjab. We have increased contact tracing and sampling. Each day we collect 32,000 samples to check the spread of infection,” said Kumar.On the other hand, civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said the urban population was heading toward attaining herd immunity. “If over 60% of the population was found to have antibodies, it will be an indication of the public developing herd immunity.”As per the government data, urban areas showed a positivity rate of 30.5%, while rural areas reported 21.0% positivity.Each district was assigned the task of collecting a sample size of 400 — 200 each from rural and urban areas.The samples were collected from Jugiana, Janakpuri, Madhopuri, Samrala, Gill, Sahnewal and Janakpuri, Koom Kalan, Pakhowal, Manupur, Sidhwan Bet, Sudhar, Field Gunj and Civil Lines.A total 4,678 participants were interviewed from across the state and their blood samples collected. Of these, 1,201 tested immunoglobulin (IgG ) reactive, of which only 4.03% were symptomatic and 95.9% were asymptomatic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/third-sero-survey-to-begin-next-week-in-ludhiana/story-kBbVm77107YJ3Gh8viwXnL.html
17-12-2020||Mumbai||Do not take coercive step against BJP leader Girish Mahajan: Bombay HC to Pune Police||In a reprieve for former Maharashtra minister Girish Mahajan and his personal assistant Rameshwar Naik, the Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday restrained the Pune Police from taking any coercive steps against them in connection with an offence registered at Kothrud police station in Pune.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik granted the relief to the BJP legislator and his assistant, after their counsel, senior advocate Milind Sathe, pointed out that the offence was registered on December 9 this year, around three years after the alleged incident which took place in first week of January 2018.The offence was originally registered at Nimbhora police station in Jalgaon district on December 9 on the basis of a complaint lodged by advocate Vijay Patil, trustee of Jalgaon District Maratha Vidya Prasarak Samaj, which runs several educational institutes in the district.The first information report (FIR) was later transferred to Kothrud police station for investigation as the incident had taken place within its jurisdiction.Patil, in his complaint to the police, alleged he was invited by some persons to Pune under the guise of collecting some documents connected with the trust. However, when he reached Pune he was first taken to a hotel and then to a flat where he threatened with dire consequences if he and others failed to resign from the trust.He alleged he was told by his alleged kidnappers in clear terms that Girishbhau (Mahajan) wanted to take control over the trust, and therefore wanted Patil and other trustees to resign.Claiming that the complaint was nothing but a concocted story, Sathe pointed out that no act has been attributed to the former minister and the complaint merely makes some references to him but the references do not amount to any offence.The senior advocate further submitted the delay of about three years goes to the root of the matter and the FIR was liable to be quashed on that ground itself.HC found substance in his submissions and restrained police from taking any coercive action against Mahajan and Naik till January 7, 2021, when the petitions filed by them are posted for further hearing. HC has also called for the record of the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/do-not-take-coercive-step-against-bjp-leader-girish-mahajan-bombay-hc-to-pune-police/story-IiVzed9HISozQ2i3DjcCtK.html

Cheema and other AAP leaders including deputy leader of opposition and Jagraon MLA Sarabjit Kaur Manuke were in Ludhiana to induct a few Congress leaders into the party fold. The Congress leaders who joined AAP include former district president of youth Congress, Raman Chandi, Surinder Saini and Baljinder Singh Bhaskar. Cheema said that the Captain Amarinder Singh-led state government has failed to fulfil any its pre-poll promises made to all sections of the society. He said that AAP had served farmers in the best possible way, while Congress gave its consent to pass the ordinances in the first place. Cheema also slammed MP Ravneet Bittu for making vague statements just to remain in the headlines. Cheema said that the state government should announce financial aid and a government job for the family members of the farmers who died during the protests. Also the deceased farmers should be given the status of martyrs, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-s-stubbornness-responsible-for-deaths-of-farmers-claims-aap/story-fi8c369q1VZbbkUGfJZJuK.html

17-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police cracks down on wanted criminals||While handling crime in the city, the Mumbai Police has turned to the age-old adage of ‘prevention is better than cure’ as the Mumbai police commissioner along with other senior police officers have conceptualised a multi-dimensional approach to crackdown on the city’s most wanted and absconding criminals.Not only have police stations across Mumbai been asked to prepare a list of 25 most wanted criminals in their jurisdiction, but they have also been asked to charge people under the Maharashtra Prevention Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act and to get courts to declare absconding criminals proclaimed offenders and confiscate their property. The Mumbai Police has also decided to make habitual offenders execute a legal bond where the amount of bond will be calculated after taking into consideration the annual income of the family. Earlier, the offender could execute a legal bond by paying a sum of ₹10,000 to ₹15,000. “A slew of measures has been planned to crackdown on wanted and absconding criminals. Every police station has been asked to prepare a list of 25 most wanted criminals in their jurisdiction and regularly update the list of anti-social elements,” said Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The wanted and absconding criminals could be involved in heinous bodily offences, underworld activities, terror suspects, habitual criminals, economic offenders, cyber fraudsters among others. “We planned to do the review as we found that the police stations had not reviewed its most wanted and absconding criminal list since many years. The idea is to launch a fresh action against such criminals,” said Vishwas Nangre Patil, joint commissioner of police, law and order. Patil also said that a plan has been put in place to get courts to declare criminals who are absconding as proclaimed offenders under section 82 of the Criminal Procedure Code which will allow the police to attach properties belonging to them. To ensure that the plan falls in place, dedicated teams will be formed at police station, zonal, region, city and state levels, he said.“These dedicated teams will be entrusted with tasks of apprehending the wanted and absconding offenders and taking other necessary action. These teams would co-ordinate with each other through superior officers of additional commissioner and deputy commissioner ranks,” added Patil.Apart from this, the Mumbai Police also plans to invoke the MPDA Act against anti-social elements and criminals as the act gives the commissioner of police powers to send a criminal behind bars for a period of two years. A senior police officer said, “The commissioner has also instructed us to increase the amount of legal bond from the existing ₹10,000 or ₹15,000 for habitual offenders after calculating their annual income. Offenders will have to pay their yearly income as a legal bond from now on. This will become an effective deterrent.” The humane side of Mumbai Police would also be showcased with the commissioner of police introducing a criminal adoption system. “Criminals who have been active in the past three years would be brought under its purview. Under this system, dedicated policemen at the police station level would encourage such people to get out of the crime world and will help them with rehabilitation. It’s a reformative, corrective and proactive policing scheme,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-cracks-down-on-wanted-criminals/story-gY0mpzRugGoC5LxBJ2DXxO.html

17-12-2020||City||Farmers brave cold wave as they camp at Haryana border||Ram Singh, a 62-year-old farmer from Gharsana tehsil in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar district, has been sleeping in his tractor for the past three days in Shahjahanpur on Rajasthan-Haryana border. Singh, along with some other farmers from Gharsana, has been camping at the site even as a cold wave sweeps across the region. While braving the cold was not easy, Singh said that the discomfort was negligible in comparison to the dangers posed by the new farm laws. “While the older farmers are sleeping in tractors and trolleys, the younger ones sleep on the road. Our sisters and daughters are not able to sleep at night. The conditions are harsh but we are ready to face it all. Until the government relents, we will continue to agitate under all challenging circumstances,” said Singh. He is among around 5,000 farmers, from states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Haryana, who have gathered at Shahjahanpur at the Delhi-Jaipur highway to join the movement against the new farm laws. Farmers across the country have been protesting against the three newly enacted farm laws — The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 — passed by Parliament during the monsoon session. The farmers fear that the new laws will put them at the mercy of large corporations and lead to the removal of the minimum support price(MSP) they receive on important crops. While the aim of the farmers is to join the agitation in Delhi, they’ve been restricted at the interstate border by the Rewari Police for the past five days. Farmer groups have stationed their caravan at one of the carriageways since the police in Haryana are not allowing them to move ahead. While this section of the Delhi-Jaipur highway is blocked, traffic movement has not been significantly hit due to route diversion.Abhishek Jorwal, superintendent of police(Rewari), said that the police were on the vigil and wouldn’t allow farmers to block the highway. “We have deployed enough strength on the highway. We will not let farmers block the highway. We have placed barricades on one side of the carriageway,” said Jorwal. He said that around 1,000 farmers in total were protesting at both Banipur Chowk and Shahjahanpur border. “Why is the Haryana government stopping us from going to the national Capital? Are we not living in a democracy? They tell us that people from Rajasthan cannot enter Haryana,” said Singh. He said that the treatment of the government towards farmers had been shocking, “We have not seen this kind of inconsiderate behaviour from governments before.” Singh said that the new laws threatened the existence of farmers and they were prepared for a long fight. “We are ready to stay here for one whole year or two, if required. We will not budge till the laws are rolled back. This is a countrywide movement that affects all farmers,” said Singh. Multiple groups of farmers from Rajasthan and Gujarat are camping in tarpaulin tents at the site. Farmers have reached the borders from places such as Churu, Mundwa in Rajasthan and Himatnagar, Modasa in Gujarat. “On a daily basis, batches of farmers from different villages are joining the agitation. We will continue to strengthen our numbers here before we decide to head to Delhi. Till the time the three laws are rolled back, we will continue to protest. Be it for weeks or months,” said Mangal Singh, a farmer from Sikar in Rajasthan. Harvinder Singh Gehlot, a farmer from Shri Ganganagar, said that the goal was to reach Delhi and strengthen the ongoing agitation. He said that more batches of farmers would be joining the agitation at Shahjahanpur following which the groups will march ahead. “We are very clear about our demands. We want the government to roll back the laws and ensure that crops are procured as per the MSP formula proposed by the MS Swaminathan committee report. We seek the improvement of conditions for all farmers. This movement is not restricted to Punjab and Haryana alone,” said Gehlot. Sanjay Madhav, the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that while the dipping mercury levels were causing discomfort, farmers were committed to the movement and in high spirits.“Despite the cold wave, farmers remain undaunted. Support for our movement is increasing daily. More groups of farmers are joining us and we expect the agitation here to grow more in the coming days. We will strengthen the movement here before moving ahead,” said Madhav||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-brave-cold-wave-as-they-camp-at-haryana-border/story-Iapba64xlPeGwNnw1xgfVM.html
17-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG to examine concerns over lease of Aravalli land||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said on Thursday that it is examining concerns raised over a lease agreement between the urban local body and a public sector oil and gas company that allows the latter to construct a petrol pump on Aravalli land in Chakkarpur village. MCG officials said they will “clear any apprehensions” in the matter before moving forward with the lease agreement. City-based NGO IAmGurgaon, which is behind eco-restoration projects such as the Wazirabad bundh and the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, had written to the municipal commissioner earlier this week, seeking cancellation of the lease agreement. It has been alleged by the NGO, as well as city environmentalists, that lease agreement violates multiple environmental statutes relating to the protection of Aravalli forests.The lease (a copy of which is with Hindustan Times) was signed on March 15, 2019, for setting up a petrol pump on a 150-square metre (sq m) land parcel in Chakkarpur. The lease has been granted to a public sector entity for a period of 30 years, with a payable rent of ₹2.25 lakh per month (subject to a 25% increase every three years). The petrol pump itself is yet to come up on the allotted parcel (recorded as khasra number 611/4 in revenue books).However, it has been pointed out in IAmGurgaon’s communique, dated December 14, that the area in question is a protected Aravalli forest falling under the land use category of “gair mumkin pahad” or uncultivable hilly lands. These lands are protected under the ministry of environment, forest and climate change’s (MoEFCC) Aravalli Notification of May 7, 1992, which prohibits any non-forest activities in the Aravallis.Addressing these concerns, municipal commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said, “We have received representation regarding the apprehensions related to grant of lease of land for fuel retail outlet (petrol pump). Environmental concerns about forest and Aravalli notification have been raised, citing various environmental regulations and orders of courts. We are examining the case to clear all apprehensions before moving forward with the lease. The applicant will have to get all environmental and forest clearances from concerned government department before getting permission from MCG.”Meanwhile, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), which is empowered to enforce the Aravalli Notification (1992) in Gurugram, said it will probe the matter. “We will seek a report from the revenue department to ascertain the status of the land. If there is any illegality, we will take appropriate action. The mandate of the Aravalli Notification will be followed in letter and spirit. I cannot say anything further for the moment,” said Kuldeep Singh, HSPCB’s regional officer in Gurugram.Moreover, prior to the signing of the lease agreement by the MCG in March last year, the corporation had approached the GMDA’s urban environment division in early 2019, seeking to restore the area’s natural Aravalli habitat. “Keeping in mind the environmental sensitivity of the area, the MCG had assigned the area to the GMDA for restoration and the GMDA has signed an MOU with our organisation, IAmGurgaon, to protect and enhance the forest, waterbody and biodiversity in this area,” states IAmGurgaon’s letter.“The area had already been earmarked for ecorestoration. Any diversion for non-forestry purposes in the area will hinder our attempts at reviving the natural ecosystem. The area is also a low-lying Aravalli forest and helps to reduce the run-off on Golf Course Road, which has recently suffered major flooding,” said Latika Thukral, founder, IAmGurgaon.This view also found support among officials. A senior IAS officer, who has formerly served in the GMDA’s urban environment division as well as the forest department, said on the condition of anonymity, “This lease agreement, ab initio, does not stand. The land is an Aravalli forest, and must be protected as per various Supreme Court orders. It sets a bad precedent when forests are diverted for a non-essential utility — in this case a petrol pump.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-examine-concerns-over-lease-of-aravalli-land/story-SjLtNnjY9G9AAFomKw5axL.html

During the pandemic, midday meals are being delivered to students at their homes. “Midday meal ration for December will be distributed among students. While doing so, sanitary pads should also be delivered to students,” stated the directive issued by the department.While schools across the state have reopened for physical classroom sessions for students in classes 10 and 12, sessions for students in classes 9 and 11 will start from December 21.Suman Sharma, the principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that the school had procured supplies for two months and would start the disbursal from Friday. “We have collected the supplies and will ask teachers to start the delivery process from tomorrow. We have already distributed midday meals for this month, so separate visits will be made from tomorrow onwards,” said Sharma.She said that teachers would be visiting the houses of girls to deliver the supplies, comprising two packs each, on a monthly basis.Sharma said that the school will try to rope in female teachers for the job so that students can be sensitised about menstrual hygiene. “Since stigma is attached to menstrual hygiene, we will try to involve more female teachers for the distribution process so that parents or students are not hesitant in accepting the supplies,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/govt-schools-to-deliver-sanitary-pads-to-girl-students-at-residences/story-U03926RULAk09TyUiUh4yK.html

In the rest, almost 98% of work is completed. “These flats can be handed over as people are ready to finish the remaining work themselves and make balance payments to the company,” he said.Samir Kumar, member, H-Rera, said that the issue of Sare Homes project is under consideration and the authority will be issuing a direction in this regard soon. “These are complex issues and resolving these takes time but we will certainly ensure that grievances of buyers are resolved at the earliest,” he said.A senior official of the company said that they have already assented to handing over the flats to the buyers if they want to complete their work themselves and pay the balance to the company. “Almost 99% of work is completed in 500 flats and these can be given to buyers. Only a few thousand rupees would be required to finish these,” he said, adding that currently the project was being overseen by H-Rera.In another development, the residents of BPTP Generations project called upon district town planner and submitted that a revenue road which had been recently opened by the department should be closed as the security of the residents was threatened. “The revenue road was closed by recently it has been opened on the request of a society nearby but this has caused problems to our residents,” said Parikshit Vats.RS Bhath, district town planner, said that the revenue road was opened after a complaint by residents of a nearby society and it was done as per rules. “The revenue road can’t be closed, but we will explore the possibility that land of revenue road can be exchanged, but this comes under the domain of MCG. We will take up this matter with them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/homebuyers-in-sare-homes-demand-delivery-of-flats/story-UiggnInA2uOzMorUgwkebJ.html
17-12-2020||Gurugram||DTCP to prepare report on takeover of Sare Homes project||The Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) will prepare a detailed report for initiating takeover of the Sare Home residential project in Sector 92 and submit the same to the government by next month. The move comes after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had directed officials to work out modalities for the process last month.The department held a meeting on Thursday to discuss the matter in detail and the district town planner of the enforcement wing was asked to prepare a report on the assets, liabilities, construction status, infrastructure and rights of the stakeholders.Residents in the Sare Home project have alleged that there were a number of deficiencies with the project, including a non-existent fire fighting system, missing boundary walls and hundreds of undelivered flats.Two phases of the five-phase project are yet to be delivered and electricity connections were frequently disconnected due to non-payment of the bill by the developer, alleged residents. As many as 1,500 flats are yet to be delivered.RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that he will seek information from the developer, homebuyers and government departments concerned, including the electricity board and public health department.“I have sought the details of the terms and conditions of the specific licence to understand how Sare Home developer operated, being an FDI, and the transfer of licence from the original allottee. We have also sought details on the number of units constructed, sold and which are still not delivered. The status of construction of infrastructure and other services is also being sought,” said Bhath.The department will also seek a status report from the fire department, public health department and other stakeholders regarding shortcomings in the infrastructure.“We will prepare a comprehensive report and submit it to the government as per the directions of the chief minister. The final call on this will be taken by headquarters in Chandigarh as taking over a project is a complex matter,” he said.Pravin Malik, president, Sare Homes’ residents’ welfare association (RWA), said that the government should work towards taking over the project. “The project is still viable. The buyers have to pay around Rs 200 crore for their properties and this can be used to finish the project,” said Malik.A senior Sare Home official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the project has been delayed due to issues such as delays in permissions, demonetisation, construction ban and other issues, which were beyond the control of the company.“Even today, the project is cash positive as there are around Rs 200 crore receivables. The matter is sub judice, in Delhi high court, as a US-based investor had approached the courts in US and Delhi to get relief in this matter,” he said.The official quoted above said that there is no official spokesperson to answer queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-to-prepare-report-on-takeover-of-sare-homes-project/story-ooSGJwIjivxwUy6979lhQP.html
17-12-2020||Gurugram||Coldest day of season as temperatures hit new lows||The city woke up to the coldest day of this winter season, with the maximum temperature dropping to 13.1 degrees Celsius on Thursday, as per India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. Meanwhile, the minimum temperature fell to 4 degrees Celsius in the early hours on Thursday, marking a new low this season for both nighttime and daytime temperatures in Gurugram.The maximum temperature was nine degrees below the normal, while the minimum temperature was four degrees below the normal, as per the IMD’s Palam observatory.Weather in Gurugram also remained colder than in the capital, where the IMD recorded a minimum temperature of 4.6 degrees, and a maximum temperature of 15.1 degrees, at Delhi’s Safdarjung observatory. However, temperatures at Delhi’s Palam observatory — which is the closest weather station to Gurugram — were lower, with a minimum reading of 13.2 degrees Celsius and maximum reading of 4.5 degrees Celsius.The maximum temperature in Gurugram on Wednesday was at 16.6 degrees Celsius, which indicates a three degrees Celsius drop in the daytime temperature.“Cold winds are blowing from the northwest of the National Capital Region, and their influence over Gurugram is more than in Delhi, since the city lies in the eastern part of Delhi-NCR. Over the next two days, there will be a further decline in both the day and night temperatures across the region,” said Navdeep Dahiya, a Rohtak-based meteorologist who has been tracking weather patterns in Haryana and Delhi-NCR.As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Gurugram, the minimum temperature is expected to remain around four degrees Celsius till at least December 19, with “cold day” conditions likely to persist.The IMD defines a “cold day” as one in which the minimum temperature remains under 10 degrees, and the maximum temperature remains less than 4.5 degrees Celsius (or 6.4 degrees Celsius below normal). The minimum temperature is expected to remain around 4 degrees Celsius till at least Saturday, while the maximum temperature is expected to remain below 15 degrees Celsius.Meanwhile, air quality in the city deteriorated slightly on Thursday, but remained in the “poor” category, recording 246 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin. The AQI was 221 the previous day.Experts attributed the relatively low level of pollution to high wind speeds, of up to 10kmph, which prevailed on Thursday. “These are cold winds blowing from the north and into the plains. While they are responsible for the sudden dip in daytime temperature, they are also what is keeping pollutants from accumulating in the region,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/coldest-day-of-season-as-temperatures-hit-new-lows/story-yDL30Rwh1BgXkdRlYtuyWL.html

On the second anniversary of the Congress government, Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia said “anti-incumbency” has developed against the government in the last two years and it will score a “hit wicket with its own deeds”. Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria raised 13 questions to the Congress government about the farmers’ loan waiver, unemployment allowance, increase in power tariff, increase in crime graph and recruitment among others. Taking a dig at the government, Poonia said it has “failed to deliver on all fronts and has no right to celebrate the anniversary”. Due to infighting, neither the Congress nor the state government was able to function properly, he alleged. “There is a long list of failures. Crimes against women have increased, law and order has completely deteriorated, contractual employees have not been regularised yet, 59 lakh farmers are waiting for complete loan waiver, unemployed youths are not being given allowance,” he claimed. Poonia said the chief minister blamed the BJP for trying to topple his government but it will fall on its own and “score a hit wicket”. He said the people of Rajasthan are suffering due to the internal issues and infighting of the Congress and the public will release its report card in the 2023 assembly elections. Meanwhile, BJP’s youth wing Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM) held demonstrations across the state against the Gehlot government. BJYM state president Himanshu Sharma said that effigies of the chief minister were burnt during the demonstrations held against the state government on completion of its two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/ashok-gehlot-govt-failed-on-all-fronts-says-rajasthan-bjp/story-N5WZfgAvRwPYTMccK0hKRN.html
17-12-2020||Chandigarh||Assault on senior forest official: Kurukshetra DFO gets bail||A Kurukshetra divisional forest officer (DFO) who was arrested by Ambala police for allegedly assaulting an Indian forest service (IFS) official senior to him was granted bail by a court on Thursday. Virender Gill was booked on December 9 on a complaint by the chief conservator of forests (north circle) G Raman at the Baldev Nagar Police Station. Raman alleged that Gill assaulted him after he refused to clear a few files and payments at his office at the Forest Complex in Ambala City’s Company Bagh. Deputy superintendent of police (Barara) Rajnish Kumar, who is investigating the case, said, “Gill was produced before a court based on the offences and was granted bail. The rest of the case related to the tender and files is the department’s internal matter.”Another police officer said the prosecution had asked for judicial custody of Gill, but the court granted bail based on the charges. G Raman, in his police statement, said that Gill had wanted an e-tender approved even though it had been issued by him in violation of rules. Gill explained that he wanted Raman’s go-ahead for carrying out plantation in December, 2020. “I refused his proposal as it is technically incorrect and environmentally not viable to carry out the plantation in the... month. It was further explained to him that since December was one of the coldest month and plantation gets affected by the frost, therefore, plantation should not be done in these winter months of the year.”Allegedly warning Raman that the consequences of not approving the files would not be good, Gill handed him another file related to payment of labourers for approval. “On perusal of the file it was found incomplete and the details were no given as sought earlier on the same issue. In unwarranted act of anger, he shouted and leaned on the table and snatched the file...” Raman said. Gill was booked under sections 186, 332, 353, 506 and 504 of the Indian Penal Code. Commenting on the matter, Raman later said, “This is a court process. The state has to see what to do next.”On being asked about the amount of tender/files, he said, “The labour payment approval was worth Rs 24 lakh, but I couldn’t see the other e-tender file as I had already refused, citing the month of plantation. The amount could be double than the labour payment figure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/assault-on-senior-forest-official-kurukshetra-dfo-gets-bail/story-MZtF2jhTTkScIUdp7eh3iK.html
17-12-2020||Chandigarh||Open Chandigarh apni mandis, demand locals||People in the city want the local farmer markets or apni mandis with controlled prices to reopen, saying it’s a free-for-all by door to door vendors who are overcharging for fruits and vegetables. The Chandigarh Residents’ Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED), too, has written to the UT administration asking that farmers be directly allowed to sell products to consumers. The UT Market Committee has also stopped sharing a list of fixed rates for the day to be displayed by vendors registered with the municipal corporation (MC).Confirming this, a market committee official who did not want to be named as he’s not authorised to speak to the media, said, “Vendors with rehris who don’t follow the rate list are doing well and others allotted space by the MC have stopped putting up their stalls, so a rate list is not being issued now.” MC started fixing fruit and vegetable rates during the lockdown when Chandigarh Transport Union buses were brought into service to supply produce to all sectors. However, when markets opened and the bus services were discontinued vendors stopped displaying lists.A round of the markets on Thursday revealed that most vegetables were being sold at marked up prices. Tomatoes, which cost Rs 25 per kg when bought in bulk from wholesalers, were being sold for Rs 50 per kg. Onions (Rs 30 per kg) were being sold for Rs 50 per kg and capsicum (Rs 20 per kg) were going for Rs 80 per kg. On CRAWFED’s letter to the UT administration, Hitesh Puri, chairman of the welfare associations’ body, said, “Since the market committee is not issuing any rate list now, how will the authorities keep a check on how much the vendors are charging? Mandis should be opened, policemen should be stationed there to ensure that all Covid-19 safety standards are maintained.”On overcharging by vendors, Puri said, “Residents should stop buying from the door to door vendors or simply not pay them what they ask for.” Jatinder Singh, secretary of the Sector 40-B Residents’ Welfare Association, also added that in sectors 46 and 37, some of the vendors had collected to form a mini mandi with fairer prices. “While I recently bought peas for Rs 30 per kg from a vendor outside my house, the same were available for Rs 20 per kg here. The administration must allow mandis to open to keep a check vendors and vegetable prices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/open-chandigarh-apni-mandis-demand-locals/story-Aj91QRBzeojvMVVTeFjo5I.html

He also alleged that local Congress member Deepinder Singh Dhillon could have had a hand in excluding the voters’ names from the final list. Sharma had alleged that even the names of sitting councillors had been deleted and threatened to stage a protest against SDM Dera Bassi, MC executive officer and other officials for working “at the behest of Congress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/12-000-voter-names-missing-from-list-mohali-dc-orders-probe/story-2ObyLSoFKAOgEUluPK5eKL.html
17-12-2020||Mumbai||‘Are you affected personally’: HC to lawyer who wants Kangana’s Twitter handle suspended||The Bombay High Court on Thursday said that it would decide on whether to consider a plea which sought the suspension of actor Kangana Ranaut’s Twitter profile as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), according to a report filed by Livelaw .com.Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh, a Mumbai-based lawyer, in his criminal writ petition said that Twitter should be directed to permanently suspend or disable Ranaut’s profile to stop the spread of hate in the country. He added that the social media platform should be directed to follow laws to prevent any misuse.The lawyer also accused Kangana of using the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput for her own gains. She did the same thing with the ongoing agitation of farmers, he said citing a few controversial tweets put out by Ranaut and her sister Rangoli Chandel which allegedly incited hatred against communities. Arguing before a division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik on Thursday, Deshmukh pointed out that he had written to the police and the state authorities in the past seeking action against Ranaut and her sister. But the judges wanted to know whether the plea was a PIL to which Deshmukh responded it was not.“Then how can we act in a criminal case on the basis of claims made by a third party, who is in no way affected personally? Is this a PIL? If not, then you will have to show personal injury to you, how it is affecting you,” the bench told Deshmukh, according to news agency PTI.The bench directed Deshmukh to ponder whether the issue should be raised through a PIL or the criminal writ petition should continue and adjourned the matter till Monday.Meanwhile, government lawyer Y P Yagnik highlighted that the plea did not state how the tweets flagged by Deshmukh affected the public at large. “This is a very vague petition. Twitter is an international body.

A detailed copy of the judgment is awaited.The court said the apparent prima facie intent of the tweet of the petitioner was at least with the knowledge to believe that the imputations made in the tweet would harm the reputation of the complainant.Malhorta said whether the tweets if, et al, were for public good can be determined by the trial court when the defence would make it contentions.Sisodia had filed the defamation case against the two BJP leaders and others for allegedly levelling corruption charges against him. Gupta and Tiwari had challenged the trial court’s November 28, 2019, order summoning them and others as accused in the criminal defamation case. The others named in the complaint are MPs Hans Raj Hans and Pravesh Verma, MLAs Manjinder Singh Sirsa and Vijender Gupta and BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana. SIsodia alleged that these leaders had levelled corruption charges against him in relation to the Delhi government’s classroom renovation in government schools.The deputy chief minister had filed the criminal defamation case against these leaders for making false and defamatory statements in print, electronic and social media. Sisodia said all the allegations made by the BJP leaders, jointly and individually, were false, defamatory and derogatory and were made with an intention to harm and damage his reputation and goodwill.Gupta later said, “We will approach the Supreme Court in this matter.”Tiwari said, “We will take necessary legal measures and approach the apex court. I had raised an important issue of corruption in the functioning of the AAP-led Delhi government and the matter is subjudice.”The accused were earlier granted bail after they appeared before the trial court. The maximum punishment is two years for the offence of defamation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-dismisses-plea-by-bjp-mp-and-mla-to-quash-summons-in-defamation-case/story-4po4cpVDaxUCCTJggAFWgJ.html
17-12-2020||Pune||Despite promise, PMC fails to offer compensation to civic staff who died of Covid-19||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had announced a compensation of Rs 1 crore and a civic job for a family member of the municipal corporation employee who succumbs to Covid-19 while on duty. However, the civic body has not paid any amount to many such employees who died due to the infection.At least 46 civic employees have lost their lives due to Covid-19 since April and of these, the labour welfare department has proposed compensation for 21 employees and tabled it in front of the general body for approval. Most of the deceased employees were conservancy staffs, who had been working at forefront during the pandemic.Shivaji Duandkar, chief labour officer, who is also handling charge of the municipal secretary, said, “We scrutinised 21 proposals which claimed Rs 1 crore compensation. The proposal has been tabled in the general body meeting. However, it is still pending as the general body has not met due to the pandemic.”As per the scheme, the municipal corporation will contribute Rs 50 lakh and the central government will provide the remaining Rs 50 lakh to the victim’s family. At present, the corporation has sent a proposal of Rs 50 lakh to the state government which will be sent to the central government for final approval. Kishor, brother of Vinod Nandgaonkar, a civic employee, said, “My younger brother who was working as part of the conservancy staff in the Ahmednagar road-Wadgaonsheri ward office died on duty due to Covid-19. It is very painful that the corporation had promised to give compensation, but we haven’t received it even after six months.”Diksha Mane, daughter of late Deepak Mane, a civic employee, who died in June, said, “My father was working with the drainage department. He died due to Covid-19 infection. Corporation has not given us anything. I am studying in Class 9 and live with my mother. We don’t have any other source of income. Now, we are using our savings. Corporation should do something as early as possible.” City mayor Murlidhar Mohol had instructed the municipal commissioner to execute the scheme and prepare details for it. “The corporation has decided to give Rs 25 lakh to the family of the victim who died due to Covid-19 and offer a job to one of the family members or give Rs 50 lakh without offering job to family member. It has not been delayed. We will disburse the money soon.”“As far as the Rs 1 crore compensation amount is concerned, we are ready to pay the amount of Rs 50 lakh and remaining will be paid by the central government,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/despite-promise-pmc-fails-to-offer-compensation-to-civic-staff-who-died-of-covid-19/story-0GMjOXFyB4J0Q7Ku17Q3IL.html

17-12-2020||Delhi||Dhol sellers drum a brisk business at Singhu protest site||While most businesses around the farmers’ protest site at Singhu border have suffered losses over the past 20 days owing to the road blockade, one group is busy doing a bit of brisk business -- dhol sellers from nearby Bawana who have reached the protest venue in large numbers to make the most of the ongoing agitation. Farmers from Punjab and Haryana are buying these small brown drums, known as dhols, in plenty -- some to take them home as presents for their children, others to “loudly cheer and celebrate” as and when their agitation becomes “victorious”.One such seller, Muzahir Ali, said he and most of the other hawkers live in Bawana’s slum colony and decided to come to Singhu as their sales had dipped in the months following the Covid-19 lockdown.“Apart from toy shops and fairs, these dhols sell the most at protest sites and right now, there is no bigger protest spot than Singhu. So, about 30 of us have been selling dhols here every day,” Ali said. Ali and the others are actually toy sellers, but the only toy they have been bringing to Singhu is dhol.Salman Naved, another dhol seller, said he was among the first to reach the spot, about a week ago. “On the first day itself, I sold over 20 dhols. The farmers here don’t even try to bargain the price the down,” Naved said. Jarnail Singh, a farmer from Mullapur village in Ludhiana, who purchased three dhols from Ali for ₹150 said he would take them back for his two children and one he would beat all the way while driving home, as and when the government gives in to the demands of the farmers.“My children think I am enjoying at a fair and they want me to bring back something from here. So, I’ll take the dhols back as mementoes,” Jarnail Singh said. Shahid Khan, another dhol seller, said he had to wrap up his toy stall in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, after the lockdown. “This protest is a boon for us. We’ll try to make up a little of the losses we sustained during the lockdown,” Khan, who sold four dhols by early afternoon on Thursday, said. The sellers said they purchase these dhols for as little as ₹50 per piece and sell them at Singhu for as much as ₹150 per piece. “In Sadar Bazar toy market, these dhols go for only ₹70-80,” Khan said.Bhajan Singh, a 65-year-old farmer from Lakhoke Behram village in Ferozpur, said he was buying a drum from Khan for himself. “The government doesn’t seem to be hearing us. Maybe the dhols will help carry our voice to those in power,” Bhajan Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dhol-sellers-drum-a-brisk-business-at-singhu-protest-site/story-zo8VDWdqvRnvib0FTiWEwL.html

As a result, three years after its formation, people are being issued highly inflated and unreasonable water bills and the MC has no control over this company,” said Chauhan.“Instead of providing relief to the people during the pandemic, the administration is increasing financial burden on the people by issuing inflated bills,” he added.The party has warned the MC that if it does not withdraw the said bills and disband SJPNL, then the party will mobilise the citizens against the “anti-people policies” and lax practices by the government and the civic body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cpi-m-demands-withdrawal-of-inflated-water-bills-by-shimla-mc/story-6LxPvhIq8Pgmig7Rl4m3VJ.html

Himachal Pradesh University’s psychology department along with HPSMHA sent questionnaires to 5,200 subscribers in Shimla, Chamba and Mandi districts.Respondents were asked to answer nine questions such as whether they had lost their job due to the pandemic and if they had experienced suicidal thoughts or suicidal tendencies during the pandemic. The survey sample included respondents residing in both rural and urban areas. Within five categories, the respondents comprised government employees, self-employed persons, unemployed people, and students. The survey was conducted over three weeks.“About 50% persons who took the survey felt anxious or depressed after going through Covid-19 related content and news on the social media,” said senior medical superintendent of Himachal Hospital of Mental Health and Rehabilitation, Boileauganj, and CEO of state mental health authority.After analysing the feedback, the HPSHMA will send its observation to the state government for its consideration. Generally, about 10% of the population suffers from common mental disorders like depression and anxiety and the study would reflect the trend in different age groups, males and females, urban and rural population and upper, middle and lower economic classes.The issue of mental health and increasing suicides was flagged by the department of police which during the lockdown gathered data from across police stations in the state. As many as 709 suicides were reported last year (2019), but there has been a spurt in these cases during the ongoing pandemic and 657 suicides were reported in the first nine months till September 30, this year. The highest of 302 suicides were reported in the months of May, June and July.As per the data collated by the police, people between the ages 18 and 35 are most vulnerable to suicide. The most common reasons for taking the extreme step are financial crisis, unemployment, marital issues, bankruptcy, drug addiction, health issues or illness, failure in examinations, love affairs, or family problems. Domestic violence, economic distress, failed relationships; unemployment, health, setback in business; drug abuse and alcoholism are factors that drove people to end their lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/50-of-himachalis-feel-depressed-by-consuming-covid-content-survey/story-Q2X4WRWJ4ExYbQqJAtQSuM.html

Even Congress ran a low-key campaign across the UT.The last round of the eight-phase DDC polls will be held on Saturday and results for the 280 seats will be declared on December 22.During the vote-seeking exercise, the BJP strengthened its poll campaign with the help of its top national leaders who arrived in the UT and promoted the DDC candidates. On the contrary, the top leaders of the biggest regional parties like the NC and PDP mostly stayed away from grassroots campaigning.NC and PAGD president Farooq Abdullah had at the start of the elections issued a short video on social media seeking votes for the alliance candidates. However, leaders like Mehbooba Mufti blamed the administration for not allowing her to travel during the DDC polls. Only People’s Conference chairman Sajjad Lone addressed three to four rallies in Kupwara district promoting PAGD candidates, mainly from his own party.NC spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar said the party has a strong cadre base across J&K who ran the campaign...“Our district and provincial leaders too were part of the poll campaign and the results will portray our hard work.”Claiming that the administration created impediments to their poll campaign, PDP spokesman Tahir Sayeed said party president Mehbooba Mufti was not allowed to travel to South Kashmir and other areas. “Security was denied to our top leaders so we devised a plan which involved grassroots cadres in the canvassing process.” He alleged that only the BJP and its “B team” (referring to Apni Party) were given a free hand to run their campaign. “We were not given a level playing field by the administration,” he rued.BJP in-charge for Kashmir, Vibodh Gupta said the BJP takes every election seriously. “For us, this is a big election and our national leaders participated in the rallies held in all parts of the UT, especially in Kashmir as we wanted that party flag should reach every corner of the valley.”In case of Congress, not a single national leader visited J&K to boost the morale of the cadres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-ddc-polls-subdued-show-by-regional-parties-in-last-leg-of-campaigning/story-GJLsiXn2lGGqiuSRHg5alM.html

The government employees are getting their salaries and all benefits, while the self-employed businessmen are suffering due to the insensitive decisions of the government, he rued.He said that the government without taking citizens into confidence imposed the night curfew.“Maximum tourist activity takes place on Saturdays and Sundays, and by imposing the lockdown on Sundays, the government is only creating hurdles in the economic revival of the indutsry. All establishments, including those where tourists eat and buy essentials from were ordered to be closed on Sundays, causing much inconvenience to them,” said Sanjay.“Targeting tourists on the Mall Road seems to be a hobby of the administration,” he added.Sanjay alleged that the administration thinks Mall Road to be the epicentre of the pandemic where scores of policemen are regularly seen bullying the common people. “There is no logic to the draconian step of imposing night curfew and closing all establishments on Sunday as the government has no statistics to prove that the spurt in Covid cases was due to tourists.”He added that the association has sent figures to the tourism department which show that hardly any tourism-related employees, employers or other staffers have been afflicted with the disease. In Shimla district, there are more positive cases in the suburbs and rural areas than in the main town frequented by the tourists.“The hotel industry has been fighting for survival during the past many months and was looking forward to the coming tourist season and there is no logic of the night curfew during the peak tourist season of Christmas and New Year,” he said.The hoteliers have also blamed the state government for the surge in Covid-19 cases and have claimed that the decision to reopen state borders was ill-planned and there was no regulation on the inflow of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shimla-hoteliers-demand-lifting-of-night-curfew-for-holiday-season/story-C561v4uZEEP3eVZ9rtIoaI.html

Anubrata Mondol (another TMC veteran) called me up from Birbhum district and said that he received a call from a BJP leader from Delhi who wanted to fix a meeting. Look at the audacity and the extent to which BJP can go. How dangerous? They don’t have the minimum courtesy,” said Banerjee, while speaking at a rally in Cooch Behar on Thursday. This is, however, not the first time that the TMC has accused the BJP of trying to break the party. The party chief had earlier alleged that the BJP was distributing money and using central agencies to scare TMC leaders into joining the BJP. “Those who got scared switched sides,” she said. Also read: Farmers protest at this stage should be allowed, observes SCWhile former TMC leaders and legislators including Mukul Roy, Saumitra Khan and Anupam Hazra had earlier switched sides and are now with the BJP holding seniors posts, the latest in the line was TMC MLA from Cooch Behar (south), Mihir Goswami. Former transport minister Suvendu Adhikari has also resigned and speculations are rife that he, along with a few other TMC leaders, could join the BJP soon. “A political party will not survive if it doesn’t have any policies and values. It can take birth but will not be able to sustain. The TMC came to power opposing the CPIM and the Congress and now except for abusing the Prime Minister and Union home minister and branding the BJP a communal party, they have no task. So the end of the TMC has started and no political leader will stay in that party. It is just a matter of time,” said Mukul Roy, BJP’s national vice president. Opposition leaders have hit back saying that it was Banerjee and her party who first started the trend of breaking other parties using force and now she is being paid back in the same coin.“History has a nasty habit of repeating itself and Banerjee is being paid back in the same coin. Several Congress legislators in the party’s bastions in Murshidabad and Malda were forced to quit and were threatened of being implicated in false cases if they don’t join TMC. Those who did the job for the TMC at that time are now with the BJP and are doing the same thing with her,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha. Several Congress leaders and legislators including Manas Bhunia, Ajoy De, Saumitra Khan, Krishnendu Narayan Chowdhury and Humayun Kabir had deserted the party since 2011 to join the TMC. Some have been given ministerial berths. Similarly, legislators and leaders from various Left parties, including Chhaya Dolai, Anantadeb Adhikary Dasarath Tirkey and Sunil Mandal, had joined the TMC over the past 10 years. “Many a time during the Left Front’s regime it happened that there was a neck-to-neck tie with the TMC which was then in the opposition. We, however, made no efforts to break into the TMC. It was Banerjee’s party which started this game after she came to power in 2011. Since then, multiple legislators from various Left parties have joined the TMC,” said Sujan Chakraborty, leader of the Left parties in the assembly.While Khan deserted the TMC to join the BJP later on, Mandal, now a TMC MLA, has already expressed his disgruntlement and has threatened to resign. Also read: China puts the pedal to the metal on vaccine diplomacy. There are concerns“Those who are suffering from an existential crisis are making such baseless allegations. Mamata Banerjee has been working for the people and will continue to do so. There would not be any difference if one or two leaders switch sides,” said Chandrima Bhattacharya, state minister and senior TMC leader. The TMC had won 184 seats out of the 294 assembly seats in the 2011 elections when it came to power overthrowing 34 years of Left Front regime. The seat count increased to 211 in 2016 elections. Political experts also said that defection has never been the practice in West Bengal barring one in the 60’s. It was a practice which started after 2011. “Defection was never the trend in Bengal politics. But the TMC government started this. Opposition leaders were roped in either by force or by luring them. Now, the TMC is at the receiving end,” said Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, political commentator and former principal of Presidency College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/switching-sides-history-is-repeating-itself-in-west-bengal-says-opposition/story-wJ41zTCHl3dM12PCZoaP0K.html

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will join the programme from Raisen. During the event, the state government will transfer Rs 1,600 crore to the accounts of 3.5 million farmers as relief funds against crop loss, said the official of public relation department.“The previous Congress-led state government did injustice with the farmers by not transferring relief funds into their accounts. The previous Congress government did not even deposit the premium of Fasal Bima Yojna. But BJP is determined to work for the welfare of farmers. We have already deposited the premium of Fasal Bima Yojna and are now going to transfer relief funds,” the chief minister said.Also read: Farmers protest should be allowed, observes SCOn Wednesday, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijaywargiya had said that farmers in Malwa are supporting the farm laws and are ready to show the support. Addressing farmers’ meet in Indore, Vijaywargiya said, “Four lakh farmers in on 1 lakh tractors are ready to march towards Delhi in support of the law. They are just waiting for the nod of cabinet minister for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan. It will take only 10 days to reach Delhi from Malwa region.” Pradhan was also present at the meeting.On the other hand, hundreds of farmers under the banner of Ekta Parishad started foot march from Morena to Dholpur in Rajasthan on Thursday against the farm laws. Ekta Parishad president PV Rajgopal said farmers from across MP have joined the march. “The foot march will end in Dholpur on Saturday and thereafter, we will leave for Delhi in vehicles. Our motive is not a protest but to resolve the problem. We are willing to convince the Central government in favour of farmers,” said Rajgopal.MP Kisan Congress state president Dinesh Gurjar, local Congress MLAs Ravindra Singh Tomar and Ajab Singh Kushwaha are participating in the march. Some local tribal leaders are also taking part in the march. A tribal leader, Kasturi, who only uses first name, said, “We are supporting the protest because it is a fight for the rights of farmers.” Earlier too, Ekta Parishad held a successful Jan Satyagraha on October 2, 2012, against then UPA government demanding National Land Reforms Act. Former Union minister of rural development Jairam Ramesh had agreed to draft a national land reform act to help poor and homeless people on the sixth day of the march.MP Congress Committee also announced to stage protest on December 19 in districts of MP to support the farmers’ protest. Former chief minister and MPCC president Kamal Nath, Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh and other leaders will participate in the protest.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana are protesting at Delhi borders since November 27 braving the chilly nights asking the Central government to scrap the three farm laws passed in the monsoon session of Parliament in September. Farmers in different parts of India have held demonstrations to support the protests around the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/pm-modi-s-virtual-address-to-madhya-pradesh-farmers-to-be-telecast-live-across-23k-villages/story-W4KvtauIvuLuvjzIobNJzM.html

The rates for purchase/supply of rice straw would be settled after mutual negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cabinet-approves-iocl-s-proposal-to-set-up-compressed-biogas-plant/story-28Ib0NDOhLFore5xuyNIlJ.html

The recently US elections were conducted on ballot papers and the results were declared after two-three days. Why are we in a hurry? We are using EVM for fast counting of votes.”Chhajed said, “There are some doubts in the mind of political workers and voters. It is my opinion that polls should be conducted on ballot paper. I am following the issue with state-level leaders for the municipal elections slated in a year. Even senior leaders are shown positive response.”NCP city unit president and MLA Chetan Tupe said, “Many political parties have raised objections for EVM. Recently in the graduate constituency, elections were held on ballot paper and results are different. For the last many years, it is considered that the educated and middle class are not voting for the Congress and NCP. The BJP also carried out maximum voter registrations. Yet, for the first time, the Congress and NCP made history in the graduate constituency. The outcome was same in Nagpur and other regions.”Tupe said, “It shows that graduate and middle-class people are voting for the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena too. The EVM practice shows that they are not our voters. We claim that if the elections are conducted on ballot paper, the results in municipal elections will also be different.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/congress-ncp-bat-for-pune-civic-polls-on-ballot-paper/story-sm6zN2nb9L2ZWdc2LDIP4O.html

17-12-2020||Pune||India’s first Waqf liaison centre set up in Pune||Pune: The country’s first Waqf liaison centre is been set up in Pune by prominent philanthropist, Fareed Tungekar, in association with a city-based NGO. The office will serve as a platform for Waqf research and development in the country, where legal experts, serving and retired Waqf board officials, including officials from the central and state governments, will guide trustees on various aspects of the Waqf’s SOPs. The office is in Kondhwa and will be inaugurated by state minister Nawab Malik and Vishwajeet Kadam on Friday, being recognised as Minorities’ Day. Former income tax chief commissioner A J Khan and chief advisor of the Maharashtra Waqf Liberation and Protection Task Force, a nationwide organisation handling Waqf and legal issues, said that the centre has been set up to guide the community regarding Waqf protection and development. “The waqf lands available with the Muslim community are precious and have to be utilised for socio-economic development. Also, a number of encroachments have been present on Waqf land which need to be removed. We will create awareness about how to legally fight such type of cases and develop Waqf lands for starting schools, colleges, hospitals, skill development centres, and providing scholarship to the poor and the needy,” Khan said. Saleem Mulla, president of the Waqf liaison centre task force, said, “The centre will legally take up all the issues related to Waqf with the central and state governments with special focus on education, health and skill development in the Muslim community. Currently, our focus will be on setting up of a national skills university for Muslims in Pune, which was already sanctioned by previous CM Devendra Fadnavis; 100 acres of land and Rs 100 crore corpus fund has been donated,” he said. Khan said, “Now with the liaison centre, we will guide all the parties in pursuing the path of Waqf for national development by investing Waqf wealth in construction of schools, hospitals and universities.” What is Waqf?Waqf means to stop, retain, prevent from transfer any kind of property so declared. The intention of the “waqif”, the person assigning the property/properties, immovable or movable, is of prime importance. Generally Waqf properties are “Fi Sabeelillah” in nature meaning (for God, creation of God, the weak, the needy, the wayfarer, the community at large for religious and secular uses)Maharashtra has over 100,000 acres of Waqf land. The total estimated value of Waqf land in Pune is Rs 10,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/india-s-first-waqf-liaison-centre-set-up-in-pune/story-4CxBDJ8dEDeAsn9eAU06kJ.html

17-12-2020||Delhi||Rahim’s tomb: Delhi’s monument of love gets new lease of life after six-year conservation||Rahim’s tomb, Delhi’s own monument of love built nearly 50 years before the iconic Taj Mahal, which stood in a ruinous condition with a “risk of collapse” has finally received a new lease of life after six-year-long “monumental conservation” work.A multi-disciplinary team of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), in partnership with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and support of a corporate conglomerate, worked extensively on the project which married traditional craftsmanship with cutting-edge technology.“After completing the ambitious Humayun’s Tomb conservation project in 2014, we began work on the tomb of Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan located in Nizamuddin area. And thus began a journey of restoring the tomb of a man who was a celebrated poet, a nobleman and one of the ‘Navratnas’ in Akbar’s court,” said AKTC CEO, Ratish Nanda.“He also patronised construction of monumental buildings - canals, tanks, enclosed gardens - in Agra, Lahore, Delhi and Burhanpur, among other Indian cities,” Nanda said. The Delhi-based conservation architect said the restored tomb was the mausoleum that Rahim had built in 1598 for his wife, Mah Banu. It is the grandest of his surviving buildings, inspired by the architectural style of Humayun’s Tomb (built in 1558) and, in turn, inspiring the Taj Mahal completed in (1653) as historian Percy Brown had reckoned, Nanda said. Upon his death, Rahim was also buried in the same mausoleum.According to AKTC, with 1,75,000 man-days of work by master craftsmen, this is perhaps the “largest conservation effort” ever undertaken at any monument of national importance in India post-Independence, and also the “first ever privately undertaken conservation effort” under the Corporate Social Responsibility.“The project was very complex and full of challenges. The volume of work involved and using both traditional knowledge and state-of-the-art technology, we overcame various challenges. InterGlobe Foundation’s support through their CSR funds helped in sustaining the project work, which given its complexity was carried out literally on a monumental scale over six years,” Nanda said.He said the cultural site that sits next to the main road in Nizamuddin area is slated to be re-opened to the public from Thursday evening.Nanda said before starting the actual conservation work, an extensive research was conducted on the monument, including from the archives.“The last time a major architectural intervention was in the 1920s when the ASI had provided masonry support to overhanging sandstone blocks on the facade – saving the structure from sure collapse. These early 20th century repairs, using Delhi quartzite stone, have been retained during the present conservation effort,” he added.The lofty double dome was originally clad with marble said to have been quarried from here, as older buildings tended to be. Though several peer reviews suggested completing the marble cladding on the dome, on the advice of the ASI restoration of marble cladding was limited to the base. This served the dual purpose of strengthening the base as well as to indicate to visitors the original finish of the dome, according to AKTC.“As in Humayun’s Tomb project, we used 3D laser scanning to identify the cracks, which is a very effective tool. Also, on cleaning layers of soot and 20th century paint layers, the principal tomb chamber and five arched bays on each facade of the ground level arcade were found to be ornamented with breathtaking incised plaster patterns,” Nanda said.Rahim had ornamented his wife’s mausoleum with diverse motifs in plaster and stone, the AKTC said.“As with his poetry, these patterns include both geometric and floral patterns commonly seen in mausoleums, but also patterns seen in Hindu buildings, like ‘swastik’ and peacock. Each of the arches of the ground level arcade boast of medallions of varying designs in the spandrels of the arches. Where there was evidence of original design, the medallions were restored, carefully matching the quality of the 16th century craftsmen,” it said. Nanda said Rahim’s tomb, situated beside Mathura Road, is important also for the syncretic cultural legacy that he has left behind and it is very much part of the city’s skyline, adding another layer of aesthetics to the historic Nizamuddin area.   “His own atelier produced beautifully illustrated translations of the Ramayan and Mahabharata into Persian and a set of Ragamala paintings. On account of his poetry and dohas, drawings from the Hindu religious narratives and customs of veneration, Rahim is often compared with the Bhakti movement poets – Surdas, Tulsidas, Kabir,” Nanda said.The conservation effort on the monument has included celebrating Rahim’s cultural legacy too.Two major publications, ‘Celebrating Rahim’ and ‘Abdur Rahim Khan-i-khanan – Kavya, Saundarya, Sarthakta’ have been produced. Both include new research by several scholars on the multi-faceted Rahim and his literary achievements, he added.Built on the riverbank, Rahim’s garden mausoleum stood within an enclosed garden stretching to the Arab Serai in the Humayun’s Tomb complex to the north. “Sadly, much of this was lost in the 20th century when residential neighbourhoods were built here. More recently, a road to the southern side of the mausoleum disrupted the historic link with the river – now, Barapullah Nallah,” according to AKTC.“From the centre of the southern river-facing facade, a vaulted passage leads to the crypt chamber with a unique circumambulatory path around the grave platform. Above this stands the lofty tomb chamber roofed by a double dome. Stone medallions of numerous designs, incised plaster patterns including the sacred ‘swastika’, floral motifs on the wall surfaces adorn the structure,” it said.A conservation effort of this magnitude and complexity required to benefit from a wide spectrum of advice, and “over 60 independent peer reviews have been carried out since 2015,” Nanda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rahim-s-tomb-delhi-s-monument-of-love-gets-new-lease-of-life-after-six-year-conservation/story-eydTrpb6ygWAO9WdwGfiFP.html

Yogi, who viewed a presentation on the airport, said it would be a pride of India and would come up as a global brand. He said the airport would add to the development of industrial infrastructure, boost tourism, promote exports, ease air traffic and lead to creation of more jobs. He said the civil aviation sector is a means of making multi-dimensional progress that would lead to economic development. The Uttar Pradesh government has selected Zurich Airport International AG for the development of Jewar airport. Giving his nod to name, logo and design of the Jewar airport, Yogi said the state government would provide all possible help for its development. The logo of the new airport has the state bird Saras (crane) on it and its design has been prepared on the pattern of world-class airports in London, Moscow and Milan.

17-12-2020||Delhi||Can’t allow residential areas to become protest sites: Delhi HC on petition against sit-in outside CM Kejriwal’s house||Hearing a contempt plea against the protest outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence, the Delhi high court on Thursday said it cannot allow a residential colony to become a designated site for protest, Ramlila Maidan or Jantar Mantar. “There is no problem if you come, protest and then go away. But this is going on for 11 days. Once you set a precedent, anyone will come and squat there. If this is permitted for all times to come, then you know what is the state of certain areas, like Ramlila ground and Jantar Mantar, where squatting and protests are permitted? We cannot have that kind of situation in a residential colony,” the court said.It also said that right to protest is a fundamental right under the Constitution but it should not go to such an extent where their (protesters’) right to protest gets hampered.The plea was filed by the Civil Lines Residents Association against the protest outside Kejriwal’s residence on the grounds that it was blocking a road and causing inconvenience to the residents. The mayors of the three municipal corporations have been protesting outside Kejriwal’s residence seeking release of funds and clearance of alleged pending dues.The association has contended that the protest has been permitted in a residential area and roads leading there have been barricaded in violation of the high court’s earlier order of 2017 restricting dharnas in residential areas.The court observed that tents had come up in the area and there were news reports that the mayors were going to run their offices from there. The judge sought to know from the city police how offices could be run from there and also what arrangements were in place for the protesters to go about their daily routines.It said, “Public functionaries deal with all kinds of people. Today, it is one group of people who are protesting, the staff is protesting...But once a precedent is set, tomorrow, there will be another group of people protesting there and then you will come running,” the court said.The matter would be now heard on December 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/can-t-allow-residential-areas-to-become-protest-sites-delhi-hc-on-petition-against-sit-in-outside-cm-kejriwal-s-house/story-pRHTBa1ca5T92fKIkpBFOK.html

The authorities, a few months back, have put up warnings on roadsides near the accident-prone stretch alerting drivers to not shut engine or put on neutral gear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/one-injured-8-vehicles-damaged-in-multi-vehicle-pile-up-on-mumbai-bengaluru-highway/story-4EL8dEJd4k5eALQ0FFCg1K.html
17-12-2020||City||Madhya Pradesh: Four arrested for killing man by putting adhesive in his mouth, nose||Four persons including a minor were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly killing a man by first putting a heavy duty adhesive in his mouth and nose in a bid to suffocate him to death and then stabbing him. The crime was reported from Madhya Pradesh’s Morena district, 465 km north of Bhopal, police said. “Two brothers, 19, and 16, both residents of a village in Morena district, killed their maternal uncle, 22-year-old Girraj Kushwaha, on December 9. They had Brahmjeet Kushwaha, 21 and Dileep Kushwaha, 22, as their accomplices. Girraj’s body was recovered on December 12 near Pagara dam in Joura,” said Anurag Sujaniya, superintendent of police, Morena. The SP said, “Girraj was fond of a cousin of the accused. The family had fixed the girl’s marriage with Brahmjeet but Girraj threatened him not to marry the girl. Upset with Girraj, the accused decided to kill him.” “The minor, Brahmjeet and Dileep took Girraj to a house in Pachbegha area in Joura on December 9. They beat him up and later the two brothers put a heavy duty adhesive in his mouth after tying his hands and legs. Once the man fell unconscious, the accused stabbed him and threw him near the dam,” said Sujaniya. Police recovered two bikes, a knife and two empty tubes of the adhesive. The accused were produced before the court on Thursday which sent them to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/madhya-pradesh-four-arrested-for-killing-man-by-putting-adhesive-in-his-mouth-nose/story-Zdz8pw7TJuEC0GQzsLFbVP.html
17-12-2020||Pune||State government approves merger of 23 areas in Pune civic body||Days after the urban development department sought an impact report from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) regarding the inclusion of 23 areas – originally villages surrounding Pune – into Pune city limits, the state government has finally given its nod for the merger. Once these areas, which are newly emerged hotspots for real estate given the cheap land prices, are part of Pune Municipal Corporation limits, the city’s boundary will increase substantially from 331 square km to 485 square km. Minister for urban development Eknath Shinde on Tuesday signed an order, paving the way for the merger. Nationalist Congress Party’s city unit president and MLA Chetan Tupe while confirming the development said, that with the order in place, the merger of these areas into Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits will soon begin.“Minister Eknath Shinde has signed the proposal for merging 23 villages in the PMC. Deputy chief minister and Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar has been aggressive about merging these villages into the PMC limits. As the minister has given the nod, the Urban Development Department will make a public resolution for it by completing the administrative process soon,” said Tupe, who also heads the NCP city unit. These 34 areas were scheduled to merge in the city in 2014 though political controversy stopped their inclusion. In 2017, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government in the state finally facilitated merger of only 11 villages in the PMC limit and promised to merge, the other 23 villages in a phase-wise manner. The move of the merger assumes significance for the NCP and Congress given that these two parties have political control over these areas, which will help them during the 2022 civic polls. As the municipal elections are slated in early 2022, Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has expedited merger of these villages in PMC before the elections. A senior official from PMC said merging these areas into PMC is good. “It would help start proper development of these villages. Though they are part of the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), they did not have enough machinery to carry out the development process,” said the official requesting anonymity. This officer said that while taking the decision on the merger, the state government must give funds to the PMC to erect basis infrastructure like road, waterlines, drainage and electricity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-government-approves-merger-of-23-areas-in-pune-civic-body/story-CJj6EzX2l08ypmdOirLeZM.html
17-12-2020||Mumbai||HC decision on Metro car shed work ‘unfortunate’: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Thursday said the Bombay High Court’s decision to stay construction of the Metro car shed in Kanjurmarg here is “unfortunate”, and that the project is a matter of development of Mumbai and Maharashtra.Talking to reporters here, Raut launched a veiled attack on the BJP, accusing the opposition of creating hurdles in the development of Maharashtra as the party is not in power in the state, and said there was a “conspiracy” to not allow the MVA government to work in the interest of people.He, however, said Maharashtra or its people cannot be “troubled” for long.“No politician is going to construct his/her bungalow or farm house at the Kanjurmarg land. This is a matter of development of Mumbai, Maharashtra and eventually of the country. It is unfortunate if such a decision has come in this case,” the Rajya Sabha member said.The Bombay High Court on Wednesday stayed the order passed by Mumbai suburban district collector allotting 102 acres of salt pan land in Kanjurmarg area here for the construction of an integrated metro car shed.A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni also restrained the authorities from carrying out any construction work at the said land.The Centre and the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government are locked in a tussle over ownership of the land earmarked by the state for constructing the car shed depot which was earlier planned at Aarey Colony, a green belt in suburban Goregaon.The previous BJP-led government in the state had decided to construct the car shed for the Mumbai Metro line 3 at Aarey Colony, despite opposition from environmentalists and activists to the vast tree-cutting for the project.The present Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government -- comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress -- recently took a decision to shift the car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg.Raut said the previous Devendra Fadnavis government in the state was to construct a housing project for police and weaker sections on the Kanjurmarg site concerned.“That means the land belongs to the (state) government, isnt it?” he asked. “...but what has happened suddenly, it seems there is some conspiracy to see that the Maharashtra government is not allowed to carry out work in the interest of the people or development,” the Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson said.He said there are lakhs of other cases to which the judiciary should pay its attention.Referring to reports of a Sikh preacher committing suicide (in connection with farmers’ agitation), Raut said the Centre and judiciary should look into such matters.“People now have doubts in their minds whether such decisions (on car shed project) are coming because there is no BJP government in Maharashtra,” he alleged.After the HC’s decision, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday asked the state government to give up its “ego”.When asked about it, Raut quipped that the definition of “ego” needs to be checked now.Where is ego if the Aarey forest and animals there are saved by shifting the car shed project to Kanjurmarg? the Shiv Sena leader asked.“It (to save the forest and wildlife) is a national duty. It is the programme of the Centre to save tigers, jungle, birds and rivers. It is the programme of the Centre, of the Narendra Modi government,” he said.Despite the efforts to save the forest, the opposition in Maharashtra is “creating hurdles” in the work, which is not in the interest of Maharashtra and the people, he said.“The court should have understood this,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-decision-on-metro-car-shed-work-unfortunate-sanjay-raut/story-SNKgotZzjcRwRXZpjOtqoO.html

The incident took place near a post-mortem house falling under Bhagwan Bazar police station area. Police recovered the body soon after receiving information that the youth was lying in a pool of blood. The victim reportedly had head injuries that had bled profusely. A team of forensic experts, along with a dog squad, also reached the spot. Prince Kumar, son of former MLA late Ram Parvesh Rai, was allegedly shot from point blank range near post-mortem house, barely 300 metres from the Saran collectorate.

His shop was located near the residence of the district board president. Police are currently investigating the reason behind the murder.DSP Muneshwar Kumar Singh said that police recovered a live bullet from the spot while two cell phones and Rs 1000 in cash were recovered from the possession of the deceased.

17-12-2020||Chandigarh||PM’s ego stopping him from solving farmers’ issue despite deaths: Sukhbir||Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal and former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal joined followers of Baba Ram Singh at Nanaksar Gurdwara at Singhra village of Karnal district on Thursday to pay tributes to the religious leader who committed suicide at Singhu border in support of the farmers’ agitation. Baba Ram Singh, 65, shot himself in his car at Delhi’s Singhu border on Wednesday evening after accusing the Centre of insensitivity towards the farmers protesting against the three new farm laws for the past 22 days. Badal said, “Ram Singh ji was known for his lifelong contribution towards humanity. He had been visiting Delhi regularly and was in deep pain due to the insensitivity of the government towards the farmers. Nobody was listening to them so he took the extreme step.” Also read: ‘Protest a constitutional right but...’: Supreme Court hears plea seeking removal of protesting farmers from Delhi borders“I cannot understand why the ego of our Prime Minister is stopping him from solving this issue despite the supreme sacrifice of Baba Ram Singh and around 30 other farmers who lost their lives during this agitation,” the former deputy chief minister of Punjab said. He said that the farmers did not want the legislation but the Prime Minister and home minister were adamant and imposing it on them. The Shiromani Akali Dal, one of the oldest allies of the BJP, made a U-turn and snapped ties with the National Democratic Alliance in September with Harsimrat quitting as Union minister as protests picked up against the three farm laws that seek to liberalise the agriculture sector. The cremation of Baba Ram Singh will be held on Friday so that more followers can attend the last rites, gurdwara sources said. Heavy police deployment has been made in the village to deal with any untoward incident, Karnal deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Rajiv Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pm-s-ego-stopping-him-from-solving-farmers-issue-despite-deaths-sukhbir/story-o7z9p8eTR5FCa2N5ip3QeJ.html
17-12-2020||Patna||JD (U) to analyse poll setback, future outside Bihar at national meet, WB elections top agenda||Top leaders of the ruling JD(U) in Bihar will hold deliberations at the party’s two-day national executive meeting to be chaired by JD(U)’s national president Nitish Kumar, beginning December 26 in Patna.The party is likely to deliberate on its performance in recently concluded Assembly polls and mull on the ways and means to revive the party not only in Bihar but in other states as well. The national executive is also likely to take a call on whether the party would contest assembly elections in West Bengal. “The two-day meeting will deliberate on the party’s performance in Bihar as to what went wrong besides chalk out plans to revitalise the party and its workers,” said K C Tyagi, principal national general secretary of the JD(U).“The party is serious about expanding itself in other states too, so a decision to contest elections outside Bihar can also be taken during the meeting,” Tyagi added. Party leaders said it will also analyse the causes of its poor performance in assembly polls in Bihar.As part of its plan to regroup the party workers, party’s national president Nitish Kumar had started frequenting the party office and begun interaction with party workers and office-bearers.Last meeting of the JD(U) national executive was held on October 30, 2019 in New Delhi when Nitish Kumar was re-elected party’s national president. “The meeting will be attended by all national and state office-bearers and it has been organised at newly-constructed Karpoori Thakur Sabhaghar at the party office in Patna,” said JD(U)’s spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan. The JD(U) national executive has 60 members and at present it has units in 28 states. Party leaders, who didn’t wish to be quoted on record, said the national executive meeting becomes all the more important as this is the first time since 2005 that the JD (U) is playing a second fiddle to the BJP in the NDA government in Bihar. “So far, it has been the senior partner in 2005, 2010 and in 2017 when JD(U) and the BJP joined hands again,” said a party functionary. Also Read: Nitish Kumar government approves free coronavirus vaccine for all in BiharThe JD (U), which contested on 115 seats in the recently concluded assembly polls, could win only 43 seats as against 74 seats won by the BJP, which contested on 110 seats.

The LJP, which is part of the NDA at the centre, opted out of the alliance in Bihar and contested the polls independently. Party’s general secretary Afaque Ahmad Khan said that the party will contest West Bengal assembly polls and the meeting is likely to decide on the number of seats it will contest. The JD(U) had contested 50 seats in West Bengal in 2011 and two seats in alliance with the Congress and left in 2016, but fared badly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/jd-u-to-analyse-poll-setback-future-outside-bihar-at-national-meet-wb-elections-top-agenda/story-Gsk32setiX4Thax8pnLEnO.html

The jumbo, which was spotted by villagers around 5am on Wednesday, was finally rescued by the forest officials with help of an excavator around 12.30 noon after a rescue mission by the herd of the elephant had failed. The Tamar forest range officer Amarnath Bhagat said a herd of 35 elephants has been reported in Tamar forest range for the past three days. The herd was in Jiling Sereng forest Tuesday night looking for food in a paddy field. “While crossing a farm field in the village, one of the adult elephants fell into a 20-foot-deep well. The villagers said the well was almost dry. The herd tried to save their fellow jumbo by filling water into it but failed,” Bhagat said. He said, “As per the villagers, the elephants carried water by filling it into their trunks from a nearby pond and poured it into the well. The jumbos might have thought that their fellow may come out of the well if they filled it with water. Since the well was deep, they could only fill it partially. By the morning, they left for the forest, as villagers had started gathering.” Also Read: Jharkhand to ask Centre to revise MGNREGs minimum wageBhagat said as they were informed about the incident, a team of forest staff and excavator was rushed to the spot.

17-12-2020||Delhi||Cold spell continues in Delhi, minimum temperature at 5.3°C||Delhi woke up to a chilly morning on Thursday with the minimum temperature dipping to 5.3 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees below normal, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s Mausam app.The Capital had recorded a “cold day”, the third in a row on Wednesday, with maximum or day temperature of just 18.6 degrees Celsius, 4.6 degrees below normal.On December 14, Palam recorded “cold day” conditions with a maximum of 17 degrees C, 6 degrees below normal. And on Tuesday, both Safdarjung and Palam stations saw a “cold day”, recording a maximum temperature of 18.5 degrees Celsius, 5 degrees below normal, and 16.7 degrees Celsius, 7 degrees below normal, respectively.IMD scientists said Delhi has been reeling under a cold spell as it has recorded more than two “cold days” in a row now.There was no cold wave on Wednesday in Delhi as the minimum temperature was 5.8 degrees Celsius, which is 2.8 degrees below normal, but does not meet the cold wave criteria.“Cold day” to “severe cold day” conditions are likely in some pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, and parts of Delhi, north Rajasthan and West Uttar Pradesh during the next 24 hours, IMD said in its Wednesday bulletin. “Cold day”conditions are likely in isolated pockets over these regions during subsequent 24 hours also, it added.“Cold wave to severe cold wave” conditions are likely in some pockets over Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh during next three days and while “cold wave” conditions are also likely over Delhi and West Uttar Pradesh during next 2 days.IMD has warned that cold wave to severe cold conditions could have a number of serious impacts on health that shouldn’t be ignored. There is an increased likelihood of various illnesses like flu, stuffy nose or nosebleed, and shivering, which is the first sign of body losing heat. Prolonged exposure to extreme cold and can cause frostbite, which leads to the skin turns pale, hard and numb and eventually black blisters appear on exposed body parts such as fingers, toes, nose and or earlobes. Severe frostbite needs immediate medical attention and treatment.The impact-based warning issued by IMD for “cold wave” recommends that people wear insulated shoes, moisturise skin, increase vitamin C intake, limit outdoor activities, maintain ventilation while using heaters, avoid drinking alcohol as it reduces body heat etc.Some of those exposed to dense fog could also suffer health impacts. Dense fog contains particulate matter and other pollutants which can get lodged in the lungs, leading to episodes of wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. Those with asthma and bronchitis are particularly vulnerable.According to IMD a “cold day” or “severe cold day” is considered based on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees, and maximum temperature of 4.5 degree Celsius or 6.4 degree C below normal.A “cold wave” occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. “Cold wave” is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degree Celsius in the plains. Witnessing a “cold day” and “cold wave” together means the gap between day and night temperatures was lower than normal.“Many places in northwest India are experiencing cold wave and severe cold day together. We are expecting the cold spell to continue over Delhi and minimum temperature to hover around 4 to 5 degrees Celsius till December 19, following which a western disturbance is expected; it will cause clouding and relieve extremely cold conditions. Places which are recording cold to severe cold day conditions are experiencing an incursion of chilly air and uplifted fog, which is not allowing the day to warm up adequately,” explained Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.“There was heavy and widespread snowfall in the Western Himalayas from December 11 to 13 and then dense fog started being recorded in many places -- which has led to cold day conditions. This is also the time when temperature drops gradually as mid latitude winds pick up. Due to extremely chilly winds, we have issued an impact-based warning which tells people what to do during cold wave and cold day conditions,” added RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.Dense fog is likely over Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh during morning hours of Thursday and over Punjab and north Rajasthan during morning hours Thursday and Friday. Very dense fog is also very likely over Punjab and north Rajasthan during morning hours of Thursday.Meanwhile, under the influence of an easterly wave, scattered to fairly widespread rain/thundershowers very likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, Kerala, Mahe and Lakshadweep area during the next four days. Heavy rainfall is also likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal during December 16 to 19 and over Kerala and Mahe during December 17 and 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cold-spell-continues-in-delhi-minimum-temperature-at-5-3-c/story-yi2ihnE0N0SrofyWRFBbJO.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC grants protection to interfaith couple from UP||The Delhi high court on Wednesday granted protection to an interfaith couple from Uttar Pradesh, who fled to the national Capital fearing persecution, days after the new UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance 2020, commonly known as the ‘love jihad’ law, was passed.The couple has alleged that they were forced to leave their parental houses due to reports of harassment on interfaith couples. Justice Anu Malhotra, while granting protection, also directed the Delhi government to provide them a safe house in accordance with an earlier order of the Supreme Court.According to the plea, the 21-year-old Hindu woman met the 25-year-old Muslim man at a coaching centre in Shahjahanpur. They fell in love and wanted to get married under the Special Marriage Act, as they did not intend to convert. However, the parents and relatives of the woman opposed their alliance. The plea, filed through advocates Soutik Banerjee and Aakarsh Kamra, alleged that the woman’s parents and relatives tortured her physically and mentally. Fearing harassment, the couple reached Delhi on December 11 and contacted an NGO. Appearing for them, advocate Vrinda Grover said the couple sought protection from the Delhi government’s Social Welfare Department. However, they were turned away, which “jeopardises the right to life, liberty and privacy”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-grants-protection-to-interfaith-couple-from-up/story-cGE2zrpgfQxLjtFYBgEokJ.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: On walking past Old Delhi’s iconic Gali Jagat Cinema Wali||The grilles are shuttered, but the lobby can be seen through them: the ticket window, the board displaying the show timings and the ticket rates—32 rupees for Box.Some things become history, are forgotten and yet a little something remains. Like the Jagat Cinema in Old Delhi.Originally named Nishat, it used to be referred to as “Macchliwallon ka Talkies” because of its proximity to the fish market. Though it stopped screening films in 2004, the cinema building remains.The place lies mostly ignored, when it should be a draw for connoisseurs of single screens, especially those who like the grandeur of the old sprawling cinema houses, when these places were not just another outlet in a shopping mall but substantial buildings in their own right. This cold morning, the clear sunshine is streaming over the Jagat, its pink walls textured with the patina of several winters and summers. The large hollow frame on the building’s front may be the place where giant film posters would be displayed. The building is sandwiched by various small eateries. The grilled lobby has stray cats wandering like purposeless ghosts.Jagat screened some iconic Hindi movies, including Mughal-e-Azam in the 1960s. Another was Meena Kumar’s Pakeeza that ran for six months. A poetically inclined resident of the nearby Matia Mahal neighbourhood would come to see Pakeeza every day, travelling on a tonga with the women of the family. The entire party would wait for the song, Chalte Chalte, and then leave the theatre.Jagat must have had many more stories, but the one of the Pakeeza aficionados has stayed more than the others —it was told by author Ziya Us Salam in his book on Delhi’s cinemas.While the theatre has been long closed, its presence reins heavy in the area, so much so that it gives its name to the neighbourhood. Letter boxes in the houses and shops on an adjacent street, for instance, are marked with ‘Gali Jagat Cinema Wali’. This alley has another sight, too—that of a slotted window built on the side wall of the cinema building. It must be the box office for the cheap front-row stall. Standing by this window, you almost feel the presence of the clerk behind. Lost time suddenly feels within grasp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-on-walking-past-old-delhi-s-iconic-gali-jagat-cinema-wali/story-ujaKy5B6RwFowqrpYjsKaI.html

17-12-2020||City||Army veterans in Amritsar come out in support of protesting farmers, set to join stir on Delhi border||As many as 300 army veterans in Amritsar have extended their support to the farmers protesting on the Delhi borders for the last 21 days, with many of them set to join the agitation against the agriculture laws from Thursday. The ex-servicemen contributed Rs 4 lakh to send milk powder and other items to the Singhu border, which has emerged as an epicentre of the agitation. At least 55 of them, including three former colonels and eight junior commissioned officers (JCOs), have decided to join the protest on the Delhi border. A truckload of powdered milk and sanitary items will be dispatched from the city’s Dussehra ground on Thursday. The veterans said they would continue supporting the farmers, financially and otherwise, till their demands are met. They said they have been establishing contact with more veterans across Punjab to support to the farmers in the days to come. Col Gurmukh Singh (retired) said, “We started contacting the ex-servicemen who are in touch with us. We managed to contact around 300 ex-servicemen, including JCOs, naiks and havildars. All of them have contributed very generously. Earlier, we thought of sending 2,000 blankets to the farmers in view of the biting cold. But when we talked to farmer leaders, they sought milk powder and sanitary items.” He said, “Some people are trying to sabotage the farmers’ protest by calling them anti-nationals and pro-Khalistani. This is purely farmers’ agitation. Are the farmers of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, who have also been protesting at the Delhi borders also Khalistani sympathisers?” Col Sarabrinder Singh Sandhu (retired) said, “We are with the farmers who are the backbone of the country. We will continue extending our support to the farmers till the last day of the protest. The Centre should immediately scrap the three laws.” Colonels Sukhjinder Singh Dhillon, Kuldeep Singh Dhillon, Gajjan Singh Bajwa, Iqbal Singh Sandhu, and Major PS Hundal (all retired) are also leading the effort to support the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/army-veterans-in-amritsar-come-out-in-support-of-protesting-farmers-set-to-join-agitation-on-delhi-border/story-gC2xaSNAgxnvzhAbLwnNUJ.html
17-12-2020||Chandigarh||Depositing part compensation can’t be pre-condition for admitting plea in cheque bounce cases, rules HC||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that depositing a part of compensation cannot be made a pre-condition for entertaining a convict’s appeal for hearing in a cheque bounce case. The HC bench of Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill set aside the order of a Ludhiana court that had ordered that the appeal would be admitted provided 20 percent of the compensation amount was deposited. The appeal in the district sessions court was filed by one Sudarshan Kumar after his conviction under the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, by a judicial magistrate. The HC bench observed that even as the Negotiable Instruments Act could override provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), there is no such specific provision in it that could be interpreted saying that availing of right to appeal by a person convicted of an offence in cheque bounce case is subject to certain conditions. “The right to appeal against conviction is an invaluable statutory right vested upon a convict under the CrPC, which cannot be allowed to be defeated by imposing any condition. While giving a wider connotation to Article 21 of Constitution, it can even be said that depriving a convict of his right to appeal by imposing any condition for availing his statutory right to challenge conviction in a higher court would amount to depriving his liberty,” Justice Gill observed. The Section 148 of the Negotiable Instruments Act only vests an appellate court with the power to direct the appellant to deposit an amount not less than 20 percent of the compensation amount but under no circumstances the same can be interpreted to be a pre-condition for availing the right of appeal, the bench added. “Imposition of any condition at the time of suspending of sentence may be a different matter and the trial court may in its wisdom impose such a condition, failing which the order suspending sentence may be vacated,” the bench said, adding that a convict’s bail during the pendency of appeal may be cancelled upon failure of the appellant to comply with the direction of deposit of such amount. The court also clarified that under the Negotiable Instruments Act the compensation amount sought to be deposited by the court is required to be deposited within 60 days which may further be extended by another 30 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cheque-bounce-cases-depositing-part-compensation-can-t-be-pre-condition-for-entertaining-an-appeal-hc/story-edSeBu5LKB6zenfXNJYfOL.html
17-12-2020||City||Despite pandemic, runaway couples knock court doors for protection from kin in Ludhiana||Decked up in a flashy bridal attire and accessories, Sunita Rani, along with her husband Ram Prasad, awaits her turn at the district and sessions court where her petition seeking protection from their families is to come up for hearing. “We got married in a temple last week as my parents were against this match. They have threatened us of dire consequences. That’s why we need police protection,” says Sunita, 22. Her husband is also of the same age and the duo hails from Bihar. While marriage halls and event planners may be reeling under heavy losses due to drop in solemnisation of marriages in the wake of the pandemic, the courts are still a safe haven for runaway couples. Sunita and Ram Prasad are among 550 couples in Ludhiana who have knocked the doors of the court so far this year, apprehending threat to their lives from their kin for choosing their life partners. This number is significant at a time when the hearing of cases is highly restrictive. The numbers of runaway couples approaching court rose substantially post lockdown when courts resumed hearing of urgent cases. A court official said that due to huge influx of migrant population in Ludhiana, the number of runway couples is high here. As per court statistics, around 4,500 runway couples who eloped and married and were facing threats from families have been provided protection in the last five years. “Elopement cases are more in the migrant population as youngsters get married here with the partner of his/her choice, while their families are pressurising them to get married in their native village to the girl or boy of their choice and community,” said a court official. Advocate Rakesh Gandhi, who moved an application for protection to a runway couple last month, said in most cases, the threat is from the girl’s side, with the groom moving the petition. “Most couples are in their early twenties. The court first verifies if the couple has reached the legal age to get married. Pandemic or not, the number of runaway couples has always remained an all-time high in Ludhiana,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-pandemic-runaway-couples-knock-court-doors-for-protection-from-kin-in-ludhiana/story-0Uw8e0zPVKu520Duiekh6L.html

Complainant Krishan Lal Sharma, 48, who is the president of All India Sher-e-Punjab National Party, had contested the sarpanch elections against the accused, but had lost. Sharma stated that he was on his way to meet a friend when his car was intercepted. The accused had dragged him out of the car and thrashed him with sticks and iron rods. The assailants also allegedly vandalised the vehicle.The victim alleged that ahead of the polls, the accused had threatened him with bodily harm unless he backed out from contesting elections. In another incident, the sarpanch’s workers had been harassing a family in Sharma’s locality, and after he had helped them lodge a complaint with the commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal, the sarpanch again threatened him with dire consequences.ASI Jasveer Singh, who is investigating the case, said that initially, Krishan Lal Sharma was medically unfit to record his statement therefore they recorded his statement on Tuesday. A case, under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restrain), 506 (criminal intimidation), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), of the Indian Penal Code, was registered against the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-village-sarpanch-aides-booked-for-assaulting-rival/story-kB5jxh9ymrFh13I3rm4M8L.html
17-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police aims to integrate network of 3 lakh CCTV cameras to control crime in city||Come 2021, the city that never sleeps could also be in the list of cities considered to be among the safest as the Mumbai Police plans to have eyes on every street possible. The Mumbai Police’s plan envisages to integrate a system of nearly 3 lakh closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras to its existing network. The city police force which currently has 5,300 CCTVs in its network is scheduled to add 7,000 more soon. In addition, Mumbai Police wants to integrate its existing CCTV network with private and commercial stakeholders across the city to ensure the streets of Mumbai are safe, said senior police officers. As part of the plan, Mumbai Police started a project in November wherein they requested all major commercial establishments including shop owners, offices, hotels, community halls, religious places, and even residential societies to install CCTV cameras within a period of two months and warned to take legal action against those who refuse to abide by it. The deadline to install CCTVs end on January 7. “The plan is to have around 3 lakh digital eyes which would cover almost the entire city. We have planned this to ensure that crime rate goes down drastically,” said joint commissioner of police (law and order), Vishwas Nangre Patil. Commenting on the compatibility of the cameras that establishments will install and the CCTV network of the police force, Mumbai Police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police Chaitanya Siriprolu (operation) said, “Initially we thought of requesting establishments owners to install high-resolution cameras so that they would be compatible with the police’s monitoring system, but we dropped the plan as it could prove to be financially not viable for many.” Patil said the presence of existing CCTVs has proved to be an effective deterrent to prevent crime, and that it was a step forward to prevent crime in the city. “While all the private CCTVs will not be directly integrated to the police surveillance and monitoring system, which uses comparatively advanced technology and cameras, these additional private cameras will compliment the network that is already in place. It will not only act as a deterrent to criminals psychologically, but it will also help police officers identify criminals and will aid in post-incident investigations including collection of evidence,” he added. When asked about the punitive action against those who refuse to install a CCTV, Patil said, “If an establishment is located in a crime hot spot or accident-prone zone or is in a densely populated area, and the owner refuses to install a CCTV, we will first request him and make him understand the need for it. If the person still does not adhere to it, then action will be taken against them under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code. We did not want to forcefully impose this on everyone as we feel it will be unfair and hence have given them a period of two months which ends on January 7,” said Patil. The officer further said that it is important for people to realise that these cameras are going to benefit them, and hence public participation is essential. The existing CCTV network has a command and control centre at the police headquarters, and the CCTV feed can be viewed from the Mumbai traffic police control room. The regional additional and deputy commissioners too can keep a watch on the CCTV feed. Local police stations also have access to the feed of cameras installed in their jurisdiction.“The Mumbai Police gathered information on the blind spots from various police stations. Now new cameras will be installed on arterial roads, slums to monitor suspicious activities. Some cameras will also be installed at key spots on the coastline to beef up surveillance,” a senior police officer said.Home minister Anil Deshmukh had, in February 2020, informed that the government will amend the current rules and make installation of CCTV cameras mandatory in every new building coming up in the state. The government will also connect the feed of such CCTV cameras with police’s existing network. BOXNikhil Banker, secretary, Marine Drive Residents Association Group (MDRAG), said, “There are several government CCTV cameras which are not working, and despite several complaints nothing has been done. First, they should bring the existing system in order before asking citizens or commercial establishments to install CCTV cameras. They don’t want to improve themselves and just want to enforce everything on citizens.”They should increase the number of CCTV cameras. Main by-lanes should be covered by government cameras. “Why should resident associations or people of the area bear the expenses? Citizens already pay taxes, and making them bear this additional expense would not be fair,” Banker said.He added that if citizens are voluntarily coming forward and helping the police, then that’s not a problem, but it should not be imposed forcefully. “Instead of asking citizens and traders to install CCTVs why not ask MPs and MLAs to shell out funds and get the cameras installed,” said Banker adding, there should be some kind of exchange of dialogue or discussion between all the stakeholders before the police introduces such plans.“I appreciate the noble thought, but is should not be a compulsion. It should not be enforced without taking people into the confidence,” Banker said.Viren Shah, president of Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association which has nearly 3 lakh shopkeepers as its members, said, “We understand the importance of having CCTVs and also encourage our shop owners to install them. But shops and establishments owners should not be pressurised to install CCTVs. We, along with the police, can put efforts together to ensure that maximum areas are covered. If any places are left, then help of elected public representatives can be taken or NGOs can be roped in to install CCTVs or help can be sought from private sponsors or civic authority. Many of our establishments already linked their CCTVs with local police stations and are helping them. But if any individual shop owner or establishment does not install camera then he/she cannot be punished.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-aims-to-integrate-network-of-3-lakh-cctv-cameras-to-control-crime-in-city/story-UyJHPgOysbN71rwzwMkjNI.html

17-12-2020||Mumbai||HC stay on Mumbai Metro car shed will hit 4 Metro lines||The Bombay high court’s (HC) interim order on Wednesday to stay the transfer of the 102-acre plot at Kanjurmarg to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for the Metro car shed will prove to be a roadblock not only for Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz), but also Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli) works. While more than 60% of Metro-3 civil works have been completed, the MMRDA has completed around 20% civil construction works on Metro-6, officials said. The authority was planning to build a common car shed for these two corridors and also integrate the under-construction Metro-4 (Wadala-Kasarwadavli) and proposed line 14 (Kanjurmarg-Badlapur), effectively making it Mumbai’s ‘transit hub’. A senior official from MMRDA, requesting anonymity, said, “While the state was considering a plot in Pahadi-Goregaon too for Metro-6 depot, there are legal issues there. The Kanjurmarg plot was considered the most feasible to integrate all lines.” Metro-3 has already seen a cost escalation of ₹11,000 crore and is now pegged at ₹32,000 crore, while Metro-6 is pegged at a cost of ₹6,716 crore. While the MMRDA is also looking at Mogharpada to build a depot for line 4, it is facing entitlement issues there too. According to a report from the Manoj Saunik committee, appointed by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to look at alternative plots for Metro-3 depot, the per-day delay in executing Metro-3 costs around ₹5.87 crore. A delay in operation by 2.5 years would work out to ₹5,356 crore, while a delay of four years would mean another ₹8,570 crore. Also, the Metro authorities have stated that construction of the car depot would require a minimum of two years. One phase of Metro-3 was to be originally operational by December 2021. The official also said the increasing delay in allotting land for Metro-3 car shed will majorly impact the schedule of the project, which is at a crucial stage. On Wednesday, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted, “Hon’ble HC has granted a stay to Kanjurmarg work. We await the detailed written order to decide the future course of action.” He further said, “This land is crucial for Metro Line 6, 4 and 14, apart from 3, as it will save almost ₹5500 crores of Govt and be a nodal point for 1 crore citizens (sic).” RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, however, did not comment on the impact of the order at a press conference in Wadala on Wednesday evening. He said, “We are waiting for the detailed order.” The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was scathing in its remarks on the state government’s decision. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said the MVA government’s decision to shift the car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg was only to satisfy their ego. “Be it the HC, Supreme Court or the green tribunal - all had given a go-ahead for the plan and the state had already spent ₹100 crore at Aarey. The BJP government had also considered the Kanjurmarg plot, but we knew that it was in dispute. The HC’s decision is an embarrassment for the state government.” He also took a jibe at Aaditya Thackeray’s tweet, saying young leaders must read reports before tweeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-stay-on-mumbai-metro-car-shed-will-hit-4-metro-lines/story-APj2uW7SYpmyOrSBNiayhI.html

According to traffic police, some workshop owners used to repair vehicles on roadsides, which resulted in bottlenecks.Some shopkeepers had also encroached on the roadsides, which the traffic police have removed.Traffic police have also suggested a ramp for vehicles that are going towards Delhi Road. Rahut Kumar, a NHAI official, said they will discuss the issue with higher authorities about the correction.Sanjay Talwar, Congress MLA from Ludhiana East, wrote to the deputy commissioner about the suggestions on Wednesday. The MLA said that the traffic going towards Delhi Road from Jalandhar Road crosses Samrala Chowk, and the elevated road from Tajpur Road reaches Sherpur Chowk, and in between there is no way to reach the elevated road.

17-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: CR to start AC local services between CSMT and Kalyan stations||Passengers will be able to travel by air-conditioned (AC) local train services between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Kalyan railway stations from Thursday. Central Railway (CR) will be operating 10 AC local trains on the slow corridor of its mainline. Presently, local train services are operational only for people working in essential services and specially-abled and cancer patients. Women commuters and lawyers were also allowed to commute during a stipulated time.The first AC local train service will depart from Kurla at 5.42am and will reach CSMT at 6.12am. Five AC train services will be operated during peak hours including three in the morning and two in the evening. The last AC local train service will be operated from CSMT towards Kurla railway station at 11.25pm. AC trains will operate between Kurla-CSMT, CSMT-Dombivli, and CSMT-Kalyan railway station. “The trains will be operated between Monday and Saturday. The trains are being operated by replacement on the current operating trains,” said a senior CR official. The fares of AC local train are 1.3 times higher than the fare of normal local trains. One-way ticket journey between CSMT to Dadar will cost ₹65. CSMT to Kurla will cost ₹125, CSMT to Thane will cost ₹180 and CSMT to Kalyan will cost ₹210. Passengers can also be get monthly AC train passes.Passenger associations have welcomed the move to operate AC local train services on CR mainline but have asked the railways to consider introducing AC trains as new services and not replacement of regular local trains. “After local trains resume for all, the replacement of train services will be a huge problem for regular passengers.

AAP MLA and state kisan wing president Kultar Singh Sandhwan along with other leaders visited Gajjan Singh’s village Khatran in Samrala. Terming him a martyr of the movement, AAP leaders slammed the Union government for destroying the farming sector by introducing the three farm laws. “Prime minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government is harassing farmers due to its stubbornness, which is forcing millions of farmers across the country to sleep on roads amid cold weather. The farmers of Punjab, who have fed the whole country, are being mistreated,” said Sandhwan. He said calling peacefully protesting farmers extremists and anti-national had “exhibited the mental bankruptcy of the BJP”. He said PM Modi should address this issue by holding talks with farmers sitting on the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/aap-gives-2-lakh-aid-to-deceased-ludhiana-farmer-s-family/story-uciIAdZLVbyFi8v6zazsQK.html

17-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro car shed: Activists say political circus will affect environment, citizens||Following the Bombay high court’s (HC) stay on the transfer of land at Kanjurmarg to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for the construction of a Metro car shed, environment activists in the city said political slugfest over the matter was delaying the Metro project further. On Wednesday the Bombay HC after hearing a petition by the Central government passed an interim order staying the transfer of 102-acre land for the proposed car shed. “The stay will delay the work on not just the Metro-3 connecting Colaba, Bandra and SEEPZ, but also on Metro-6 connecting Lokhandwala to Kanjurmarg,” said Stalin D, director of Vanashakti, a non-government organisation who petitioned to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), HC and the Supreme Court to move the Metro car shed out of Aarey Milk Colony.Architect and activist Nitin Killawala said, “The intervention by the Central government and the high court is unfortunate. This 102-acre land was always the spot for a car shed for Metro line 6, so why has the question of ownership arisen only now?” In October, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government announced the relocation of the controversial Metro-3 car shed out of Aarey Milk Colony to Kanjurmarg where the car shed for Metro-6 line was situated. The car shed was to be used for Metro lines 4 (Wadala-Kasarwadavali) and 14 (Kanjurmarg-Badlapur). “Combining the metro yards and making a common car shed for two or three lines leads to optimisation of space. With this stay, work on all lines will suffer,” Killawala added. Last year, the then government led by Devendra Fadnavis, faced severe criticism and protests from environmentalists over its move to construct the car shed at Aarey Milk Colony. The Shiv Sena had taken the matter up and promised to reverse the decision in its election manifesto. “The matter is not restricted to Aarey anymore, but has turned into a political slugfest between the state and the Central government where environment is the casualty,” Stalin added. “This is a needless intervention over ownership of the land when there are orders dating to 2018 stating that the land belongs to the state government. The delay in the project will affect the citizens,” said Zoru Bhathena, activist and one of the petitioners before SC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-car-shed-activists-say-political-circus-will-affect-environment-citizens/story-wUXNDXtOjamXkfCHJyNkwN.html
17-12-2020||Chandigarh||Medics in Ludhiana worried about public health as farmers’ protest enters Day 21||With mercury witnessing a record decline, the Ludhiana based doctors visiting Singhu and Tikri borders expressed concern over harsh climatic conditions that could trigger health issues among the protesting farmers.The cold weather could prove detrimental for elderly protestors and there could be a rise in cases of strokes and heart attacks, say the doctors.The delegation of doctors, who held medical check-up camps at the protest site recently, expressed their concern over the impending public health problems which will come to light when the protest ends.The doctors said that open defecation could lead to fungal infections. Besides, many farmers have not taken a bath for days due to the absence of provisions, which could lead to skin allergies including scabies.While expressing concern, Dr Gaurav Sachdeva, senior vice-president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Ludhiana, who organised a medical check-up camp on December 9, said, “The protest may appear impressive but life at the site is not easy. Imagine sitting in the middle of the road with a few quilts and makeshift tents for over 20 days.”“ The elderly are a vulnerable group. Our job is to save lives, so I would urge the government to concede to the demands of protesting farmers as many of them have lost their lives at the protest site already,” he added.Two Ludhiana farmers lose life at protest siteGajjan Singh, 60, of Khatra village and Bhag Singh, 65, of Baddowal village, died at the protest site due to heart attack recently.Dr Charanpreet Singh, a gastroenterologist, who along with a group of doctors carried out check-ups at Singhu border on December 13, said that there are many such farmers and their relatives who had forgotten to carry their hypertension and diabetes medicines. Some people have exhausted their medical stock. Many vulnerable groups are suffering from underlying health issues and need care.”Dr Arun Mitra, ENT specialist, and senior vice-president, Indian Doctors for Peace and Development (IDPD), who held a camp on December 10, said, “Such weather could trigger cough and cold. Besides, fog causes breathing problems among the elderly.”“It is sad to see that the government is not bothered about the plight of the farmers, who have been sitting on the road in this bone-chilling weather for over 20 days. Nearly 20 farmers have died so far at the protest site. The government should show humanity and scrap the three laws,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/medics-worried-about-public-health-as-farmers-protest-enters-day-21/story-icVosfOm10HUyWvQIyRxQK.html

17-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC initiates drive to put a leash on stray dog menace||On receiving regular complaints the growing menace of stray dogs in public parks, the municipal corporation (MC) initiated a drive to free the public from the menace. Apart from sterilizing the stray dogs, the MC will also take steps to prevent their entry into the parks.The drive, undertaken on the directions of mayor Balkar Sandhu after he received complaints from the public, was initiated from Rose Garden on Tuesday and will be carried forward to other major parks, including Rakh Bagh, Mini Rose Garden, Leisure Valley, Sarabha Nagar, etc. in the first phase. The MC team caught four dogs from Rose garden on the first day of the drive and took them to the animal birth control centre for sterilization.The officials said that stray dogs create a nuisance for people who go to the park, especially the ones who go for jogging/running, as stray dogs attack them when they run.Suraj Nayyar, a resident of Maya Nagar, said, “I, along with my three friends, go for a morning walk at the Rose Garden. Stray dogs make it tough for the residents to run or jog. People cannot leave their children to play in the open as they fear that the dogs might attack them. The MC should shift the stray dogs from the public parks, and an extensive drive should be held for the same.”Dilpreet Singh, a resident of Dugri area, Phase 2, said, “Rather than only focusing on major parks, the MC should take up the drive in all parks as stray dog menace has been troubling residents all over. Not only children but at times adults also refrain from entering the parks as a large number of dogs roam there.”Dr Harbans Dhalla, senior veterinary officer, MC, said, “The drive has been initiated. and the MC team will cover all major public parks in the first phase. As per the norms, the MC cannot displace the dogs. They will be left at the same places from where they have been lifted, but this will decrease the number of dogs eventually. Efforts are also being made to stop the entry of dogs in the parks.” MC appeals to residents to stop feeding stray dogs in parksDr Dhalla said, “The residents should also understand their responsibility and should not feed stray dogs in public parks, as it will add to the problem and the visitors have to bear the brunt. The stray dogs do not leave the place where they are fed, and this can take a toll on the public. We are not stopping residents from feeding the dogs but if they want to feed the stray dogs, they should do it in their localities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mc-initiates-drive-to-put-a-leash-on-stray-dog-menace/story-KagJdc6KGrxlKyd19uOofI.html

17-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Monorail commissions rake rebuilt using local spare parts||Two years after taking over the operations of Mumbai Monorail, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) on Wednesday commissioned a rake, rebuilt by sourcing close to 213 spare parts from local vendors in Mumbai, Pune and Chennai.MMRDA rebuilt the train at a cost of ₹8 crore and also sought the help of professors from the Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) and Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) for testing and commissioning the train. Officials said that sourcing the spare parts was a major challenge as the trains were originally manufactured and assembled in Malaysia, and MMRDA did not have any technical know-how of the spare parts. Most of the spare part vendors were also based in Germany, Korea and Canada. MMRDA is looking at operationalising one more train by the next week to improve the frequency from 30-35 mins currently to around 18 minutes. This means the Mumbai Monorail will operate with a total of seven trains from next week. “Though we had 10 trains from the contractor, two were completely destroyed by the ex-contractors and one train was burnt in an accident. But we successfully refurbished two trains with a cost saving of about 74% when compared to foreign vendors,” said RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA. The authority has also invited bids to procure 10 additional rakes and is looking at getting more response from Indian companies. “Apart from sourcing indigenous spare parts vendors, we also had an in-house team for fitment and assembly of the parts,” said DLN Murthy, chief operating officer, Mumbai Monorail. The 19km corridor from Chembur to Sant Gadge Maharaj Chowk was fully operationalised from March 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-monorail-commissions-rake-rebuilt-using-local-spare-parts/story-aL9zeW6aFbgsdR7GgZ25mI.html
17-12-2020||Mumbai||Centre requests Maharashtra to conduct techno-economic feasibility study before integrating Metro-3 and Metro-6 lines||Amid shifting the Metro car shed to Kanjurmarg getting stuck in a legal tangle, the Centre requested the Maharashtra government to conduct a techno-economic feasibility study before taking a decision on integrating Metro-3 and Metro-6 lines.The letter was written by Durga Shanker Mishra, secretary, Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, on December 1. He is also the chairman of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRCL), a joint venture company with equal participation of both the state and Central government. MMRCL is also the nodal agency responsible for implementing Metro-3 project.In his letter to chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, Mishra also expressed his concern saying that the integration move may create huge operational difficulties and additional expenditure.Ranjit Singh Deol, the managing director of MMRCL, is yet to respond on this.“You will further appreciate that Metro projects are designed for 100 to 150 years and it is the concern of my ministry that the way integration of line-3 and line-6 is being planned may create huge operational difficulties for both the Metro lines within five to seven years after commencement of operation. This is not desirable for such cost intensive project like Metro. It may be detrimental to the public interest,” stated the letter, a copy of which is with HT.“In view of large and long term implications, it is recommended and requested that the Government of Maharashtra (GoM) should conduct a techno-economic feasibility study of proposed shifting of depot before going for preparing a detailed project report as has presently been decided by GoM,” it added further.“We have received the letter very recently. A detailed discussion on Centre’s request is yet to be held,” said a senior official from the state revenue department.The state government in October decided to scrap the Metro car shed at Aarey Milk Colony and shift it to Kanjurmarg. It has also decided to integrate Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) and Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli) line.Mishra, in his letter, has cautioned that the integration will bring severe implication on train operation and capacity utilisation of both the lines due to mixing of operation of line-3 and line-6. Trains on line-3 which will be dispatched from Kanjurmarg depot have to cross over both the operational lines of line-6 to reach the network of line-3 leading to operational bottlenecks on both the lines.In Washington DC (United States) a similar arrangement was done which is presently affecting the line capacity of both the lines. There are a number of example on Indian Railways eg. MEMU car shed at Jajha where dispatching and receiving of MEMU rakes is a big congestion problem due to wrong planning leading to under-utilisation of maintenance facilities,” quoted the letter.The move is likely to delay the project and may lead to cost and time overrun. Already executed contracts would have to be deferred which may have huge financial implications on account of escalation. The consent of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which is providing bilateral financial assistance to this project, would be necessary so as to ensure that there is no problem in terms of funding, else the progress will be impacted adversely.Another official said the state government will decide its next course of action only after receiving the written order of the Bombay high court on Kanjurmarg plot. “We have yet to receive the order of the high court. Once received, it will be discussed thoroughly with legal experts and further decision will be taken,” said the official.Congress questions BJP govt’s moveThe Congress on Wednesday questioned the BJP government’s decision on constructing car shed in Kanjurmarg. Sachin Sawant, state Congress’ general secretary, said the then government under Devendra Fadnavis had allotted the Kanjurmarg plot for Metro-6. “If Metro-3 car shed cannot be built in that area, then how can Metro-6 car shed be built there? Fadnavis must answer this question,” Sawant said. He also said that the land in question belongs to the state government since 1906 and the salt department could never prove its ownership. “In the past one year, it has become clear that the BJP is deliberately trying to hamper development works in the state,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/centre-requests-maharashtra-to-conduct-techno-economic-feasibility-study-before-integrating-metro-3-and-metro-6-lines/story-MSB2rXECuqu61zs37lVxPP.html

He had to walk nearly 2km to reach the police station for lodging an FIR.The victim has been identified as Gurmeet Singh, 40, of Tajpur Road, Raikot. He is the son-in-law of Raikot Mahila Congress president Balwinder Kaur.Gurmeet told the police that he had come to Ludhiana for the service of his car. However, due to the night curfew, he decided to stay in the city. He parked his car outside a taxi stand near the bus stand. At around 2am, two men posing as farm labourers knocked on his windowpane and said they were in urgent need to reach Ahmadgarh and pleaded Gurmeet to take them.Gurmeet agreed and the men sat in the car. As they had moved only a few meters, three more men standing on the road asked for lift. The first two accused then told Gurmeet that they were also farm labourers and insisted him to allow them to sit in the car.The victim added that when they reached near Jagrera Road near Pohir, two of the accused asked him to stop for a while saying they were feeling nauseated.“I stopped the car on the roadside and two accused came out to vomit. However, the other three miscreants overpowered me and pushed me out of the car. After this, all five fled with my car, which had my mobile phone and wallet too,” said Gurmeet.He added, “I reached Ahmedgarh police station after walking for 2km, but the cops there asked me to go to Dehlon police station for lodging the FIR, as the crime spot lied in the latter’s jurisdiction. The cops also denied me a cellphone to call my family, and blanket, so I waited till the morning. I went to a gurdwara and borrowed a phone from a devotee and informed my family.”When he finally got to Dehlon police station and lodged an FIR, the police scanned the CCTVs and traced the car, which had crossed Raikot around 3am. If the Ahmadgarh police would have taken timely action, the accused could have been caught.ASI Baljeet Singh said a case has been registered against the unidentified accused under sections 379-B and 34 of the IPC. A hunt is on for the arrest of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-leader-s-son-in-law-carjacked-in-ludhiana/story-cvudZO9ebpCXt0HKm6gTyL.html
17-12-2020||City||National Clean Air Programme: Ludhiana MC to restart mechanical sweeping||With the deteriorating air quality in the industrial hub becoming a cause for concern for authorities and residents alike, a slew of government departments have joined hands with the civic body under the National Clean Air Programme. Under the programme, the municipal corporation (MC), Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), forest department and industries department have been brought under one roof. Since the Union government has sanctioned Rs 26 crore for the city under the national clean air programme (NCAP), cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu conducted a meeting with officials of different departments at the MC’s Zone D office on Wednesday and directed them to collectively prepare detailed project reports (DPRs) regarding measures taken to reduce pollution. Mayor Balkar Singh Sidhu, MC commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal and senior officials from other departments were in attendance. The officials said that with Ludhiana, being an industrial hub with over 90,000 industrial units and thousands of vehicles plying on city roads, is one of the nine non-attainment cities (areas with air quality worse than national ambient air quality standards) in Punjab. The city’s air quality index has surpassed 300 and ventured into the ‘very poor category’ on numerous occasions, particularly, when stubble burning was at an all-time high or during Diwali. Doctors say the poor air quality has led to breathing discomfort among people with asthma, heart and lung diseases. It has been decided that the MC will restart mechanical sweeping of roads to reduce the quantity of particulate matter and dust in the air. Officials said the civic body will commence trials of mechanical sweeping this week. Funds allocated under the NCAP will be used to purchase the machine. The project was put on hold in 2018 after objections were raised on the working of the company and payment of bills. Similarly, many other points were discussed, including installation of intelligent traffic lights, timely repair of potholes and stubble burning.Apart from the four monitoring stations being installed by PPCB, the MC has also proposed to install 15 more environmental monitoring stations in the city. Currently, only one monitoring station is operational in Punjab Agricultural University (PAU). Eight screens will also be installed by PPCB at different points to display the pollution levels in the city. PPCB superintending engineer Sandeep Bahl said a source apportionment and emission inventory study was done in the past and as per the study, road dust contributes to 28% of the air pollution, bio-mass burning 18%, vehicular pollution 16% and industrial pollution 35% to the total air pollution. As per the 15th finance commission, funds have been allocated to urban local bodies for improvement of air quality and under this programme, Rs 52 crore has been allocated to Ludhiana city, of which Rs 26 crore will be sanctioned and released to the MC, said Bahl. Ashu said all the departments have been directed to work on this project collectively and residents have been urged to support the administration. “We aim to reduce the air pollution in the city and a road map is being made for the same. All the departments will submit their reports in a week or two, following which we will start working on ground level and regular review meetings will be held to increase efficiency,” said Ashu. With the civic body working to establish micro forests alongside Buddha Nullah to increase green cover in the city, the forest department officials have also been directed to establish micro forests within the city. Ashu said that till now the focus of the forest department was on areas outside the MC limits but now authorities have been directed to chalk out a plan to increase green cover in the city. With thousands of diesel auto rickshaws plying on city roads causing air pollution, it has been decided to prepare a new report to phase out the diesel auto rickshaws and introduce e-rickshaws in the city. Ashu said different departments including the Regional Transport Authority and traffic police have been directed to prepare the report in two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/national-clean-air-programme-ludhiana-mc-to-restart-mechanical-sweeping/story-UAzsMggPAUgwLaas27ZcFN.html
17-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Activist withdraws plea against diversion of forests land, work at Bandra-Versova Sea Link may resume||Activist Zoru Bhathena on Wednesday withdrew his application opposing diversion of about 30,000 square meters of mangrove forest for the construction of Bandra-Versova Sea Link, thus paving the way for the project proponent, Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) to begin work on the important transportation project.Bhathena’s counsel advocate Ronita Bhattacharya agreed to withdraw his application after the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni opined that it had become infructuous given January 25 order of the ministry of environment and forests and climate change (MoEF&CC), correcting the area from which mangroves were permitted to be cut - from earlier 150 square meters to 1,500 square meters.Bhathena had moved HC opposing the petition filed by MSRDC, seeking HC’s permission for felling 1,585 mangrove trees for the construction of Bandra-Versova Sea Link.He had complained that there were discrepancies in different permissions granted for the project, making it difficult to gauge the exact mangrove area likely to be affected by the project and it showed the arbitrariness and lack of proper application of mind in deciding the proposal by MoEF&CC.Discarding his objections, on February 8, 2019, HC had granted MSRDC permission to cut 1,585 mangrove trees on the ground that the project was of vital importance for the city and the permissions were subject to a condition to plant 13,332 mangrove trees at Charkop, to compensate the environmental loss.Bhathena had then carried the matter to the Apex court which has remanded the matter back to HC for fresh consideration.Acting on his plea, HC had on September 20, 2019, directed MoEF&CC to explain the discrepancies in two permissions granted for the sea link - while the Coastal Regulation Zone clearance stated that there will be permanent loss of mangroves on 150 square meters and temporary loss on 50 square meters, the permission granted under provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, talked of diverting 2.997 hectares - about 30,000 square meters of mangrove forest for the project, and permitted cutting of 1,585 mangroves.In this backdrop, HC had on September 20, 2019, restrained MSRDC from cutting any mangroves, except from the 200 square meters area required for construction of the 10 pillars of the sea link.On Wednesday, HC felt that the please had become infructuous, given the January 2020 MoEF&CC order. Bhattacharya then urged the court to allow her to file a fresh plea to challenge the MoEF&CC order within two weeks or so.She urged HC to continue September 20, 2019, in the meantime, expressing apprehension that MSRDC would divert forest area of 30,000 square meters taking advantage of the CR-Z clearance.HC granted her liberty to file a fresh plea but refused to continue the interim order.Bandra-Versova Sea Link forms part of the larger Coastal Road project of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and is being proposed to ease traffic congestion on SV Road and Western Express Highway. It is also expected to cut the travel time from south Mumbai to the airport.Bandra Versova Sea Link will take the Coastal Road forward from Bandra-end of the Worli Bandra Sea Link and will have three connectors at Carter Road in Bandra, Juhu Koliwada and Versova, which will enable residents of these localities to use the entire sea link conveniently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-activist-withdraws-plea-against-diversion-of-forests-land-work-at-bandra-versova-sea-link-may-resume/story-8sjkbO2wffnQQZheKxvo3I.html
17-12-2020||Mumbai||Two girls from Pune run ‘sugar class’ in Bhiwandi for migrant workers’ children||Eleven-year-old Divija Darekar’s visit to her sugarcane farm at Bhokari village in Padgha, Bhiwandi turned her into a teacher of 20 children of migrant workers who are deprived of primary education as they keep migrating with their parents for livelihood. Never in her dream had Divija thought that she would take up teaching and get attached to her students so well. She now plans to carry forward this initiative in future too. Divija, a resident of Pune, came to the sugarcane farm with her parents as her school was not running due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A student of Class 5, she used to interact with the migrant children at the 14-acre sprawling farm. These children used to wander in the farm with their parents all day.As soon as she learned that these children were deprived of basic education, she started teaching them. Later, she took help from her 14-year-old friend Sejal Pawar, a student of Class 9. Sejal too started to take classes with her and together, they named the teaching sessions as sakhar shala or sugar class.The young duo used to teach the group of children aged between three to 13 for two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening. The teaching and learning process comprise of basic learning such as alphabets, numbers and crafts and paintings. The duo also instructed the children to do stone painting, drawing, colouring, mud modelling and physical exercises. They also explained the importance of cleanliness and hygiene, health care and education to the children.“I used to play with them initially, and during my interaction with them I learned that they are deprived of basic education. I decided to teach them. When I began with it, I realised I would need help from one more person to plan the sessions. I called up my friend Sejal from Pune who joined me. Then we planned each day and taught the children,” said Divija, who aspires to be an IAS officer in future.In one of the classes, the duo asked each student to introduce themselves in front of others and mention their dream career. “Some students said they want be police personnel while some said they want to be doctor. This means they do have dreams but they lack direction. We are trying to be the direction for them,” added Divija.“The learning process was not only beneficial for them but also for us as we could revise all our previous lessons. When Divija asked me to join, I was so excited and joined her right away,” said Sejal.Chetan Pawar, 16, brother of Savita Pawar, a three-year-old student, said, “I am in Class 10 and used to go to school in Malegaon. I always wanted my sister also to get education as she was deprived of it due to migration. Sakhar shala motivated her a lot and she now tells me that she want to go to school. I will try my best to help her out.” As the young duo’s sakhar Shala gained popularity on social media, it also gained attention of Vikas Shankar Kharage, principal secretary to the chief minister, and sugar commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, who appreciated the initiative.“The principal secretary then contacted the Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Bhiwandi and arranged a health check-up camp for the migrant workers and their children and also arranged for an educational session where they were taught about cons of child marriage, importance of health care and primary education,” said Ashwini Darekar, 40, mother of Divija and a social activist from Pune.Although the teaching sessions are not being conducted now, the migrant children make sure they learn on a daily basis and send videos and photos to Divija and Sejal.“We want to teach more such children in future and we will take this up for all kinds of migrant children who are deprived of education,” added Divija.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-girls-from-pune-run-sugar-class-in-bhiwandi-for-migrant-workers-children/story-c2ZXL65CQptRCdKYjTbPiI.html

She said their party was in touch with MLAs, both Independents as well as from the JJP. Selja was addressing a press conference in Ambala City after inaugurating the election office of party’s mayoral candidate Meena Aggarwal. “Independents and JJP MLAs should think about supporting the Congress as they are the ones who won on the anti-BJP narrative and now, they are in the government. I also want the like-minded lawmakers from the BJP to decide where to stand and whom to support,” she said while responding to a question on destabilisation in the government amid the farmers’ agitation. Selja said it was unfortunate that farmers had to leave their farms and sit on roads to press for their demands. On ‘unhappiness’ among local party workers over ticket allocation, the Congress’ Haryana chief said they should not leave and stick with the party’s ideology. “Even I was denied ticket once, but it is a normal process,” she said. Selja also mentioned the development projects carried out by the Congress government while in power in Ambala. “But in the regime of the BJP government, Ambala’s development work has been stalled,” she added. Meanwhile, returning officer-cum-SDM Sachin Gupta said total six nominations were filed on the last day for the Ambala’s mayor seat. BJP’s Vandana Sharma, Jan Chetna Party’s Shakti Rani Sharma, BSP’s Jolly and three Independents — Neena Sharma, Shubhangi Malik and Veena Dhall — have filed their papers at the ADC office, Gupta said in a statement. He further said that 107 candidates from different parties and wards also filed their nominations to the designated AROs. On Thursday, scrutiny of the nomination papers will be done and Friday will be the last day to withdraw nominations. Selja also visited Panchkula and addressed the workers at the party’s poll office in Sector 14.Taking a dig at the BJP, she said, “You can’t deceive people for long. The dual face of the BJP has been exposed now and people are waiting to teach them a lesson. Panchkula MC polls would reflect the common man’s mood against the BJP for its anti-people policies.” Selja said that Panchkula’s mayoral candidate Upinder had implemented numerous development projects in her MC limits and would return with record margin win.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/like-minded-mlas-from-bjp-should-pick-a-side-selja/story-ShqZD9NuKJjTARX9saNw0O.html
17-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Great-grandmother donates kidney to save 4-year-old great-granddaughter||A 73-year-old great-grandmother saved the life to her four-year-old great-granddaughter by donating one of her kidneys. Considering the age gap of almost 70 years between the donor and recipient, doctors said this is one of the rarest live organ transplants conducted. The child– Aizah Tanvir Qureshi had a history of facial swelling with poor appetite, nausea and vomiting. She had severely deranged renal function along with metabolic acidosis. Finally, in June, she was diagnosed with an end-stage renal disease – focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) – in which scar tissue develops on the parts of the kidneys that filter waste from the blood (glomeruli). FSGS can be caused by a variety of conditions. The only option left was kidney transplantation. But when the Qureshis registered with the state health department, the waiting list for cadaveric donation was 850. So, the family started hunting for a suitable donor. “I wanted to donate my kidney, but due to my diabetes I wasn’t qualified. My husband and his family members couldn’t donate as their blood groups were different. Luckily, my grandmother, who doesn’t have any comorbidities, has the same blood group (O-positive) as that of my daughter. She happily agreed to donate her kidney,” said Nazeen Tanvir Qureshi, 34, Aizah’s mother, a Byculla resident.The great-grandmother – Rabiya Banu Mohd Haroon Ansari – underwent the pre-surgery diagnosis and was deemed qualified for the transplantation which took place on November 25 at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital. “We didn’t have any other option, so we had to take her great-grandmother’s kidney. It has been over three weeks, and both of them are doing well,” said Dr Sharad Sheth, consultant and head of nephrology at the hospital. Currently, Aizah has been kept on immunosuppressants to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. Dr Sheth is planning to publish the case study in a medical journal, considering it is one of the rarest organ transplantations. “This case is rare because of the almost 70 years’ age difference between the donor and recipient. I have witnessed cases where grandmothers have donated organs to their grandchildren. But this is the first time I have seen a great-grandmother save a four-year-old great-granddaughter,” he said.According to doctors, the age difference of 70 years is quite rare in organ transplantation, considering most people above 65-years have comorbidities, which makes them unqualified as donors. “Great-grandmothers donating organs to their great-grandchildren happens only in 0.20% cases. Though it is not new, it is a rare incident. Had it been a liver, doctors wouldn’t have been able to adjust the adult-sized liver into a four-year-old child,” said Dr Vijay Surase, senior consultant interventional cardiologist at Jupiter Hospital, Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-great-grandmother-donates-kidney-to-save-4-year-old-great-granddaughter/story-YazOu9nSanJbHzdZTuDxhM.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Police allowed to record Jamia student Iqbal Tanha’s voice samples||A Delhi court on Wednesday allowed police to record the voice samples of Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha, who has been charged under the stringent UAPA in the Delhi riot cases, after the investigating officer (IO) moved an application for the same.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat directed the investigating officer to coordinate with the Central Bureau of Investigation’s Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) at Lodhi Colony (New Delhi), to schedule the obtainment of voice samples and inform the court so production warrants could be issued.The police had moved the court seeking its permission to take voice samples of Tanha so that certain alleged incriminating data/audio files, retrieved by CERT­-In technology from his mobile phone, could be matched with it.While allowing the police’s plea, the court said the aspect of taking voice samples of an accused was an aspect of the investigation and it did not make the accused a witness against himself.“Accused Asif Iqbal Tanha is already arrested in the case and is in judicial custody. His regular bail has already been dismissed by this court. Further investigation is in progress.“The aspect of taking voice samples of an accused is an aspect of investigation. As such, it does not make the accused witness against himself. Accordingly, in the interest of investigation, the application, moved by the Investigating Officer of the present case seeking permission to take voice sample of the accused Asif Iqbal Tanha, is allowed,” it said in its order passed on December 15, and passed certain directions to protect the rights of the accused.The judge also directed the police to intimate Tanha’s counsel about the specified date and time of his production at CFSL.It added that the accused’s counsel may remain present at the time of obtaining voice samples with the permission of the Director of CFSL or the IO and have legal interview with Tanha for 15 minutes only.During the hearing, special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, said data retrieved from the accused’s mobile phone by the CERT-­In technology was examined and allegedly some incriminating audio files have been found, for which the voice sample was required to identify and match it with the data.Advocate Sowjhanya Shankaran, appearing for Tanha, denied all the contents of the application and claimed the arrest of the accused in the case was wholly “illegal” and without any evidence. Shankaran added that Tanha has diligently cooperated with the investigation from the beginning and before to his arrest, and undertakes to do so subject to the exercise of his fundamental right against self-incrimination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-police-allowed-to-record-jamia-student-iqbal-tanha-s-voice-samples/story-gAAq9BlK9SlFzxgtDTvwOP.html
17-12-2020||Mumbai||Exempt IITs from caste reservations in faculty recruitment: Panel to Centre||Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) should be exempted from caste reservations for faculty appointments as they are institutes of national importance, proposes an expert panel appointed to recommend measures to better implement reservations at IITs. In a report submitted to Rakesh Ranjan, additional secretary, department of higher education, Ministry of Education (MoE), on July 17, the committee proposed that the institutes be included in the list of ‘Institutes of Excellence’ which are exempted from caste-based reservations according to the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers’ Cadre) Act (CEI Act) of 2019. The committee report, a copy of which has been accessed by HT, was recently released following a right to information (RTI) plea filed by an activist in Uttar Pradesh. The eight-member committee was formed by the MoE in April to suggest measures for effective implementation of reservation rules in admission and faculty selection at IITs. V Ramgopal Rao, director IIT-Delhi and chairperson of the committee, said the report was final and refused to comment further. “It has been submitted to the ministry,” he said. While the report does not remark on implementation of reservations in admissions to undergraduate and postgraduate courses, it proposes that since IITs were established under the Act of Parliament as institutions of national importance, they should be exempted from reservation rules in faculty recruitment. “IITs ought to be listed under the Schedule to the CEI Act, 2019, for exemption from reservations,” the report stated. The list currently constitutes eight institutions including the Homi Bhabha National Institute and its five constituent institutes – Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Space Physics Laboratory and Indian Institute of Remote Sensing. According to the Government of India (GoI) norms, 10% of all positions are reserved for candidates belonging to the economically weaker sections (EWS), 27% from other backward class (OBC) category, 15% for scheduled cast (SC) category, 7.5% for scheduled tribe (ST) category and 5% for candidates with physical disabilities. The committee found that admissions to all academic undergraduate and postgraduate programmes were in line with the reservation guidelines of the government. The premier technology institutes were also following the norms of reservations in all non-faculty recruitments, the committee noted. “To compete with other top institutions in the world in terms of excellence, output, research, and teaching, a system emphasising targeted goals over a period of time, rather than specific quotas, to address diversity issues through outreach campaigns, targeted recruitment, etc, is recommended,” the report added.The report and its recommendations have been condemned by several student bodies across the country such as the Students Federation of India and All India OBC Students Association. “Ironically, the committee formed to study the violation of reservation norms in IITs has requested the government to add IITs to the class of reservation-exempted institutions in the country. The recommendation was especially on exempting IITs from fulfilling reservation norms in teaching faculty recruitment. The committee has also blatantly lied about IITs following reservation norms in all academic levels [UG and PG],” read a statement by the Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle, demanding that the MoE reject the demand for IITs to be included in the list of reservation-exempted institutions.BOXWhat the panel recommendsThe panel makes two kinds of recommendations for faculty recruitment: - Exempt IITs from caste reservations as they are institutes of national importance OR - Reservations be applied for all categories including EWS to posts of assistant professor grade I and II filled as a whole during the year. Reservation should be applied to the institute as a whole rather than on individual departments.2. The panel proposes a two-year preparatory programme for students willing to take admissions in the PhD programmes||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/exempt-iits-from-caste-reservations-in-faculty-recruitment-panel-to-centre/story-eZnTvhtL56IhVzZ1A5SniI.html

The victims, identified as Agnidev Yadav and Hari Prasad, 25, who worked as a plumber, were going to Giaspura on their scooter when the incident took place. Eyewitnesses told the police that after the bus hit the scooter, the victims fell down on the road; but instead of stopping, the driver sped up the vehicle, crushing them in the process. While Yadav died on the spot, Prasad, who was riding pillion, succumbed to his injuries on the way to the hospital. The bus driver fled the spot soon after the mishap, leaving the vehicle behind. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Balbir Singh, the investigating officer, said a case under Sections 279 (rash driving) and 304 A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been lodged against the unidentified driver. A hunt is on for his arrest, the ASI added.A YOUNG FAMILY’S DREAMS SHATTERHoping to provide quality education to his children, Hari Prasad had brought his family of five from Darbhanga of Bihar and planned to settle down in Ludhiana. They had bought a new house in the city and moved into it just about two months ago. “We were very happy about the new house and were still buying furniture for it. My husband wanted to educate our three children in this city. But now, there is no one to take care of us here. So we will return to Bihar,” said his grief-stricken wife, Padma. Agnidev Yadav is survived by his wife and two sons. The family lives in Darbhanga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-speeding-bus-mows-down-hosiery-worker-his-nephew-to-death/story-yBaFh6XFsbXa0vt6BwcARL.html
17-12-2020||Mumbai||Form sub-committee to verify status of Uran wetlands in National Atlas: Bombay HC-panel to Raigad collector||The Bombay high court (HC)-appointed Konkan wetland grievance redressal and state mangrove monitoring committee on Tuesday directed the formation of a sub-committee to verify the status of all wetlands in Uran identified under the National Wetland Inventory Atlas (NWIA), Maharashtra 2011. The move comes days after the Raigad district administration informed the HC panel that there were no wetland sites in Uran taluka.The letter, which HT has reviewed, was issued by member secretary of the panel Neenu Somraj, highlighting that Konkan divisional commissioner Annasaheb Misal had directed the Raigad collector to set up the sub-committee comprising the collector, a representative each from the police, environment and forest departments, City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (Cidco), and HC-panel member Stalin D.“The committee should submit its report within 15 days,” the letter read, directing the collector to expedite the appointment at the earliest.Somraj told HT that during last week’s HC panel meeting, a list of wetlands including locations at Karal, Khopte, Bori BK, Dronagiri, Bokadvira, Juipunde, Sheva, Sawarkhar, Bhendkhal, and Kaladhonada as well as Panje and Belpada were submitted before the panel. “We are very serious about the protection of the existing wetland in Uran. All these sites marked under the NWIA have to be protected irrespective of the new wetland rules (2017), and whether the features of such sites fall within the definition of those rules. Numerous complaints have been received pertaining to all these sites identified under the Atlas. Thus, we intend to ensure they remain protected. Based on the subcommittee’s findings, further directions will be issued,” said Somraj.Non-government panel member Stalin, director, NGO Vanashakti, said that though the exercise was welcome, many of the NWIA-identified wetlands have already been reclaimed. “We hope that by the time the committee visits these sites, there will be some semblance of wetland features there. The Raigad collector has failed to take any action over two years. Apart from booking unidentified persons, no effort was ever made to restore a single wetland. All directions by the HC panel were consistently ignored by Cidco and the collector,” he said.Raigad collector Nidhi Chaudhary refused to comment on the matter.Meanwhile, environmentalists on Wednesday highlighted that planning agency Cidco’s records show the existence of wetlands in Uran and that they are threatened by development projects, contrary to the collector’s submissions. Bombay Natural History Society’s (BHNS) Baseline Survey of Birds (January-March 2015) report at the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), posted on Cidco’s website, highlights the potential damage to wetlands and bird strike threats to aircraft. “These records are irrevocable as the cover page carries Cidco’s logo and the report is still available on their website. The report assumes significance in view of assertions by the collector and also strengthens our stand that Panje must immediately be declared as a bird sanctuary,” said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation. The BNHS report shows that several potential habitats will be destroyed in the near future due to rapid development and land use pattern changes in Navi Mumbai and the adjoining areas in Raigad district, especially due to projects such as the proposed Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link, NMIA, and the terminal project of Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust.MIGRATORY BIRDS MAKE THEIR WAY TO URAN WETLANDSOver the past week, large flocks of flamingos, waders and other migratory birds have made their way to various wetlands in Uran, including Panje. The birds were spotted by environmentalists, highlighting that the Panje area is not dry anymore, after bunds and sluice gate blockages were removed to allow high-tide water. “This once again is evidence that these areas have rich biodiversity and need to be protected,” said environmentalist Nandkumar Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/form-sub-committee-to-verify-status-of-uran-wetlands-in-national-atlas-hc-panel-to-raigad-collector/story-Qq5e7VsXsTeezpsb6YvwmI.html

The state transport department later clarified that their dedicated website https://www.bookmyhsrp.com was hacked.“We received several complaints from people today[Wednesday] about the website being down. When we asked the company which operates the website, it informed the department that their website was hacked at 10.50am and the problem was not resolved until late afternoon,” said a senior transport official. A spokesperson of HSRP manufacturer Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited said the company has registered a complaint with the cybercrime cell of the Delhi police. Meanwhile, vehicle owners who tried applying for the HSRPs or the colour coded stickers on Wednesday said they were unable to book an appointment. “I reached till the point of selecting the date of collection of the number plate. But, after that, it said there was some server error and the process did now get through despite me attempting 4-5 times,” said Arvind, who goes by his first name. Another vehicle owner said the web page hanged when she tried to make the payment. “It is illegal to fine us when even after trying so many times we cannot apply for an HSRP,” she said.On Wednesday, the transport department said it prosecuted 320 owners who did not have HSRPs on their vehicles. On Tuesday, when the crackdown was launched, 239 fines were issued for the same violations.

17-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body panel amends proposal to appoint consultant for Malad sewage treatment plant||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) standing committee on Wednesday appointed a project consultant for the proposed sewage treatment (STP) plant at Malad. Amending the administration’s proposal to appoint the lowest bidder Tata Consulting Engineers as the project consultant for the proposed STP, the committee directed the BMC to award the contract to the second-lowest bidder NJS Engineers India Pvt Ltd, with directives to negotiate with this firm to match the price quoted by the lowest bidder. The cost of the project is ₹61 crore. This is part of BMC’s plan to upgrade its STPs at Worli, Bandra, Versova, Malad, Bhandup and Ghatkopar, and construct a new STP at Dharavi. Treated water from these upgraded facilities will be used for non-potable purposes such as gardening, for car garages, fire-fighting, among others. While the six STPs presently treat water at the primary level, they will be upgraded to treat water at the tertiary level, making it fit for reuse. The amendment was proposed by the leader of the house Vishakha Raut. Raut said, “According to rules, BMC does not give one contractual firm more than three contracts. Tata Consultancy already has six existing BMC contracts. This delays the timeline of all projects and burdens the firm. We moved an amendment to award the contract to the second-lowest bidder, but the administration will have to negotiate with them to match the price quoted by the lowest bidder.” Rais Shaikh, leader of the Samajwadi Party in BMC said, “Now the administration can either accept this, negotiate with the bidder to lower the cost and match the lowest bid, or refer the proposal to the state government.” The consultants will help BMC in the project from the start to finish, will oversee the day to day’s work, and ensure the project is completed while resolving technical issues that may arise during the project completion. BMC is spending approximately ₹350 crores for appointing consultants for all seven STPs in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-panel-amends-proposal-to-appoint-consultant-for-malad-sewage-treatment-plant/story-iTLfz9T3vAgw58pBGcuoZN.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: A restored Rahim’s Tomb opens to public today after six years||Six years after its restoration work began, Rahim’s Tomb in south-east Delhi’s Nizamuddin will be reopened to the public from Thursday. Union minister for Tourism and Culture Prahlad Singh Patel will be presiding over the completion ceremony on the 464th birth anniversary of Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan – a poet and one of the navaratnas ( nine gems) of Mughal emperor Akbar’s court.Built in 1598 by Rahim for his wife Mah Banu, historians say the building was the first Mughal monument built for a woman and the architectural innovation developed there “informed the designs of Taj Mahal”. Following his death in 1627, Rahim’s body was also placed there.The mausoleum is constructed in the vicinity of the shrine of the 13th century Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya as it was believed to be auspicious to be buried near the grave of a saint. It was also built on the riverside terrace and not in the centre of the garden, unlike the other Mughal structures.Experts said the monument was “used as a quarry” from 18th century to early 20th century -- stones from the beautiful tomb were plundered to construct monuments elsewhere in the capital city-- leaving the structure in a dilapidated condition and at risk of a collapse. In the 1920s, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) provided masonry support to overhanging sandstone blocks on the façade, saving the structure from collapsing on itself.A major part of the renovation work – carried out by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) and funded by the InterGlobe Foundation in association with the ASI since 2014 – involved strengthening the foundation and repairing the deep and wide cracks in the crypt and other areas.The “emergency conservation work” -- one of the largest in recent times – also included around 60 independent peer reviews, architectural documentation involving 3D laser scanning, and extensive research. Wide-ranging consultations with various stakeholders eventually lead to a restored heritage structure and a renovated dome which looks half-finished to many.Ratish Nanda, chief executive officer (CEO) of AKTC, said, “We held deliberation at various levels about the dome. While some were in favour of us completing the dome, others wanted us to leave it as is. Following the discussions, we decided to use some white marble to stabilise the base of the dome and to let it remain as a symbolic addition to represent the original marble cladding. Some of the areas around the dome have been left empty as we had no evidence of what those spots looked like when it was first constructed.”Nanda also said their experience with conservation efforts at Humayun’s Tomb helped them to carry out this complex restoration work. Stone medallions of numerous designs, incised plaster patterns, including the swastika and floral motifs on the walls, were also restored. “Cleaning these designs, covered in soot, dust, modern plaster, and cement, was more difficult than restoring certain areas,” Nanda said.Rohini Bhatia, chairperson, InterGlobe Foundation, said, “In addition to physical restoration, we are also establishing the relevance of sites and creating awareness among communities towards the need to preserve culture and heritage.” The cultural revival efforts of Rahim’s Tomb include the compilation of Rahim’s literary works and archival research on his life and works by eminent scholars, culminating in an English publication titled ”Celebrating Rahim”, she said.Historian Rana Safvi said, “The structure was in a bad shape even when Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan was writing the first edition of his book Asar us Sanadid (The Remnants of Ancient Heroes) in 1847. In that, he describes the disrepair that the tomb of the Mughal noble had fallen into and compares it to the grandeur and magnificence of the Khan-e-Khanan’s life. I am glad that this noted scholar’s tomb has once again been restored to some semblance of its former glory,” said the author who translated the book into English.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-a-restored-rahim-s-tomb-opens-to-public-today-after-six-years/story-GfYnTJ4MYnZ0w029NCn3XK.html

Mumbai’s active caseload dropped below 10,000 to 6,958 after data reconciliation, according to the state health department. Maharashtra has witnessed a dip in Covid-19 cases and fatalities this month against November. In the first 15 days of December, the state had reported 62,911 cases and 1,188 deaths, a 8.06% and 42.41% drop respectively from 68,836 cases and 2,063 deaths in the corresponding period last month.Also read: Maharashtra records fewer than 5,000 cases for 11 days nowThe case fatality rate (CFR), too, has fallen, with the first fortnight of November recording it at 3%, while it is 1.88% from December 1 to 15.

The growth rate is 0.2%. I think, if people remain disciplined, strictly wear masks and maintain social distancing then cases will not surge and will remain in control,” said Tope, speaking to TV news channels.The minister added that a “possible second peak” of Covid-19 will not be witnessed in the state if people remain disciplined. Tope said the state is ready to begin the immunisation drive as soon as a vaccine is available. “Two companies have claimed that their clinical trials are complete; they have sought clearance from the authorities concerned. We have kept ready all resources required for vaccination, including trained manpower, cold chain, methodology, booths. If vaccination is to start tomorrow, Maharashtra is fully prepared,” Tope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-deaths-in-mumbai-cross-11-000-maharashtra-toll-rises-to-48-434/story-ee5dCnretClPoqzDx6vVyL.html
17-12-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana govt’s decision to rename Faridabad’s Badshah Khan Hospital irks public||The Haryana government’s decision to rename the Badshah Khan Hospital in Faridabad after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has received criticism from the public.The inauguration plaque at the hospital reads: “Badshah Khan Hospital, the hospital built by the people of Faridabad with their own hands was named after their beloved leader Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan”. It was inaugurated by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on June 5, 1951.The name change was notified by the Haryana’s director general health services notification on December 3, 2020, following orders from the chief minister.“Abdul Gaffar Khan was the beloved leader of all the people, who came from the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). Many of our elders were part of the organisation Khudai Khidmatgar (servants of God) formed by him in the pre-Independence era. After resettling in Faridabad, they collectively worked in the construction of the civil hospital and named it Badshah Khan Hospital in the honour of Abdul Gaffar Khan,” says 79-year-old Mohan Singh Bhatia, the president of the Bhatia Sewak Samaj, an organisation of the people from NWFP.“Badshah Khan Hospital is our identity and we request the government not to change its name. We are not against the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The government can build a new hospital and name it after him,” he said, adding that they may resort to protestsFaridabad’s New Industrial Town (NIT) was the biggest settlement of the people that moved to India after Partition.“I was 15 when I came to Faridabad with my parents. He (Abdul Gaffar Khan) had a great association with the people who came from NWFP and even post Partition, he used to visit Faridabad to meet us. Our emotions are associated with Badshah Khan and it’s our identity. By removing the Badshah Khan name from the civil hospital, the state government is wiping out our history,” said 87-year-old Kewal Ram Bhaita.Abdul Gaffar Khan, who is also known as Badshah Khan, died at the age of 97 in 1988 in Afghanistan.When contacted, Faridabad chief medical officer DR Randeep Poonia, said: “Please speak to the Prime Minister’s office, which is in charge of the hospital regarding the change of name.”Dr Vinay Gupta, principal medical officer, in charge of the hospital, said, “We received the notification from Haryana director general health services regarding the change of name of the hospital on December 14. From yesterday (December 15), we are using the new name in all our communication and references, including the hospital’s name and on the patient’s card. In the next couple of days, we will get the new board (with the new name) installed at the hospital premises.”“We never imagined even in our wildest of the dreams that the government will change the name of Badshah Khan Hospital. They don’t know what Badshah Khan is for the people, who came from NWFP,” says 74-year-old Basant Khattak.“He is our Gandhi and we don’t know what the current regimen is up to. Will they change the name of Taj Mahal also?” said Khattak. His father, the late Kanhiya Lal, was among the 81 refugees from NWFP, who sat in protest in front of Nehru’s residence, demanding a place for their resettlement.“Now, after 73 years of partition, the government is displacing our identity,” added Khattak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-govt-s-decision-to-rename-faridabad-s-badshah-khan-hospital-irks-public/story-C9Ind6obg45EmNAdMLddeL.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Govt sanctions sedition charges against Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, others||The Delhi government on Wednesday gave its sanction to the police to charge 18 people accused in the Delhi riots case -- including former JNU students Sharjeel Imam, Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, former JNU student Umar Khalid, and local politicians Tahir Hussain and Ishrat Jahan -- under sections of the Indian Penal Code that deal with sedition and criminal conspiracy.On November 22, when Delhi Police charged Khalid and other accused for their alleged role in the case, they informed the court that the sanction to prosecute the accused persons for sedition and other sections was still under consideration. A court takes cognisance of the charges and starts trial only after the state government gives a prosecution sanction. The police had sent a request for the prosecution sanction under sedition in mid- September. Last month, the government had given police prosecution sanction to charge the accused persons under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. But the sanction for sedition was still awaited. The accused have been arrested for their alleged role in conspiring to orchestrate the riots in northeast Delhi -- a charge that they have vehemently denied. The arrested have alleged that police framed them in the Delhi riots cases because they were prominent faces of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests.At least 53 persons died while 400 others were injured when clashes turned violent leading to full-blown Hindu-Muslim riots across parts of northeast Delhi. According to the Delhi government’s sanction approval letter, the police’s charge sheet was vetted, and after perusal it appeared that “prima facie the accused persons had committed the acts of sedition and criminal conspiracy.” HT has seen a copy of the government’s sanction letter. The government has also written to police saying that the granting of the prosecution sanction has been approved by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal.The Delhi government did not respond to requests for comment.The sedition law under Section 124 is a British era law, mentioned in the Indian Penal code. The maximum punishment, if convicted under the section, is life imprisonment with fine. This is the second case in which Umar Khalid will be tried for sedition. He, along with former JNU students’ union president Kanhaiya Kumar, was booked under a sedition charge for allegedly shouting anti-India slogans in the 2016 JNU case. They have both denied the charges.A controversy had erupted during that case when the Delhi government said police filed a charge sheet in January 2019 without getting an approval from the state government to include the sedition charge. The court did not take up the case until the government finally granted sanction in February 2020. Former Uttar Pradesh police chief, Vikram Singh who served as the state’s director general between 2007 and 2009 said, “ The government must not delay in granting sanctions in cases such as this. The government has the best legal minds. If there is a lacunae in the case, the legal minds can fix it. Many times governments delay sanction because of vote bank politics. Delaying the sanction hurts the government and the victims at large. The trials get extended. Ultimately the government suffers losses when trails are delayed. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-govt-sanctions-sedition-charges-against-umar-khalid-sherjeel-imam-others/story-MNfGsVfaaxQyiXN3EkU9OJ.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: As mayors’ protest enters Day 10, civic officials fear delay in budget proceedings||The sit-in protest of Delhi’s three civic bodies’ mayors outside the residence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal continued for the 10th day on Wednesday. Though mayors and other functionaries of the municipal corporations sitting on dharna have started basic work from the protest site, municipal officials fear that budget proceedings and discussions might get delayed if the protest continues. According to civic officials, budget proposals cannot be approved until there are proper deliberations by councillors, leader of the House and standing committee chairpersons of the three corporations.Budget proposals for the financial year 2021-22 were presented in the north, east and south corporations earlier this month by additional commissioners of the civic bodies. These proposals are now to be discussed and approved by the elected representatives in the standing committees and House meetings.A senior official of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said that the budget proposals are to be discussed in the standing committee meeting of the civic body on December 21 and the House meeting is likely to be conducted on December 24 to deliberate on different issues. However, the chairperson is protesting in front of the CM’s house. “In such a case, either we have to postpone the meetings while we wait for this impasse to be over or the deputy chairperson of the standing committee will have to handle the meeting for budget discussion. As of now there is not much of a problem but the deliberations on the budget may get delayed if the protest continues for another week,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Officials in the North and East Delhi Municipal Corporation said that had there been no protest, the deliberations on the budget would have been scheduled for next week, but “the process might get affected” in the current scenario.They, however, said that as of now budget proposals are being tabled in zonal offices before different municipal committees that do not require mayors or other senior political functionaries to be present. “Budget proposals are approved after several deliberations at different levels. After being tabled by the commissioner, the budget is put before different municipal committees and then presented in the standing committee for deliberations and remarks of the chairman. It is then reviewed by the leader of the opposition and finally approved by the leader of the House. The process for all this starts soon after the budget presentation by the commissioner. If the protest continues further, we may require changes in the schedules of deliberations on budget,” a north corporation official said on the condition of anonymity.As many as 30 BJP councillors, including mayors, standing committee chairpersons and leaders of Houses of the three corporations have been protesting outside Kejriwal’s residence at Flagstaff Road since December 7 for the release of allegedly pending dues of Rs13,000 from the Delhi government.Political leaders in the three municipalities said that of the Rs13,000 crore, the north corporation is to get Rs6,355 crore, the SDMC Rs4,125 crore and the EDMC Rs2,985 from the state government.Jai Prakash, mayor, north corporation, said, “We are committed that the work should not suffer so we have started working from the protest site. If required we might postpone the deliberations by one or two days and in the meantime, make some alternative arrangements so that the process is not affected further. We are sitting here for the cause of our employees as we are not able to pay their salaries. We hope that the Delhi government will listen to our demands and release funds soon.”Similarly, Nirmal Jain, mayor, EDMC, said that currently, the budget was being presented before different municipal committees and there was “no delay” expected in deliberations on the budget. “We will make some alternate arrangements and ask deputies of those sitting on dharna to conduct deliberations on the budget. We will not leave the protest site until our pending fund of Rs13,000 crore is released,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-as-mayors-protest-enters-day-10-civic-officials-fear-delay-in-budget-proceedings/story-oselwV5IYMPCX4eSJIyddO.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Release doctors’ salaries: Delhi HC to civic bodies||The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NrDMC) and the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) to release the salaries of the doctors of the nine hospitals they run for the month of October.A bench comprising justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said that the salaries should be released within two weeks while hearing an application moved by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) seeking directions to the two civic bodies to clear the arrears of salaries of the doctors and health workers.In its impleadment application, IMA had sought that doctors of three hospitals—Swami Dayanand Hospital, Chandiwala Maternity Home and Shahdara Polyclinic—managed by EDMC also be included in the list of hospitals being considered for relief by the high court.The application was filed as part of a petition which the court had initiated on the non-payment of salaries to the doctors of the Kasturba Gandhi Hospital. The doctors had threatened to resign as they have not been paid salaries since March this year.Subsequently, many more petitions related to non-payment of salaries by the three municipal corporations of Delhi—North, East and South—to their employees and pensioners were filed.The petitioners in those pleas include doctors, nurses, paramedic staff, safai karamcharis, teachers, Class-IV employees and retired staff such as teachers and engineers.On Wednesday, senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for the IMA, told the court that the doctors have not been given salaries for the last two months.Appearing for the civic bodies, their counsels told the court that the funds have to be released by the Delhi government for salaries to be disbursed by the municipal corporations.Advocate Satyakam, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, however, opposed this submission. He said that the hospitals are managed by the corporations and the government has already released its share.Following this, the court observed that the salaries to the doctors should be released despite administrative differences between the civic bodies and the Delhi government.“The doctors should not be deprived of their salaries,” the court said.“In the meantime, NrDMC and EDMC shall release the arrears of salaries of doctors employed with the nine hospitals being run and managed by the said civic authorities... for the month of October, 2020 within two weeks,” the court bench said in its order.The matter will be now heard on January 15, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/release-doctors-salaries-delhi-hc-to-civic-bodies/story-eBbta6UeikE1xNEJA9YHWI.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||AAP, BJP trade accusations over sanitation workers||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday alleged that leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are forcing sanitation workers to participate in the ongoing protest by all three mayors outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence.The BJP dismissed the allegation and said sanitation workers are in distress because of the AAP-led Delhi government.For the past 10 days, mayors of the three BJP-ruled municipal bodies and party supporters have been camping outside the CM’s residence in north Delhi’s Flagstaff Road demanding funds of ₹13,000 crore which they claim the Delhi government owes the civic bodies. The Delhi government has dismissed the claim.The protest by mayors began after sanitation workers to stop work if not paid on time.“The BJP’s dirty politics is quite evident in videos which show BJP leaders blackmailing MCD unions to go on strike and turn Delhi into a “garbage capital”. They are also forcing sanitation workers to join the mayors’ protest outside the CM’s residence,” said AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj.AAP leader Rakhi Birla said, “Most sanitation workers are Dalits and by not paying their wages for around three months now, the BJP has exposed its anti-Dalit face.”Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “The allegations are baseless. It reflects the AAP’s frustration as despite strong provocation by AAP supporters, sanitation workers have not gone on strike even though they are facing hardships. Sanitation and other municipal workers know very well that the AAP government is not releasing funds it owes the municipal corporations. And that is why they are not getting salaries on time. AAP will have to face the consequences in the 2022 municipal polls.”BJP to hold day-long fast todayThe Delhi BJP also said around 40,000 party workers will sit on a day-long fast on Thursday against the Delhi government and demand the release of ₹13,000 crore in funds to the three municipal corporations.The BJP-led municipal corporations have accused the Delhi government of not releasing funds due to them, thereby leading to a situation where they are unable to even pay employee salaries. Demanding that the government release the pending amount of ₹13,000 crore at the earliest, the three mayors have been staging a sit-in protest outside Kejriwal’s residence for the past 10 days. BJP workers will also stage a protest outside the Delhi assembly on Thursday to oppose the special session called by the government to discuss the alleged ₹2,400 crore irregularities in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.Harish Khurana, spokesperson, Delhi BJP, said, “Around 40,000 party workers will sit on a fast on Thursday from 9am to 5.30pm in support of our mayors. The CM has no time to meet our mayors who have been sitting outside the CM’s residence for over 10 days. Instead of releasing the ₹13,000 crore to the corporations, the government has levelled baseless allegations about irregularities.”Gupta, who addressed the media along with BJP MPs Meenakshi Lekhi, Gautam Gambhir and Hans Raj Hans outside Kejriwal’s residence, said, “We are challenging the CM to order an inquiry into the alleged scam by any investigating agency. If the charges are not proved, then he must resign.”In a statement, the AAP said, “Why is BJP showing its double face to the public at large? The AAP wants a CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) probe into the corruption in the MCDs, and we protested for the same. When we protested, we were beaten up by police and many party workers were arrested. We demand a thorough probe by the CBI to unearth the truth before the public.”Chail Bihari Goswami, chairman, standing committee in North Delhi Municipal Corporation, on Wednesday had sent a legal notice to Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, Delhi Jal Board V-C Raghav Chadha, AAP MLAs Atishi and Sourabh Bharadwaj for “making false allegations” of ₹2,400 crore scam in the north corporation. The corporation in a statement also denied allegations of any misappropriation of funds.The AAP did not respond for comment on the legal notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-aap-bjp-trade-accusations-over-sanitation-workers/story-6rvGzbDI5FcJlOPgRxd2lK.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Widows, mothers of farmers who died by suicide join stir at Delhi’s Tikri border||A 56-year-old woman whose farmer husband died by suicide five years ago; a 70-year-old who lost her daughter-in-law, the sole earner of the family, a decade ago; and a 60-year-old mother whose son consumed poison in 2010 were among the several people from farm families who joined the protest at Tikri border on Wednesday.Jasbeer Kaur, 56, a farmer from Kakarwal village of Sangrur district of Punjab, said her husband ended his life in 2015 after he failed to repay his farm debts. “Our lives had stopped the very day. We just could not ever overcome the loss. Things got more worse after that. We had to sell the two-acre land and my 16-year-old son is now working on someone else’s farmland. I still have to repay a loan of Rs4 lakh,” she said.Holding photographs of their loved ones, the women were seen raising slogans against the new farm laws at the Delhi-Haryana border in Tikri near a separate stage set up by Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan).Hardeep Kaur, 70, a farmer from Ugrahan, said her daughter-in-law died by suicide a decade ago after she was trapped in farm debts. “She was the only earning member of our family. Both my husband and my son are bedridden. We had Rs6 lakh debt at that time and the produce from our less than two-acre land was not enough to repay that. Her death was like a storm we feel every day. The debt is still there and we have no means of repaying it,” she said.The women said they had decided to join the stir at Delhi’s borders because the three new farm laws will “lead to more farmers ending their lives”. To be sure, the suicide cases are not linked to the new farm laws, which were approved by Parliament in September. However, farmers’ suicides, a long-standing issue in India, have been linked to farmers’ indebtedness, poor crop prices and price volatility. A Reserve Bank of India (RBI) study in 2019 warned that farmers were taking on more agricultural loans than is required to meet cultivation costs based on prevailing prices.As many as 10,281 agriculturists (5,957 cultivators and 4,324 farm labourers) died by suicide in 2019, accounting for 7.5% of total suicides in the country, according to official data.Sarjeet Kaur (60), said her 28-year-old son died by suicide in 2010 as he could not repay the debt of ₹10 lakh. “He was our only son. We are still under huge debt despite selling our three-acre land. Both my husband and I work on our neighbour’s farmland. Now, these new farm laws will further reduce the income of farmers and will force more farmers to meet a fate like my son’s. We do not want anyone to go through what we have faced,” she said.The protesting women said that debt has increased over the years. Mahinder Kaur, 55, whose husband died by suicide in 2015, said, “He ended his life because he could not repay a loan of ₹5 lakh. Now, that loan has increased to ₹15 lakh. I can’t end my life and leave my children alone. We are also here to ask the government to either give us compensation or waive our debts. This debt-ridden life is a slow death.”Harpreet Kaur, president of BKU (Ugrahan) women’s wing, said, “We had requested these women to join the stir to make the government understand that farmers have been struggling for years due to anti-farmer policies. The new farm laws will make the situation worse for them and trigger more suicides.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-widows-mothers-of-farmers-who-died-by-suicide-join-stir-at-tikri/story-iTZsmlr1pqWVVn722NZlVI.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Covid-19 positivity rate remains below 2% for two days in a row, govt may not scale up testing||With over 79,000 tests conducted and 1,547 new cases reported on Wednesday, Delhi saw a positivity rate of less than 2% for the second consecutive day, as per the daily health bulletin shared by the city government. Delhi also reported 32 deaths due to Covid-19, taking the city’s total toll to 10,147 as on Wednesday. The positivity rate – the proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested – has remained at 5% or less in Delhi for the past 15 days, a first since the government started releasing daily data in March, giving rise to hopes that the disease may finally be under control in the national capital. Experts believe that the spread of the infection is under control if a positivity rate is 5% or less and hat rate is maintained for at least two weeks. “The number of cases and positivity rate in Delhi have continued to decline even though the behaviour of the people – such as wearing masks properly in public and maintaining social distance – has remained somewhat ambivalent. So, the decline is probably due to a high percentage of the population being exposed to the infection. Now, it is unlikely that Delhi would see a large spurt in cases. It might happen if a lot of susceptible people return to the city or if the virus mutates significantly,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The low positivity rate, however, could mean that Delhi might not scale up testing further, as implied by Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday during a press briefing. “The World Health Organization says tests should be scaled up till the positivity rate of less than 8% is achieved. A positivity rate of 5% is considered to be optimum, which means that sufficient number of tests is being done. Delhi has had a positivity rate of less than 3% for five days in a row and less than 5% for 15 days in a row. Right now, the positivity rate is about 2%. Let us wait and watch as to how long the 2% positivity rate can be maintained,” said Jain, when asked about scaling up testing. After a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in mid-November, when Delhi was going through the third and the worst surge in cases, the government had decided to scale up the number of daily tests to between 100,000 and 120,000. On Tuesday, Delhi had reported the highest number of tests in a day – 85,105. Of these, almost half were conducted using the more accurate RT PCR method. The daily number of tests has gone up from an average of 52,617 tests, in the first week of November, to 72,793 over the past seven days, as per the data shared by the Delhi government. The proportion of RT PCR tests daily has also gone up from 27.6% in the first week of November to 48.25% during the past seven days. As for hospitalisations, the minister said around 50% of intensive care unit (ICU) beds were available in Delhi. However, in some of the big private hospitals, the occupancy of ICU beds still remained at 80%. As per the government’s own Delhi Corona app, on average only 34.8% of the ICU beds – with or without ventilators – were occupied across hospitals as on Wednesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-covid-19-positivity-rate-remains-below-2-for-two-days-in-a-row-govt-may-not-scale-up-testing/story-OHQsA9ve8k9aYnLiN2TnwK.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: DJB, electricity dept employees on front-line workers’ list for vaccination||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said the state government would consider employees of the electricity department and the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) as front-line workers and they would be second in line, after health care workers, to receive the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine when it becomes available. As per the recommendations of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), an estimated 10 million health care workers, 20 million front-line workers, including the police and army personnel, and 270 million people, either over the age of 50 years or with comorbidities, will be the three priority groups to receive the vaccine. “Yesterday (Tuesday), the Delhi government has ordered that the employees of the DJB and the electricity department will be on the list of front-line workers and will be administered the vaccine on priority when it becomes available. They were working 24 hours a day even when there was a lockdown. Police, civil defence volunteers and safai karmacharis are already on the priority list,” said Jain in an interaction with the press on Wednesday. Delhi has already collected information on health care workers through the hospitals and clinics they work in. The category of health care workers includes doctors, AYUSH practitioners, dentists, nurses, paramedical staff, non-medical staff in health care facilities, as well as security personnel in such facilities. The districts already have in place data on the aged and those with comorbidities in containment areas, which was collected during the door-to-door survey. This will be updated for the vaccination drive. The government has also started training health care workers on vaccine administration. The cold storage facilities and fixed points such as dispensaries and mohalla clinics where the vaccine will be administered are already in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-djb-electricity-dept-employees-on-front-line-workers-list-for-vaccination/story-OlHcUO4gRnYBQVg6wFCETM.html

The reply comes after several contentions were raised on the delay in removal of the temple.The court was hearing an application seeking the compliance of the court’s earlier order to demolish the temple which is under the right of way of Chandni Chowk main road, which is part of the redevelopment plan.On Wednesday, the civic body told a bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad, that in compliance with the orders of the court, the demolition programme for the removal of the temple had earlier been scheduled for November 1.“However, keeping in view the upcoming festival of Deepawali etc. it was decided to postpone the said action,” the North MCD said, adding that the next date for the removal was fixed for November 22. But on the said date, a huge crowd had gathered at the demolition site and the civic body that work could not be executed on the day due to administrative reasons. The civic body told the court that another encroachment removal program has been fixed for December 20.The court, while taking note of the submissions, posted the matter for further hearing on January 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-mcd-tells-hc-it-will-demolish-temple-to-clear-way-for-chandni-chowk-revamp/story-40cOJ9YMYLTJENrSapA59I.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Blockade at Chilla border: Traffic from Noida diverted||Farmer groups on Wednesday blocked the carriageway from Noida to Delhi via the Chilla border, even as the Supreme Court on Wednesday indicated that it may form a committee to resolve the deadlock over the three new contentious farm laws. The Delhi-Noida carriageway, however, remained in operation with only about 150 farmers reaching the site instead of the nearly 2,000 that were expected, according to farm union leaders. The Noida-Delhi traffic was diverted through the Delhi-Noida Direct Flyway.In a press conference on Tuesday evening, farmer leaders had announced that they will “completely block” the Chilla (Delhi-Noida link road) border.“We were expecting nearly 2,000 farmers to reach there for the complete blockade of the Chilla border. However, only a few could reach and block one carriageway. We will reach on Thursday morning in full strength and block both the roads,” said Rishipal Ambawata, head of Bharatiya Kisan Union’s Ambawata group.Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president of BKU (Bhanu), said: “We will continue the blockade till the government accepts all our demands. We are not against another round of talks, but the government should also give us an optimistic response. We are planning to block DND next.”The agitation at Delhi’s four key borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate and Chilla – entered the 21st day on Wednesday. Farm union leaders also said they had formed an IT cell to counter the Centre’s “propaganda” about the agitation.Commenting on the SC’s indications earlier in the day, Bharatiya Kisan Union leaders after their core committee meeting in the evening decided “to remain silent on the matter” until they receive any notice from the apex court over constituting the panel. They had welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision earlier in the day, with some suggestions of their own on how the body would be constituted.Manjeet Rai, national president of BKU (Doaba), said, “In the meeting, the members of our core committee decided that we will not comment anything on the Supreme Court’s suggestion of forming a panel of farmers and representatives of the government for talks on the farm laws till a formal notice is received. The matter is listed in the Supreme Court on Thursday. Further decision will be taken accordingly.”The farm leaders had earlier demanded that the panel should mainly consist of the representatives of the farmers who have been protesting against the farm bills at Delhi borders and other places across the country. They also said that they will not accept the “participation of any pro-government farmer leaders” in the panel.“We will not accept any such leaders in the panel. The committee should be time-bound. We request the government of Punjab and Haryana to play a positive role and stand in solidarity with the agitating protesters. The farmers are dying at the protest venue because of the chilling cold,” Satnam Singh Sahni, BKU Doaba’s general secretary, said in the afternoon when asked to comment on the Supreme Court’s decision.However, the farmer leaders changed their stand after the core committee meeting and decided to maintain silence of the issue till the Wednesday’s hearing in the court.Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari Kisan Union, said that the members of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a platform leading the protests, will meet on Thursday morning and decide the next course of action. “We will discuss the suggestions given by the apex court on Thursday. We will take any decision after discussing with all the farmers’ unions,” he said.On Wednesday, the farmer leaders said that they have formed an IT Cell to counter the central government’s “propaganda” that they have been spreading against the protesting farmers through various means.“Our 50 member IT wing would respond to all such propaganda of the government and revert instantly in the same manner. This cell will also work to disseminate real-time information about our decisions and progress in the agitation to nearly 1.2 billion people across the globe who are associated with us,” said Rai.At the Ghazipur and Tikri borders, the protest remained peaceful on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/blockade-at-chilla-border-traffic-from-noida-diverted/story-EwvqjCtxPeXrNUTGrIsp1H.html
17-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government seeks ₹3,700 crore for flood-hit farmers||The Maharashtra government has sought a financial aid of ₹3,700 crore from the Centre for relief to farmers hit by floods in September and October. A six-member central team will assess the losses in flood-hit areas of Vidarbha, Marathwada and Pune over six days, beginning Sunday. The Centre is expected to release the financial compensation based on the report of its committee. “We have sought financial assistance of ₹3,700 crore against the losses of crops due to the floods in September and October. Following this, a team from the Central government will come for a six-day tour of the state, during which they will visit flood-affected areas of Vidarbha, central Maharashtra (Marathwada) and western Maharashtra,” said Abhay Yawalkar, director, disaster management, relief and rehabilitation department. The retreating monsoon caused damage to harvest-ready crops over seven lakh hectares in more than 10 districts in central and western Maharashtra in October. Standing crops such as soya bean, cotton, gram, sugarcane, pomegranate etc. were flattened due to heavy rain in districts of Solapur, Sangli, Kolhapur, Satara, Osmanabad, Latur, Beed and Aurangabad. Solapur in western Maharashtra and Osmanabad in central Maharashtra were the worst-hit. Similarly, in September, around 88,864 hectares of agriculture land in 34 talukas of Nagpur, Bhandara, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli was hit due to the floods in Vidarbha, officials said. This would be the second visit of the Central team to Vidarbha as it had already visited the region post the floods in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-seeks-3-700-crore-for-flood-hit-farmers/story-u6hQoxBBAKdcqwKiDRqJUP.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Gopal Rai visits Singhu border to take stock of facilities, says AAP firmly behind farmers||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Delhi convener and environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday visited the protesting farmers at Singhu Border and took stock of the facilities provided by the Delhi government there. After his visit, Rai told reporters that the Kejriwal government stood firmly in support of the farmers’ protest in the Supreme Court on Wednesday when the matter was being heard by the bench of the Chief Justice of India.The party, later in a statement, said the AAP government told the Supreme Court that the protests will end immediately if the Central government agrees to the farmers’ demands.“The farmers are protesting even in extreme weather not out of choice but out of compulsion. Their demands are absolutely legitimate and the Central government must listen and accept these demands. But the Central government does not seem interested in looking into the demands of farmers,” Delhi government’s counsel Rahul Mehra told the apex court. Rai said the Delhi government is running kitchens for providing food to protesting farmers. “We have also installed mobile toilets and facilities for drinking water. The BJP-ruled Centre is saying that massive losses are taking place due to the farmer’s protest owing to the closure of the borders. But the farmers wanted to hold the protest at Ramlila Maidan for which the BJP government did not grant them permission,” he said. The AAP leader said Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh came to Delhi, met Union home minister Amit Shah and returned but did not meet farmers. “And now he is falsely accusing the AAP of faking support. Let me remind him that it was Kejriwal who visited Singhu border. It was Kejriwal who was put under house arrest when he wanted to visit the border again on the day the Bharat Bandh,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gopal-rai-visits-singhu-border-to-take-stock-of-facilities-says-aap-firmly-behind-farmers/story-0eKw4fGj8FHMDrWscFFxhM.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||BJP starts campaign in support of farm laws, meets farmers in north-west Delhi||As the protest by farmers at Delhi borders intensifies, the Delhi BJP has stepped up its campaign in support of the three new farm laws passed by Parliament and held meetings with farmers to “explain” the laws tot them.On Thursday, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, BJP MLA and leader of the opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, and Union minister of state for agriculture Kailash Choudhary met farmers in Narela and Khanjhawla in north-west Delhi.BJP leaders said they are explaining the laws to farmers and trying to make them understand how these new legislations will do away with the middleman. The BJP also hit out at Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for supporting the ongoing protest and said farmers in Delhi don’t even get basic benefits and the Kejriwal government has done nothing in this regard.Gupta said, “The farmers in Delhi do not have irrigation facilities; there is no department to solve the problems of the farmers. The Modi government is dedicated to work in the interests of farmers and is fighting against the injustice being done to farmers of Delhi. We will get them their rights.”Bidhuri said, “During the assembly elections, Kejriwal has made tall promises for the welfare of farmers. But the government has done nothing despite being in power for six years. We will tell farmers in Delhi about the failure of the AAP-led Delhi government and the benefits farmers will get with the new farm laws.”AAP did not comment on the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-starts-campaign-in-support-of-farm-laws-meets-farmers-in-north-west-delhi/story-W34P7clfFWwDYRTCIkGYbJ.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Retired Army veterans join farmers’ protest, celebrate Vijay Diwas at protest venue||With their medals pinned on, nearly 40 Indian Army veterans, including some who had fought and won the 1971 war against Pakistan, on Wednesday gathered at the Singhu border and celebrated Vijay Diwas (Victory Day) along with thousands of farmers who have been protesting there against three farm laws for the past 21 days.The veterans, who are members of Indian Veterans’ Organisation (IVO), said they had come from five states to the protest venue to “support and fight the farmers’ agitation” as defence personnel.“On this day (December 16) in 1971, the Indian Army defeated Pakistan in war, which resulted in East Pakistan’s liberation and the creation of Bangladesh. The protesting farmers need something similar from us to win their battle against the government and get freedom from the three black farm laws. We have come here to extend our support,” said Captain Ashin Khan (retd), general secretary of the IVO, adding that he was part of the Kargil War, and operations Pawan and Parakram.These veterans from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, said that their presence in solidarity with the farmers should be considered as the real tribute to the defence personnel who died fighting the 1971 war. More than 1,500 members of the IVO have visited the Singhu and Tikri borders since the agitation started 21 days ago, said Captain Bikkar Singh (retd), adding that had fought the 1971 war with Pakistan.Captain Joginder Singh Sengar (retd), national president of the organisation, said that he was pained by the “misinformation” being circulated through various mediums that the farmers’ protest is being “funded by terrorist organisations” and that “anti-national elements” have taken over the protests.“I came with my team to the Singhu border to identify such elements. But forget about terrorists, we have not even found any political leaders here. All those who are protesting are farmers and there is no international funding as such. If any anti-national element is identified, we will catch them and treat him the way the Indian Army treats a terrorist,” said Sengar.The retired Army officers said that the farmers and defence personnel are two sides of the same coin and by supporting the farmers they will be able to uphold former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri’s slogan, “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-retired-army-veterans-join-farmers-protest-celebrate-vijay-diwas-at-protest-venue/story-61iJLOCOPO58w2qlj0LaeP.html
17-12-2020||Mumbai||Bhima Koregaon case: Bombay HC reserves order on Navlakha’s bail plea||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday concluded hearing arguments in the appeal filed by Gautam Navlakha, activist and accused in the Bhima Koregaon case against the rejection of his default bail plea by the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on July 12, 2020. Navlakha had sought default bail as the investigating agency had failed to file a charge sheet within the stipulated period and he was in custody for 94 days. The agency, however, claimed that the period of 34 days of Navlakha’s house arrest between August 29 and October 1, 2018, was termed illegal by the Delhi high court, hence it could not be included as part of the period of his detention. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik, while hearing the appeal, was informed by senior counsel Kapil Sibal that the house arrest had restricted all movement and contacts of Navlakha, hence his plea for default bail under section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was valid. The court was further informed that though the Delhi HC had termed the detention illegal, Navlakha’s remand was to be considered from the date on which he was put under house arrest. It also submitted that after rectifying the technical lapses, which resulted in the Delhi HC terming the arrest illegal, Maharashtra Police had arrested Navlakha again, hence it was part of the same process. However, additional solicitor-general SV Raju for the NIA opposed the claims stating that after the Delhi HC had deemed the period of detention from August 29 to October 1 as illegal, Navlakha was a free man in that period, hence it could not be considered while calculating the period of arrest. He also referred to judgements to bolster his arguments. After hearing both sides, the court said that it had concluded hearing arguments in the appeal and directed both parties to submit their written submissions within a week and said that it would pass its orders in due course. Navlakha had been kept under house arrest between August 29 and October 1, 2018. Later, on March 9, 2020, based on an order of the Supreme Court in his bail application he had surrendered to Maharashtra Police and was kept at Taloja jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-case-bombay-hc-reserves-order-on-navlakha-s-bail-plea/story-qXfNr2Uq40b0lg4lC1iGWN.html
17-12-2020||Gurugram||Licence for realty project cancelled over pending due of Rs 22 crore||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has cancelled the licence of a residential plotted colony spread over 84 acres due to non-payment of external development charges (EDC) of around Rs 22 crore. The residential project, being developed by Vatika Ltd, is spread in sectors 81, 82, 82A, 83 and 84, and the licence was granted in 2014.The order, issued by the director, DTCP, on December 3, was received by Gurugram officials on Wednesday. It observed that the developer had failed to pay the EDC along with interest update, with Rs 2,294.67 lakh outstanding, as of October 10, 2020.The residential project is located in the revenue estate of Sihi, Shikhopur, Badha, Sikanderpur Badha, Kherki Daula and Harsaru villages. It is part of the Vatika India Next residential township.The order (a copy of which is with HT), issued by Makrand Pandurang, the director, DTCP, stated, “Since a reasonable time and opportunity already stands granted to the company for payment of outstanding EDC, therefore, it will not be appropriate to grant further time for payment of said dues. Hence the license number 66 is hereby cancelled under section 8 of the Act of 1975 as the coloniser has contravened the conditions of the license (sic).”A senior official of Vatika Ltd, when asked about the matter, said that they have already made payments to the department, which need to be adjusted. “This is a procedural issue and all the formalities will be completed and compliances submitted to the department at the earliest,” he said.Pandurang also directed the formation of a committee, comprising senior town planner, district town planner, executive engineer of HSVP and representative of the deputy commissioner, Gurugram. “This committee will decide on issues like development works, execution and maintenance of public health services, electricity supply, property registrations and related matters,” the order stated.A senior DTCP official, requesting anonymity, said that if the matter is not resolved, the colony would be taken over by the department and development works will be carried out by the director and the payment for the same would be taken from developer and plot owners. “Apart from non-payment of EDC, the developer has not got approved service plan estimates of the colony, NOC from the environment ministry and other formalities remain pending,” he said.The official further said that multiple notices in this regard were issued to the developer since November 2017, but the replies were not found satisfactory. At a hearing in August 2020, an authorised signatory of the developer had agreed that all formalities will be completed within the moratorium period but nothing happened in this matter. “It is because of this reason that it was decided to cancel the licence,” he said.Sanjiv Mann, senior town planner, Gurugram, said that non-payment of EDC was being seen as a serious issue by the department, as repeated relaxations have been given in the last two years. “The developers must comply with policies and directions in these matters,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/licence-for-realty-project-cancelled-over-pending-due-of-rs-22-crore/story-Y908Vm80a0DYvVTx7IN0aL.html
17-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Chilla border closed again, traffic re-routed via DND||Farmers against the central government’s three new farm laws blocked the Noida to Delhi traffic on the Mayur Vihar-Noida link road at the Chilla border once again on Wednesday morning this time protesting the detention of their supporters across Uttar Pradesh. Noida Police routed the traffic via the DND flyway instead.The increased number of vehicles on this route had led to traffic congestion, said police.The Chilla border was first closed on December 1 in response to the nationwide protests called against the new laws. At the time, scores of farmers were proceeding to Delhi to mark their protest when Delhi Police stopped them. After negotiations between the police and protesters’ leaders, the road was re-opened on December 13.The farmers, however, continued their protest without blocking the road.However, at 11 am on Wednesday, the Bhanu faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) moved in.“A delegation of our (farmer) brothers from Amroha was stopped at the district’s border and were forced to turn back. The police is threatening our supporters with detention and house arrest to keep them from reaching us to lend their support. Our brothers are not being allowed to speak against laws that are unjust and unfair to us. We understand the problems being faced by public but we are also suffering under these new laws,” said Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president, BKU (Bhanu). HT could not independently confirm the detention.Singh and his followers are on an indefinite hunger strike since Sunday. Police said doctors were monitoring their health and were stable.“We have a drill in place and the traffic was diverted to DND Flyway. We are monitoring the situation closely and sharing frequent updates with the public. The traffic movement is being managed without any major issues,” said Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, traffic.More factions of the BKU are expected to lend their support to the Bhanu group on Thursday. A farmer with the Lokshakti faction, protesting at the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal, said that even their volunteers from Uttarakhand were detained and sent back when they entered Uttar Pradesh.“They are trying to keep us from raising our voices. But we will not let that happen. We have support from all farmers and we will keep on protesting peacefully for as long as it is needed,” said a Bhanu farmer.“We are on alert and prepared to handle the situation. For now traffic is coming from Delhi to Noida and we are working on resolving the situation soon,” said additional DCP, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-chilla-border-closed-again-traffic-re-routed-via-dnd/story-0vW8DV9dDm54fA6r77VqsN.html
17-12-2020||Delhi||Long-term sexual relation based on promise of marriage can’t be involuntary, says Delhi HC||“A promise of marriage cannot be held as an inducement for engaging in sex over a protracted and indefinite period of time”, the Delhi high court said, while dismissing the appeal of a woman who had challenged the acquittal of man who she had accused of raping on the pretext of marriage.Justice Vibhu Bakhru said it is difficult to accept that continuing with an intimate relationship, which also involves engaging in sexual activity over a significant period of time, can be construed as involuntary.“Inducement to have a physical relationship by promising marriage and the victim falling prey to such an inducement may be understandable in the context of the moment. A promise of marriage cannot be held as an inducement for engaging in sex over a protracted and indefinite period of time,” the court said in its judgment passed on December 15.The single judge bench was hearing the appeal of a woman who had challenged the acquittal of a man who she claimed had raped her on the pretext of marriage and later deserted her.On August 15, 2015, the woman had filed a complaint at the police station in Malviya Nagar alleging rape following which an FIR was registered under IPC sections 376 (rape) and 415 (cheating) against the accused. In her complaint, the woman had alleged that she was working as a domestic help in Greater Kailash and she knew the accused since 2008.She claimed that he promised to marry her and made her elope with him. He later took her to his house and kept her with him as his bride, she said. During that period, she became pregnant but he allegedly forced her to terminate the pregnancy.Till 2013, they stayed together. Then the accused left for his village in Punjab and later she got to know that he had married a woman there.In 2014, she continued to be in touch with the accused over phone, and also stayed with him in a rented house in Faridabad for almost six months. Later, he got married to another woman following which she registered the complaint.The court said it is apparent that there is no dispute between the woman and the accused and the relationship between them was consensual. It also said the allegation that the accused had given her a promise of marriage is not sustainable.The judge said in certain cases, a promise to marry may induce a party to agree to establish sexual relations, even though such a party does not desire to consent to the same. In such cases, a false promise to marry with the intention to exploit the other party may vitiate consent and thus, constitute rape, the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/promise-of-marriage-can-t-be-held-as-inducement-to-engage-in-long-term-sexual-relations-says-delhi-hc-dismisses-rape-case/story-0O0fzD4PA4rGeSnkt26swM.html

The willing candidates have already started lobbying for it. Recently while campaigning for the graduate constituency, Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar hinted at the new recruitments at Balgandharva melava.While addressing party workers at Balgandharva, Pawar said, “After the graduate constituency election and assembly session, the party will start new appointments in the city.”NCP city unit president Chetan Tupe, said, “The party had appointed me as the city unit president and I have completed two years of my tenure. I will follow the decision of the party.”Many candidates from the city unit of NCP are vying for the post.Former mayor Prashant Jagtap; former mayor Datta Dhankawade; former deputy mayor Deepak Mankar; NCP leader Pradip Deshmukh and Subhash Deshmukh are some of the front-runners.Party sources aware of the development, said, “The party is likely to take a decision regarding the city unit president’s post very soon.

During the meeting, held at Mantralaya, Kadu assured the members of the parent associations that in the next 15 days the said schools will undergo an audit and a report will be submitted to him. Kadu also assured the parents of an immediate audit of five schools from Pune, which, according to parents, have been denying education to students on the pretext of fees. “These five schools will be audited and probed. Those schools which have stopped online education will face punitive action. Even after that, if they do not continue online education for all students, criminal proceedings will be started against them,” said Kadu. Speaking on the behalf of the parent associations, Jayshree Deshpande, said, “Our demand for the audit reports of schools has been accepted. The reports have to be submitted in 15 days. Meanwhile, we want the online education of our children to continue.” Private schools from Pune and PCMC stopped all online education classes till December 17 to protest non-payment of fees by over 50 per cent of parents. The Federation of English Medium schools has alleged that around 58 per cent parents have not paid full fees. Rajendra Singh, State President of Federation of Schools Association in Maharashtra said, “Some schools have exhausted all funds and it is difficult for them to continue functioning. We hope the parents who are not able to pay the fees get in touch with the schools with relevant documents. In the last three days, we have been approached by many parents who are not able to pay the fees. And we have helped them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/parents-meet-minister-bachhu-kadu-after-schools-in-pune-stop-online-teaching/story-6z8HIigCA0cqFLJ2TwvJfM.html

17-12-2020||Pune||Pune jumbo hospital staff protest over salary dues||Pune: Around 100 staff working at the College Of Engineering Pune (COEP) jumbo facility staged a protest on Wednesday against the management of the hospital complaining about pending payments. The protestors alleged that they have not received their salaries for the past four months and have not received the promised accommodation too. One of the staff nurses who was appointed, requesting anonymity, said, “We were appointed for a six-month salary by the previous agency, Lifeline, but their contract got scrapped. Then the new agency hired us on the same condition of providing accommodation and on the same pay scale for the next three months. After they could not pay the bills for the hotel we had to vacate the hotel premises. Also, since September, we have not been paid out full salaries and only part payment was being paid monthly after multiple follow-ups every month. Despite our repeated attempts when the management did not respond, we had to take this extreme step.” Abhijeet Gite, 23, another staff nurse from Beed, said, “We have come from another town to earn a living, but we are not being paid our rightful salary. The management is not responding to our queries. They have given us a letter stating that all our dues would be cleared by this month-end. However, we are not sure whether they will pay all the pay cuts or if they would start paying as promised from this month. Tomorrow, we will meet the PMC commissioner to put forward our request.”PMC health chief Dr Ashish Bharti said, “We have made all the payments from our end. We have outsourced the facility to another agency and so the pending salary issue needs to be sorted out by the agency.” Attempts to reach Med Bros went unanswered. The facility was opened on an emergency basis on COEP ground in August and was built by PMRDA and part payment for the same was made by PMC. The facility had come under fire by the citizens after the initial higher deaths rate wherein 7-8 deaths due to Covid19 were reported in just 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/jumbo-hospital-staff-protest-over-salary-dues/story-4e8owluZjzslCBw5MfNQLP.html

The traffic branch has asked the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to put up information boards which clearly state that the speed limit on this stretch is 60km/hour. DCP (Traffic) Rahul Srirame said, “This belt has become accident prone and we are taking strong steps to curb speeding and rash driving. Two speed interceptor vehicles, including speed guns, will be deployed. Vehicles travelling at over 60km/hour will face action.” The highway area near Navale bridge has witnessed several accidents. Commuters travelling from the new Katraj tunnel and heading towards Sinhagad road drive into the service road from the bypass and at the same time, commuters on Sinhagad road come directly onto the bypass, resulting in a traffic jam. Several residential areas, including Narhe, Ambegaon Budruk, Dhayari and Vadgaon Budruk, are connected to this stretch. Suhas Chitnis, project director, NHAI, said, “We have taken steps aimed at commuter safety as recommended by the traffic police. The process of installation of signboards about speed limits will be erected soon. The process of cross-bar marking has also been completed and other warning signs have been erected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/speed-limit-on-vehicles-plying-five-km-stretch-from-navale-bridge-to-katraj-tunnel/story-I0XQ9qIXVFtkieUSRhXCJJ.html
17-12-2020||Pune||30 new oxygen refilling stations to come up in Pune division||Pune: Though there is a decline in fresh Covid cases in Pune district as compared to previous months, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pune division has taken steps to tackle the possible second wave of the deadly virus as mentioned by the Central team. During September the oxygen supply ratio was 80:20, as 80 per cent of the oxygen cylinders were supplied to hospitals and 20 per cent to industrial units. Later, the ratio was reversed. Even as the district is seeing les Covid cases, FDA has given permission to set up 30 new gas filling stations in Pune division, including Pune, Solapur, Sangli and Kolhapur districts. While gas cylinders will be brought from Gujarat, the preparations for oxygen transport tankers, their permits, cylinder refilling and storing centres have begun. “During the lockdown period when there was a spike in Covid cases, beds from private hospitals were acquired and new beds were added in government hospitals for treatment. All these beds were equipped with oxygen supply, but there was shortage of oxygen gas cylinders and refilling stations. The 80:20 ratio was implemented during the crucial period (80 for hospitals and 20 for industries) which is reversed now. Presently, the numbers of positive cases are less and so is the demand for cylinders. Yet, as per the instructions from the state government, preparations are done for the possible second wave in the month of February and March,” said SB Patil, joint commissioner (drugs), Pune division, FDA. “Accordingly, we are setting up oxygen gas refilling stations. We have given permissions to 30 new gas refilling centres in Pune division, including 16 in Pune district, 4 in Satara, 3 in Sangli, 3 in Solapur and 4 in Kolhapur districts. Currently, 328.72 metric tonnes of oxygen gas is produced in Pune division of which 122.52 metric tonnes is reserved for medical use. With drop in Covid cases and demand from industries, the reserved quota of gas is transferred to industries. We will be transporting oxygen gas cylinders through 31 gas tankers,” Patil said. Vijay Damodare, owner of Raigad Gas (India) Pvt Ltd in Rajgurunagar said, “The oxygen gas supply to hospitals is almost nil since the last one month because of few Covid cases. During August, September and October, the demand from hospitals was high. We are always ready to supply gas cylinders to hospitals as per their demand as saving lives is more important than industry usage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/30-new-gas-refilling-stations-to-come-up-in-pune-division/story-oaGcIzxz12pY9sTccnSrVP.html

How are the schools and junior colleges at rural parts faring after it resumed classes? Almost 15,000 schools have restarted which is around 60 per cent of total schools in the state which are imparting education to Class 9 to Class 12. Almost 8 lakh students have resumed offline classroom classes, which is around 15 per cent of student population covering Class 9 to Class 12. So, the progress is gradual, but we have to observe the local situation which is changing every day and the decision cannot be made at central or state levels. Hence, we have given the responsibility to local authorities like collectors, municipal commissioners and CEOs to take the call. I would like to assure parents that their wards’ mental and health well-being is our top most priority. At the same time, we have to ensure that their academic progress is not hampered, especially in rural areas where we see prolonged break from schools and academics result in rise in dropout figure. Till now almost 4 lakh teaching and non-teaching staff has been tested for Covid of which around 3,000 employees were tested positive. So, the exercise helped us to ensure a safe environment in schools and no case of infection of teacher or student has been reported yet. Your appeal to municipal corporations who have not yet allowed schools to reopen? Though many municipal corporations have already restarted schools, some like Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad are yet to do so. My opinion is to review the Covid situation, but at the same time take steps to ensure that children from weak socio-economic background do not end up being dropouts because of gap in classes. As they won’t be able to compete with children who take digital classes, we have to be sympathetic towards them. We need to walk the extra mile to see how we can tap into possibilities of reopening schools. As schools have been closed for eight months, we need to take some calculated risks to bring back these children to classrooms. Update on teacher recruitment process that will start soon. We had advertised for 12,000 odd posts of which almost more than 6,000 posts have already been filled through a portal called “Pavitra Portal” which was launched as per the directions of the high court. With reports of corruptions and irregularities, the court sought a transparent process for recruitment. It is a merit-based online system and recruitments were done in last two years (before Covid). Ban on further recruitment in government posts was imposed be because of Covid situation. As many teachers are due to retire, we may face shortage in our schools and have put up the matter before the government. The state government allowed us to go ahead with the remaining recruitment of 6,000 posts from Class 1 to Class 12 across all managements, government and private. So, the process is on and, hopefully, in the next three months we would be able to recruit teachers, subject to various high court petitions. Advice to parents who are reluctant to send their children to schools? Our school management committees and education officers are regularly interacting with parents. In rural areas, resuming classes was not difficult as there is not much density and children are studying on farm lands. Reopening in cities is a problem because of population. We are trying our best to motivate them in a positive manner, but we cannot force them. So, we are taking steps to provide a risk-free environment on school campuses. What will you appeal to students of the state? I would like to tell students to make the most of this opportunity of being at homes as it is a rare occasion to remain indoors for such a long period. So, take care of your mental, social and physical well-being and emotional stability. Try to develop hobbies, help parents so that you learn dignity of labour and learn new things. I wish them a Happy New Year and hopefully the next year brings us good health and prosperous way ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/student-s-safety-top-priority-but-schools-need-to-restart-to-avoid-academic-loss-vishal-solanki/story-I0V1oYbw6gTMbHUuaMB9vN.html
17-12-2020||Pune||Former MLA Harshavardhan Jadhav remanded in police custody till Dec 18||Former Kannad legislator Harshavardhan Jadhav has been remanded in police custody till December 18 in a case related to physical assault of a couple in a road rage case in Pune. Jadhav (43), who was a legislator till May 2019, was arrested by the Chatuhshrungi police after he and his associate assaulted an elderly man and his wife in Aundh on Monday. Jadhav is the estranged son-in-law of Union minister Raosaheb Danve.Jadhav was booked after the victims’ son Aman Chadda (28), a resident of Bopodi, lodged a complaint against Jadhav and his associate identified as Isha Jha stating that they assaulted his parents, Ajay and Mamata Chadda, at a spot in front of a bank on an approach road towards Bremen chowk.Jadhav suddenly opened the door of his car which hit the couple’s approaching vehicle. Because of the car door, his mother, who was riding pillion, sustained an injury on the leg and his father lost balance and almost fell, according to the complaint.When his father questioned Jadhav about his “rash behaviour”, an enraged Jadhav got out of his car and got into an argument with the couple. The female colleague along with the former MLA allegedly abused and assaulted the couple.After the incident, based on the official complaint, Jadhav and his co-passenger Jha, were booked under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 325 (grievous hurt), 323 (voluntary causing hurt) , 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 34 (common Intention ) of the Indian Penal Code.DCP (Zone IV) Pankaj Deshmukh said, “Jadhav has been given police custody till December 18. We tried to give Jha a notice to which she declined and she has not approached us since then. We had sent a team to look for her since an offence has been lodged against her as well.”Police inspector Anil Shewale said, “Jadhav is now in police custody and investigation is on. We are on the lookout for the second accused in the case who is yet to be arrested.”According to advocate Zahir Pathan, he has filed anticipatory bail application on behalf of Isha Jha, the co-accused in the attempt to murder case, filed against ex MLA Harshwardhan Jadhav.Jadhav in May had released a video declaring his resignation from active politics after being influenced by spiritual reading. He is married to Sanjana Jadhav, the daughter of central cabinet minister Raosaheb Danve. He was part of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) when he made the announcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/former-mla-harshavardhan-jadhav-remanded-in-police-custody-till-dec-18/story-4qOi0S46eSDfTZiYOOvvRO.html

The meeting will be live-streamed to the public, and will end with a vote by two dozen scientists and industry representatives.

17-12-2020||World||Putin says Russia could have killed Navalny had it wanted to||President Vladimir Putin dismissed reports linking Russia’s secret services to the near-fatal poisoning of opposition leader Alexey Navalny, saying if authorities had wanted to kill the politician they would have succeeded.Accusing Navalny of ties to US intelligence, Putin said Russian agents needed to monitor him. “But this doesn’t mean at all we needed to poison him. Who is he of use to? If we had wanted to, we would have finished the job,” he told his annual press conference on Thursday.In a 4 1/2-hour video link with journalists from around the country, the Russian leader struck a confident tone, saying his nation had done better than the US and Europe in combating the coronavirus pandemic. The 68-year-old leader expressed caution, however, about taking the Russian vaccine that Moscow has used as a soft-power tool because it hasn’t been fully tested on people his age.Tensions have surged in recent months between Russia and European nations led by Germany over the poisoning of Navalny, who’s recovering in Berlin after a nerve-agent attack on him in Siberia in August that he and western governments have blamed on the Kremlin. The European Union in October sanctioned six senior Russian officials over the use of the banned poison.Navalny was followed from at least Jan. 2017 by a clandestine unit of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) that focused on poisons, investigative website Bellingcat reported this week, citing leaked phone and travel data.Navalny’s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, expressed shock at Putin’s comments. “I remind you this is the country’s president speaking,” she said on Instagram. “But the most important thing in Putin’s answer: he confirmed that FSB agents tailed Navalny. Only not to poison him but to follow him.” Navalny said later German prosecutors had questioned him Thursday at the request of Russian authorities.Putin expressed confidence that Moscow can at least partially improve fraught ties with Washington under incoming President Joe Biden, describing him as “experienced” in both foreign and domestic policy. President Donald Trump won’t leave political life given the broad support he has in the US after winning almost 50% of votes, he said.Putin blamed the US and its allies for increasing pressure on Russia, which he described as “white and fluffy” by comparison.Asked about the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which the Trump administration has sought to block with sanctions, Putin said he hoped the incoming US president wouldn’t oppose the project, which will be completed soon.As for his own future, Putin said he hasn’t yet decided if he will run again in presidential elections set for 2024. He has the right to serve two more terms until 2036 after removing limits in a constitutional overhaul this year.Putin said Russia is coping better than advanced economies in Europe and the US from the fallout of the pandemic, vowing to take steps to counter falling incomes, including announcing a new one-time payment for families with children.The world’s largest energy exporter warded off the crisis better than initially anticipated, mainly because many industries continued working through the pandemic and the size of its service sector is smaller than in western countries. After shrinking 4% this year, the economy may grow 2.6% next unless Covid-19 cases continue growing into the second half of 2021, which would curtail growth to 0.6%, according to the World Bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-says-russia-could-have-killed-navalny-had-it-wanted-to/story-TyjoKArEUilAQC23vPHVhJ.html
17-12-2020||World||Over 38 million people in England face highest Covid-19 curbs||More than 38 million people in England will be ordered to comply with the toughest level of coronavirus restrictions from Saturday after the government moved to slow a surge in infections.Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced Thursday that more parts of the east and southeast of England will face the toughest rules -- meaning 68% of England’s population will be under tier 3, 30% in tier 2, and just 2% in the lowest tier 1.The move is another huge blow to the hospitality industry ahead of Christmas, as tier 3 means pubs, restaurants, bars and indoor entertainment venues must close.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said the government’s job support program, which pays 80% of furloughed workers wages, will be extended by a month to the end of April. The Treasury’s loan programs will also now end in March, rather than January.London was moved to the highest tier on Wednesday after a rapid spread of infections across the capital in recent days. It will now be followed by the nearby counties of Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Hertfordshire, most of Surrey, and parts of Cambridgeshire, East Sussex and Hampshire, Hancock told the House of Commons. Cases increased by 46% in southeast England in the last week.The vast majority of regions already in tier 3, including Greater Manchester in northwest England, will stay in that bracket -- prompting anger from local lawmakers including senior Conservative Graham Brady, who said the region has already been in “severe restrictions” for nine months.The southwest city of Bristol and nearby north Somerset will move down to tier 2, and the West Midlands county of Herefordshire will drop to the lowest tier 1.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is going ahead with plans to let people celebrate with two other households over five days at Christmas, despite doctors warning the relaxation will lead to a spike in cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The public must “exercise a high degree of personal responsibility” and “avoid contact with elderly people wherever possible,” he said on Wednesday.Hancock said people must continue to “be cautious” as the U.K. rolls out a coronavirus vaccine.“We’ve come so far, we mustn’t blow it now,” he told Parliament. “I regret having to take the action that we have to take. I deem it necessary and there is a strong view right across government that these actions are necessary.”Johnson faces a looming battle with his own lawmakers when the restrictions are put to a vote at the end of January, with increasing numbers opposed to his coronavirus strategy.Conservative MP Stephen McPartland said on Twitter it is “ridiculous” that his Hertfordshire district had been moved into tier 3. “Totally unacceptable and clearly shows I was right to vote against a second lockdown and tier system,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-38-million-people-in-england-face-highest-covid-19-curbs/story-LaxkEzy7kQzb4fa1stpeeL.html
17-12-2020||World||Google’s ‘Star Wars’ Facebook pact is latest antitrust target||It reads like a grand conspiracy of the nerds.At the center of the latest antitrust lawsuit against Google is a bold claim: The company colluded with arch rival Facebook Inc. in an illegal deal to manipulate auctions for online advertising, an industry the two dominate. Google named the secret pact after a Star Wars character.“Any collaboration between two competitors of such magnitude should have set off the loudest alarm bells in terms of antitrust compliance,” the Texas lawsuit read. “Apparently, it did not.”Shares of smaller advertising technology providers rose when the complaint was filed on Wednesday. PubMatic Inc. surged 16%, while Magnite Inc. climbed 6%.“This allegation is inaccurate,” Google said in an emailed statement. “Facebook Audience Network (FAN) is one of over 25 companies participating in our Open Bidding program. There’s nothing exclusive about their involvement and they don’t receive special data. The whole goal of Open Bidding is to work with a range of ad networks and exchanges that are important to our publisher partners.” Facebook declined to comment.The complaint centers on automated ad technology called header bidding that routes digital ads into a live auction. It’s designed to increase the money web publishers, such as news outlets, can get for their ad real estate. With more bids from the widest array of sources, rates go up.By 2016, 70% of major publishers used header bidding from a variety of smaller advertising technology companies. That posed a threat to Google’s ad exchange system because the approach opened up the bidding process to other exchanges. So Google created a program to “secretly let its own exchange win,” according to the Texas suit. (This was named after a Star Wars character, although the state redacted the name.)Enter Facebook. The social network introduced header bidding for its own ad-selling tools in 2017. A year later, it brought it to mobile apps. This tool allowed Facebook to take small cuts of ads sold across the web and on mobile phones, not just on its own properties like Instagram.It also directly competed with Google. But Facebook soon pulled back from the practice. It did so, the Texas suit said, because Google cut a deal, signed at the “highest-level,” that let Facebook sell ads on mobile apps more quickly and gave it other advantages in ad auctions. This deal, too, was given a codename related to Star Wars. The suit redacted the name, but the Wall Street Journal reported it was “Jedi Blue.”“Google understood the severity of the threat to its position if Facebook were to enter the market and support header bidding,” Texas said in the complaint. “To diffuse this threat, Google made overtures to Facebook.”The suit, backed by several other states, also accused Google of tricking publishers into buying ads through Google services rather than header bidding.“If the AGs can back up those kinds of claims, well, this is a hell of a case and I think there could be massive liability,” said Chris Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. Allegations about the deal with Facebook set “this complaint significantly apart from any of the other major litigation pending against the dominant online platforms.”Still, extensive redactions make it hard to judge the strength of the evidence. If the details of the case end up being weak, the agreement might look “like a pretty garden-variety collaboration deal in which Facebook got some sort of functionality it needed from Google,” Sagers added.Header bidding is an arcane process in ad tech, an industry thick with suppliers, middlemen and marketers. While it’s automated, there are often bespoke deals. Major providers like Google, for instance, often give ad buyers and websites discounts in the auctions if enough money is flowing through.It’s a fairly common mechanism called “marking up,” giving a company an edge over others, according to Bob Walczak, an industry veteran and president of Lemma Media. A deal between two firms, even giants like Google and Facebook, could be standard practice, he said.“Maybe they’re rigging a game a little bit. But in the reality of ad tech, that’s commonplace,” said Walczak. “These are all just auction dynamics. These are business deals.”A Google spokeswoman said Facebook is one of 25 companies in an “open bidding” service the company’s exchange offers and receives no special data. The company declined to disclose the name of the Star Wars character.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-s-star-wars-facebook-pact-is-latest-antitrust-target/story-5ttLSKyEy7GbNsJS776CyK.html
17-12-2020||World||Every state in US saw personal incomes drop in third quarter||Every US state saw personal income drop in the third quarter as stimulus wound down, underscoring the need for fresh aid as Congress moves closer to a deal.West Virginia led declines, contracting 30% at an annual rate, as Michigan, Kentucky and Oklahoma all registered drops exceeding 20%, Commerce Department data showed Thursday.By comparison, incomes fell 1.6% in California and less than 1% in Georgia, where two Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections will determine control of the upper chamber.American incomes overall contracted the most since 2013 in the third quarter. State personal income fell 10% at an annual rate in the period, Commerce said. That marked a sharp deceleration from the prior quarter’s 36% jump, though total income remained higher than a year earlier, before the pandemic hit.Transfer receipts, which include state unemployment benefits and Medicaid, fell by $1.3 trillion in the third quarter after soaring $2.4 trillion in the prior period.Receipts were boosted earlier in the year by an added $600 weekly jobless benefit and $1,200 stimulus payment. The weekly unemployment top-up, however, expired at the end of July and the check was a one-time disbursement.The data highlight the benefits of economic stimulus at a time when unemployment is high and a spike in US coronavirus cases coupled with fresh restrictions keeping businesses closed are weighing on hiring.Congress is nearing a deal on fiscal stimulus, with Democrats pushing to include state and local governments that have made cuts amid the income shortfall. Meanwhile, additional unemployment benefits expire at the end of the year, as well as an eviction moratorium that has protected some Americans.More recent economic data point to a stalled recovery: claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly jumped to a three-month high last week. Also, US retail sales fell more than forecast in November, highlighting challenges for consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/every-state-in-us-saw-personal-incomes-drop-in-third-quarter/story-9XLgG0WXKfNi0RK3XhwmbI.html
17-12-2020||World||Facebook removes French, Russian accounts active in Africa||Individuals linked to Russia and the French military used fake Facebook and Instagram accounts to wage a covert disinformation campaign in the Central African Republic ahead of elections there this month, Facebook announced this week.Facebook said it took down hundreds of accounts and groups linked to France and Russia accused of “coordinated inauthentic behavior” in the Central African Republic as well as other countries in Africa and the Middle East.While accounts traced to Russia have been repeatedly accused of such activity, Facebook told The Associated Press this is the first time it has taken action against a network tied to individuals associated with a Western government. It has taken action against networks tied to political parties in the West in the past.Facebook’s move came ahead of elections Dec. 27 in the Central African Republic, which Facebook identified as the main target of the disinformation, at a time when both France and Russia have been jockeying for influence in the region.The company said its investigators traced the French accounts to “individuals associated with French military.” However, both Facebook and Graphika, a New York City social media analysis firm that investigated the accounts with Facebook, said they found no evidence of direct institutional involvement by the French government or military.The French military said in a statement Thursday to The Associated Press that it “firmly condemns” such disinformation efforts and is working alongside the UN and European partners to bring peace to CAR.“We are examining the results (of the Facebook-Graphika investigation), but at this stage, we’re not able to confirm any responsibility. There are many stakeholders in this struggle, public and civilian, which makes it difficult to assess the situation clearly,” the statement said.France was once the colonial power in Central African Republic and nearby countries that Facebook also identified as being targeted. Russian companies also have growing interests in the region.Facebook said it removed the networks for “violating our policy against foreign or government interference which is coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) on behalf of a foreign or government entity.”Russian officials have not publicly commented.Facebook said its investigation found links to individuals associated with Russia’s Internet Research Agency, a so-called troll farm accused of meddling in the 2016 US election, and Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has been indicted by the US Justice Department. Prigozhin has repeatedly denied any connections to the troll farm and its activities.The US Treasury Department has sanctioned mining businesses and employees tied to Prigozhin in the Central African Republic and claims his business activities there are coordinated with the Russian government. In a statement published this week on Russian social networks in response to media queries, Prigozhin claimed that Facebook is a tool of US intelligence agencies and “a group of oligarchs” serving to advance their interests around the world.Facebook said it has taken down the network of accounts that tried to meddle in the Central African Republic, which were among almost 500 inauthentic Facebook and Instagram accounts, pages and groups that targeted users in several African and the Middle Eastern nations with posts about Covid-19, politics or the military.“While we’ve seen influence operations target the same regions in the past, this was the first time our team found two campaigns — from France and Russia — actively engage with one another, including by befriending, commenting and criticizing the opposing side for being fake,” Facebook said in its report on the networks.In the Central African Republic, the dueling French and Russian troll operations tried to counter one another with Facebook posts, and at some points tried to expose the other, according to a report by Graphika.The Russian operation, primarily conducted in French, posted pro-Kremlin videos and applauded the Central African Republic’s incumbent President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, according to Graphika.The French operation, meanwhile, strayed away from talking about upcoming elections in posts. It began as early as May 2018, focusing on the Central African Republic and security in Mali.One Russian page that promoted Touadéra had 50,000 followers. Meanwhile, the largest following a French group amassed in the Central African Republic was 34 followers.“Facebook’s takedown marks a rare exposure of rival operations from two different countries going head to head for influence over a third country,” Graphika said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-removes-french-russian-accounts-active-in-africa/story-uL2kZ3n65eRo3dOfmS40kK.html
17-12-2020||World||Debunked Covid-19 myths survive online, despite facts||From speculation that the coronavirus was created in a lab to hoax cures, an overwhelming amount of false information clung to Covid-19 as it circled the globe in 2020.Public health officials, fact checkers and doctors tried to quash hundreds of rumors in myriad ways. But misinformation around the pandemic has endured as vexingly as the virus itself. And with the US, UK and Canada rolling out vaccinations this month, many falsehoods are seeing a resurgence online.A look at five stubborn myths around Covid-19 that were shared this year and continue to travel:MYTH: MASKS DON’T OFFER PROTECTION FROM THE VIRUSIn fact, they do.However, mixed messaging early on caused some confusion. US officials initially told Americans they did not need to wear or buy masks, at a time when there was a shortage of N95 masks for health workers. They later reversed course, urging the public to wear cloth masks and face coverings outside.The early messaging gave people “a little more room to take up these narratives” against wearing masks, explained Stephanie Edgerly, a communications professor at Northwestern University.Some social media users, for example, are still circulating a video from March of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious disease expert, saying people “should not be walking around with masks,” although he has since urged people to cover their faces in public. Versions of that clip have been watched millions of times on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.Online claims that masks are not an effective form of protection spiked again in October after US President Donald Trump and two US senators contracted Covid-19 during a Rose Garden ceremony, according to media intelligence firm Zignal Labs. Social media users claimed that the coverings must not be effective because the senators wore masks at some points during the event.But masks do prevent virus particles from spreading. Last month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which continues to advise Americans to wear masks, cited research that suggested masks can protect the wearer as well as other people.MYTH: THE VIRUS WAS MAN-MADEIt was not.Social media users and fringe websites weaved together a conspiracy theory that the virus was leaked — either accidentally or intentionally — from a lab in Wuhan, China, before the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic in March. The falsehood was espoused by elected officials, including Trump.The origins of the virus are far less scandalous: It likely originated in nature. Bats are thought to be the original or intermediary hosts for several viruses that have triggered recent epidemics, including Covid-19. US intelligence agencies also concluded the virus is not man-made.Yet the conspiracy theory continues to travel online, and made a resurgence in September when a Chinese virologist repeated the claim on Fox News.MYTH: Covid-19 IS SIMILAR TO THE FLUIn fact, Covid-19 has proved to be far deadlier.Early similarities between the symptoms of Covid-19 and influenza led many to speculate that there was not much difference between the two illnesses. Social media posts and videos viewed thousands of times online also claim that Covid-19 is no deadlier than the flu. Trump tweeted a faulty comparison between the flu and Covid-19 in March and October, as states implemented stay-at-home orders.Covid-19 has been blamed for more than 300,000 American deaths this year, and has killed roughly 1.5 million worldwide. By comparison, the CDC estimates there are 12,000 to 61,000 flu-related deaths annually.Covid-19 symptoms can be far more serious and persist for months. Health experts have also uncovered a range of bizarre coronavirus symptoms, from brain fog to swollen toes.MYTH: OFFICIALS ARE EXAGGERATING Covid-19’S TOLLThey are not.Social media users began photographing empty hospital waiting rooms earlier this year, claiming few people were sick with Covid-19. The photos and videos gained traction with the #FilmYourHospital hashtag, part of a right-wing conspiracy theory that public health officials and politicians were exaggerating Covid-19’s deadly toll. But fewer people are in waiting areas because hospitals started taking appointments virtually, canceling elective procedures and prohibiting visitors during the pandemic.This month, a Nevada doctor’s selfie at an empty makeshift care site set up to handle additional coronavirus patients was shared online as evidence that hospitals are not full. However, the photo was taken on Nov. 12, before the site opened. It has since served at least 200 patients.MYTH: THE VIRUS IS A PLOY TO FORCE GLOBAL VACCINATIONSThat’s not true.Anti-vaccine supporters have been pushing this conspiracy theory since January, when some falsely claimed online that the virus had been patented by pharmaceutical companies as a scheme to cash in on the illness. Some targeted billionaire and vaccine advocate Bill Gates, claiming he was part of a global plan around Covid-19 to microchip billions of people through mass vaccinations. Gates has not threatened to microchip anyone. Instead, he suggested creating a database of people who have been inoculated against the virus.Skepticism also has grown around the speed of vaccine development. A video viewed nearly 100,000 times on social media, for example, falsely claimed pharmaceutical companies skipped animal trials for the vaccines. In fact, the vaccines were tested on mice and macaques.The U.K., Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have authorized Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine. The FDA will review Moderna’s shot Thursday.Still, only about half of Americans say they are willing to get the vaccine, according to a survey this month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.Ongoing misinformation around the vaccine might drive some of that hesitancy.“I don’t think it was one myth that caused the problem,” said Nancy Kass, deputy director for public health at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. “It’s the fact that there were many, many, many myths.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/debunked-covid-19-myths-survive-online-despite-facts/story-j4WWYCB62Dq87lUyPHAAOJ.html
17-12-2020||World||Some vaccine doses kept too cold, Pfizer having manufacturing issues: Report||The first days of Pfizer Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout have seen unexpected hitches including some vaccines being stored at excessively cold temperatures and Pfizer reporting potential challenges in its vaccine production, US officials said on a Wednesday press call. At least two trays of Covid-19 vaccine doses delivered in California needed to be replaced after their storage temperatures dipped below minus 80 Celsius (minus 112 Fahrenheit), US Army General Gustave Perna said on the call. Pfizer’s vaccines, made with partner BioNTech SE, are supposed to be kept at around minus 70C. Officials are investigating whether storing the vaccines at excessively cold temperatures poses a safety or efficacy risk, he said. Pfizer also has reported some production issues, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said.“We will ensure that by whatever mechanism, that we provide them full support to ensure that they can produce for the American people,” Azar said.Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but its Chief Executive Albert Bourla told CNBC earlier this week the company was asking the US government to use the Defense Production Act to relieve some “critical supply limitations,” particularly in some components. He did not provide further details.Officials did not outline what the specific manufacturing challenges were. Ugur Sahin, chief executive of Pfizer’s partner BioNTech, told Reuters last week that Pfizer’s initial 2020 production target of 100 million doses was halved earlier this year in part over issues with raw materials supply. He said that has since been resolved and manufacturing has begun at scale. Officials said Wednesday they plan to allocate 2 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine next week and 5.9 million doses of Moderna Inc’s, assuming it receives regulatory authorization. Moderna’s vaccine is likely to be authorized as soon as Friday, they said.The US government is in talks with Pfizer to secure 100 million additional doses, US Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui said on the call. It had previously contracted with Pfizer for the option to buy up to 500 million additional doses at an unspecified price. Officials said on Wednesday the United States has already contracted for 300 million vaccine doses between the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and one from Moderna in the first half of next year, and 900 million doses in total from drugmakers developing Covid-19 vaccines.Officials said logistics companies United Parcel Services Inc and FedEx Corp are developing contingency plans for vaccine deliveries this week in response to forecasts of severe snowstorms in some parts of the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-vaccine-doses-kept-too-cold-pfizer-having-manufacturing-issues-report/story-5TgplCtnTxvD9TcHLhjsyK.html
17-12-2020||World||UK extends salary support program to contain unemployment||The British government on Thursday extended its salary support program by another month through to the end of April as it tries to keep a lid on unemployment as coronavirus restrictions slam businesses.The government confirmed it would carry on paying 80% of the salaries of those workers retained by firms rather than fired. It also extended its government-guaranteed Covid-19 business loan schemes for two months until the end of March.“We know the premium businesses place on certainty, so it is right that we enable them to plan ahead regardless of the path the virus takes, which is why we’re providing certainty and clarity by extending this support,” said Treasury chief Rishi Sunak.The UK, like others, has re-imposed onerous coronavirus restrictions following the resurgence of the virus. The government has expressed hope that by April the rollout of coronavirus vaccines will have changed the dynamics of the pandemic to allow some sort of normality to return to everyday life.Because most of the UK is currently facing stringent restrictions that involve the closure of certain sectors, notably pubs and restaurants, millions of people are not able to work. Many other businesses, such as in arts and entertainment, have not opened since the pandemic took root in March.The government launched in March the Job Retention Scheme and it has certainly helped - the UK recorded far smaller increases in unemployment than many other countries, such as the United States. Though the unemployment rate has risen to nearly 5% and is forecast to rise further, there were fears in the spring it would be double that.The Treasury says the scheme has protected nearly 10 million jobs across the UK with more than one million businesses accessing loans to help them through the crisis. It’s not been cheap — more than 45 billion pounds ($60 billion).The Bank of England has also been providing unprecedented support to the British economy over the past few months. However, on Thursday it held fire, keeping its main interest rate at the record low of 0.1% while maintaining the monetary stimulus already in place.It said the outlook remains “unusually uncertain” and “depends on the evolution of the pandemic and measures taken to protect public health, as well as the nature of, and transition to, the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom.”The bank’s forecasts are based on the assumption of a smooth adjustment to a new tariff-free trading relationship between the EU and the UK Were a deal not to emerge, tariffs and quotas would be imposed on many goods traded between the two sides, a development that most economists think would hurt the British economy relatively more.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey recently warned that failing to reach a new trade deal would have a greater long-term impact on the British economy than the long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic.The British economy is expected to end this year around 12% smaller than it started as a result of the pandemic and the restrictions on business activity and public life. That would be its deepest recession in three centuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-extends-salary-support-program-to-contain-unemployment/story-2dRg6PBp4daIdmq6OHKXkI.html

17-12-2020||World||Spain’s parliament votes to legalise euthanasia||Spain’s parliament voted Thursday to approve a bill that will allow physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia for long-suffering patients of incurable diseases or unbearable permanent conditions.The bill, which was backed by Spain’s left-wing coalition government and several other parties, passed in a 198-138 vote. The conservative Popular Party and the far-right Vox party voted “No.”The bill will now continue its legislative journey, facing a vote in the Senate where it is also expected to pass. According to the draft of the law approved by the lower house, it won’t go into effect until three months after being published in the government gazette.“As a society, we cannot remain impassive when faced with the intolerable pain that many people suffer,” Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa told lawmakers.Spain is following the footsteps of Iberian Peninsula neighbor Portugal, whose parliament approved similar bills to legalize physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia in February. Those bills have yet to become law and could yet face resistance from Portugal’s president.Euthanasia — when a doctor directly administers fatal drugs to a patient — is legal in Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. In some U.S. states, medically-assisted suicide — where patients administer the lethal drug themselves, under medical supervision — is permitted.A small group of people gathered outside Madrid’s lower house of parliament waving black flags with skulls and crossbones to protest the bill. Groups that support legislation to legalize medically assisted suicide planned rallies in cities across the country to celebrate the passing of the bill.The law will allow health professionals, both public and private, to assist patients who express their wish to die rather than continue suffering “a serious and incurable disease” or from a “debilitating and chronic condition” the person considers “unbearable.”Patients must ask to die on four different occasions during the process, which can last over a month. The first two requests must be in writing and submitted over two weeks apart. The patient must reaffirm that request a third time after consulting with a doctor and a fourth time just before undergoing the procedure to end his or her life.The process must be overseen by a medical team led by a physician and another doctor who acts as an external supervisor. An oversight board in each region must approve requests. The person asking to exercise his or her right to die must be a Spanish citizen or resident, of adult age, and able to make rational decisions.The law will also allow any medical worker to refuse to participate on grounds of belief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-s-parliament-votes-to-legalise-euthanasia/story-A2BhnOZKLlfXT4ZSHrOm8K.html
17-12-2020||World||EU’s Covid-19 vaccinations to begin from December 27, confirms European Commission president||“It’s Europe’s moment,” Ursula Von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, tweeted on Thursday confirming that Covid-19 vaccination will start across the European Union on December 27, 28 and 29, two days after Christmas. With the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine already being administered in the US and the UK, the announcement has come later than anticipated in the EU. However, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said in a press release that its human medicines body, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), is evaluating data available from Pfizer and BioNTech to provide Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA). Also, a CHMP meeting to discuss the same which was initially scheduled for December 29, 2020, has been advanced to December 21, 2020, to conclude the assessment, the statement said. Given that the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech was pioneered in Germany, it became difficult for the European leaders to explain to their citizens how the US and the UK approved the vaccine before the EU. The EMA has explained that the agency is looking for providing a conditional marketing authorization to the vaccine unlike the emergency approval that was given in the UK and the US. The EMA says conditional marketing authorization requires less comprehensive data than normal and the data should establish that the medicine’s benefits outweigh the risks posed. The manufacturer should also furnish complete clinical data in the future.Once CHMP gives its nod for the vaccine based on the assessment on December 21, 2020, EMA is expected to authorize the vaccine for usage in all EU and European Economic Area (EEA) countries, the statement said. This was confirmed by health-policy spokesman Stefan de Keersmaecker of the European Commission, who said, “As soon as EMA has adopted a positive recommendation, the commission will take a decision authorizing the vaccine on the market within two days.”EU has already placed orders for 300 million vaccine doses for its member states. It has also signed deals with Moderna, whose vaccine is currently under review by the US authorities and another deal for 200 billion doses of Novavax’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-s-covid-19-vaccinations-to-begin-from-december-27-confirms-european-commission-president/story-qOi8zcoV05cvI0O3LQsV2K.html

In a tweet, Trump said he was not involved in any criminal probe into the family. His tweet came just one day after Jeffrey Rosen, the incoming Acting Attorney General, declined to say in an interview with Reuters whether or not he would appoint a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden and his foreign business dealings.Trump, who leaves office on Jan. 20, has privately been mulling whether to pressure the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel for Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the matter.On December 9, Hunter Biden disclosed his tax affairs were under investigation by the US Attorney for the District of Delaware. Hunter Biden has long been the subject of Republican attacks.Trump and his allies have often raised questions about potential conflicts of interest from his position on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma at the time his father was vice president to Democratic President Barack Obama, and also called for probes into his efforts to raise capital for a Chinese fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-nothing-to-do-with-potential-prosecution-of-hunter-biden/story-EVhZr9yi6Rr2Ul3S7Y2qjI.html
17-12-2020||World||US Joint Chiefs chairman meets with Taliban on peace talks||The top US general held unannounced talks with Taliban peace negotiators in the Persian Gulf to urge a reduction in violence across Afghanistan, even as senior American officials in Kabul warned that stepped-up Taliban attacks endanger the militant group’s nascent peace negotiations with the Afghan government.Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met for about two hours with Taliban negotiators in Doha, Qatar, on Tuesday and flew Wednesday to Kabul to discuss the peace process with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.Although Milley reported no breakthrough, his Taliban meetings represent a remarkable milestone — America’s top general coming face-to-face with representatives of the group that ruled Afghanistan until it was ousted 19 years ago this month in the early stages of what became America’s longest war. Milley served three tours of duty in Afghanistan, the first in 2003 and the last in 2013-14.Milley’s meetings came amid a new drawdown of US troops, although under current US policy a complete pullout hinges on the Taliban reducing attacks nationwide.“The most important part of the discussions that I had with both the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan was the need for an immediate reduction in violence,” Milley told three reporters, including one from The Associated Press, who accompanied him to Qatar and Afghanistan. “Everything else hinges on that.”Under ground rules set by Milley for security reasons, the journalists traveling with him agreed not to report on either set of talks until he had departed the region. It was Milley’s second unannounced meeting with the Taliban’s negotiating team; the first, in June, also in Doha, had not been reported until now.Army Gen. Scott Miller, the top commander of US and coalition forces in Afghanistan, said in an interview at his military headquarters in Kabul on Wednesday that the Taliban have stepped up attacks on Afghan forces, particularly in the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar, and against roadways and other infrastructure.“My assessment is, it puts the peace process at risk — the higher the violence, the higher the risk,” Miller said. Miller meets at least once a month with Taliban negotiators as part of Washington’s effort to advance a peace process.Speaking in the same interview, Ross Wilson, the ranking American diplomat in Kabul, said he also sees growing risk from Taliban violence. He said it has created “an unbearable burden” on the Afghan armed forces and the society as a whole.In the so-called Doha agreement signed last February by the United States and the Taliban, the administration of President Donald Trump agreed to a phased withdrawal of US troops, going down to zero troops by May 2021 if the agreement’s conditions are upheld. One condition is a reduction in violence by the Taliban, leading to a nationwide ceasefire. The Taliban also agreed to begin peace negotiations with the Afghan government, which are in an early stage.The Taliban have demanded a halt to US airstrikes, which have been conducted since February only in support of Afghan forces under Taliban attack.Miller said he was saddened by what he called the Taliban’s deliberate campaign to damage roadways, bridges and other infrastructure as part of the militants’ effort to limit the Afghan government’s ability to reinforce its troops.“Military commanders on the ground are now starting to do things that are not conducive to peace talks and reconstruction and stability,” Miller said, adding, “Clearly, the Taliban use violence as leverage” against the Afghan government.Miller said he is executing Trump’s order to reduce US forces from 4,500 to 2,500 by Jan. 15, just days before Joe Biden is sworn in as Trump’s successor. Miller said troop levels are now at about 4,000 and will reach the 2,500 target on time.Biden has not said publicly whether he will continue the drawdown or how he will proceed with the Doha agreement negotiated by Trump’s peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad.Biden has not laid out a detailed plan for Afghanistan but has made clear he prefers a small US military footprint and limited goals. He has acknowledged that he dissented from then-President Barack Obama’s decision in December 2009 to vastly increase troop levels in hope of forcing the Taliban to the peace table.“I think we should only have troops there to make sure that it’s impossible for... ISIS or al-Qaida to re-establish a foothold there,” Biden told CBS News in February.Trump has argued for withdrawing entirely from Afghanistan but was persuaded in November to reduce the force to 2,500 and continue the current missions of counterterrorism and training and advising Afghan forces.Some believe that the further thinning of US forces in coming weeks could lead to renewed Taliban gains on the battlefield and a weakening of the Afghan government’s position at the peace table.Stephen Biddle, a defense policy expert with the Council on Foreign Relations and professor of international relations at Columbia University, says the main contribution of US forces at this stage is political rather than military.“In military terms, the war is a slowly decaying stalemate,” Biddle said in congressional testimony last month. “The US presence can slow the rate of decay at the margin, but we cannot reverse it absent a major reinforcement that seems highly unlikely. This means that if the war continues, the Taliban will eventually prevail regardless of plausible variations in the size or nature of the US troop commitment.”Milley’s visit comes in the 20th year of a war initially aimed at overthrowing the Taliban regime, running al-Qaida out of the country and laying the groundwork for a global “war on terrorism.” It turned into something more ambitious yet less well-defined and became far more costly in blood and treasure.Looking back on the long-stalemated war, Milley earlier this month proclaimed the US and its coalition partners had achieved “a modicum of success.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-joint-chiefs-chairman-meets-with-taliban-on-peace-talks/story-opyhVqsVoFmb9o4UrINFTN.html
17-12-2020||World||Putin denies involvement in poisoning of Kremlin critic Navalny||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday rejected allegations that the Kremlin was behind the poisoning of his top political foe, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and accused US intelligence agencies of fomenting the claims even as he held out hope for better ties with Washington.Putin also voiced hope that the administration of President-elect Joe Biden would move to extend the last remaining US-Russian arms control pact that is set to expire in early February.Speaking via video hookup during his annual marathon news conference that lasted 4 1/2 hours, the Russian leader countered the accusations by saying that if the Kremlin wanted to poison Navalny, it would have succeeded.“If there was such a desire, it would have been done,” Putin said with a chuckle.Navalny fell sick on Aug. 20 during a domestic flight in Russia and was flown while still in a coma to Berlin for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.Russian authorities have vehemently denied any involvement in the poisoning.On Monday, the investigative group Bellingcat and Russian outlet The Insider released a report alleging that operatives from the FSB, Russia’s domestic security agency, which is a top KGB successor, followed Navalny during his trips since 2017, had “specialized training in chemical weapons, chemistry and medicine,” and ”were in the vicinity of the opposition activist in the days and hours of the time-range during which he was poisoned.”The investigation, done also in cooperation with CNN and Der Spiegel, identified the supposed FSB operatives and laboratories working on poisons like Novichok after analyzing telephone metadata and flight information. It mentioned two instances in 2019 and 2020, in which Navalny or his wife Yulia suffered from unexplained symptoms.Navalny said the investigation has proven beyond doubt that FSB operatives tried to kill him on Putin’s orders.In his first comment since the report’s publication, Putin charged that it relied on data provided by US spy agencies. Its authors have denied any link to US or any other Western intelligence services.“It’s not some kind of investigation, it’s just the legalization of materials provided by US special services,” he said, adding that it means that Navalny “relies on the support of US special services.”“It’s curious, and in that case, special services indeed need to keep an eye on him,” Putin said. “But that doesn’t mean that there is a need to poison him. Who would need that?”He alleged that Navalny was accusing the Kremlin of ordering to poison him in order to raise his political profile. As before, Putin refrained from mentioning Navalny by name, referring to him as a “blogger” and the “Berlin patient.”Navalny tweeted after the news conference that Putin effectively confirmed the investigative report proving that the FSB was shadowing him for nearly four years. “It’s impossible to deny our concrete proof,” he said.Even as Putin accused US spy agencies, he held the door open for cooperation with the incoming administration. Putin congratulated Biden on his victory earlier this week.“We proceed from the assumption that the newly elected US president would realize what’s going on. He’s quite experienced in both domestic and foreign policies, and we hope that the problems that have emerged, at least some of them, would be solved under the new administration,” Putin said.He noted that Russia remains ready to extend the last remaining US-Russian nuclear arms control pact still standing, the New START, which expires in early February. He added that the deal’s demise would “leave no restrictions on weapons systems.”Putin emphasized that Russia is ready to discuss its new hypersonic weapons system, including the Avangard glide vehicle, in future arms control talks with the United States.He said the development of other weapons systems that he announced in 2018, including the Poseidon nuclear drone and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, was proceeding according to plan and they would enter service. Putin emphasized that Moscow built those weapons in response to prevent the US-designed missile defense system from eroding Russia’s nuclear deterrent.Russia-US relations have sunk to post-Cold War lows after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Putin has reaffirmed Russian denials of meddling in the 2016 vote to help Donald Trump win and rejected media reports earlier this month that alleged a new attack by Russian hackers, charging that US authorities had made the claims for domestic policy goals.Asked if Russia would offer Trump political asylum and a job after he steps down, Putin responded that “Trump doesn’t need a job.”“He has quite a broad base of support in the United States and, as far as I understand, he has no intention to leave the country’s politics,” Putin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-denies-involvement-in-poisoning-of-kremlin-critic-navalny/story-kLeQi2LDkQULKyvxVSIhBO.html
17-12-2020||World||US jobless claims unexpectedly jump to highest in three months||Applications for US state unemployment benefits unexpectedly jumped to the highest level in three months, suggesting the labour market’s recovery is faltering amid the surge in Covid-19 cases and widening business restrictions.Initial jobless claims in regular state programs rose by 23,000 to 885,000 in the week ended December 12, Labour Department data showed Thursday. On an unadjusted basis, the figure fell by about 21,000.Continuing claims for state programs declined by 273,000 to 5.51 million in the week ended December 5. That figure roughly approximates the number of people receiving state unemployment benefits, but doesn’t include the millions of people who have already exhausted those benefits or are receiving assistance through federal pandemic jobless aid programs.A Bloomberg survey of economists had called for 818,000 initial state claims and 5.7 million continuing claims on an adjusted basis.The increase in initial claims reflects rising filings in California and Illinois, two states where governments have imposed particularly restrictive lockdowns in the wake of the latest Covid-19 surge. That, paired with cooler weather, has led to additional job losses and growing risks for the economy in the months before widespread vaccine distribution.With the outlook shaky, US lawmakers are working out final details of a new relief package that would extend pandemic jobless aid, while the Federal Reserve on Wednesday pledged to maintain its massive bond purchases until employment and inflation make “substantial further progress.”US stock futures pared gains following the report, while 10-year Treasury yields fell.The latest initial claims data also coincide with the reference period for the December jobs report, adding to signs that the month could show a weakening labour market after payrolls increased by 245,000 in November, less than half the October gain.On top of regular state claims, about 455,000 initial claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance were filed last week. The program, which provides jobless benefits to those not typically eligible like the self-employed and gig workers, is set to expire later this month without congressional action. There were 9.24 million continued weeks claimed for PUA in the week ended November 28, up about 689,000 from the prior week.In the same week, there were 4.8 million continuing claims for Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, the federal program that provides up to 13 additional weeks of benefits to those who have exhausted their regular state benefits. That program is also set to expire.While the labour market is struggling, housing remains a bright spot in the economy amid ultra-low interest rates and demand for more space. A separate government report on Thursday showed new home construction rose more than forecast to a nine-month high in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-unexpectedly-jump-to-highest-in-three-months/story-oj7ndohOtI4m3QHMoOR2cL.html

17-12-2020||World||Google wins EU approval for Fitbit bid amid tech crackdown||Google won European Union approval for its $2.1 billion takeover of health tracker Fitbit Inc., days after regulators proposed tougher rules to curb powerful technology firms’ push into new services.The European Commission said Google’s pledge to maintain access for rival health and fitness apps and device makers for 10 years removed its concerns about the company’s move into health data and devices. Smaller rivals previously complained that the company’s promises might not go far enough to stop Google shutting off access in future to rival products or services.“The commitments will determine how Google can use the data collected for ad purposes, how interoperability between competing wearables and Android will be safeguarded and how users can continue to share health and fitness data, if they choose to,” Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s antitrust chief, said in a statement Thursday.Approval comes in a harsh climate when Google and others are facing mounting scrutiny of acquisitions that help them push into new areas. Google announced its plans to buy Fitbit in November 2019, describing the bid for the smartwatch maker as a boost to its lagging hardware business.Mountain View, California-based Google said it understood “that regulators wanted to look closely at this transaction, and we have worked constructively with them to resolve their concerns, including the set of legally binding commitments.”Its promises “build on assurances we have made since the beginning that we are committed to protecting Fitbit users’ privacy and will continue to invest in and support manufacturers and developers,” the company said.Google pledged not to use Fitbit’s data about users’ health and fitness for online advertising and to store Fitbit’s data separately from its ad services. The company will ensure that European users can grant or deny Google access if they want Google services to link up with Fitbit information. The EU said it can extend this pledge for an extra 10 years if necessary “because of Google’s entrenched position in the market for online advertisement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-wins-eu-approval-for-fitbit-bid-amid-tech-crackdown/story-eg2aQ08M47sWuQ1s2VykhP.html

London is among cities in the highest Tier 3 of the three-level alert system, with the toughest restrictions.Speaking to the BBC and other news organisations, Patel said, “I would urge people to change. I won’t be seeing my parents this Christmas. My parents live in a different part of the country and I will not travel to see them.“I want to protect them, I don’t want to be spreading the virus. I feel I will take that responsibility and others will make that judgement too. We would urge everyone to be conscientious and to make the appropriate plans and the appropriate changes to their plans as well, hence the point about having a smaller and shorter Christmas.”“I think the British public are smart enough to make their own decisions and judgements and they don’t want to put themselves at risk, they won’t put their friends and families at risk,” she added.Johnson and other ministers have been repeatedly calling for caution over the Christmas period, urging people not to travel long distances to meet families. As of Wednesday evening, 25,161 new cases and 612 were recorded in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/consider-cancelling-christmas-priti-patel-tells-britons-to-play-it-safe-as-pandemic-rages/story-kBlwJNoef94cuF5673Ry6K.html
17-12-2020||World||‘Scandal… political stunt,’ says UK minister on Unicef feeding poor kids in London||A cabinet minister in the UK has described the Unicef’s effort to fund a school project in London to feed hungry children hit by the Covid-19 pandemic as a “scandal” and a “political stunt”.Labour Party leaders called it a “disgrace” that children in one of the richest countries in the world had to be fed by the Unicef, which usually focuses on the poor in developing countries. The UN organisation is spending £25,000 to provide breakfasts in 25 schools in London’s Southwark.Asked about the initiative in the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House with a cabinet ministerial status, criticised the UN organisation, saying it should be ashamed of itself.An official spokesperson said lowest-paid families were being supported through the pandemic.Responding to a remark from Labour MP Zarah Sultana, Rees-Mogg said, “I think it is a real scandal that the Unicef should be playing politics in this way when it is meant to be looking after people in the poorest, the most deprived, countries of the world where people are starving, where there are famines and where there are civil wars. And they make cheap political points of this kind, giving, I think, 25,000 (British pounds) to one council. It is a political stunt of the lowest order. The Unicef should be ashamed of itself.”Charity organisations have highlighted the growing dependence in recent years on food banks, which provide free groceries and food to people in need. The Unicef is funding the School Food Matters project that supports children over the Christmas period and later.Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said, “The fact that the Unicef is having to step in to feed our country’s hungry children is a disgrace and (UK PM) Boris Johnson and (UK chancellor) Rishi Sunak should be ashamed.“We are one of the richest countries in the world. Our children should not have to rely on humanitarian charities that are used to operating in war zones and in response to natural disasters.”“Charities and businesses across the country have done a brilliant job of stepping in where the government has failed, but it should have never come to this,” she added.Anna Kettley, the director of programmes at Unicef UK, said, “This is the Unicef’s first ever emergency response within the UK, introduced to tackle the unprecedented impact of the coronavirus crisis and reach the families most in need.”“This funding will help build stronger communities as the impact of the pandemic worsens, but ultimately a longer-term solution is needed to tackle the root causes of food poverty, so no child is left to go hungry,” she added.A government spokesperson said, “We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond. That’s why we have raised the living wage, boosted welfare support by billions of pounds and introduced the £170 million Covid winter grant scheme to help children and families stay warm and well-fed during the coldest months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scandal-political-stunt-says-uk-minister-on-unicef-feeding-poor-kids-in-london/story-gr3k66BxIVz8cjWmFX4TLI.html

The new law passed by parliament widened the circumstances that could constitute rape - under the old legislation, prosecutors had to show the rapist had used violence or attacked someone who was unable to resist.“Now it will be clear, that if both parties do no consent to sex, then it’s rape,” justice minister Nick Haekkerup said in a statement.A similar law introduced in neighbouring Sweden in 2018 resulted in a 75% rise in rape convictions. Around 11,400 women a year are raped or subjected to attempted rape in Denmark, according to the ministry’s figures. Amnesty International said Denmark had become the 12th country in Europe to recognise non-consensual sex as rape.“This is a great day for women in Denmark as it consigns outdated and dangerous rape laws to the dustbin of history and helps to end pervasive stigma and endemic impunity for this crime,” the campaign group’s Women’s Rights Researcher, Anna Blus, said.The law will take effect on Jan. 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-strengthens-rape-laws-criminalises-sex-without-explicit-consent/story-41o3lFtjHbN4dJrXPuAwYN.html
17-12-2020||World||Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine over 95% effective: Vladimir Putin||Sputnik V, the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine, is over 95 per cent effective, said Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.Taking to Twitter, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) cited Putin saying that some health specialists have claimed that the vaccine’s protection level reaches up to 96-97 per cent.“Putin: Russia has been the first country in the world, which has invented and started to produce the COVID19 vaccine. And we have a good vaccine, safe and efficient - over 95 percent - and specialists say its protection level reaches 96-97 per cent,” tweeted MFA Russia.Earlier this week, the efficacy of the Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine has been confirmed to be 91.4 per cent, based on data analysis of the final control point of clinical trials, announced the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).“The data analysis at the third and final control point of the Sputnik V vaccine clinical trials confirmed its efficacy over 90 per cent. Clinical trials have proven this in the three consecutive statistically important points described in the trial protocol,” remarked RDIF Chief Executive Officer Kirill Dmitriev.Russia became the first country to register the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine on August 11, Sputnik V, named after Russia’s first satellite.Western experts have expressed scepticism at the speed at which the purported vaccine was developed and Russia has not provided any data to back up its claims for the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-sputnik-v-vaccine-over-95-effective-vladimir-putin/story-uMoKgMmu5osadEVEfVp6IK.html
17-12-2020||World||Putin says will receive Covid-19 vaccine when he can, urges mass vaccination||President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he was yet to be inoculated with the Russian-made vaccine against Covid-19 but that he would do so when possible.Speaking at his annual news conference, Putin also said Russia needed to step up production of its Sputnik V vaccine and that some of its components could be made abroad.Russia rolled out the Sputnik V jab to medics and other frontline workers in Moscow this month, and more than 200,000 people across the country have already been vaccinated.“As for the need for mass or universal vaccination, I think this should be done... This is exactly what should create immunity in the population nationwide,” Putin said.The Russian leader has gone to great lengths not to contract the novel coronavirus, running the world’s largest country mainly from his residence outside Moscow rather than working from the Kremlin.But he said citizens in other age groups were receiving the Russian-made vaccine before he could have access to it.“I am a fairly law-abiding person,” said Putin, 68, when asked if he had been inoculated against Covid-19. “I listen to the recommendations of our specialists. So I haven’t had the shot yet. But I will absolutely do it as soon as that becomes possible.”He added: “Our vaccine is effective and safe, so I see no reason not to be vaccinated.”Putin said he was confident that a plan for British drugmaker AstraZeneca to test a combination of its vaccine with Russia’s Sputnik V would yield results.“Our foreign colleagues, thank God, have also turned to face us and are ready for cooperation in an area where something isn’t working out for them,” he said.He said Russia needed to focus on stepping up production capacity by building factories, equipment and companies.“Nothing is stopping us producing the components of the vaccine themselves at facilities in foreign states,” he added.The marathon annual news conference, expected to last up to four hours, was dominated by questions about the pandemic from journalists and citizens in studios across Russia. Two hours in, with Putin still in full flow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged participants to change their masks.Peskov said in June that the Russian leader was protected from the coronavirus by special disinfection tunnels that anyone visiting his residence or meeting him in the Kremlin must pass through.Putin is regularly tested for the virus, Peskov has said.Russia has recorded more than 2.7 million infections and 49,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic.Data published this week found the Sputnik V vaccine, which Russian regulators approved in August after less than two months of human testing, to be 91.4% effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-says-will-receive-covid-19-vaccine-when-he-can-urges-mass-vaccination/story-0MZqBU1Qxt1rqDx4SIZFoK.html
17-12-2020||World||China puts the pedal to the metal on vaccine diplomacy. There are concerns | Analysis||Turkey has joined a growing list of 100-plus countries who, Chinese state media claims, have ordered Covid shots produced by Chinese companies despite an unusual delay in the release of data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.China controversially launched the emergency vaccine use programme in July this year, mostly directed at frontline workers and those travelling abroad. Over the next four months, the government-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) has said a million people in China have taken the experimental vaccine. But Beijing hasn’t put out any information about the safety or efficacy of the vaccine that relies on a killed virus, similar to how polio immunizations work.The first bit of information on this account came from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that went ahead to approve Sinopharm’s vaccine on 9 December, citing data from its Phase III clinical trials. The UAE health ministry said the trials had shown an 86% efficacy, short of the 94.1% reported for Moderna’s vaccine and 95% for the Pfizer-BioNTech collaboration. Abu Dhabi’s move to announce the 86% figure is unusual because there has been no statement from the company on the efficacy of its vaccine.ALSO WATCH | ‘Learn from Sri Lanka’: CDS Gen Bipin Rawat cautions Nepal on ties with China “Usually [clinical trial] data is revealed by the sponsor and eventually published in a peer-reviewed journal,” Peter Shapiro, senior director of drugs at GlobalData, told Nikkei Asia.Bahrain followed the UAE’s footsteps days later. And the first shipment of Chinese Sinopharm’s vaccine cleared by close ally UAE landed in Egypt soon after. By then, Indonesia had received 1.2 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine made by Chinese company Sinovac Biotech’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine CoronaVac; another 1.8 million doses will arrive in January.Analysts have described the Chinese effort to promote and push its vaccines as an opportunity for Beijing to bolster its international influence in the developing world, particularly after funding for President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative slowed down and criticism mounted over its handling of the emergence of the coronavirus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. It was in this context that President Xi had, back in May, promised to the World Health Assembly to make the Chinese vaccine a “global public good”.“It has also become a tool to increase China’s global influence and iron out... geopolitical issues,” Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations told AFP earlier this month.Besides, analysts warn that the vaccine diplomacy, as China’s outreach to the developing world has been called, may not be unconditional.“Beijing may use its vaccine donations to advance its regional agenda, particularly on sensitive issues such as its claims in the South China Sea,” Ardhitya Eduard Yeremia and Klaus Heinrich Raditio said, according to news agency AFP, in a paper published this month by the Singapore-based Yusof Ishak Institute.It also makes economic sense for China. According to an estimate by a Hong Kong-based brokerage firm Essence Securities cited by the news agency, China could tap gold at the bottom of the pyramid, netting around $2.8 billion in sales if Beijing can capture just 15% of the vaccine market in middle and low-income countries.Not everyone, however, is willing to bet on the Chinese vaccines in the absence of data on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy.For one, Cambodia, China’s closest ally in the region, has unveiled plans to acquire 1 million doses for the first batch of Covid-19 vaccinations. It has, however, made it clear that it won’t go for untested vaccines but use the United Nations-backed Covax facility that subsidises vaccines for 92 lower-income countries.“Cambodia is not a dustbin... and not a place for a vaccine trial,” Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said this month, a clear signal that Phnom Penh is unlikely to, at this stage, take up Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang on his offer in October to supply the vaccines on priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-puts-the-pedal-to-the-metal-on-vaccine-diplomacy-there-are-concerns-analysis/story-wIg0AsghkxVa1ghlnfAxTJ.html
17-12-2020||World||Covid-19: China assures cooperation with visiting WHO team||Beijing on Thursday said it was ready to cooperate with the World Health Organization (WHO) in tracing the origin of the novel coronavirus, a day after the global public health body announced it was sending a team of investigators to China next year.A team of 10 experts led by the WHO is expected to visit Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged in December last year.The Chinese foreign ministry did not directly comment on the upcoming visit or share details but assured cooperation.“China stands ready to enhance its cooperation with the WHO to advance the global tracing efforts and contribute our share in our early victory against the pandemic,” said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, on Thursday.Wang added that since the Covid-19 outbreak, China has taken the lead in conducting traceability cooperation with the WHO in an open, transparent and responsible manner.China, however, has strongly opposed calls for an international inquiry into the origins of the virus, saying such calls are anti-China.It has been more open to a WHO-led investigation, and allowed experts from the organisation to visit China twice.Several countries including the US and Australia have called for an international investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus. It has become one of the reasons for deteriorating ties between Beijing on one hand, and Washington and Canberra on the other.In Singapore, a WHO official said on Thursday that Beijing will welcome an international team of Covid-19 investigators due to travel in January.“WHO continues to contact China and to discuss the international team and the places they visit,” Babatunde Olowokure, the WHO’s regional emergencies director in the Western Pacific, told a news conference on Thursday.“Our understanding at this time is that China is welcoming the international team and their visit... This is anticipated, as far as we are aware, to happen in early January,” he was quoted as saying by Reuters. “It’s really not about finding a guilty country,” Fabian Leendertz of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute told AP, adding that the WHO was not seeking to fix the blame but attempting to prevent future outbreaks.The emergence of the coronavirus was linked to a wet market in Wuhan, though Beijing has been pushing the narrative that it could have been circulating in other countries before it was detected in the Chinese city.“The present pandemic started almost certainly in the People’s Republic of China. Genetic analysis of the virus suggests that it originated in a bat and was transmitted to humans via a yet unknown animal, possibly a mammal used as food or for fur production,” Alexander Kekule, director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research in Halle, Germany, told HT in an email recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-china-assures-cooperation-with-visiting-who-team/story-8ppRox1TXlCZ53x7DniRDM.html
17-12-2020||World||Moon rocks in hand, China prepares for future moon missions||Following the successful return of moon rocks by its Chang’e 5 robotic probe, China is preparing for future missions that could set the stage for an eventual lunar base to host human explorers, a top space program official said Thursday.China’s next three lunar missions are on track, along with programs for returning samples from Mars and exploring asteroids and the planet Jupiter, Deputy Chief Commander of the China Lunar Exploration Program Wu Yanhua said.“Exploring the truth of the universe is just beginning,” Wu said at a news conference held hours after the Chang’e 5′s capsule parachuted to a landing in Inner Mongolia carrying the first lunar samples to be brought to Earth in more than 40 years.Named after the Chinese goddess of the moon, the Chang’e program has made three landings there, including on its less explored far side. Chang’e 6, scheduled for a 2023 launch, is to collect more samples from the lunar south pole, while its two successors are to conduct detailed surveys and test technologies needed for the construction of a science base on the moon.No dates have been given for Chang’e 7 and 8, or for a crewed mission to the moon that China says is in the works, or for the construction of a lunar base.“China is willing to keep on contributing to the world and enhancing human well-being with Chinese space solutions,” Wu said.The capsule of the Chang’e 5 probe and its cargo of samples were flown to the space program’s Beijing campus after landing just before 2 a.m. on Thursday.The mission achieved firsts for China’s lunar exploration program in collecting samples, launching a vehicle from the moon’s surface and docking it with the capsule to transfer the samples for their voyage to Earth, the China National Space Administration said in a statement issued following the landing.“As our nation’s most complex and technically groundbreaking space mission, Chang’e 5 has achieved multiple technical breakthroughs ... and represents a landmark achievement,” it said.China in 2003 became just the third country to send an astronaut into orbit on its own after the Soviet Union and the United States and its space program has proceeded along a steady, cautious track, largely avoiding the fatalities and launch failures that marred the US-Soviet space race of the 1960s.Wu said the latest flight featured collaboration with the European Space Agency, along with Argentina, Namibia, Pakistan and other nations with which Chinese cooperates on monitoring and communicating with its spacecraft. China in the future will “encourage more scientists around the world to participate to obtain more scientific results,” Wu said.One exception remains the United States. Amid concerns over the Chinese space program’s secrecy and close military connections, American law forbids cooperation between NASA and the CNSA unless Congress gives its approval. That has prevented China from taking part in the International Space Station and helped drive Beijing to launch a now-defunct experimental space station and formulate plans to complete a permanent orbiting outpost within the next two years.Two of Chang’e 5’s four modules set down on the moon on Dec. 1 and collected about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of samples by scooping them from the surface and drilling 2 meters (about 6 feet) into the moon’s crust. The samples were deposited in a sealed container that was carried back to the return module by an ascent vehicle.The newly collected rocks are thought to be billions of years younger than those obtained earlier by the US and former Soviet Union, offering new insights into the history of the moon and other bodies in the solar system. They come from a part of the moon known as the Oceanus Procellarum, or Ocean of Storms, near a site called the Mons Rumker that was believed to have been volcanic in ancient times.As with the 382 kilograms (842 pounds) of lunar samples brought back by US astronauts from 1969 to 1972, they will be analyzed for age and composition and are expected to be shared with other countries.The age of the samples will help fill in a gap in knowledge about the history of the moon between roughly 1 billion and 3 billion years ago, Brad Jolliff, director of the McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences at Washington University in the US city of St. Louis, wrote in an email. They may also yield clues as to the availability of economically useful resources on the moon such as concentrated hydrogen and oxygen, Jolliff said.“These samples will be a treasure trove!” Jolliff wrote. “My hat is off to our Chinese colleagues for pulling off a very difficult mission; the science that will flow from analysis of the returned samples will be a legacy that will last for many, many years, and hopefully will involve the international community of scientists.”Whether US researchers will have access to the samples depends on American policy, Wu said.“Regardless of whether they are American government departments, commercial operations, scientists or engineers, we sincerely seek friendly cooperation on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and peaceful application,” Wu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moon-rocks-in-hand-china-prepares-for-future-moon-missions/story-Q4QMaBQ06D0wTlGLzmJYlK.html
17-12-2020||World||Covid-19: Pregnant women missing from most clinical trials||Pregnant women have been excluded from 75% of Covid-19 treatment trials, which puts potential effectiveness of treatment at risk, as well as the safety of pregnant women who may be at increased risk of severe illness, according to a new study published by the Lancet Global Health journal.Pregnant women are among those most in need of safe and effective therapies against Covid-19, but they are routinely excluded from the majority of clinical treatment trials, says the study that was based on a review of international trial registry data.The study found that three-quarters of Covid-19 trials reviewed specifically excluded expectant mothers, even though they were investigating medications and vitamins that already have a relatively favourable safety profile during pregnancy, or that are already used in pregnant women.The study’s authors say that given the scale of the pandemic and those that will inevitably follow, there is a public health obligation to include pregnant women in treatment trials to identify and provide appropriate management and care.“Without explicit and proactive efforts to recruit and retain pregnant women in therapeutic trials for Covid-19, expectant mothers will suffer from having fewer medical options available to them, because we are not including them in clinical trials,” said author Melanie Taylor from the World Health Organization (WHO) in Switzerland and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).“There is a very real possibility that treatment could become approved for treatment of Covid-19 without evidence-based guidance for use in pregnant women,” Taylor said.Co-author Loulou Kobeissi from the WHO and HRP in Switzerland adds, “The systematic exclusion of pregnant women cannot be justified on the basis of safety as many of the medications being evaluated are either not harmful in pregnancy, or their risks are minimal.“We are concerned that the resulting evidence gaps and delays will limit our understanding of the effects of treatment, dosing, and side effects in this important population, which can be vastly different from other groups due to the physiological changes that come with pregnancy.”The review found that 80% (124) of 155 clinical treatment trials of Covid-19 registered in April 2020 and 75% (538) of 722 trials in July 2020 specifically excluded pregnant women.The authors note that expectant mothers were excluded in three-quarters (130/176) of trials investigating six key drug treatments (lopinavir/ ritonavir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, interferon beta, ivermectin, and corticosteroids) previously used as treatments in pregnant women, as well as most (77%; 27/35) trials evaluating high-dose vitamins (A B-complex, C, D, E, and zinc) for which safety data show no, or minimal risk, of adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes.The authors also investigated the inclusion eligibility criteria for these trials and found that the principal researchers of these trials did not include an explanation for why pregnant women were excluded. They believe that their exclusion from Covid-19 trials is likely happening due to perceived risks around use in expectant mothers and medication exposure to foetuses or neonates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pregnant-women-missing-from-most-clinical-trials/story-2owirT0BbV1eEeukiWDccP.html
17-12-2020||World||Self-immolation persists as grim form of protest in Tunisia||In his old life, Hosni Kalaia remembers strolling the streets of his hometown of Kasserine in central Tunisia with confidence. He flashed his heavy gold bracelets and rings, and puffed out his chest, broad and sculptured from regular workouts.Today, Kalaia hides his face from the world behind dark sunglasses and beneath a woolen hat. On his left hand, three blackened, gnarled fingers protrude from one glove; on his right, he has none at all.He lost them in the few seconds it took to disfigure his life forever, when — angry and distraught about the abuse and injustice he’d suffered at the hands of a local police chief — Kalaia doused himself in gasoline and set himself on fire.He’s among hundreds of Tunisians who have turned to the desperate act of self-immolation in the past 10 years, following the example of Mohammed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old fruit seller in the town of Sidi Bouzid who set himself ablaze on December 17, 2010, to protest police harassment.Bouazizi’s gruesome death unwittingly unleashed mass demonstrations against poverty and repression, leading to the downfall of Tunisia’s dictator of 23 years. That in turn sparked the Arab Spring uprisings and a decade of crackdowns and civil wars across the region.“I would never describe the act of self-immolation as an act of courage because even the bravest person in the world couldn’t do it,” Kalaia, 49, told The Associated Press in his family home. “When I poured the petrol over my head, I didn’t think very much, because I wasn’t really conscious about what I was doing. Then I saw a flash, I felt my skin start to burn and I fell down. I woke up eight months later in hospital.”He says it hasn’t gotten any easier seeing the shock on people’s faces when he removes his hat and sunglasses. Rivulets of scars fray and splinter across his face and misshapen ears, and there are livid, deep welts on his arms and stomach.His younger brother set himself ablaze too, killing himself, and his mother tried to do the same, their family a graphic reminder of the chaos and economic turmoil in this North African nation.Most everywhere in the Arab world, the demonstrators’ dreams have been shattered. Tunisia is often considered a success story and a Tunisian democracy group won the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize, but while it has more civil liberties, free expression, and political plurality, the country is plagued by an ever-worsening economic crisis.Lack of socio-economic reforms, the devaluation of the Tunisian dinar and weak, inefficient governance have failed to alleviate poverty or fully revive investment. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, unemployment has risen to 18%. Attempts to migrate to Europe by sea have soared.“There is a huge gap between people’s aspirations and their means. It is this gap that pushes people further into misery,” said Abdessater Sahbani, a sociologist at the University of Tunis. “You can have a good job and be well-educated, but it doesn’t give you anything substantial.”The number of self-immolations has tripled since 2011, and “the rise has persisted right into 2020,” said Dr. Mehdi Ben Khelil of Tunis’ Charles Nicolle Hospital, who studies the phenomenon.After the revolution, Ben Khelil said, “there was a contrast between what we hoped for versus what we gained. Disillusion kept on growing.”Although there are no official statistics, the Tunisian Social Observatory of the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights recorded 62 such suicides or attempts in the first 10 months of 2020.Most occur near local administration or government buildings to protest financial insecurity and suffering, said Najla Arfa, project manager at the observatory. Police abuse is often a trigger.The overwhelming majority are working-class men in their 20s and 30s, living in deprived interior areas such as Kairouan and Sidi Bouzid. Of 13 survivors contacted by AP, all said they needed financial help.In the decade since Bouazizi’s suicide, little has changed in his hometown of Sidi Bouzid. Huddles of jobless young men sit chain-smoking on plastic chairs in cafés. Others stand in line to buy canisters of cooking gas after a strike disrupted supplies and forced people to use firewood.With monuments in his memory, the town has become a shrine to Bouazizi, whose life resembles those of millions of other Tunisians. But not everyone regards his legacy positively.“His act had a negative effect on the whole country and especially for Sidi Bouzid,” says 30-year-old accounting assistant Marwa Hamdouni. “I think only his family benefited. But for the governorate of Sidi Bouzid, the revolution did not bring anything good.”In 2013, Bouazizi’s family moved to Montreal. Experts say that tales of his family gaining financially from his death spawned other such suicides, notably right after the revolution.Ben Khelil, the doctor, says the reasons go beyond that: “Behind immolation, there is the desire to express their words and suffering. For certain people, the desire it not to die but to be heard.”Survivors face immense psychological, physical, and financial challenges.“Some scars may heal badly and might hinder certain functions such as sitting, chewing and expressing facial emotions,” Ben Khelil says. “There can be a lot of persistent pain, especially when the scars are deep and touch the nerves.”Kalaia spent three years in a hospital and then a private clinic recovering from his burns. He cannot hold a bottle of water, dress himself without assistance or fall asleep without medication. His arms are still riddled with infections.“I’m not going to tell you I regret waking up, but dying would have been better,” Kalaia says, dragging on a cigarette. “Nowadays, I don’t think about killing myself another time, but I ask God for death because I’m so tired.”The Quran forbids suicide, and many Muslim societies regard it as taboo. This does not prevent hundreds of Tunisians attempting it every year.In 2014, Kalaia’s mother, Zina Sehi, now 68, tried to burn herself to death in front of the president’s palace in Tunis, protesting the government’s lack of support for the family. The next year, his 35-year-old brother Saber did the same, dying instantly. Kalaia blames himself for their actions.The government created a committee to prevent such suicides in 2015, but political turmoil has led to a series of short-term governments that have taken little deep action to help survivors or their families.“Do you see what this state did for me? It is the state that left me in this corner,” Kalaia says, gesturing to a mattress on the floor of his home where he sleeps. “It’s over, my life is over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/self-immolation-persists-as-grim-form-of-protest-in-tunisia/story-MBTo9WAODMxnogkQNuJu7J.html
17-12-2020||World||US residents warned of severe snowstorm amid Covid-19 vaccination drive||As many as 14 US states, with more than 60 million residents, have been warned of a powerful snowstorm sweeping through the north-eastern US. The National Weather Service (NWS) warned that the snowstorm will result in “significant impact including travel disruptions and power outages” in the worst-affected areas.“Some of the heaviest snowfall associated with the winter storm impacting the Northeast will fall tonight,” the NWS tweeted.The NWS predicted that residents across central Pennsylvania and south-central New York State will wake up to one to two feet of snow. The weather forecasting agency also said that over six inches of snow are likely across the mountainous regions of Utah, Wyoming, and western Colorado. US transportation secretary Elaine Chao has urged people to check with their local transportation officials and weather resources for the latest travel conditions.“For those in the path of today’s winter storm, know what’s expected for your area and don’t drive in dangerous conditions! Check with your local transportation officials and weather resources for the latest travel conditions,” Chao tweeted. For those in the path of today’s winter storm, know what’s expected for your area and don’t drive in dangerous conditions! Check with your local transportation officials and weather resources for the latest travel conditions.New York mayor Bill de Blasio has warned that the storm could be the biggest the city has seen in years, urging people to use public transportation in case of emergency travel. The extreme weather condition has also become a matter of concern for the vaccine distribution process as the United States rolled out Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine, earlier this week, for health care workers and people at high risk. Health secretary Alex Azar said that the government is following the situation. “We have prepositioned Centres for Disease Control and Prevention people at each place receiving people. This is FedEx, this is UPS express shipping - they know how to deal with snow and bad weather, but we are on it and following it,” Azar told Fox News in an interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-residents-warned-of-severe-snowstorm-amid-covid-19-vaccination-drive/story-qDjSQ7g3TgHSfM6ljZECsN.html
17-12-2020||World||Thailand relaxes travel curbs for tourists from over 50 countries||Thailand on Thursday eased travel restrictions for citizens from 56 countries in a bid to boost the country’s pandemic-hit tourism industry, though visitors will be required to undergo a mandatory two-week hotel quarantine.Tourists from countries including Australia, France and the United States can travel without visas, but would need a certificate to show they were free of Covid-19 72 hours before travel and a place at a quarantine hotel, Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for Thailand’s Covid-19 taskforce said.Visitors would then be subject to a two-week quarantine period after arriving, he said, adding that the normal 30-day visa would be extended to 45 days. While in quarantine, arrivals would undergo three Covid-19 tests, up from two required previously, Taweesin said, adding that more testing could potentially lead to shorter quarantine times in the future. The revisions come as the tourism-reliant economy struggles to encourage more domestic activity, but an ongoing travel ban continues to keep most foreign tourists away.“The entry of tourists will stimulate the economy,” Foreign Ministry spokesman, Tanee Sangrat, told Reuters.Travellers from other countries not included in Thursday’s announcement could still be eligible for a 90-day special tourist visa and a certificate of entry.Thailand’s entry restrictions have helped keep its Covid-19 cases at a low 4,281, but caused widespread economic damage and many job losses.“We are confident in the Thai public health system, before this we were not sure, but now we are confident in the system,” Tanee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-relaxes-travel-curbs-for-tourists-from-over-50-countries/story-EJR4tNAfEovMmSA7y87LkJ.html

A spokeswoman said that all his trips had been cancelled, including an upcoming visit to Lebanon on December 22.Macron’s positive test comes just two days after France relaxed measures to curb a second wave of Covid-19, replacing a nationwide lockdown with a curfew.Health authorities on Wednesday reported the highest increase in cases since November 21.Macron is the latest head of state to contract the virus. US President Donald Trump tested positive in October.The French presidency said Macron and his team were trying to assess where he could have contracted the virus.Macron was at a European Council heads of state meeting on December 10-11. His schedule over the last week has also included a private dinner with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, during which he awarded him the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. He also has had lunch this week with European leaders Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen as well as the Spanish and Portuguese prime ministers.He was seen shaking hands with OECD chief Angel Gurria.Prime Minister Jean Castex will also self isolate after coming into contact with Macron over the last few days, said Gerard Larcher, head of the Senate, the upper house of the French parliament.Political party chiefs from the Senate and France’s lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, were also in isolation as they had a lunch with Macron earlier this week..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-emmanuel-macron-has-tested-positive-for-covid-19/story-8XKqMwQwauE1tbD9DzNvCM.html

Patel, currently the Chief of Staff to Acting US Defence Secretary Christopher Miller, filed the lawsuit in a Virginia court against CNN and several CNN reporters on Friday, according to Fox News. In his lawsuit, Patel, who previously served in the White House before being moved to the Pentagon, alleged that CNN between November 24 and December 4 published a series of articles that “contain a series of false and defamatory statements” about him, according to the complaint reported by Fox News. The CNN articles described Patel, who was previously a top aide to Republican Representative from California, Devin Nunes, as a pro-Trump conspiracy theorist, the report said. “..publication of the defamatory statements is part of a general pattern of retaliation and discrimination against Kash… a larger conspiracy undertaken between 2018 and the present to discredit Kash through the publication of false statements and the promotion of unfounded left-wing political narratives,” his attorney Steven S Biss said. Patel “uncovered many inconvenient facts undermining the fake political narrative about collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russians when he was counsel for Nunes, then-chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,” Biss said. CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Fox News said. New York-born Patel has his roots in Gujarat. His parents are from East Africa – mother from Tanzania and father from Uganda. They came to the US from Canada in 1970.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-pentagon-official-kash-patel-sues-cnn-seeks-usd-50-million-for-defamation/story-0aYulwHhqv7cfOzMPqBubO.html

We also want to know how it developed, specifically where it came from, if the source of the virus is here,” said a Wuhan resident surnamed Wan, as he walked to work on Thursday morning. “My feeling is that it is not from there,” he added, referring to the seafood market. The WHO did not confirm whether its team will go to Wuhan, saying that discussions on the itinerary were ongoing. A two-member WHO team visited China in July, but did not visit Wuhan.Reuters reported earlier, citing a member and diplomats, that a team of 12-15 international experts will visit Wuhan to examine evidence, including human and animal samples collected by Chinese researchers, and to build on their initial studies.Beijing has strongly opposed calls for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus, but said it has been open to a WHO-led investigation.China’s foreign ministry did not directly comment on the WHO visit during a daily media briefing on Thursday.“China stands ready to enhance its cooperation with WHO to advance the global tracing efforts and contribute our share in our early victory against the pandemic,” spokesman Wang Wenbin said.Many questions remain about the origins of Covid-19 and the role Wuhan’s exotic wildlife trade may have played in it. Although authorities closed the Huanan market in January, there is a growing scientific consensus that the virus did not originate there. Some studies suggest it was already in circulation by the time it reached the market, with more than one transmission route.China still tightly restricts access to locations such as the Huanan market, which stands empty and locked even though normal life has largely resumed in Wuhan and throughout China.Beijing has also been pushing a narrative that the virus existed abroad before it was found in Wuhan, and unlike other countries cites frozen food packaging as a risk of spreading Covid-19.“There is a strong possibility it was brought in via wholesale seafood from elsewhere. Wuhan has no seafood,” said 20-year-old Wuhan student Jiang Yongcheng. Others said a WHO visit is an opportunity to show how well the city had done battling the virus. Wuhan has not reported a locally transmitted case since May 10, after a 76-day lockdown that was one of the strictest worldwide. “We are not afraid of their investigation,” said Liu Qin, who works in real estate. “Because you can see from the epidemic this year, in Wuhan things were done well, if not the epidemic would not have been controlled quickly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-residents-say-coronavirus-came-from-elsewhere-hope-who-team-finds-its-origins/story-CyOe6l6fI0ni9GAKF8xYeO.html
17-12-2020||World||Will children be able to get Covid-19 vaccines?||Will children be able to get Covid-19 vaccines?Not until there’s enough data from studies in different age groups, which will stretch well into next year.The Pfizer vaccine authorized in the US this month is for people 16 and older. Testing began in October in children as young as 12 and is expected to take several more months. The Food and Drug Administration will have to decide when there’s enough data to allow emergency use in this age group.Depending on the results, younger children may be enrolled for study as well.Moderna, which is expected to become the second Covid-19 vaccine greenlit in the US, began enrolling study participants ages 12 to 17 this month, and will track them for a year. Testing in children younger than 12 is expected to start in early 2021.It is uncertain if the results on younger children will come in time for vaccinations to begin before the next school year.Positive outcomes in adult studies are reassuring and suggest it is safe to proceed in testing kids, said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University and director of its vaccine research program.Even though children usually don’t get very sick from Covid-19, they can spread the virus to others, said Dr. Robert Frenck, who is the lead researcher for Pfizer’s study in kids at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. At least 1.6 million youth have been infected, 8,000 have been hospitalized and 162 have died from the virus, he noted.“It’s really important, not only for themselves but also for society,” Frenck said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-children-be-able-to-get-covid-19-vaccines/story-EV1z1UlCYOIcUqX5zj6kxI.html

The two leaders spoke on Wednesday as the Doha-based Taliban’s Political Commission (TPC) arrived in Islamabad on a three-day visit and met Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. The group is scheduled to meet the prime minister Khan during the visit. The Pakistan Prime Minister’s office said Khan welcomed the recent progress in the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha, underlining that Pakistan’s outreach to all Afghan stakeholders was part of its efforts to ensure progress towards an inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive political settlement. He told President Ghani that the “Afghan-led and Afghan-owned” peace process was critical for regional stability. Khan said the latest visit by the TPC delegation to Pakistan would further the talks. The prime minister urged all Afghan parties to actively reduce violence in the country. The leaders agreed to continue their engagement for supporting the peace process and enhancing bilateral cooperation, the Prime Minister’s office said. Last month, Khan made his maiden visit to Kabul and held talks with Ghani and other leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-khan-reiterates-support-to-afghan-peace-process/story-ORjlPgugn9GMcqhZrbpBkN.html

17-12-2020||World||Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout draws wary, mixed response||While excitement and enthusiasm greeted the Western-developed coronavirus vaccine when it was rolled out, the Russian-made version has received a mixed response, with reports of empty Moscow clinics that offered the shot to health care workers and teachers — the first members of the public designated to receive it.Kremlin officials and state-controlled media touted the Sputnik V vaccine as a major achievement after it was approved Aug. 11. But among Russians, hope that the shot would reverse the course of the Covid-19 crisis has become mixed with wariness and skepticism, reflecting concerns about how it was rushed out while still in its late-stage testing to ensure its effectiveness and safety.Russia faced international criticism for approving a vaccine that hasn’t completed advanced trials among tens of thousands of people, and experts both at home and abroad warned against its wider use until the studies are completed.Despite those warnings, authorities started offering it to certain high-risk groups, such as front-line medical workers, within weeks of approval. Alexander Gintsburg, head of the Gamaleya Institute that developed the vaccine, said last week over 150,000 Russians have gotten it.One recipient was Dr. Alexander Zatsepin, an ICU specialist in Voronezh, a city 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of Moscow, who received the vaccine in October.“We’ve been working with Covid-19 patients since March, and every day when we come home, we worry about infecting our family members. So when some kind of opportunity to protect them and myself appeared, I thought it should be used,” he said.But Zatsepin said he still takes precautions against infection because studies of the vaccine’s effectiveness aren’t over.“There is no absolute confidence yet,” he said.After Britain announced Dec. 2 it had approved a vaccine developed by drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech, President Vladimir Putin told authorities to start a large-scale inoculation campaign, a sign of Moscow’s eagerness to be at the front of the race against the pandemic.Russia approved its vaccine after it was tested on only a few dozen people, touting it as “the first in the world” to receive a go-ahead. Developers named it “Sputnik V,” a reference to the Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of the world’s first satellite during the Cold War.More than just national pride is at stake. Russia has recorded more than 2.7 million cases of Covid-19, and over 48,000 deaths, and it wants to avoid another damaging lockdown of its economy.On Dec. 2, Putin cited a target of over 2 million doses in the coming days. Despite such a limited supply for a nation of 146 million, Moscow immediately widened who was eligible for it. Shots are free to everyone in medical or educational facilities, both state and private; social and municipal workers; retail and service workers; and those in the arts.The European Medicines Agency said it has not received a request from the vaccine makers to consider licensing it for use in the EU, but some data have been shared with the World Health Organization. The U.N. agency does not typically approve vaccines itself but waits for regulatory agencies to weigh in first. The Russian vaccine is reportedly under consideration for use in a global effort led by WHO to distribute Covid-19 vaccines to poorer countries.Unlike in the U.K., where the first shots are going to the elderly, Sputnik V is going to those aged 18 to 60 who don’t have chronic illnesses and aren’t pregnant or breastfeeding.Its developers have said study data suggests the vaccine was 91% effective, a conclusion based on 78 infections among nearly 23,000 participants. That’s far fewer cases than Western drugmakers have accumulated during final testing before analyzing their candidates’ efficacy, and important demographic and other details from the study have not been released.Some experts say such efficacy rates inspire optimism, but public trust may be an issue.“I don’t so much worry about Sputnik V being unsafe or less effective than we need it to be,” said Judy Twigg, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University specializing in global health. “I worry about whether or not people are going to be willing to take it in Russia.”A poll conducted in October by the Levada Center, Russia’s top independent pollster, showed that 59% of Russians were unwilling to get the shots even if offered for free.Denis Volkov, sociologist and deputy director of the Levada Center, says respondents cited unfinished clinical trials, saying the vaccine was “raw” and they were suspicious of the claims that Russia was the first country to have a vaccine while others were still working on theirs.Some medical workers and teachers interviewed by The Associated Press expressed skepticism about the vaccine because it hasn’t been fully tested.Dr. Yekaterina Kasyanova of Siberia’s Kemerovo region said she didn’t trust it enough to get the shot and has advised her mother, a teacher, not to get it either, adding: “The vaccine is several months old. … Long-term side effects are not known, its effectiveness hasn’t been proven.”Dzhamilya Kryazheva, a teacher in Krasnogorsk near Moscow, echoed that sentiment.“I don’t intend to experiment on my body. I have three children,” she said.For other health care workers, the choice to be vaccinated was easy.“People are dying here every day. Every day, we carry out corpses. What’s there to think about?” said Dr. Marina Pecherkina, an infectious disease specialist in the Far East city of Vladivostok. She got her shots in October because of her daily work with coronavirus patients.Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said more than 6,000 people received the shots in the first five days of vaccinations launched Dec. 5. But some media reports about the first days of the Moscow campaign showed empty clinics and medical workers offering the shots to anyone who walked in. In some instances, this was because the vaccine must be stored at minus 18 degrees Celsius (minus 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit), and each vial contains five doses. Once defrosted, it must be administered within two hours or discarded.The rollout outside Moscow and the surrounding region appeared to go much slower, with Health Minister Mikhail Murashko declaring that all regions started the vaccination Dec. 15.Media reports suggested there may be problems with scaling up the manufacture and distribution of Sputnik V. It uses two different adenovirus vectors for the two-shot regimen, which complicates production. In addition, the low-temperature storage and transport makes it harder to move across the vast country.There also were confused signals about whether recipients should consume alcohol. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said those getting vaccinated should refrain from drinking three days before and after the shots.Several medical workers in Siberia who received the vaccine later reported contracting the virus, but health officials said not enough time had passed for them to develop the antibodies.Dr. Yevgenia Alexeyeva in the Siberian city of Tomsk tested positive for the virus 12 days after her second shot. Alexeyeva said she wasn’t surprised by the result and that it didn’t shake her confidence in the vaccine.“The vaccine doesn’t guarantee that the person wouldn’t get infected. But it should protect us from developing a severe case,” Alexeyeva said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-draws-wary-mixed-response/story-uDcjqLeEdmbbQVQlPZuioI.html
17-12-2020||World||Hong Kong sets new climate disclosure rules, aligns with global standard||Hong Kong financial institutions and listed companies will have to disclose the financial impact of climate change on their businesses, as outlined in a major global standard, by 2025, the city’s main financial regulators said on Thursday.Investors in Hong Kong and around the world say uncertainty about the quality and comparability of companies’ climate-related disclosures limits their ability to make informed decisions.“We’re trying to create enough commonality and harmonisation to enable investors to be able to discriminate and compare,” Ashley Alder, chief executive of markets regulator the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in an interview.The change is one aspect of a plan produced by a cross-agency group involving the SFC, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and government departments aimed at driving green initiatives in Hong Kong and helping the financial hub develop as a sustainable finance centre.“While Hong Kong as a geographical area is quite small ... our international financial centre footprint is huge. If you embed into that footprint the major components of climate finance as it develops, that is of global significance,” Alder said.Under the proposals, by 2025 companies will have to share information in line with standards set by the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD), a body created by the Financial Stability Board to publish principles to inform investors of climate-related financial risk.Alder said in some sectors such disclosures would become mandatory earlier.The TCFD said in October the level of disclosure by companies worldwide was inadequate.Hong Kong’s plan also says next year the city will adopt a common green finance taxonomy being developed by the European Union and China aimed at promoting the convergence of the two jurisdictions’ systems for assessing how environmentally-friendly companies are.Hong Kong will also support a separate effort by accounting standards body IFRS to develop a uniform set of sustainability standards, the plan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-sets-new-climate-disclosure-rules-aligns-with-global-standard/story-m1NYbhwiLn13ATMgSueH4H.html
17-12-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccines not silver bullet to end pandemic: WHO||The World Health Organization (WHO) regional office for the Western Pacific on Thursday called for greater vigilance amid the roll-out of coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine, saying the vaccine is not a “silver bullet” that will end the nearly year-long pandemic which has already killed over 1.6 million.“Whoever you are, wherever you live, as long as the virus is circulating somewhere, we all remain at risk, and we must keep preparing for the worst-case scenario,” WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific Takeshi Kasai said in a virtual media briefing.Kasai appealed to the younger and socially active people aged under 40 to “do everything you can to avoid infection for yourself and everybody around you” despite the anxiety and uncertainties brought about by the pandemic.“By following the advice of health authorities you can directly contribute to protecting the lives of people in your community and in doing so to reviving your society’s economies in 2021,” Kasai said.“I urge you to think about those who may be at high risk of severe Covid. If you catch the virus, you could unknowingly pass it on to your parents or grandparents, your neighbour or friend with an underlying condition,” Kasai said.Moreover, he urged the young to “think of health workers who have been working day and night for almost a year. They are exhausted.”Kasai also appealed to the governments across the region “to use an additional layer of surveillance that picks up an early sign of infection among those groups that are difficult to catch with the existing system.”Kasai said the Covid-19 vaccines “are not a silver bullet that will end the pandemic in the near future.”“The development of a safe and effective vaccine is one thing but producing them in adequate quantities and reaching everyone that needs them is another. They will initially only be available in limited quantities and high-risk groups should be prioritized first,” he said.“This means that we are tired of this pandemic, we must stick to the actions and behaviour which protect not only ourselves but also those around us. Hand washing, mask-wearing, physical distancing and avoiding places that have a high risk of transmission,” he added.“For now we must keep making the choices that will reduce transmission of the virus and protect our families and our communities. By doing so we can go into 2021 with hope,” Kasai said.Babatunde Olowokure, WHO regional emergency director, echoed Kasai, saying that the “Covid-19 vaccine itself is not a silver bullet to end the Covid-19.”“There is no room for complacency. So we must continue to remain vigilant, continue to comply with our public health interventions,” he said.He further urged governments to “look at strategies” which could help the younger population cope with public health interventions and to manage those appropriately.There are now 985,539 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the Western Pacific Region, including 18,641 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccines-not-silver-bullet-to-end-pandemic-who/story-GOzspQyzaSM4VXnVqQ3IaP.html
17-12-2020||World||Jedi Blue: Lawsuit alleges Google, Facebook colluded to manipulate auctions for online advertising||It reads like a grand conspiracy of the nerds.On Wednesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc.’s Google. At its center is a bold claim: Google colluded with archrival Facebook Inc. in an illegal deal to manipulate auctions for online advertising, an industry the two companies dominate. Google named the secret pact after a Star Wars character.“Any collaboration between two competitors of such magnitude should have set off the loudest alarm bells in terms of antitrust compliance,” the Texas lawsuit read. “Apparently, it did not.” Google disputed the allegation it had done anything improper, while Facebook declined to comment.“This allegation is inaccurate,” Google said in an emailed statement. “Facebook Audience Network (FAN) is one of over 25 companies participating in our Open Bidding program. There’s nothing exclusive about their involvement and they don’t receive special data. The whole goal of Open Bidding is to work with a range of ad networks and exchanges that are important to our publisher partners.”The complaint centers on automated ad technology called header bidding that routes digital ads into a live auction. It’s designed to increase the money web publishers, such as news outlets, can get for their ad real estate. With more bids from the widest array of sources, rates go up.By 2016, 70% of major publishers used header bidding from a variety of smaller advertising technology companies. That posed a threat to Google’s ad exchange system because the approach opened up the bidding process to other exchanges. So Google created a program to “secretly let its own exchange win,” according to the Texas suit. (This was named after a Star Wars character, although the state redacted the name.)Enter Facebook. The social network introduced header bidding for its own ad-selling tools in 2017. A year later, it brought it to mobile apps. This tool allowed Facebook to take small cuts of ads sold across the web and on mobile phones, not just on its own properties like Instagram.It also directly competed with Google. But Facebook soon pulled back from the practice. It did so, the Texas suit said, because Google cut a deal, signed at the “highest-level,” that let Facebook sell ads on mobile apps more quickly and gave it other advantages in ad auctions. This deal, too, was given a codename related to Star Wars. The suit redacted the name, but the Wall Street Journal reported it was “Jedi Blue.”“Google understood the severity of the threat to its position if Facebook were to enter the market and support header bidding,” Texas said in the complaint. “To diffuse this threat, Google made overtures to Facebook.”The suit, backed by several other states, also accused Google of tricking publishers into buying ads through Google services rather than header bidding.“If the AGs can back up those kinds of claims, well, this is a hell of a case and I think there could be massive liability,” said Chris Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. Allegations about the deal with Facebook set “this complaint significantly apart from any of the other major litigation pending against the dominant online platforms.”Still, extensive redactions make it hard to judge the strength of the evidence. If the details of the case end up being weak, the agreement might look “like a pretty garden-variety collaboration deal in which Facebook got some sort of functionality it needed from Google,” Sagers added.Header bidding is an arcane process in ad tech, an industry thick with suppliers, middlemen and marketers. While it’s automated, there are often bespoke deals. Major providers like Google, for instance, often give ad buyers and websites discounts in the auctions if enough money is flowing through.It’s a fairly common mechanism called “marking up,” giving a company an edge over others, according to Bob Walczak, an industry veteran and president of Lemma Media. A deal between two firms, even giants like Google and Facebook, could be standard practice, he said.“Maybe they’re rigging a game a little bit. But in the reality of ad tech, that’s commonplace,” said Walczak. “These are all just auction dynamics. These are business deals.”A Google spokeswoman said Facebook is one of 25 companies in an “open bidding” service the company’s exchange offers and receives no special data. The company declined to disclose the name of the Star Wars character.(Updates with analyst’s company in the third paragraph from bottom)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jedi-blue-lawsuit-alleges-google-facebook-colluded-to-manipulate-auctions-for-online-advertising/story-RroKvFJfcilSG3TKAFkkMN.html
17-12-2020||World||Fiji under curfew, as category five Cyclone Yasa approaches||The Fiji government ordered a nationwide curfew on Thursday, including a ban on public transportation, with a potentially devastating cyclone expected to unleash powerful winds and flooding on the island nation within a day.Cyclone Yasa, a top category five storm, is expected to bring winds of up to 250 kmh (155 mph) and torrential rain across the South Pacific archipelago nation when it makes landfall by early Friday.The country ordered a 14-hour nationwide curfew from 4 p.m. (0400 GMT) with people living in low-lying areas urged to move to higher ground before nightfall, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said in a video posted to Facebook. “The impact for this super storm is more or less the entire country,” Bainimarama said in the video.Yasa would “easily surpass” the strength of 2016’s Cyclone Winston, he added, referring to the southern hemisphere’s most intense tropical storm on record, which killed more than 40 Fijians and left tens of thousands of people homeless.Over 850,000 Fijians, or 95% of the population, live in the direct path of Yasa, said Bainimarama, adding that weather forecasts anticipated flash flooding and “severe coastal inundation” that included waves up to 10 metres (33 ft) high.Police would enforce a ban on public transport, said the country’s National Disaster Management Office, which added that the country had declared a “state of natural disaster” which gives law enforcement authorities increased powers.By 8 p.m. on Thursday, the centre of Yasa was forecast to be 100 km (62 miles) east of the village of Yasawa-i-Rara and potentially over Fiji’s fifth-most populous province of Bua, home to 15,000 people, the office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fiji-under-curfew-as-category-five-cyclone-yasa-approaches/story-YFuCVHSHiAH5PskaQi0nrL.html
17-12-2020||World||Macron and the moguls: Inside the fight over a ‘French Fox News’||Behind the corporate battle for French media company Lagardere, there’s a political tug-of-war involving the country’s richest man, a media magnate and President Emmanuel Macron.At stake is control of one of France’s best-known private radio stations and its power to sway voters ahead of France’s presidential election in 2022, when Macron could face off once again with far-right leader Marine Le Pen.Macron fears that if media tycoon Vincent Bollore wins Lagardere, he could use its Europe 1 radio to inundate the airwaves with right-wing views and make the president’s re-election bid even tougher, two sources close to the matter said.So when Bollore’s Vivendi built a stake in Lagardere in April, Macron’s office relayed its concerns to Bernard Arnault, the billionaire founder of luxury goods empire LVMH and one of the president’s early supporters, the sources said.“The situation is being followed closely from on high,” one of the two sources told Reuters.Weeks later, Arnault stepped into the fight, backing Chief Executive Arnaud Lagardere’s holding company with funds and pledging his support to the son of the company’s late founder Jean-Luc, whom Arnault has said was his best friend.Macron’s office and a spokesman for Bollore declined to comment. LVMH did not respond to requests for comment on behalf of Arnault.At the time, Arnault’s move was seen as an attempt to bolster its defences in tandem with Bollore against the Amber Capital hedge fund in London, which has also built up a stake in Lagardere and campaigned to change the company’s management.A source familiar with Arnault’s thinking said his attachment to Jean-Luc Lagardere was genuine, and had prompted him to act when his son sought help to fend off Amber Capital. But the billionaire’s move puzzled French business rivals. After a career built on a reputation for penny-pinching on deals such as LVMH’s renegotiated purchase of US jeweller Tiffany, they wondered whether Arnault may have had another motive for ploughing funds into Lagardere.After his initial investment of 80 million euros ($97 million), Arnault bought a direct stake of 7.75% in Lagardere, which is worth 209 million euros now. Speculation has been growing in French media that there was a political angle to Arnault’s surprise move to invest in a company racking up losses and debts as the coronavirus pandemic battered its global network of airport retail outlets. Macron’s inner circle was concerned that through Vivendi, now Lagardere’s biggest shareholder, Bollore could consolidate his media assets and build a French version of US conservative media network “Fox News”, helped by Europe 1, the sources said.Shortly after Arnault invested in Lagardere, a first pitch by Bollore to buy Europe 1 in June for 250 million euros was turned down by Lagardere’s management, a third source said. Vivendi declined to comment. The company already owns France’s biggest pay-TV company Canal Plus, whose free-to-air news channel CNews has taken a conservative turn since Bollore took control. Anti-immigration and hardline law-and-order comments made by some of its talk show hosts regularly inflame social media and both its viewership and advertising revenues have jumped.The network’s boss Serge Nedjar has acknowledged that some of its commentators are provocative but said in a recent interview that the priority of CNews was to host open debates on all topics and there was no political line.Lagardere’s Europe 1 station has struggled with losses and falling audience numbers but has kept a following among urban, educated and more conservative-leaning listeners.While Lagardere’s arcane ownership structure gives its chief executive the right to veto significant decisions despite holding only 7% of the company, analysts still expect its major investors to try to grab bits of the business. Vivendi now holds a 27% stake and has teamed up with Amber on 20% to push for board changes. Even Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, Lagardere’s long-silent third biggest investor with 13%, has called for fair representation for all shareholders. The moves have put pressure on Lagardere’s management to deal with the situation, especially the billionaire dealmakers, while Amber Capital has maintained its campaign for an overhaul to drive a better share price performance.Four sources close to the situation said discussions over how parts of Lagardere could be spun off had begun in recent weeks. One said that Arnault and Bollore had met in person.The two have never been direct business rivals, and are not especially close, but neither is interested in an all-out war over Lagardere, people who know them said.Bollore may be content to pick up parts of Lagardere’s publishing division, home to Hachette, or agree to cede some media assets even if he launched a full takeover, an option that could unblock the complex saga, people close to the talks said.Such scenarios were still speculative, the people said. Letting Arnault take Lagardere’s media outlets, which include the Paris Match weekly and Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche, however, could pose issues. The billionaire already controls financial daily Les Echos and newspaper Le Parisien.Lagardere also owns a travel retail business, but the sector has been hit hard as the pandemic has pummelled the travel industry, and Arnault is experiencing similar problems within LVMH, which owns duty-free retail chain DFS.But for those planning Macron’s re-election campaign, keeping Europe 1 away from Bollore is a priority, especially given the growing popularity of CNews and its right-leaning commentators.Its viewership doubled in October from last year and while it still trails France’s market leader BFM, it’s ahead of TF1’s LCI news channel - and its transformation is not just alarming those in the corridors of power.“The general idea is: in the name of freedom of expression, any right-wing person is welcome. There’s no moral barrier,” said Sebastien Cochelin, a CFDT union representative for Canal Plus. “We’re playing with fire.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-and-the-moguls-inside-the-fight-over-a-french-fox-news/story-k9l9flEjh6ybo73SUFHl7M.html
17-12-2020||World||Twitter reverts to old retweet function after US election||Twitter Inc is reversing changes made to its retweet function intended to curb the spread of misinformation during the US presidential election, the company said. The microblogging site had in October made it difficult for users to retweet a tweet with misinformation and promoted the use of quote tweets, which included commentary from the user.It had also imposed curbs including labeling and removal of tweets calling for people to interfere with the election process or implementation of results.Twitter said it will no longer prompt quote tweets from the retweet icon. “Retweet functionality will be returning to the way it was before,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday.Quote tweets instead of retweets was intended to encourage thoughtful amplification, but that has not happened in practice, the company said. “The use of Quote Tweets increased, but 45% of them included single-word affirmations and 70% had less than 25 characters,” it said. “The increase in Quote Tweets was also offset by an overall 20% decrease in sharing through both Retweets and Quote Tweets.”Meanwhile, Facebook has in the past few days rolled back their algorithm that lifted news from authoritative outlets over hyperpartisan sources after November’s election, according to a report in the New York Times.Facebook did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. The implementation of the algorithm had resulted in a reduction in traffic for partisan sites like Breitbart and Occupy Democrats and an increase for mainstream news publishers, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-reverts-to-old-retweet-function-after-us-election/story-kwp5sZlT5aWVMM10pBuarI.html
17-12-2020||World||Beijing welcomes Covid-19 investigators trip to China, says WHO||Beijing will welcome an international team of Covid-19 investigators due to travel to China in January, said the World Health Organization (WHO), which is leading the mission.China has strongly opposed calls for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus, saying such calls are anti-China, but has been open to a WHO-led investigation.However, it was unclear whether the WHO investigators will travel to the city of Wuhan where the virus was first detected, with discussions on the itinerary ongoing.“WHO continues to contact China and to discuss the international team and the places they visit,” Babatunde Olowokure, the WHO’s regional emergencies director in the Western Pacific, told a news conference on Thursday.​”Our understanding at this time is that China is welcoming the international team and their visit...This is anticipated, as far as we are aware, to happen in early January,” he said.On Wednesday, a WHO member and diplomats told Reuters the mission was expected to go to China in the first week of January to investigate the origins of the virus.The United States, which has accused China of having hidden the outbreak’s extent, has called for a “transparent” WHO-led investigation and criticised its terms, which allowed Chinese scientists to do the first phase of preliminary research.Chinese state media have suggested the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, citing its presence on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers claiming it had been circulating in Europe last year.Olowokure said the exact timing of the trip would depend on “obtaining the results of some other tests that are being carried out initially”, without giving further details.Referring to the ongoing discussions with China over the trip, Olowokure said: “These are of course important for us, and to get an overall picture of how the investigation will go.”More than 72.92 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 1,641,733​ have died, according to a Reuters tally.Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-welcomes-covid-19-investigators-trip-to-china-says-who/story-Wuzk0KKWg8yqmhdV8xGmgI.html
17-12-2020||World||US has stood with India as it faced Chinese aggression: White House official||Expressing concern over China’s increasing aggression across the globe from Hong Kong, Taiwan, South China Sea and along the India-China border, a senior White House official said the US has stood with New Delhi during its military standoff with Beijing. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official asserted that US President Donald Trump, during his presidency, has really strengthened all aspects of the US-India security and defence cooperation to build a comprehensive, enduring and mutually beneficial defence partnership. “We have been very concerned with China’s increasing aggression really across the globe, whether it be Hong Kong, Taiwan, South China Sea and of course along the India-China border,” the senior administration official from the White House told PTI in an exclusive interview. “We have stood with India as it faced this aggression along its border over the last six-seven months. We provided equipment. We have been engaged with India, shown our moral support for India to be able to stand up to the Chinese and make sure that there’s a peaceful resolution and de-escalation of the situation,” said the official. The armies of India and China are locked in a tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May. Both sides have held multiple rounds of military and diplomatic talks. However, no breakthrough has been achieved yet. During the Trump administration, the United States has become the second largest arms supplier to India, growing from virtually no sales a decade ago to more than USD 20 billion today, the official said. Earlier this year, the US and India concluded USD 3 billion in defence sales for naval and attack helicopters. To bolster India’s role as a net provider of security in the Indo-Pacific, the Trump administration has lifted restrictions on provision of sensitive defence technology, enabling India to become the first country that’s not a treaty ally of the United States to be offered armed MQ-9 Reaper drones. In support of India during its border standoff with China, the United States has leased two MQ-9s to India while the sale of MQ-9s is being finalised, said the official. The US also expedited delivery of cold weather gear to support the deployment of Indian military along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) through the winter, said the senior administration official. “In addition, we have concluded the basic exchange and cooperation agreement, which is the last of the so-called key defence enabling agreements. I think this is really a historic achievement that clearly demonstrates progress in defence partnership,” said the official. Responding to a question, the senior administration official said that the US cut security aid and reimbursements to Pakistan in January 2018. There have been some exceptions, such as for things that are in the US interest. “Some minor exceptions. But the suspension remains in effect. We continue to look to Pakistan to crack down on terrorists and militants on its territory. We’ve seen some progress on that front. But we certainly need to see more. We need to see a decisive crackdown, and sustained measures to rein in these terrorists and militant groups,” said the official. “We have received cooperation from Pakistan on the Afghan peace process. We value the cooperation that we have received from Pakistan. We continue to work with Pakistan and look to them to help when it comes to convincing the Taliban to reduce violence, for example. “We were glad to see that the two sides are sitting down in Doha, and have been for the last several months, but we are very troubled by the high levels of Taliban violence that continues. So, we do look to Pakistan to help us move the peace process forward. And right now, that means to see a reduction in violence from the Taliban,” the senior administration official added. His remarks came as a high-level delegation of the Afghan Taliban, led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, met Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in Islamabad on Wednesday and discussed the Afghan peace process, amid growing incidents of violence in the war-torn country. The delegation is visiting Pakistan at a time when President Trump has ordered the withdrawal of more American soldiers from Afghanistan, leaving around 2,500 troops behind in the strife-torn country.

17-12-2020||World||‘New voice’: Joe Biden hails transportation nominee Pete Buttigieg||President-elect Joe Biden has introduced his one-time Democratic primary rival Pete Buttigieg as his nominee for transportation secretary, saying the 38-year-old can be “a new voice” in the fight against economic inequality, institutional racism and climate change.Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, would be the first openly gay person confirmed by the Senate to a Cabinet position. Biden hailed that milestone Wednesday while saying that by the time he’s done filling out his new administration’s top jobs, it will have more women and people of color than ever, including “a Cabinet that is opening doors and breaking down barriers, and accessing the full brains and talent we have so much of.”Biden said Buttigieg offers “a new voice with new ideas determined to move past old politics.”“We need someone who knows how to work with state, local and federal agencies,” Biden said, noting that highways are in disrepair and that some bridges “are on the verge of collapse.”Beyond standard transportation fixes, which are easier to promise than for administrations to get through Congress, Biden wants to rejuvenate the post-coronavirus pandemic economy and create thousands of green jobs by making environmentally friendly retrofits and public works improvements.The president-elect noted that much of the nation, including his home state of Delaware, faces the risk of rising sea levels. A more immediate challenge, though, will be enforcing Biden’s promised mask-wearing mandate for airplanes and public transportation systems to slow the spread of the coronavirus.“At its best, transportation makes the American dream possible, getting people and goods to where they need to be, directly and indirectly creating good-paying jobs,” Buttigieg said. “At its worst, misguided policies and missed opportunities can reinforce racial, economic and environmental injustice, dividing or isolating neighborhoods, undermining government’s basic role to empower everyone to thrive.”Buttigieg mentioned his affinity for trains while acknowledging that he would be only the “second-biggest” Amtrak enthusiast in the administration, given that Biden rode the rails for years between Washington and Wilmington, Delaware, while serving in the Senate.Buttigieg also mentioned that he proposed to his husband, Chasten, at Chicago O’Hare International Airport.Buttigieg was the only Cabinet choice, after Biden’s defense secretary nominee, retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, to appear at a solo announcement ceremony rather than be introduced with other picks. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris joined via videoconference from Washington because of a snowstorm.Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said Buttigieg was “more than ready to finally address our nation’s infrastructure crisis.” Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., applauded Biden for tapping someone with “plenty of intellect, vision and drive” to take a shot at modernizing America’s crumbling transportation infrastructure.Others weren’t as thrilled.“I don’t know him at all,” Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a pivotal Republican in the closely divided Senate, told reporters in Washington. She instead brought up Rahm Emanuel, a former Chicago mayor and chief of staff to President Barack Obama. Emanuel was mentioned as a potential candidate for several Biden Cabinet posts but drew strong backlash from progressives.“I think Rahm Emanuel would have been a strong choice,” Collins said.As Biden, Harris and Buttigieg talked about how they got to know one another during the contested Democratic primary, it was easy to imagine the 2024 campaign beginning to take shape as the Cabinet introduction unfolded. Biden, 78, has said he sees himself as a bridge to a new generation of leaders such as Buttigieg.If Biden opts not to run again in 2024, Harris would be his political heir apparent. But that may not stop Buttigieg and other rising Democrats from launching primary challenges.Buttigieg praised Harris for her “trailblazing leadership and friendship,” and Harris used virtually the same language, calling Buttigieg a “trailblazing leader.”During the primary, Buttigieg was initially written off as the leader of a small town competing against far more established figures. But he zeroed in on a message of generational change to finish the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses in a virtual tie with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.Buttigieg’s campaign stumbled, however, in appealing to Black voters who play a critical role in Democratic politics. As the primary moved into more diverse states such as South Carolina, Buttigieg faltered and quickly withdrew from the race. His relatively early backing of Biden ushered in a remarkably swift unification of the party around its ultimate nominee.In the primary, Biden took a shining to Buttigieg, who he said reminded him of his late son, Beau Biden, a former Delaware attorney general who had urged his father to make a third run for the White House. Beau Biden died in 2015.Biden’s selection of Buttigieg for transportation secretary drew praise from LGBTQ rights groups.“Its impact will reverberate well-beyond the department he will lead,” added Annise Parker, president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Institute.But the South Bend chapter of Black Lives Matter denounced the nomination. The group had made its displeasure with Buttigieg known during his presidential campaign, following the 2019 South Bend shooting of a Black man by a white police officer.“We saw Black communities have their houses torn down by his administration,” BLM’s South Bend leader Jorden Giger said in a statement, referring to Buttigieg’s effort to tear down substandard housing. “We saw the machinery of his police turned against Black people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-voice-joe-biden-hails-transportation-nominee-pete-buttigieg/story-jYQ5HsGww78zLNS3C3I35M.html
17-12-2020||World||Palestinians left waiting as Israel is set to deploy Covid vaccine||Israel will begin rolling out a major coronavirus vaccination campaign next week after the prime minister reached out personally to the head of a major drug company. Millions of Palestinians living under Israeli control will have to wait much longer.Worldwide, rich nations are snatching up scarce supplies of new vaccines as poor countries largely rely on a World Health Organization program that has yet to get off the ground. There are few places where the competition is playing out in closer proximity than in Israel and the territories it has occupied for more than half a century.Next year could bring a sharp divergence in the trajectory of the pandemic, which until now has blithely ignored the national boundaries and political enmities of the Middle East. Israelis could soon return to normal life and an economic revival, even as the virus continues to menace Palestinian towns and villages just a few miles (kilometers) away.Israel reached an agreement with the Pfizer pharmaceutical company to supply 8 million doses of its newly approved vaccine — enough to cover nearly half of Israel’s population of 9 million since each person requires two doses. That came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu personally reached out multiple times to Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla, boasting that at one point he was able to reach the CEO at 2 a.m.Israel has mobile vaccination units with refrigerators that can keep the Pfizer shots at the required minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit). It plans to begin vaccinations as soon as next week, with a capacity of more than 60,000 shots a day. Israel reached a separate agreement with Moderna earlier this month to purchase 6 million doses of its vaccine — enough for another 3 million Israelis.Israel’s vaccination campaign will include Jewish settlers living deep inside the West Bank, who are Israeli citizens, but not the territory’s 2.5 million Palestinians.They will have to wait for the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied West Bank in accordance with interim peace agreements reached in the 1990s. Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, territories the Palestinian seek for their future state, in the 1967 Mideast war.The PA hopes to get vaccines through a WHO-led partnership with humanitarian organizations known as COVAX, which aims to provide free vaccines for up to 20% of the population of poor countries, many of which have been hit especially hard by the pandemic.But the program has secured only a fraction of the 2 billion doses it hopes to buy over the next year, has yet to confirm any actual deals and is short on cash. Rich countries have already reserved about 9 billion of the estimated 12 billion doses the pharmaceutical industry is expected to produce next year.Complicating matters is the fact that the Palestinians have only one refrigeration unit — in the oasis town of Jericho — capable of storing the Pfizer vaccine. They are among nearly 3 billion people worldwide for whom lack of adequate refrigeration capacity could pose a major obstacle.Dr. Ali Abed Rabbo, a senior Palestinian health official, said the PA is in talks with Pfizer and Moderna — whose vaccines require extra-cold storage — as well as AstraZeneca and the makers of a largely untested Russian vaccine, but has yet to sign any agreements beyond COVAX.The PA hopes to vaccinate 20% of the population through COVAX, beginning with health workers, he said. “The remainder will depend on Palestine purchasing from the global supply, and we are working with several companies,” he said.Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority have struggled to contain their outbreaks, which have fed off one another as people travel back and forth — mainly tens of thousands of Palestinian laborers employed in Israel. Israel has reported more than 350,000 cases, including more than 3,000 deaths.The Palestinian Authority has reported more than 85,000 cases in the West Bank, including more than 800 deaths, and the outbreak has intensified in recent weeks. The situation is even more dire in Gaza, home to 2 million Palestinians, which has been under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since the Hamas militant group seized power in 2007. Authorities there have reported over 30,000 cases, including 220 deaths.With Gaza’s Hamas rulers shunned by the international community, the territory will also rely on the Palestinian Authority. That means it could be several months before any large-scale vaccinations are carried out in the impoverished coastal strip.Dr. Gerald Rockenschaub, the head of the WHO office for the Palestinian territories, said the PA will provide vaccines to Gaza, but they will arrive in batches and it will take time to reach the first 20%. “We hope that sometime during the first quarter of the next year that the first vaccines will start arriving,” he said.Israel’s Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch told Kan Radio that Israel was working to attain a surplus of vaccines for Israelis and that “should we see that Israel’s demands have been met and we have additional capability, we will certainly consider helping the Palestinian Authority.” He said doing so would help prevent a resurgence of outbreaks in Israel proper.Dr. Ashi Shalmon, an Israeli Health Ministry official, said its approach is in line with past agreements. The Oslo accords require the PA to maintain international vaccination standards and for the sides to exchange information and cooperate in combating epidemics.Israel, which intends to start by inoculating health workers and nursing home residents, plans to issue special “passports” to those who have been vaccinated, exempting them from restrictions and paving the way for the revival of travel and commerce.But the pandemic would continue to rage in Palestinian cities like Bethlehem — where hotels and shops have been empty for months and Christmas celebrations were mostly called off — even as a sense of normalcy is restored in Israel and in nearby settlements.Still, tens of thousands of Palestinians work in Israel and the settlements. They could potentially transfer the virus to Israelis who have not been vaccinated, slowing Israel’s path to herd immunity, the point at which the virus can no longer easily spread.Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, a group that advocates for more equitable health care, says Israel has a legal obligation as an occupying power to purchase and distribute vaccines to the Palestinians. It says Israel must also ensure that vaccines that don’t meet its own safety guidelines — like the Russian shot — are not distributed in areas under its control.“Israel still maintains control over many aspects of the Palestinians’ lives, whether checkpoints, importing goods and medication, and controlling the movement of people,” said Ghada Majadle, the director of the group’s activities in the Palestinian territories.“The Palestinian health system, whether in the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, is in dire condition, mainly (because of) restrictions imposed by Israel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-left-waiting-as-israel-is-set-to-deploy-covid-vaccine/story-q9iJPJAOaXX6T5AhM5OiAO.html
17-12-2020||World||US angling to secure more of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine||US officials say they’re actively negotiating for additional purchases of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine after passing up a chance to lock in a contract this summer since it was still unclear how well the shots would work.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and special adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui also told reporters Wednesday that Pfizer had been unable to commit to a firm delivery date. Azar called that “the core issue.”There was no immediate comment from the company, whose CEO Albert Bourla told CNN this week it is “working very collaboratively” with the government to deliver additional vaccine through the federal Operation Warp Speed. That’s a White House-backed, taxpayer-funded effort to quickly develop coronavirus vaccines and treatments.Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said late Wednesday that some Pfizer vaccine vials may contain more than the standard five doses.The FDA statement followed reports from hospital and pharmacy staff that some vials are apparently overfilled. The FDA advised health professionals to use every full dose possible “given the public health emergency.” The agency said it is communicating with Pfizer about the issue.The Trump administration has come under scathing criticism from congressional Democrats after news leaked out last week about the missed opportunity to secure more vaccine.“We are concerned the failure to secure an adequate supply of vaccines will needlessly prolong the Covid-19 pandemic in this country, causing further loss of life and economic devastation,” a group of senators led by Patty Murray of Washington and Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote HHS. “We fear this is yet another instance in which the Trump administration’s failure to develop a comprehensive national vaccines plan in a timely manner could jeopardize efforts to get people vaccinated and ultimately end this pandemic.”Azar sought to rebut that concern Wednesday, saying that pending contracts with a number of manufacturers will ensure enough vaccine for all Americans by around the middle of next year. A second vaccine from Moderna appears headed for FDA approval within days, and more vaccine candidates are advancing through clinical trials.But the one from Pfizer and German pharmaceutical BioNTech was first into the arms of Americans, raising hopes of taming a pandemic that has killed more than 300,000 people in the US and hobbled much of the national economy. Health care workers and nursing home residents top the list as local TV stations across the country are broadcasting scenes of the first vaccinations. Some polls show skepticism about getting vaccinated may be easing.After early failures with testing, Trump administration officials are hoping to write a very different ending with vaccines. Operation Warp Speed has financed the development, manufacture and distribution of millions of doses, with the goal of providing a free vaccine to any American who wants one.Pfizer was not as closely involved with Operation Warp Speed as other manufacturers, preferring to retain control over its own development and manufacturing. But the government did enter into a contract to buy 100 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first of which were shipped this week.At issue is the purchase of another 100 million doses for delivery as early as the middle of next year.“We are engaged in active negotiations,” said Azar.Slaoui, a world-renowned vaccine scientist who is helping lead the federal effort, said the goal all along was to have several promising vaccines in development, with taxpayers assuming the financial risk if any given vaccine failed to secure FDA approval.“We built a portfolio of vaccines to ensure one of them at least would make it to the finish line,” he said.Back in the summer, “it wouldn’t make sense to preorder more from a manufacturer before we knew how a vaccine worked.”Although initial signals were positive about the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the full FDA review did not take place until earlier this month.Slaoui and Azar also said that because of Operation Warp Speed’s arm’s length relationship with Pfizer, officials had less of a window into the company’s manufacturing and any potential problems that might develop.“We of course would welcome having another 100 million doses,” said Slaoui, adding that it’s his expectation that negotiations with Pfizer will be successful.With at least one other vaccine appearing headed for approval, they’re already talking about a surplus that could be sent out to the rest of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-angling-to-secure-more-of-pfizer-s-coronavirus-vaccine/story-BFxUQaNjsdGwSYTOg5Hl9L.html
17-12-2020||World||Australian state reportedly violated human rights in Covid-19 lockdown||An Australian state’s decision to lockdown more than 3,000 people in public housing towers to contain a second Covid-19 outbreak was not based on direct health advice and violated human rights, Victoria’s state Ombudsman said in a report.Australia’s second-most populous state, Victoria, locked down nine public housing towers for several days in July due to a surge in coronavirus cases.Victoria’s acting chief health officer had only 15 minutes to consider and approve the lockdown, including the potential human rights impacts, Ombudsman Deborah Glass said in her report released on Thursday.“The rushed lockdown was not compatible with the residents’ human rights, including their right to humane treatment when deprived of liberty..., the action appeared to be contrary to the law,” she said.Residents in eight towers were confined in their apartments for five days but the ninth tower, which had the highest number of infections, went through a total lockdown for two weeks. Some were left without food and medicines while many others waited more than a week to be allowed outside, the report said.The state government conceded mistakes were made, but said decisions were made to ensure the safety of the residents. “We make no apology for saving people’s lives, absolutely no apology for saving people’s lives,” Victoria state Housing Minister Richard Wynne told reporters.It was not immediately clear on Thursday whether the findings would open up any legal remedies for residents to pursue against the government.Victoria was placed into a statewide lockdown days after authorities shut the towers to contain fresh outbreaks but it has since effectively eliminated the virus due to the lockdown. No new cases have been reported in the state for 48 straight days as of Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-state-reportedly-violated-human-rights-in-covid-19-lockdown/story-RziVDflQ74cpey19ibVL3M.html
17-12-2020||World||Alibaba facial recognition tech specifically picks out Uighur minority: Report||Technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has facial recognition technology which can specifically pick out members of China’s Uighur minority, surveillance industry researcher IPVM said in a report.The report comes as human rights groups accuse China of forcing over 1 million Muslim Uighurs into labour camps, and call out firms suspected of complicity.China has repeatedly denied forcing anyone into what it has called vocational training centres, and has also said the region of Xinjiang is under threat from Islamist militants.Still, sensitivities have prompted caution among Chinese internet firms which often self-censor to avoid running afoul of a government which strictly controls online speech, and which last month published draft rules to police livestreaming.US-based IPVM in a report published on Wednesday said software capable of identifying Uighurs appears in Alibaba’s Cloud Shield content moderation service for websites.Alibaba describes Cloud Shield as a system that “detects and recognizes text, pictures, videos, and voices containing pornography, politics, violent terrorism, advertisements, and spam, and provides verification, marking, custom configuration and other capabilities.”An archived record of the technology shows it can perform such tasks as “glasses inspection”, “smile detection”, whether the subject is “ethnic” and, specifically, “Is it Uighur”.Consequently, if a Uighur livestreams a video on a website signed up to Cloud Shield, the software can detect that the user is Uighur and flag the video for review or removal, IPVM researcher Charles Rollet told Reuters.IPVM said mention of Uighurs in the software disappeared near the time it published its report, and that Alibaba told it the feature has only been used “in a testing environment”. Alibaba did not provide a comment following a Reuters’ request.Alibaba is listed on both the New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges. It is the biggest cloud computing vendor in China and the fourth worldwide, showed data from researcher Canalys.Earlier this month, US lawmakers sent letters to Intel Corp and Nvidia Corp following reports of their computer chips being used in the surveillance of Uighurs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alibaba-facial-recognition-tech-specifically-picks-out-uighur-minority-report/story-ajXAhyFwq8Tm6kJbuReuBN.html

It had kept its alert for medical preparedness at the second-highest level at the time, indicating a need to boost hospital capacity but a notch below critical conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-says-covid-19-strain-on-hospitals-severe-raises-alert-to-highest/story-2D6pRrPmFbhaZ4Gb4PKLfN.html
17-12-2020||World||New Zealand to purchase Covid-19 vaccines from 2 more firms, says PM Ardern||The New Zealand government will purchase COVID-19 vaccines from pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Novavax, meaning every New Zealander will be able to be vaccinated, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Thursday.The new agreements secure access to 7.6 million doses from AstraZeneca -- enough for 3.8 million people, and 10.72 million doses from Novavax -- enough for 5.36 million people. Both vaccines require two doses to be administered, according to a government statement.The four pre-purchase agreements secured to date are 750,000 courses from Pfizer/BioNTech; 5 million courses from Janssen; 3.8 million courses from the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca; and 5.36 million courses from Novavax, said the statement.There are multiple types of vaccine technology that have been used to develop COVID-19 vaccines. “Our strategy has been to purchase different types of technology, to ensure if some are found in development or in trials not to be a successful option, we will have alternatives available,” Ardern said.“We now have agreements in place with four providers, covering three different types of vaccine technology and we have secured more than enough doses to cover our entire population plus the Pacific,” she said.The AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines announced on Thursday complement the other purchases, and are compatible with existing infrastructure and storage facilities in New Zealand, she added.“If proven to be safe and effective by New Zealand’s pharmaceuticals regulator Medsafe, they will provide broad population coverage for New Zealand and our Pacific neighbors,” Ardern said.This will be New Zealand’s largest immunization rollout ever. Most countries are factoring the process to take all of 2021 and some of 2022 to complete due to its scale and complexity, also due to production and delivery timeframes, she said.“Our first priority will be to vaccinate border workers and essential staff who are at the greatest risk of getting COVID-19. We expect vaccines to be delivered to our front-line workers in the second quarter of 2021,” the prime minister said, adding that vaccination of the general public will begin in the second half of the year.“We are moving as fast as we can, but we also want to ensure the vaccine is safe for New Zealanders,” she said.Minister of Research, Science and Innovation Megan Woods said the agreements could ensure that “we are invested in a range of options and that we’re not putting all of our eggs into one basket.”(ANI/Xinhua)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-to-purchase-covid-19-vaccines-from-2-more-firms-says-pm-ardern/story-ZBrp2MhomjKgLi5qDgti1O.html

The rail link is also expected to enhance connectivity and trade between Assam, West Bengal and Bangladesh.“During the summit, the two leaders will hold comprehensive discussions on the entire spectrum of the bilateral relationship, including further strengthening cooperation in the post COVID era,” the Ministry of External Affairs was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.India and Bangladesh have both been very keen to restart the six pre-1965 rail links between both countries. There are five links that are currently operational between both nations - Petrapole (India) - Benapole (Bangladesh), Gede (India) - Darshana (Bangladesh), Singhabad (India)-Rohanpur (Bangladesh) and Radhikapur (India)-Birol (Bangladesh). The rail link between Akhaura and Agartala is also being quickly developed to further increase trade in that region.Both the leaders will also launch a stamp to commemorate the birth centenary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladesh to its independence from Pakistan in 1971. Pakistan lost the war to the Indian Army and Bangladesh’s Muktibahini on December 16. India celebrates December 16 as Vijay Diwas to commemorate the victory.The summit will also see the launch of the Bangabandhu-Bapu Digital Exhibition to celebrate the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

Second lady Karen Pence and Surgeon General Jerome Adams are expected to receive the vaccine along with the vice president.Biden’s plan, which was confirmed by a transition official, comes after he pledged to get the vaccine in public to allay any fears about the shots.“I want to make sure that we demonstrate to the American people that it’s safe to take,” Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware. “When I do it, I’ll do it publicly.”Pence and Biden stand in contrast to President Donald Trump, who has wavered about whether and when he will receive the vaccine. Many public-health experts, including the head of Trump’s own vaccine initiative, said the president should be among the dignitaries who get the shots to inspire confidence in them.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said this week that Trump would encourage Americans to take the coronavirus vaccine but would not say if he would get it while he is still in office. The president was hospitalized in early October after contracting the virus.“He will receive the vaccine as soon as the medical team determines it’s best,” she told reporters.Pence’s and Biden’s plans to quickly receive the shots were announced days after a Covid-19 vaccine created by Pfizer Inc. And BioNTech SE received authorization for emergency use, a pivotal moment in the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 300,000 lives in the USYet government officials and public health have said they are worried many Americans might not take it for political reasons or skepticism about vaccines in general.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-joe-biden-to-get-vaccine-to-build-public-confidence-in-shot/story-pzo9grwK4iSPKCOxHMvrGI.html
17-12-2020||World||Erdogan says US sanctions an ‘attack’ on ally Turkey’s rights||President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday U.S. sanctions imposed on Turkey over its purchase of Russian defence systems were a “hostile attack” on its sovereign rights and defence industry, and the move was bound to fail.Washington slapped the sanctions on NATO member Turkey’s Defence Industry Directorate (SSB), its chief Ismail Demir and three other employees on Monday over its acquisition of Russian S-400 missile defence systems.In his first public comments on the move, Erdogan said problems stemming from the sanctions would be overcome and vowed to ramp up efforts towards an independent defence industry, while criticising Washington for punishing a NATO ally.“What kind of alliance is this? What kind of partnership is this? This decision is an open hostile attack on our country’s sovereign rights,” he said in a televised address.“The real goal is to block the advances our country started in the defence industry recently and to once again render us absolutely dependent on them (United States),” he added. “Surely there will be problems, but each problem will push open a door for us for a solution.”Turkey says its purchase of the S-400s was not a choice, but rather a necessity as it was unable to procure air defence systems from any NATO ally on satisfactory terms. Washington says the S-400s pose a threat to its F-35 fighter jets and to NATO’s broader defence systems. Turkey rejects this and says S-400s will not be integrated into NATO. On Wednesday, Erdogan repeated that the U.S. concerns had no technical basis. He said Ankara still produced close to 1,000 parts for the F-35 jets, despite being removed from the programme over the S-400 purchase. Turkey had also been due to buy more than 100 F-35 jets. The sanctions come at a delicate moment in the fraught relations between Ankara and Washington as Democratic President-elect Joe Biden gears up to take office on Jan. 20, replacing Republican incumbent Donald Trump.Erdogan’s Communications Director, Fahrettin Altun, said the sanctions would be a burden for Biden but that Ankara believed Washington would reverse “this grave mistake without delay”. Altun added that the sanctions made Washington look like an unreliable ally within NATO.“This crisis will go down in history...books as a failure of U.S. diplomacy. For the United States, which we see as an important ally, to experience such an eclipse of the mind, despite our efforts to protect our mutual interests on the basis of equality, is a loss for them,” he told Aksam newspaper.Erdogan said last week he would discuss strained ties with Washington once Biden enters the White House.Ending his remarks, Erdogan unveiled footage of Turkey’s new domestic missile defence system, HISAR-A+, which he said had been delayed due to an embargo on a part Turkey was importing. He did not say which country Turkey was importing from.

The other three being Dr Ami Bera, 55, who is the senior-most member of the so called ‘Samosa Caucus’, Raja Krishnamoorthi, 47, and Pramila Jayapal, 55.Khanna’s father is a chemical engineer who graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and the University of Michigan, and his mother is a former substitute school teacher.Considered to be “dynamic” by his Congressional colleagues, Khanna is a strong supporter of India-US relationship. He previously served in the Obama Administration, as Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Department of Commerce under from August 8, 2009, to August 2011.First elected to the US Congress in 2016 by defeating incumbent Mike Honda, he has made a mark for himself within the Democratic Party, but also at the national stage on key issues ranging from foreign policy, national security, environment, commerce and manufacturing jobs.He identifies himself as a progressive capitalist and was a national co-chair of Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ro-khanna-named-democratic-vice-chair-of-congressional-india-caucus/story-zgY15rufcr3EVfDMhrs4YK.html
17-12-2020||World||US plans new charges in 1988 Lockerbie airline bombing||The Justice Department plans to unseal new charges in the coming days in connection with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet that exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people, according to a person familiar with the case.The bombing of Flight 103, whose victims included dozens of American college students, spurred global investigations and produced sanctions against Libya, which ultimately surrendered two intelligence officials for prosecution before a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands.The announcement of a prosecution against an additional individual would carry personal significance for Attorney General William Barr, who is leaving the position next week but held the same job when the Justice Department nearly 30 years ago revealed criminal charges in the U.S. against the two Libyans. Monday is the 32nd anniversary of the bombing.“This investigation is by no means over. It continues unabated. We will not rest until all those responsible are brought to justice,” Barr said at a 1991 news conference announcing the charges. “We have no higher priority.”The head of the Justice Department’s criminal division at the time was Robert Mueller, who went on to serve as FBI director and as special counsel in charge of the investigation into ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign.Libya refused to extradite the men to the U.S. but ultimately agreed to a deal to put them on trial in the Netherlands.News of the expected criminal case was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. A person familiar with the Justice Department’s plan who was not authorized to discuss it by name confirmed it to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.The New York-bound flight exploded over Lockerbie less than an hour after takeoff from London on Dec. 21, 1988. Among the Americans on board were 35 Syracuse University students flying home for Christmas after a semester abroad.The attack, caused by a bomb packed into a suitcase, killed 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground.In 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed arms sales and air travel sanctions against Libya to prod Col. Muammar Gadhafi, the country’s leader, into surrendering the two suspects. The sanctions were later lifted after Libya agreed to a $2.7 billion compensation deal with the victims’ families.One man — former Libyan intelligence official Abdel Baset al-Megrahi — was convicted in the Netherlands of the bombing, and a second Libyan suspect was acquitted of all charges. Al-Megrahi was given a life sentence, but Scottish authorities released him on humanitarian grounds in 2009 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He later died in Tripoli.____Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-plans-new-charges-in-1988-lockerbie-airline-bombing/story-FNGJMhrN5IkpQGqxq0zvlL.html
17-12-2020||World||White House holds several meetings to address spate of Russian hacking||The White House has convened urgent meetings of officials across multiple agencies to address a breach of US government computer systems attributed to Russia, according to a person familiar with the matter.The Trump administration is holding daily discussions on the hack that include representatives of the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Department of Homeland Security and National Security Agency, according to the person.US government agencies were attacked as part of a global campaign orchestrated by hackers believed to be tied to the Russian government, according to US officials. The hackers were reported to have installed a malicious vulnerability in software from Texas-based SolarWinds Corp., whose customers include top government agencies and Fortune 500 companies.It’s unclear what information the hackers were after. No classified systems are believed to have been accessed, the person said.A White House National Security Council spokesman had no immediate comment. The FBI is investigating and gathering intelligence to track down the responsible actors, national security officials said in a joint statement Wednesday night.National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien returned early from a trip to the Middle East and Europe this week to address the hack.The Department of Defense said in a statement that to date it had no evidence its information networks were compromised.“We will continue to work with the whole-of-government effort to mitigate cyber threats to the nation.” Vice Admiral Nancy Norton, director of the Defense Information Systems Agency, said in the statement.In addition to the daily meetings, a separate US cyber response group is investigating the scope of the breach, which involved the departments of State, Commerce, Treasury and Homeland Security. That group meets every other day and is in regular communication, the person said.Technology officials at various government agencies are providing information to investigators and coordinating the response, the official said. It’s not clear how long the cleanup and investigative effort will take.The White House convened officials to assess the hack under an Obama-era program, known as Presidential Policy Directive 41, that outlined how the federal government would respond to a cyber attack. The 2016 directive was designed to address incidents that had significant impact on an entity, national security or the economy that would require a unified government response and close coordination between the public and private sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-holds-several-meetings-to-address-spate-of-russian-hacking/story-V3BSS9SefT65jTq09qJWaN.html

Health-care providers can use all the liquid in each vial, though they shouldn’t combine vaccine from separate vials, FDA spokeswoman Abby Capobianco said in a statement.“At this time, given the public health emergency, FDA is advising that it is acceptable to use every full dose obtainable (the sixth, or possibly even a seventh) from each vial, pending resolution of the issue,” Capobianco said.Pfizer can’t provide a recommendation, spokeswoman Sharon Castillo said in an email. Once the formula is diluted, the multidose vial contains enough vaccine for at least five shots, she said. How much is left after five shots are given can vary depending on the type of needles and syringes used, she said.Extra vaccine must be discarded if there isn’t enough left to administer the correct dose, she said. Pfizer and the FDA say they are working together to address the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-says-extra-pfizer-vaccine-doses-are-usable/story-V3hsXz5m6Pq8PNKp3T5niK.html

Pakistan’s gas distribution companies Sui Southern Gas Co. and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd., which have started acquiring land for the pipeline, will be a part of the project, while a Russian consortium will lead construction.Pakistan has become one of the top emerging markets for the super-chilled fuel in recent years as domestic gas production has plateaued, forcing the nation to import cargoes. The nation has also auctioned a record 20 oil and gas blocks to encourage exploration activity, with bids expected by mid-January, said Babar.Pakistan, which imported its first cargo five years ago, currently has two LNG terminals. It’s running the two terminals at capacity to meet peak winter demand, with 12 cargoes secured for December and 11 for January, Babar said. Two more LNG terminals, Energas and Mitsubishi’s Tabeer Energy, are expected to start in the next few years.Pakistan has LNG deals for 700 million cubic feet a day and Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government will decide if the nation needs another medium-term LNG contract for five years after reviewing demand from power generators, the biggest consumers of the fuel, in the next three months, said Babar.The nation has also decided that it will only import cleaner Euro-5 diesel from January after doing the same for gasoline earlier this year. Besides imports, Pakistan also plans to add 150 million cubic feet a day of domestic gas output this month, including 50 mmcfd from the Mari gas field, Babar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-build-1-100-km-lng-pipeline-with-russia-in-july/story-301xQa2JV4Mc5Lryeu85bM.html
17-12-2020||World||Powell busts out Fed model to defend high equity valuations||To defend soaring equity markets against claims of overinflation, economists often cite a valuation methodology that adjusts stock prices for interest rates. The latest to do it is Jerome Powell.In his press conference Wednesday, the Federal Reserve chairman noted that relative to risk-free rates of return, a reference to Treasury yields, shares probably aren’t as overpriced as they appear at first blush. It makes sense Powell would cite the comparison -- it’s a version of something that over the years has come to be known as the Fed model.“If you look at P/Es they’re historically high, but in a world where the risk-free rate is going to be low for a sustained period, the equity premium, which is really the reward you get for taking equity risk, would be what you’d look at,” Powell said.The S&P 500’s earnings yield -- profit relative to share price -- is 2.5 percentage points higher than the yield on 10-year Treasury notes. The comparison, known as the Fed model, sits well above what the spread was before the burst of the internet bubble, when bonds yielded more than equities by that measure.“The PE mafia hates his answer, but it is what it is,” Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note to clients. “But fighting that battle is like trying to convince an extreme partisan to change her position.”A look at equity risk premium offers a very different picture than a plain look at the S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio. Currently, the stock benchmark is trading at 29 times trailing earnings. In 1999, that metric surpassed 30.“Admittedly P/Es are high but that’s maybe not as relevant in a world where we think the 10-year Treasury is going to be lower than it’s been historically from a return perspective,” Powell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/powell-busts-out-fed-model-to-defend-high-equity-valuations/story-EaUaBbV06sYj8edEdT8FYO.html

All sides will have to play a role,” he said, adding that there are many reasons for the violence and the Afghan delegation had shared their views with Pakistan on the matter.“From their discussions, I could sense seriousness towards achieving peace,” Qureshi added.He also announced that the next round of talks between the US and the Afghan Taliban for peace in Afghanistan will commence on January 5. He said that the venue is yet to be decided.The foreign minister said that in the discussions that were held, Pakistan once yet presented its view that there is no military solution for continued peace in Afghan.The foreign office said in a statement that Pakistan will keep supporting an “inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive political settlement for durable peace, stability, and prosperity in Afghanistan and the region”.The visit comes days after US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, announced that the Afghanistan peace process has reached a “significant milestone”.Khalilzad said on Twitter that the two sides had recognised a three-page agreement that codifies rules and procedures for negotiations on a political roadmap and a “comprehensive ceasefire”.Pakistan had welcomed the announcement of the agreement, saying it reflected “a common resolve of parties to secure a negotiated settlement”.But it also warned the world against spoilers in the peace process, saying that New Delhi was against peace and stability in the war-torn country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-qureshi-holds-talks-with-taliban-team-calls-for-peace-in-afghanistan/story-kn6KvknGukTQ3S5giVp8oO.html
17-12-2020||World||Trump spy chief stirs dispute over China election-meddling views||President Donald Trump’s spy chief is considering holding up a report to Congress on foreign efforts to sway the Nov. 3 election, arguing that China should be cited more prominently for its attempts to influence American voters, according to people familiar with the matter.The disagreement that’s dividing US intelligence officials and analysts has prompted Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to weigh withholding his certification of the report that’s supposed to be delivered to US lawmakers on Friday, the people said.Ratcliffe wants the report to more fully reflect the national security threat that China’s efforts posed, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity owing to the sensitivity of the information.The report was set to go to Capitol Hill as Trump continues to reject the outcome of the presidential election won by Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has claimed without proof that wide-scale voter fraud cost him the race, with a number of fellow Republicans still refusing to recognize Biden as president-elect. The intelligence report wouldn’t deal with allegations of domestic fraud, such as in ballot-counting.Ratcliffe and other Trump appointees -- including National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr -- suggested over the summer that China posed a bigger election threat than Russia even though intelligence assessments at the time didn’t support that assertion. In recent months they have issued a barrage of warnings that China is covertly attempting to sway American politics and culture from state legislatures to Hollywood movies and from college campuses to Disney theme parks.US intelligence agencies concluded before the election that Russia was seeking to interfere with this year’s vote, reprising its 2016 effort to undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton and help Trump win the presidency. Officials at the time also cited China and Iran for their attempts at interference, with his supporters saying those nations would seek to hurt Trump rather than help him.In September, FBI Director Christopher Wray focused on Russia in an appearance before a House committee, saying it was seeking to hurt Biden’s presidential campaign through social media and influence operations. Although Wray testified that China also was trying to interfere, primarily by spreading disinformation, Trump chided Wray in a tweet, saying China “is a FAR greater threat than Russia, Russia, Russia.”Ratcliffe’s concerns are fueled by fresh intelligence that provides a fuller picture of what China’s leaders either did or planned to do to keep Trump from being re-elected, the people said.That information, some of it in Mandarin and gathered in the weeks before and after the election, is still being assessed, one of the people said. It includes social media campaigns, such as attempts to amplify messages that Trump is a white supremacist, the person said.China has previously rejected the Trump administration claims as false. The Chinese embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.The dispute over China’s role comes even as the U.S. government is trying to assess the damage from a devastating hacking attack on government agencies attributed to Russia.Some analysts say the new intelligence will show that China’s effort to influence the U.S. election was far more extensive than previously reported by spy agencies over the last year, the people said.Others, though, argue that China took minimal efforts or never acted on its plans.The report is due in classified form to lawmakers 45 days after the election, with an unclassified version set to be released to the public weeks afterward. It summarizes intelligence gathered by agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency.Before taking over in May as director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe was a Republican congressman from Texas who emerged as one of Trump’s fiercest defenders during the president’s impeachment inquiry last year.A former federal prosecutor with no intelligence background, Ratcliffe was originally chosen to replace former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats last year. But he withdrew from consideration following public scrutiny of his qualifications, and his denunciation of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller at a House hearing.Tensions over the report due this week reflect the debate that played out before the election over which US adversary bore greater responsibility for attempts to tamper with US democratic institutions. In September, O’Brien asserted that China -- not Russia -- “has the most massive program to influence the United States politically.”Yet a week later, a Homeland Security Department official accused Trump administration appointees, including O’Brien, of attempting to suppress intelligence on Russian election interference while promoting China as the prime threat.In a whistle-blower complaint, Brian Murphy, Homeland Security’s former intelligence chief, said he was ordered to stop providing intelligence assessments on Russian election meddling and start reporting instead on interference activities by China and Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-spy-chief-stirs-dispute-over-china-election-meddling-views/story-s28qoNeVNgUnPOxtz9Pd5I.html

Defining the Indo-Pacific construct, he said the region signifies the confluence of the Indian and Pacific oceans that can no longer be handled as distinct spheres. The space is also home to more than 64 per cent of the world’s population and accounts for 62 per cent of the global GDP, with more than 50 per cent of global trade traversing through its waters.“And obviously, the security, stability, peace and prosperity of this vast region is vital for the world,” he said while speaking on the theme “Future construct of the Indo-Pacific” at the Partnership Summit 2020 organised by the Confederation of the Indian Industry (CII) and the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade.“Every nation and region would have its own version of this reality. But I can speak for India and say this: It captures a mix of our broadening horizons, widening interests, and globalised activities,” he added.Also read: India wants further talks with China for ‘mutually acceptable solution’ to LAC standoffJaishankar emphasised the need for collaborative action, as the individual interests of countries and collective benefits are at stake. He said it is critical to address the Indo-Pacific policy for all players in the international arena as threats to the region could imperil security.Referring to the debate on who owns the Indo-Pacific concept, he said records show India and Japan were “early movers” and Australia and the US joined in later. The ASEAN announced its Indo-Pacific approach last year and France, Germany and The Netherlands recently unveiled their official policies while the UK is now talking of an “Indo-Pacific tilt”. “This active debate should be treated as a recognition of reality and statement of priority. Quite appropriately, much of it revolves around the ASEAN, whose East Asia Summit initiative has long had its own Indo-Pacific connotations,” he added.Speaking on India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI), that was announced at the East Asia Summit in November 2019, Jaishankar said this is aimed at strengthening practical cooperation and rests on the seven pillars of maritime security, maritime ecology, maritime resources, capacity building, disaster risk reduction and management; science, technology and academic cooperation; and trade, connectivity and maritime transport.India will be a driving force for all areas under IPOI, and like-minded countries, such as Australia and Japan, and ASEAN member states have already expressed willingness to work with the country in these areas, Jaishankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-stability-of-indo-pacific-vital-for-world-s-jaishankar/story-UPEuJUaxViqa0eIDuhSSeM.html

Though there have been rumours — fuelled after her recent tiff with the Shiv Sena — that the actor may join the BJP, Kangana earlier clarified that she harbours no political ambition. The ongoing farmers’ protest has again brought the actor in news, apart from her movies, after she got engaged in a Twitter spat with singer Diljit Dosanjh over the farmers’ protest. I have been honest about the film industry so most of them are against me, I opposed reservations most Hindus hate me, during Manikarnika’s release I fought with Karni Sena so Rajputs threatened me as well, I oppose Islamists many Muslims hate me, I fought with Khalistanis... 1/2 pic.twitter.com/2Eu4RENQWm“I fought with Khalistanis. so now most Sikhs are against me,” Kangana wrote referring to her recent comments on the farmers’ protest. “...my well wishers tell me no political party likes a vote repellent like me, so clearly no political party appreciates me,” she said explaining. But she said she is appreciated in the world of her conscience.“I have been honest about the film industry so most of them are against me, I opposed reservations, most Hindus hate me, during Manikarnika’s release I fought with Karni Sena so Rajputs threatened me as well, I oppose Islamists, many Muslims hate me,” she wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-political-party-appreciates-me-tweets-kangana-explains-why/story-keIRwSzLXkPXBsMo0XE9fK.html

It is an industry which is going to thrive, the question is how do we build the bridge between now and the next 18 to 24 months, which is the post-vaccine era,” Chhatwal said.Speaking about the survival and revival of the sector, he said reopening of the services sector in general and tourism in particular requires the industry to be safe, attractive and economically viable for all stakeholders.“Crisis is also an opportunity to change and we can come up with innovation on new products, services, business models so that revival is faster,” Chhatwal said.Technology can help, we have to accelerate digital skills training for the youth, that will help us revive the business, though a full recovery may take 2 to 3 years, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tourism-sector-will-thrive-again-in-post-vaccine-era-ihcl-ceo/story-iYPrJYa53KjqqJTRIphYNI.html

17-12-2020||India||Amid nationwide protests, Uttarakhand govt announces new panel to determine MSP for tea farmers||Amid nationwide farmer protests, the Uttarakhand government on Thursday announced the formation of a committee that will determine the minimum selling price (MSP) for tea farmers. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat during a review meeting of the state tea development board on Thursday announced that the MSP should be equal to farm gate price. Farm gate price is the value of a product received by a farmer without the transports and marketing costs. Rawat said, “Four new factories should be set up in the state to provide market to the farmers. A committee should be set up to determine the minimum selling price of green leaves produced from tea gardens. This committee will determine the minimum selling price for each year. Tea experts must be employed in developing tea garden and finalizing the price.” This announcement comes at a time when farmers across the country are protesting, demanding adding of a provision on continuing MSP in the farm laws passed by the Central government in September. He also announced that the headquarters of the Tea Board should be established in the summer capital of Garsain. He instructed the district magistrate Chamoli to find a suitable land for it. The chief minister added that tea gardens should be developed and handed over to the farmers. For this, an action plan should be prepared by within one month. Farmers’ suggestions should also be included in the preparation of this model. Technical expertise should also be provided to the farmers after developing the tea gardens. “Efforts should be made to run private tea factories in the state for any reason. If the owners of private factories are not able to run them, then efforts should be made by the board to run them. This will create employment opportunities for the local people and provide them a means of livelihood,” added Rawat. He further said board should meet four times a year. He said that tea gardens can play an important role in the tourism sector in the state. He also instructed the district magistrates to focus on tea tourism in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-nationwide-protests-uttarakhand-govt-announces-new-panel-to-determine-msp-for-tea-farmers/story-AZSWgMPde2oZxUoBEchz8J.html
17-12-2020||India||‘Expressed his feelings’: PM Modi backs agriculture minister’s letter to farmers amid stir||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday backed his agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s letter to the protesting farmers and urged people in the country to read it. “Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar Ji has expressed his feelings by writing a letter to the farmer brothers and sisters, trying to have a polite dialogue. I request all the ‘annadaatas’ to read it. The countrymen are also urged to make it reach to as many people as possible,” PM Modi wrote in a tweet. Tomar, in an eight-page open letter to farmers, said the Modi government is committed to the welfare of farmers and stressed that the new agri laws are aimed at benefiting small and marginal farmers.In his letter, Tomar underlined his background and said, “I am from a farming family. I have grown up seeing, understanding the challenges of farming. I have seen the distress of untimely rain, the happiness of timely monsoon. These were parts of my growing up. I have also seen the week-long wait to sell crops.”Tomar said that several farm unions have welcomed the reforms and are happy, and that there were farmers from some regions who had already stared availing the benefits of these reforms. He further urged farmers to not get influenced by those who were spreading lies for political selfishness.Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.At least five rounds of formal talks have been held between the three Union Ministers and 40 farmer unions to break the deadlock.The unions, however, are demanding complete roll back of the central laws. Last week, the Centre had sent a proposal to these unions, stating that it would give a written assurance that the minimum support price (MSP) system will remain and also redress their other key concerns.

17-12-2020||India||India wants further talks with China for ‘mutually acceptable solution’ to LAC standoff||India on Thursday called for further discussions with China to reach a “mutually acceptable solution” on complete disengagement at all friction points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) against the backdrop of the nearly eight-month border standoff. The eighth and most recent round of talks between senior military commanders of India and China was held at Chushul along the LAC on November 6, and the two sides haven’t held any discussions since then as they were unable to bridge reported differences on pulling back troops and armoured vehicles at key friction points. “It is our expectation that the further discussions will help both sides to achieve an agreement on a mutually acceptable solution for ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western sector and full restoration of peace and tranquillity as early as possible,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. Also Read: India welcomes normalisation of ties by Israel and Morocco, calls for talks with PalestiniansResponding to a question on possible talks with China either between diplomats or military officials, Srivastava said several rounds of discussions held so far had led to better understanding on both sides. “The two sides continue to maintain communication through diplomatic and military channels. These discussions have helped both sides to enhance understanding of each other’s positions,” he said. India and China recently blamed each other for the situation along the LAC, where tens of thousands of troops from both sides have dug in for the winter. New Delhi has maintained that attempts by Chinese troops to unilaterally alter the status quo on the LAC and violation of several agreements for maintaining peace and tranquillity on the disputed border triggered the standoff. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said on December 9 that China had given “five differing explanations” for deploying thousands of soldiers on the LAC and pushing bilateral ties into their most difficult phase ever. He also said ties were “very significantly damaged” by Beijing’s violation of border agreements. In response to another question regarding media reports that a member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was hired by the Indian consulate in Shanghai through a Chinese state-owned recruitment agency, Srivastava said the ministry wasn’t in a position to independently verify the information. “In certain countries, the hiring of local staff requires the approval of local authorities. However, all our missions and posts ensure due security precautions in this regard,” he added. Also Read: Centre modifies hilly road width citing India-China border link, impacts Char Dham roadChinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement that such allegations of “CPC infiltration” were groundless and made out of “ideological prejudice”. She added: “The members of the CPC are not ‘monsters’...It is absolutely ridiculous and wantonly smearing to maliciously label CPC members [for] ‘espionage’.” Responding to another question on Indian crew members of cargo vessels stranded at Chinese ports due to the China-Australia trade row, Srivastava said 23 Indian nationals were on board the MV Jag Anand, anchored near Jingtang port in Hebei province since June 13, and another 16 Indian nationals were on board MV Anastasia, anchored near Caofeidian port since September 20. Both vessels were waiting to discharge their cargo. Chinese authorities have said crew change is not permitted at these ports because of Covid-19-related restrictions, and owners of shipping companies and receivers of the cargo were made aware of the delay in unloading the cargo. “The government continues to be in regular touch with Chinese authorities to seek a resolution of these issues at the earliest and to ensure the humanitarian needs of the crew are taken care of,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-wants-further-talks-with-china-for-mutually-acceptable-solution-to-lac-standoff/story-eWtY8CaOi0OjgjSbZgnfTL.html

Morocco had on December 10 announced the partial normalisation of ties with Israel, including direct flights, the resumption of official contacts and diplomatic relations and the reopening of liaison offices in the two countries. King Mohammed VI of Morocco had also backed a two-state solution through negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis. The US, which brokered the understanding, in turn recognised Morocco’s sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara region. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing that India has always supported peace, stability and development in the region. “In that context, we welcome the normalisation of ties between Morocco and Israel. We have very good relations with both countries,” he said. “India continues with its traditional support for the Palestinian cause. We hope to see early resumption of direct negotiations to find an acceptable two-state solution,” he added. Morocco is the fourth Arab country to set aside hostilities with Israel in the past four months with US help. Israel has also normalised relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan. India has also welcomed a recent decision for resumption of coordination between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, and urged the leadership of both sides to use the opportunity to resume direct negotiations to advance the goal of a two-state solution. Such a solution envisages the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-welcomes-normalisation-of-ties-by-israel-and-morocco-calls-for-talks-with-palestinians/story-kP2XY6zflnFHzAD6lw3gwN.html

17-12-2020||India||PM Modi, Sheikh Hasina launch 5th rail link connecting India and Bangladesh||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina on Thursday launched the fifth rail link connecting both nations during a virtual bilateral summit. The 10.5 km long rail link connecting Haldibari in West Bengal to Chilahati in Bangladesh is expected to further strengthen people to people contact and boost trade between the two neighbours. A goods train was flagged off by Bangladesh’s railway minister Md Nurul Islam Sujan from Chilahati and it entered the Indian side after crossing the international border, said a release issued by Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR). At present there are four other operational rail links between both countries. They are, Petrapole (India)-Benapole (Bangladesh), Gede (India)-Darshana (Bangladesh), Singhabad (India)-Rohanpur (Bangladesh) and Radhikapur (India)-Birol (Bangladesh). The rail link, 3.5 km of which is on the Indian side and the rest in Bangaldesh, was operational till 1965 and was part of the broad-gauge rail route from Kolkata to Siliguri during partition. But the link got disconnected in 1965 after the war with Pakistan. Reopening of the train link is part of the joint declaration in the inter-government railway meeting between both countries at New Delhi in 2015. Indian Railways restored the broad-gauge link from Haldibari till the international border at a cost of Rs 82.72 crore while the Bangaldesh railways upgraded the section from Chilahati to the border. “The newly opened rail link will enhance rail network accessibility to the main ports, dry ports and land borders to support growth in regional trade and to encourage economic and social development of the region,” the NFR release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-sheikh-hasina-launch-5th-rail-link-connecting-india-and-bangladesh/story-E38gq6llodxXgpqWCetZDI.html

17-12-2020||India||Will provide whatever ‘friend’ India needs to defend itself: Israel ambassador Ron Malka||Israel won’t be found wanting in meeting India’s requirements to defend itself against all challenges and hostilities though such cooperation is not directed against any other country, Israeli ambassador Ron Malka has said. The normalisation of ties between Israel and key West Asian states such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain presents new opportunities for trilateral cooperation with India in areas such as trade and technology, Malka said in an interview. In an effort to boost cooperation with India in water management, an area in which Israel possesses the world’s leading technologies and expertise, the country will soon post a “water attaché” at its embassy in New Delhi and undertake an end-to-end project covering 25 villages in a semi-arid region of Uttar Pradesh focused on conservation, purification, recharging groundwater and irrigation techniques, he said. Responding to a question on whether India had made any emergency requests for defence equipment amid the border standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Malka said: “Since we have a strong friendship, whatever India needs from Israel to defend itself, we are there and available to India because this is how we manage our friendships and especially a precious friendship like with India. “But I have to stress that we are not against anyone, we have enough [problems of our own], so we are not against anyone but we are in favour of India...and we also trust India and the bold and strong leadership of India, that India knows how to manage its affairs wisely.” He added, “You don’t need us for that, you just need us to share with you the experience and practices since we share similar challenges and similar hostilities. So of course, there is so much we can share but we are not against anyone but only very strongly in favour of India.” India-Israel defence cooperation has advanced from a buyer-seller relationship to a key strategic partnership, Malka said. “We are working on a regular basis with India, sharing research and development, information and experience,” he said. Referring to the Abraham Accords and Israel’s normalisation of ties with the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco, Malka said this has opened new doors for trilateral cooperation. “Given the fact that Israel and the UAE are defined as key strategic partners of India, those distant partners now form relations...and I understand there is a big opportunity for India.” This atmosphere for normalising relations was reflected in the recent decision by Israel and Bhutan to establish diplomatic relations, he said. “Israel is trying to make as many friends as we can, it is part of our vision and values...There have been bilateral relations between Israel and Bhutan for many, many years, this warm friendship matured to the stage that we decided to formalise and start a formal relationship between the nations,” he added.Israel, the UAE and India are all focused on innovation and technology, and each country brings “comparative advantages to the table” and a lot of “added value to each other”. Malka pointed out that the Indo-Israeli Chambers of Commerce had opened an international office in Dubai because of the huge potential in trilateral collaboration and identified water security, food security and healthcare as potential areas for cooperation. The three countries will work together “to make each other more self-reliant because if there is one lesson that we learnt from this pandemic, every country should be more self-reliant”, he said. To give fresh impetus to Israel’s efforts aimed at water management in India, Israeli foreign minister Gabi Ashkenazi has cleared a long-standing proposal to post a “water attaché” at the embassy in New Delhi. “We have signed a MoU with Uttar Pradesh for a flagship water project that will bring in Israel’s holistic approach for water and agriculture, we are going to work in a semi-arid area with 25 villages on both sides of the equation – the sources and the uses of water – to make it very efficient,” Malka said. A feasibility study for the project will soon be carried out. “It will be successful because it’s a proven concept in Israel. After we finish that, we can just replicate it in many places,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-provide-whatever-friend-india-needs-to-defend-itself-israel-ambassador-ron-malka/story-89hqXs9wFFR02CmA7D6CCN.html

There has been no date mentioned in the notice and Karan may not need to appear in the NCB office in person. He has been asked to send his response and produce documents/electronic evidence, with regard to the viral video of his party, which triggered a huge drug controversy long before the agency started its probe into Bollywood’s link with drug mafias following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput on June 14. In 2019, Karan Johar had hosted a party, a video of which went viral claiming that most of those attending the party were in an inebriated state. Deepika Padukone, Malaika Arora, Arjun Kapoor, Vicky Kaushal were among the stars present at the party and in the viral video. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Manjinder Singh attacked Karan over the video and asked police to take cognizance of the party where drugs were allegedly being used.  #UDTABollywood - Fiction Vs RealityWatch how the high and mighty of Bollywood proudly flaunt their drugged state!!

Both of them are now out on bail, but the probe is going on and several Bollywood personalities have been interrogated by NCB in the last few months.On several occasions, Karan Johar talked about the video in the last one year. “There were achieving members of the industry who were having an easy night out after a hard week of work, having a good time. I took that video with all the earnestness... would I be putting out that video if there was anything happening at all, I am not stupid,” he said in an interview.After the NCB interrogated and arrested Kshitij Ravi Prasad in the drug case, the name of Johar and the old video surfaced. Kshitij was associated with Dharma Productions’ sister concern Dharmatic Entertainment.In September this year, Karan Johar issued a statement distancing from Kshitij and reiterating that no drug was consumed at the party. “In view of the current malicious campaign. I am reiterating that the allegations are completely, baseless and false. No narcotics substance was consumed in the party. I WOULD LIKE TO UNEQUIVOCALLY ONCE AGAIN STATE THAT I DO NOT CONSUME NARCOTICS AND I DO NOT PROMOTE OR ENCOURAGE CONSUMPTION OF ANY SUCH SUBSTANCE,” he had said in a statement on Instagram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bollywood-drug-probe-ncb-issues-notice-to-karan-johar-regarding-his-party-s-viral-video/story-2f6u3Rcv7pkHzlBEt2ENaK.html

During this period, our steps brought a lot of good name for the country. Even foreigners preferred to stay back here and felt safe. Now the post-corona situation is one where our system of medicine, local cure and wellness methods are what could be best suited to deal with it. After corona, medical tourism is expected to rise and we must be prepared for this opportunity.“Domestic tourism is the future. Unexplored, unexploited destinations have to be identified and promoted. Also, people are now preferring to go to tiger projects and other serene places to be with nature and not just big hotels, who will continue to have their own importance and preference for international events etc.,” he said at the ASSOCHAM’s virtual session on “Reviving the stressed sectors to support the post-Covid recovery for India”.Rupinder Brar, Additional Director General, Ministry of Tourism, in her address, highlighted how domestic tourism grew from 128 crore to 2,322 crore visitors between 2014 and 2019, and has the potential to grow further.“Domestic tourism is now happening in a more organic fashion as an organised vertical and has a lot of potential. India’s natural heritage has been rated the sixth greatest in the world by the World Economic Forum. In the post-Covid recovery, I would like to say that we truly are a blessed land. Having said that, we are not forgetting the global market too,” she said.Speaking at the valedictory session of the CII’s annual tourism summit here, Patel reiterated the importance of domestic tourism and said the steps taken by the government during Covid have led to a change in the perception of India in the world.“We need to look at what our role will be after the Covid pandemic is over and it is our responsibility that we meet our pre-Covid level position. The government is working on initiatives like a medical and wellness tourism board, guide training, skilling and Dekho Apna Desh,” he said.Patel said the ministry has changed its publicity campaign by highlighting not just the destination, but the path leading to it as well. “Every stakeholder, whether private or government, will be promoted if they are contributing to the tourism industry. The ministry is open to suggestions on how to improve things. Also, we are as much a stakeholder in the sector as everyone else and if the industry does well, we will too,” he said.It was indicated at the CII session that assessments based on recent demand projections state that the return to pre-Covid levels of international travel will be by the end of financial year 2024 and the sector will see a dip of about 90 per cent in financial year 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-tourism-to-be-mainstay-of-tourism-industry-in-post-covid-times-prahlad-patel/story-XW4ovtSQx7s7kFfiL4tuUJ.html
17-12-2020||India||Innovation has shifted towards OTT shows, Saurabh Tewari||Content creator, producer and director Saurabh Tewari feels that content-driven innovation which used to happen on TV, has shifted towards the OTT platform. The Lucknowite has shot his series ‘Jackson’ in his hometown for 40 days.“Unfortunately, innovation has stopped happening on TV and I don’t think, even with falling ratings, broadcasters are still ready to change their approach. The problem today is that people from a business background have taken over and writers and creative persons are in the backseat. Sequels are the best example of this!” said the maker of shows like ‘Madhubala’ and ‘Rangrasia’. He feels creativity is happening in the digital space. “Storytellers, scriptwriters and creative content makers are doing more digital content and that’s the reason innovation is happening in the OTT space.” Tewari started in 2004 as writer with ‘Siddhant’ then turned creative-programming head and from 2012 an independent producer. Currently, his show ‘Pinjra Khoobsoorti Ka’ is on-air on TV. “We are producing it but I am not creatively involved. I have started realising that I started repeating my stories which was an alarming call for me. I have nothing against TV but my new stories are not suiting the medium. I am done with my phase with creating TV shows.”After ‘Jackson’ he will be directing another OTT series and producing a film that will be shot in London. He feels happy with family-oriented shows like ‘Scam-1992’, ‘Panchayat’ and ‘Gullak’ getting huge success. “With family-oriented content getting huge success, digital shows are getting more viewership. Like, ‘Jackson’ is a love thriller and it has zero sexuality and nudity. Since it is set in the North, it will surely have some words which may be a bit abusive but they are an integral part of script and characterisation.”Saurabh has also directed the TV show ‘Krishna Chali London’ and web-series ‘Chinese Bhasad’ in Lucknow. During the shooting, he contracted the novel coronavirus. “I was the only person to contract the virus but I was asymptomatic. I quarantined myself and after full recovery resumed shooting. It got a little scary but with God’s grace all is well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/innovation-has-shifted-towards-ott-shows-saurabh-tewari/story-oOb5fRynsTA5cczWt5DUhM.html
17-12-2020||India||India, Sri Lanka to discuss release of detained Indian fishermen at meet on Dec 30||India and Sri Lanka will hold a virtual meeting of their joint working group on fisheries on December 30 that will take up the issue of the recent apprehension of 36 Indian fishermen and seizure of five fishing vessels by the Sri Lankan Navy. The established bilateral mechanisms for discussions and cooperation on the issue of fishermen could not be convened because of Covid-19-related restrictions and the two sides have now mutually agreed to hold a meeting of the joint working group at the end of the month, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing on Thursday. The government attaches “high priority” to the issue of the apprehension of Indian fishermen and seizure of their vessels by the Sri Lankan Navy on December 14 and 15, which was also reported by the government of Tamil Nadu, he said. “We are in close touch with the government of Sri Lanka through our high commission in Colombo and the consulate in Jaffna to verify the information and to ensure consular access and facilitate the early release of the fishermen and their boats,” he added. The issue of fishermen and the seized fishing vessels have been on the agenda of discussions between India and Sri Lanka for many years, and the two governments have been “seized of this essentially humanitarian matter at high levels”. Srivastava said: “There exists a common understanding to handle the matter in a humanitarian manner.” The joint working group, led on the Indian side by the secretary of the department of fisheries, is expected to address all issues related to fisheries between India and Sri Lanka, including release of apprehended fishermen and fishing boats, modalities of communication between relevant authorities on the two sides, cooperation in dealing with issues related to livelihood of fishing communities and other matters, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sri-lanka-to-discuss-release-of-detained-indian-fishermen-at-meet-on-dec-30/story-g9AOnQOQDRu2FDw6HZPRJI.html

Recently, we have brought the space reform and unlocked India’s potential in the space sector initiated by the government of India. Now, the first satellite by a start-up called Pixxel India called Anand which is an Earth Observation Satellite will be launched on PSLV C51. Along with Anand, two more satellites under the space reform are going to be launched – one by Space Kidz India and another by a university consortium called UnitySat,” said Sivan after the launch of CMS 01.Also read: Farmers protest should be allowed, observes SCThe satellite by Pixxel India is the first in a series of constellation of Earth Observation Satellites that will provide global coverage every 24-hour; enabling organisations to detect and monitor global phenomenon in near real-time. The data will be available on an Artificial Intelligence-based platform, making the extraction of the data easy. It will have uses in agriculture, forestry, urban monitoring, and climate.As for Space Kidz India, this will be their second satellite to be launched by ISRO. Their first KalamSat was the first student-made satellite to be launched by ISRO using the fourth stage of the PSLV as the platform for the first time.Apart from the PSLV-C51 mission, the Indian Space Research Organisation is also gearing up for the maiden flight of the small satellite launch vehicle. The SSLV will have the capacity to launch a light 500-kilogram satellite in the lower Earth orbit.Also read: Kejriwal is ‘new chameleon’, says Lekhi after CM tore copies of farm billsThe new rocket will cost about Rs 30 crore, compared to the Rs1 20 crore it costs to manufacture the currently used PSLV. It can also be assembled by a team of six within seven days, in comparison to a team of 600 people and a few months that takes to assemble a PSLV. The SSLV has been developed by ISRO mainly for commercial launches.The chairman also assured that work was ongoing on the big-ticket missions.“We have lot of work on hand; there are missions like Chandrayaan 3, Aditya L1 and Gaganyaan for which activities are going on. We will have the missions at the earliest. As usual, team ISRO will rise to the occasion and do the needful to meet the demand by the Indian government,” said Sivan.Chandrayaan 3 would be just a lander-rover mission which will use the existing India orbiter from Chandrayaan 2 mission to communicate with Earth. The Chandrayaan 3 mission was announced after the failure of the previous mission to attempt a soft-landing. It was to take place in late 2020 or early 2021, a deadline ISRO is likely to miss due to the pandemic.Aditya-L1 is India’s first solar mission which will see a satellite travel 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth to the L1 point. The L1 or Lagrangian point, between the Earth and the Sun, is where the gravitational pull of both the bodies on the satellite is equal to centripetal force needed to keep it in orbit.As for Ganganyaan mission, which aims to place Indian astronauts in low earth orbit, the first of the two planned unmanned mission was to take place in December 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/next-pslv-launch-to-carry-3-satellites-made-by-indian-start-ups/story-EFd5k8XIht3jjgXJy2qM8O.html
17-12-2020||India||Assamese people will get a govt of their dreams in 2021: AJP’s 1st president Lurinjyoti Gogoi||A day after officially joining the party, former All Assam Students Union (AASU) general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi on Thursday took charge as the president of the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP). The student-leader-turned-politician was entrusted the responsibility of leading the new regional party, which aims to espouse rights of indigenous Assamese, at the outfit’s first political convention in Sivasagar. “The aspirations of Assam and Assamese people aren’t safe with national parties. We have been duped and exploited for long. The only way to safeguard our interests is to have a platform which believes strong regionalism,” said Gogoi in his maiden address after taking charge. “I want to assure people of Assam that in 2021 we will get a regional government. It will be a government that represents the dreams of the people of Assam. No one can stop this journey,” he added. Former minister Jagadish Bhuyan has been made the party’s general secretary and Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) MLA from Patacharkuchi Pabindra Deka, who resigned from his old party earlier this week and joined AJP, was made the working president. The party, which was formed by AASU and Assam Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad-two of the biggest student organizations in Assam-also appointed 11 vice-presidents and a same number of joint secretaries, organizations secretaries and secretaries. The convention adopted the party’s constitution and also adopted a 19-point political resolution which outlined AJP’s views on various issues including repealing of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), verification of National Register of Citizens (NRC) and implementation of Clause 6 of Assam Accord of 1985. AJP is the second political party to be formed by AASU after Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), which came into being in 1985 after signing of the Assam Accord that ended the six-year-long anti-foreigners agitation--in which both AASU and AJYCP played a key role. Both organizations had spearheaded the anti-CAA stir in the state opposing the Centre’s move to grant citizenship to religious minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan—which many in Assam feared would lead to large scale influx of Bangladeshis to the state. Incidentally, AJP isn’t the only political party that would make its debut in the next assembly polls. Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), another outfit which spearheaded the anti-CAA stir has also formed a political party called Raijor Dal. The outfit’s leader Akhil Gogoi, is at present in jail since last December last year for his role in the anti-CAA stir. In his speech, Gogoi, urged all regional parties of Assam to come together and defeat the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in the next polls. He also called for unconditional release of the KMSS leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assamese-people-will-get-a-govt-of-their-dreams-in-2021-ajp-s-1st-president-lurinjyoti-gogoi/story-GwqPhgIvKeYxrbU1C3GrYN.html
17-12-2020||India||‘Was not allowed to speak': Rahul Gandhi to Lok Sabha speaker on exit from Parliamentary panel meet||Amid political furore surrounding his exit from the Parliamentary panel meet, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and said that he was not allowed to speak freely in the meeting. Gandhi has sought the speaker’s intervention in the matter, citing the right of an elected member of Parliament to speak freely and the need to protect it. The Congress leader and Wayanad MP exited the Parliamentary panel meet on Wednesday along with the members of his party, sparking a wave of political backlash, alleging that the panel’s time was being wasted in discussing armed forces’ uniform instead of the crucial issue of national security.Gandhi , according to people familiar with the proceedings, expressed an opinion that such matters were best left for the forces to discuss and suggested that the panel focus on more substantive issues. The chairman of the panel, Jual Oram, then asked Gandhi to stick to the agenda of the day, listed as “an introduction to the rank, structure of the Defence forces including their uniforms, stars and badges, and review of working of cantonment boards”.Gandhi, in his letter, also said the Speaker, being the custodian of Parliament, should ensure that the discussions and presentations in the panel on defence are in consonance with its role and objectives.     “Sir, as Speaker of the Lok Sabha and custodian of the House, I urge you to intervene and ensure that the discussion and presentations held in the defence committee are in consonance with the role and objective of the institution and that the right of elected MP’s to speak freely is protected,” the Congress leader wrote.Gandhi also raised the issue of Galwan clash from May this year and said, “You are aware that we are currently facing a serious national security challenge on our borders and that China has forcibly occupied our territory and martyred 20 of our soldiers. There are many critical matters to discuss at a time like this.”“It is the right of a member to point out digressions from the agenda and the purpose of the Standing Committee. The Committee is free to disagree with what I say, but the fact that the Chairman does not even permit a member to speak is a sad comment on how the government handles military affairs.He expressed his dismay over the contents of the meeting and the manner in which it was conducted and said it is meant to provide legislative oversight on the policies and decisions of the defence ministry, it being the premier interface between the defence forces and elected representatives. The former Congress chief said he was extremely disturbed to find that the Chief of Defence Staff and the top brass of the Army, Navy and Air Force, who have important matters to deal with, had been asked by the chairman to spend an entire afternoon explaining the colours and different types of uniforms and insignia worn by different ranks in our forces.The meeting was attended by Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat, Army Vice Chief Satinder Kumar Saini and Defence Secretary Arun Kumar. According to some of the members, Rajya Sabha member Lt Gen (retired) DP Vats was asking the officers why the Indian defence establishment couldn’t have a uniform rank system, that is same designations in the Army, Navy and Air Force like the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-not-allowed-to-speak-rahul-gandhi-to-lok-sabha-speaker-on-exit-from-parliamentary-panel-meet/story-OoSetggPBwLUxX3ByHnmoO.html

Addressing a press conference on Singhu border on Thursday evening, farmers leader and coordinator of Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh KV Biju said, “All farmer unions had a meeting today and we have decided that we will consult four Supreme Court lawyers - Prashant Bhushan, Dushyant Dave, HS Phoolka and Colin Gonsalves - about the ongoing proceedings in the Supreme Court… We will neither comment on the matter nor announce any decision without consulting these lawyers.”The Supreme Court stepped in on Wednesday to try and end the impasse between farmers’ unions and the Centre over the contentious new laws to open up trade in agriculture, observing that the protest will soon become a national issue and that recent events suggest government negotiations with the unions were “bound to fail again.” A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde on Thursday asked the attorney general for India if the government can commit that the farm laws will not be implemented while the court is hearing the petitions filed against the ongoing protest.Also read: Second setback: Jitendra Tiwari quits TMC ahead of Amit Shah’s visit; may join BJPThe farmer leaders said that they have not received any notice from the apex court so far. “We have only got to know what is happening in the Supreme Court through the media. We have not received any notice or communication as of now. We will take a legal decision only after consulting these four lawyers,” said another farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal.The agitation at Delhi’s four key borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate, and Chilla – entered the 22nd day on Thursday. Meanwhile, Senior advocate and the president of the Supreme Court bar association Dushyant Dave said that he had offered free legal advice to the farmers on all issues. “If they have decided to take my help it is a privilege and honour for me. After all, for this country ‘Jai Jawaan, Jai Kisan’ means the most. It’s my duty as the lawyer of the Supreme Court to help them as much as I can… I will be happy to appear for them in the Supreme Court if they ask me.”Senior advocate HS Phoolka also confirmed that the farmer leaders had consulted him and the other three lawyers on the matter. Advocate Prashant Bhushan said that he will be offering legal advice to the farmer associations if they approach him.Advocate Colin Gonsalves said, “The discussion with farmers is in the very initial stage. We might be able to comment on it after a couple of days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-unions-to-consult-top-lawyers-including-prashant-bhushan-on-sc-proceedings/story-4T9ccIDWVnBX3Gbf9mNgnI.html

The protest should be allowed to continue without impediment, it said. “We are of the view at this stage that the farmers’ protest should be allowed to continue without impediment and without any breach of peace either by the protesters or the police,” the bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said.On December 16, when the public interest litigation was taken up by the Supreme Court bench, the bench wanted to hear the agitating farmers. However, one of the impleaded respondents-farmers’ associations appeared on Thursday.“The preliminary issue before this court is the claim of the citizen who are the residents of NCT of Delhi/Haryana, having a population of more than two million people, that the manner in which the protest is being carried on is seriously inhibiting the supply of essential goods to the city because of restrictions on the free movement of goods vehicles,” the apex court said.“We clarify that this Court will not interfere with the protest in question. Indeed the right to protest is part of a fundamental right and can as a matter of fact, be exercised subject to public order,” it said.As long as the protest is non-violent and does not result in damage to the life and properties of other citizens and is in accordance with law, there can be no impediment in farmers exercising their rights to protest, the court observed. On finding a way out, the top court mentioned a committee of experts in its order. But this may not be possible without hearing all the necessary parties, it observed. “Till the parties come before us, it would be advisable to obtain suggestions about the constitution of the said committee from all the parties which may be submitted on the date of next hearing,” it said.“List these matters after the ensuing winter vacation with liberty to move the vacation Bench if necessary, after service is complete,” the order said.During the hearing, the court asked Advocate General of India KK Venugopal whether the farm laws can be put on hold as long as the court is hearing the case.When the AG pointed out that if the laws are not implemented, then farmers will not come for further talks, the court said the move is to ensure that the farmers are open to further talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/won-t-interfere-with-farmers-protest-at-this-stage-says-sc/story-CZyhbmHjbbJBo5DcN9ZNKO.html

Lekhi pointed out that the three farm laws had been published in the Delhi Gazette on November 23, and that they were tearing up the copies of the act after notifying. She called Kejriwal the ‘new chameleon’ who can ‘just change colours without qualms’.“Centre’s three farm laws were notified in Delhi Gazette on November 23. Now, they’re tearing copies of same act in Delhi Assembly after notifying. This is opportunistic politics. Delhi CM is the new chameleon, he can just change colours without qualms,” she said.Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had torn up the copies of the three farm laws in the one-day session of the Delhi Assembly on Thursday as a protest against the controversial legislation. He accused the BJP of ensuring their poll funding through the laws rather than thinking of the welfare of the farmers. “What was the hurry to get the farm bills passed in Parliament during the pandemic? It has happened for the first time that three laws were passed without voting in Rajya Sabha, even when several members were opposing the move… In the last 6-7 years, the BJP has made elections so expensive. So, much of money is spent on elections (by political parties). These laws have not been passed for the farmers. These laws have been made to ensure election funding for the BJP,” he told the members of the house. The assembly had passed a resolution tabled by revenue minister Kailash Gahlot demanding that the Central government should repeal the laws immediately.The Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) national convener also accused the nation’s ruling party of asking big party leaders to convince the farmers, saying that the farmers were not the ones that were misguided, but the BJP leaders and supporters. Kejriwal even urged the Centre to not be worse than the British. “How many sacrifices will the farmers have to make to get their voices heard? Today, the Delhi Assembly rejects all the three farm laws and appeals to the Central government to take back the legislations. I request the Centre not to be worse than the British,” he said. Scores of farmers have been protesting against the three controversial farm legislations brought by the Centre for days now and talks between representatives of both have resulted in stalemate. The Centre is willing to amend the laws but the majority of the protesting farmers want a complete roll back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-is-new-chameleon-says-meenakshi-lekhi-after-cm-tore-copies-of-farm-bills/story-xJtptKYR13A5lga7kUZbZM.html
17-12-2020||India||Sustainability an important decision-making factor in govt, corporate world: Piyush Goyal||Sustainability has become an important element of decision-making both in the government and the corporate sector of the country, Union Minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday. Sustainable development will further enhance the scale and speed of growth in the years to come, the commerce and industry minister said. He was addressing a virtual international conference organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). Goyal further said the present situation provides a unique opportunity to redesign, reinvent and realign various practices and processes. “While doing so, sustainability is the restrain that must guide our plans, decisions and actions for the future,” Goyal emphasised.   Under the mission of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’, India is progressing rapidly to become a hub of manufacturing and expand its role in the global economy, he said. This is not possible without strengthening the ecosystem of MSMEs, the minister noted.  “India is going through a series of radical reforms which is changing our mindset to alleviate our actions, ambition and aims,” Goyal said. Echoing the views, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic strategy of Aatmanirbhar Bharat is not only aimed at self-reliance but also sustainability across sectors.” In 2014, when the Modi government came to power for the first time, it inherited an economy which was part of the ‘Fragile Five’ global economies and foreign investors were pulling out funds from India, he said. “However, in the last six years, we have consistently introduced reforms that have brought about significant change and now all indicators from inflation to fiscal deficit, from forex reserves to current account deficit, from GDP growth to financial inclusion, all point to very stable and sustainable economic position,” Thakur added. He further noted that a digital highway has been laid for growth of the banking and financial sector by taking up the task of connecting India’s 6 lakh villages with optical fibre network. “In the past three years, 1.5 lakh gram panchayats have already been connected and rest of the 1 lakh gram panchayats will be connected within next 12 months,” Thakur said. India can achieve double-digit growth through a healthy mix of digital services and manufacturing base expansion in the times ahead, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sustainability-an-important-decision-making-factor-in-govt-corporate-world-piyush-goyal/story-OsY26TpfqWvWb5WIHEhSzI.html
17-12-2020||India||IT secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney pushes for India’s own data protection model||IT secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney on Thursday said the new decade is of India and it is time for the country to come up with a data protection model that the world follows.The data protection model for both personal and non-personal is at an infancy stage and there is learning that is coming from various countries as of now, he added.“We have actually practised for the past several decades where we look at models which have emerged somewhere else and then sort of improve on that. This is 2020 and decade of India.“I truly believe it’s India’s decade and it’s India’s time to come up with a model that the world looks at and does some cut and paste, and some improvisation of what comes out of India,” Sawhney said at a virtual panel discussion organised by Vidhi Legal.He said that the idea of creating data trusts is going to be very significant for both personal and non-personal data.The Personal Data Protection Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in February and has been referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee of both the Houses, headed by BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi, for examination and report.“Our framework is something that the world is looking very carefully and I believe this to be recognised as the best thinking at the current level. These are of course subjects that are there at the infancy stage. There is learning already from GDPR implementation and from other countries as well, but as we move not only to personal data protection but also into various aspects of non-personal data,” Sawhney said.The draft of the bill, approved by the Cabinet in December 2019, proposes a penalty of up to Rs 15 crore and up to three-year jail term for company executives for violating privacy norms.The draft mandates storage of critical data of individuals by internet companies within the country, while sensitive data can be transferred overseas only after explicit consent of the data owner.The bill has been drafted following a Supreme Court judgement in August 2017 that declared ‘Right to Privacy’ a fundamental right.The need for a strong personal data protection regime was further highlighted by the apex court in its judgement in September 2018 in which it held Aadhaar as a constitutionally valid scheme but struck down some provisions in the Aadhaar Act.As per the provisions of the bill, all internet companies will have to mandatorily store critical data of individuals within the country. However, they can transfer sensitive data overseas after explicit consent of the data owner to process it only for purposes permissible under the proposed legislation.Critical data will be defined by the government from time to time. Data related to health, religious or political orientation, biometrics, genetic, sexual orientation, health, financial etc have been identified as sensitive data.A company executive in-charge of conduct of the data business would face a jail term of up to three years if found guilty of knowingly matching anonymous data with publicly available information to find out the identity of an individual - called as ‘re-identify de-identified data’ in technical parlance, under the proposed law.Social media companies will be required to come up with a mechanism to identify users on their platform who are willing to be identified voluntarily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-secretary-ajay-prakash-sawhney-pushes-for-india-s-own-data-protection-model/story-szmpLHPmalS3kyQHL4t3yJ.html

The move, cleared during a meeting of the DAC headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh, was described by officials as a big boost to the “Make in India” and “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiatives. Among the acquisition proposals approved were the airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft designed and developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for the Indian Air Force, next generation offshore patrol vessels for the Indian Navy, and modular bridges for the Indian Army, according to a statement from the defence ministry. The DAC approved seven capital acquisition proposals for various weapons, platforms, equipment and systems required by the army, navy and air force at an approximate overall cost of Rs 28,000 crore. Six of these acquisitions, worth Rs 27,000 crore, will be made from Indian industry, the statement said, without giving further details. This was the first meeting of the DAC under the new regime of the Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020, and these was the first set of “acceptance of necessity (AoNs)” accorded, the statement said. A majority of the AoNs were “accorded in the highest categorization of Buy Indian (IDDM)”, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dac-clears-proposals-to-acquire-defence-hardware-worth-rs-27-000-cr-from-indian-industry/story-6s5kOFEZ7sRFx6thD62b3L.html

17-12-2020||India||ISRO launches PSLV with communication satellite||In its fiftieth successful flight, India’s workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) launched the communication satellite CMS-01, which will replace the old GSAT-12 satellite launched in 2011.The new satellite will enhance the country’s communication networks and aid in e-learning, tele-medicine, and disaster management services. The current satellite has an estimated mission life of over seven years. The rocket – in its XL configuration with six solid strap-on motors – lifted off from the second launch pad at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh at 3.41pm on Thursday. After the burn of all four stages of a PSLV rocket, the satellite was placed in an elliptical geostationary transfer orbit. After four days, the Liquid Apogee Motor will be fired and after a few manoeuvres, the satellite will be placed in a circular orbit of 36,000 km. This was the second launch for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) this year, with most of the missions – including big-ticket solar mission and first unmanned flight of the Gaganyaan mission – delayed due to the pandemic. Before the pandemic, India was only able to complete one satellite mission—GSAT-30—this year, launched by the international launcher Arianespace from Kourou, French Guiana, in January. The launch of PSLV-C50/CMS-01 had earlier been scheduled for December 7, exactly one month after its previous launch. However, the launch had to be delayed by ten days due to weather conditions. The satellite, named CMS-01, will be the first in a new series of communication satellites by India after the INSAT and the GSAT series. The previous satellite launched by Isro also had an altered nomenclature-- EOS (Earth Observation Satellite) 01.Earth observation satellites in the past were thematically named by the space agency, depending on their task or the kind of instrumentation carried. EOS-01 had previously been named RISAT-2BR2, short for Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT). “I am extremely happy to declare that PSLV C-50 successfully injected CMS 01 in precise sub-GTO orbit. The satellite is functioning very well and I have received confirmation that the solar panels have been deployed. In another four days, the satellite will be placed in geo synchronous orbit. This excellent success was achieved because of the hard work of Team ISRO. They worked very safely during pandemic, with minimal staff,” said ISRO chairperson Dr K Sivan after the launch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-launches-pslv-with-communication-satellite/story-CDzp86VEV4mjzmFQJJR6SK.html

Agarwal announced the rule while inspecting the arrangements being made in the assembly for the session on Wednesday. “Considering the ongoing pandemic, all the members of the assembly would have to mandatorily carry a negative report of a Covid-19 test so as to attend the session. Without it, nobody will be allowed to enter the House,” said Agarwal. He informed that there would also be a medical team at the entrance of the House to conduct a Rapid Antigen test for the members. “All the members are requested to undergo a test beforehand with a report having validity of 72 hours,” Agarwal said. He also informed that all the members would be attending the session in person unlike during the previous one-day session in which about 24 members opted to attend virtually. “This time as all the members have opted to attend it by being present in the House, no arrangements will be made to attend it virtually. Appropriate sitting arrangements have been made with social distancing for the members,” Agarwal said. During the three-day session, the Uttarakhand government will also present the state’s supplementary budget of Rs 4,096 crore. A Cabinet minister speaking on condition of anonymity citing the norm of not revealing details regarding the policy before any upcoming session said, “During the three-day session, a supplementary budget of Rs 4,096 crore would be tabled. Apart from that, the government would also answer about 468 questions received so far by the House to be taken up in the session.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-test-report-must-for-uttarakhand-mlas-to-attend-upcoming-assembly-session/story-wRewMHXnq4iIo2UWRFUJSJ.html
17-12-2020||India||Mumbai: Special court asks Iqbal Mirchi’s wife, sons to appear||A special court here has asked the wife and sons of Iqbal Mirchi, the late aide of gangster Dawood Ibrahim, to appear before it. Mirchi’s wife Hajra Memon and sons Junaid and Asif have been summoned under Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018, and they would be declared fugitive economic offenders if they fail to comply. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had, on December 4, approached the special court to declare the three as fugitive economic offenders as they have failed to respond to warrants issued against them and have not returned to India even after repeated summons and warrants. The court has issued notices to all three to return to India or it would proceed to hear the ED’s plea. The ED had initiated money laundering investigation against the gangster and his family on September 26, 2019. While probing the matter, the ED had provisionally attached the family’s assets to the tune of Rs798 crore in India and abroad under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.The agency had arrested five accused persons, including Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL’s) Kapil Wadhawan, Dheeraj Wadhawan and Humayun Merchant in that case.The ED probe has revealed that the DHFL allegedly extended loans to Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd, which purportedly routed money to Mirchi, who died in the UK in August 2013. The DHFL came under the ED’s scanner when the agency was examining properties linked to Mirchi in Worli. The three properties have already been attached by ED under PMLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/appear-or-be-declared-fugitive-economic-offenders-special-court-to-iqbal-mirchi-s-wife-sons/story-vKooOyrBD2wPN2aiCT9bGL.html

17-12-2020||India||Delhi HC rejects PIL seeking medical facilities for farmers protesting at borders||The Delhi high court on Thursday refused to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought medical and health facilities at borders with Delhi where the farmers have been protesting against the new farm laws. A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan said the matter is already pending with the Supreme Court, which is looking into the larger issue. It also said that the petitioner, a lawyer, Ashish, could have filed the petition at the Punjab and Haryana high court rather than coming here.“We are not the central govt. Where are they protesting? Outside Delhi? Is this publicity interest or public interest?,” the bench said. The court also said that since the protests are being held at the borders, it does not have jurisdiction. It said the same plea could have been filed before the Punjab and Haryana HC which could have adjudicated it.The plea filed through advocate Rohit Jha contends that under the present circumstances the agitation may take the face of “violent riots” at any point of time. It said that ‘unavoidable situations’ have been witnessed between the farmers and police authorities while the former has been agitating against the newly passed farms laws.The plea said that the farmers gathered at various borders of Delhi are at a high risk of getting infected from Covid-19 as there is no adherence to social distancing and most of the protestors are spotted without facemasks, which shows they are least aware about their own safety in the present situation of Covid-19 pandemic.Also Read: Crucial meeting at BJP headquarters on farmers’ issue; Ready to talk only if Centre calls, says TikaitThe petition argued that it was likely to turn the situation in Delhi critical if a large number of protestors get infected, thereby increasing the chance of a mass spread of the disease in the capital.“That the farmers who are protesting at various borders of the NCT Delhi are vulnerable to various kinds of diseases and are a threat to the women, children and aged protesters,” the plea said.The plea further argues that “it is a possibility that the violent anti-national groups may see a good opportunity to convert the peaceful protests by the farmers into violent riots and create communal tension among people. The protesting farmers who are already de-motivated by the utter negligence of the Union of India may act violently due to the inducement and abetment by the bad elements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-rejects-pil-seeking-medical-facilities-for-farmers-protesting-at-borders/story-sqI57PYLVxeF36A0olKT7H.html
17-12-2020||India||Rebel Suvendu Adhikari quits Trinamool; Asansol’s outgoing mayor steps down||Former West Bengal minister and heavyweight leader Suvendu Adhikari resigned from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Thursday by writing a formal letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “Respected Madam, I am writing to tender my resignation as a member of the All India Trinamool Congress as well as from all other positions held by me in the party and its associate organs with immediate effect. I am thankful for all the challenges and opportunities that has been afforded to me and I will always value my time spent as a member of the party,” Adhikari wrote in the short letter. He was a member of the TMC’s steering committee and state committee as well as a leader of the trade union front. Last month, he had quit the cabinet in which he held three important departments. Though the body of the letter was typed in English, the date was hand-written. The initial date appeared to be December 15 but was overwritten and changed to December 16. TMC leaders said they received it on Thursday morning. In another significant development, popular TMC leader Jitendra Tiwari resigned from the post of chairman of the board of administrators of Asansol Municipal Corporation in West Burdwan district. Jitendra Tiwari quit the TMC around 4.45 pm. He alleged that his office at Pandabeswar was ransacked by miscreants shortly after he resigned from the post of chairman of the administrative board at the Asansol civic body. He also stepped down from the post of president of the TMC’s West Burdwan district unit and sent a letter to Subrata Bakshi, the party’s state president. “Now there is no need to meet the chief minister on Friday. I have not decided whether I will resign from the state assembly,” said Tiwari while the TMC faction opposed to him took out a rally in Asansol town. “Tiwari was not a big leader as such. Mamata Banerjee, who made him an MLA and mayor, had asked him to wait till she returns from north Bengal. People who do not have any ideology are leaving the TMC in search of better fortune. This is unfortunate but the party will not suffer,” Saugata Roy, TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson told HT. In Murshidabad district, six area presidents of the TMC resigned in the Bamangola community block area. At Dankuni in Hooghly district, Debasish Mukherjee, deputy chairman of the local civic body, stepped down and spoke out against the party. Gargi Mukherjee, president of the TMC’s women’s unit at Haldia in East Midnapore district, also resigned from her post. CM Banerjee, also the party’s founder, had called up Tiwari on Wednesday and asked him not to take any drastic step till she returns from north Bengal and meets him on Friday. After quitting the civic body, Tiwari remained non-committal on whether he would meet her. Tiwari is president of the TMC’s district unit and lawmaker from the local Pandabeswar assembly seat. Union minister of state Babul Supriyo is the Lok Sabha member from Asansol. The district’s adjacent Lok Sabha seat, Bardhaman-Durgapur, is represented by another Union minister of state SS Ahluwalia. The BJP secured more votes than the TMC in almost all the assembly segments of the district during the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. “I promise you that after the assembly elections our men will be in charge of the civic body and solve your pending problems. These will not be solved now as the incumbent urban development minister will never address issues regarding development of Asansol,” Tiwari said in his last speech before the civic body staff. He did not name Firhad Hakim, the minister. Tiwari attended a closed-door meeting with Adhikari and some other rebel lawmakers on Wednesday night. The meeting stoked speculations that Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit to the poll-bound state this weekend might be marked by defections of TMC rebels to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Shah will address rallies and party workers in three districts on December 19 and 20. Tiwari, however, said after the meeting that his allegiance to the chief minister was intact. On Thursday, he said, “I want the TMC to keep Adhikari in the party. If the party wants me to quit from the assembly, I will do so immediately.” Meanwhile, Adhikari’s resignation from the assembly ran into rough weather. When Adhikari went to the assembly house on Wednesday afternoon to submit his hand-written letter, the speaker was not present in his office. Though received by the assembly secretary, the letter raised several technical questions since Adhikari did not put any date on it and did not write or sign it before the Speaker --- something anti-defection rules of the assembly demands. The speaker, Biman Banerjee, said on Thursday that Adhikari’s resignation as an MLA had not been accepted on technical grounds. “There are technical issues. The resignation cannot be accepted.

17-12-2020||India||TRP manipulation case: SIT arrests former BARC COO||Mumbai Police crime branch has arrested Romil Ramgarhia, the former chief operating officer of Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) for his alleged involvement in the Television Rating Points (TRP) fraud.This is the 14th arrest made by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) which is probing the case. The TRP fraud case is based on the complaint filed by BARC through Hansa Research Group.A crime branch officer confirmed the arrest, but did not specify Ramgarhia’s role in the case. Police sources said that the accused was well aware of wrongdoings related to TRP manipulation. According to the Mumbai Police, TRP ratings, which decide who will get the biggest share of advertisements, were being manipulated by three channels.Some families, at whose houses barometers were installed for collecting data of viewership, were being bribed to watch a particular channel to boost its TRP.In a press conference, Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh had claimed that two regional channels and Republic TV were suspected to be involved in the manipulation.Later, 13 people were arrested by the SIT in connection with the manipulation. Arrested accused involved executives of the channels.SIT recently also arrested Republic Television chief executive officer (CEO) Vikas Khanchandani. Later, he secured bail in the matter.Republic TV’s distribution head Ghanshyam Dilipkumar Singh was also arrested in the past. Singh has allegedly paid monthly Rs15 lakh for seven months to a vendor to boost viewership of his channel, claimed the crime branch in their remand copy filed before the court. Police also claimed that hawala channels were also used for these transactions.Singh’s name cropped up in the investigation while officials were probing the role of Abhishek Kolawade alias Ajit alias Amit alias Mhadik, who worked as a vendor for many channels and was arrested on October 31.Mumbai Police has earlier informed the court that Kolawade’s sustained interrogation revealed that to amplify TRP of Republic TV, he received Rs15 lakh per month from Singh between January 2020 and July 2020. He received some of this money through hawala.The remand copy added that Kolawade gave part of this money to Ramji Varma, Dinesh Vishwakarma and Umesh Mishra to further pay to the families whose houses were selected for installing a barometer with an instructions to watch Republic TV channels. Many unlawful financial transactions surfaced during the investigations of Mumbai Crime Branch, which perhaps also prompted Enforcement Directorate to launch a parallel probe to investigate possible money laundering in the TRP manipulation.Previously, Republic TV had said that Mumbai Police is attacking it through fake TRP case probe.Recently, the SIT has also filed a charge sheet in the case, detailing the roles of arrested accused. The SIT would be filing a supplementary charge sheet in the case which would also include the report of forensic auditor tracing the money trail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trp-manipulation-case-sit-arrests-former-barc-coo/story-7UMnDt9cPb23EvzlbwKNXI.html
17-12-2020||India||Amit Shah, Tomar, Piyush Goyal attend crucial meeting on farm issues at BJP headquarters||As the Supreme Court on Thursday heard the issue of the ongoing protest of the farmers and made some suggestions to untangle the present deadlock, the protesting unions of the farmers remained stern on their demand to withdraw the laws first. A crucial meeting is being held at the BJP headquarters to discuss the farmers’ issues with party general secretaries. The meeting is to be attended by Union home minister Amit Shah, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, commerce minister Piyush Goyal. Agreeing to what Supreme Court pointed out that the issue must be resolved soon, Bharatiya Kisan Union national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait on Thursday said the future course of action will be taken after discussion with panchayat. As the apex court noted that the farmers have rights to protest but not blocking a city, Tikait said that the protesters have not blocked roads. The barricades have been put up by police, he said. “Supreme Court is right that the issue should be resolved soon. We’ll go if we’re called. Government wants amendments, while we want them to take back the laws,” Tikait said. The Supreme Court on Thursday noted that farmers have rights to protest but sitting on roads will not bring about any solution. A panel for mediation is likely to be set up with representations of farmers and the Centre. Experts like P Sainath can also be members of the panel. As the panel gets formed and starts working, the farmers can continue their protests, the Supreme Court bench, led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, said. It also asked attorney general of India KK Venugopal whether the government can commit to not implement to laws as long as the hearing on the case is going on. The AG said if the laws are not implemented, then farmers will not continue the talks to which the SC bench said the move is aimed at facilitating further talks. The AG sought some time to take direction from the government.Since the three bills were passed in Parliament in September, there have been five rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmers. Three rounds of talks have been held in December after thousands of farmers started ‘Dilli Chalo’ protest rally on November 26. The protest has entered its 21st day on Thursday. No date for another round of meeting has been finalised yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crucial-meeting-at-bjp-headquarters-on-farmers-issue-ready-to-talk-only-if-centre-calls-says-tikait/story-WVJq8SS8uXrQieU5o3lk4N.html
17-12-2020||India||Centre modifies hilly road width citing India-China border link, impacts Char Dham road||The Union road ministry has increased the sanctioned width of hilly roads of national strategic importance that provide connectivity to India-China border to 7 metres. The move will impact the Char Dham road project by nearly restoring its original width which was reduced by the Supreme Court to 5.5 metres. In a modification issued to its 2018 regulation for highways in hilly areas, the ministry said the width of the road should be 7 metre carriage way. In 2018, the ministry had reduced the width of the main carriageway of roads on hilly terrains to maximum 5.5 metres to reduce the impact on the environment due to road development. In September 2020, the SC upheld the 2018 ministry regulation. “For roads in hilly and mountainous terrain, which act as feeder roads to the Indo-China border or are of strategic importance for national security, the carriageway width should be 7m with 1.5m paved shoulder on either side,” the highway ministry said in the new modification order issued on Tuesday. The new circular further mentions, “The standards prescribed therein have been further reviewed in the Ministry in light of the issues raised by the Ministry of Defence.”Speaking on the new circular issued by the ministry, VS Khaira, chief engineer, regional office of MoRTH Uttarakhand and project in-charge of Char Dham road project said, “We will now be following this new circular with a carriageway width of 7m. Following these new norms, the total road width would come up to be 10m. Before the Supreme Court’s order in September, the total road width of 10m was being followed.” He said that through the affidavit filed by the Defence ministry in the Supreme Court, the Centre was able to explain to the court the importance of the roads and “we hope that the court will allow us” to build a 10 metre wide road.On December 2, the SC was told by the defence ministry that the court order of 5.5 meters width posed serious repercussions to the country’s defence preparedness along the border points with China and Nepal. Both road transport and defence ministries were aggrieved by the SC’s September 8 order mandating the Char Dham road project to have a road width of 5.5 metre as recommended by five members of the 26-member high-powered committee (HPC).Committee chairman Ravi Chopra had written to the court on October 5 and November 2 about constant tree felling by the Uttarakhand government that was causing landslides along the Char Dham route. Also Read: After SC order on Char Dham road, alignment of key bypasses to be changedThe defence ministry in an affidavit to the Supreme Court on the Char Dham road project had said that national highways from Rishikesh to Mana, Rishikesh to Gangotri and Tanakpur-Pithoragarh are strategic and feeder roads for India-China border. These roads are also a part of the Char Dham road project. The court had asked HPC to examine the concerns of the two ministries and submit its report within two weeks. Next hearing on the matter is on January 18, 2021. When asked if the new road width would be followed for the whole project, Hemant Dhyani, a member of the minority group of the HPC said, “We have discussed about the new circular issued by the MoRTH in our recent meeting, but we cannot comment anything as the matter is subjudice. The HPC would be submitting a report to the Supreme Court within a week’s time.” Also Read: Govt’s own ministries divided on Char Dham road project, says SCThe environmentalists had challenged the project in the Supreme Court. They alleged that the project was broken into 100 parts to escape a mandatory comprehensive environment review by the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee. The government had, however, claimed that it followed all environmental norms. The project is being developed by the Uttarakhand government’s Public Works Department (PWD), Border Roads Organisation (BRO), and National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (NHIDCL). The road provides all-weather connectivity to four famous Hindu shrines of Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-modifies-hilly-road-width-citing-india-china-border-connectivity/story-EwLoDYrpOop84bmsxnymGK.html

She was distressed about the loss of her hair and I somehow wanted to help, but did not know how,” said Maiti.Maiti said she recently came to know about the hair loss of another cancer patient, who is the mother of a close friend of hers. “When I expressed my desire at home, no one made fun of me. But I don’t think anyone took me seriously either. I went to a ladies parlour where I shaved my hair carefully so that it can be cleaned and packed for use by some cancer patients. There are a few websites that collect hairs for such patients,” she added. Maiti said she was prepared to face the embarrassment of having a bald head so that some cancer patient can smile. “When a cancer patient loses hair due to chemotherapy, imagine how pathetic they feel. I can get my hair back in a few months, but a cancer patient may not regrow hair. It’s just a small help. Beauty comes and goes, but humanity is what counts,” said the girl, who has already pledged to donate her eyes and other organs in the event of her death.Also Read: Study: Target ‘zombie’ cells to improve Cervical cancerMaiti’s grandparents said they are proud of her decision. “We are proud to be her grandparents. In a world where kindness is a rare thing, Shruti has shown how big her heart is. She is also a regular blood donor. Doing something for the society without expecting anything is big,” said Shruti’s grandparents Nirmal Kanti Bose and Kuni Bose.Maiti said she got the idea of social service after joining the National Service Scheme in college. “In NSS I learnt that living for oneself isn’t life. I hope my hair donation gesture would motivate youths to come forward and help cancer patients,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-teenager-tonsures-head-to-help-cancer-patient-get-a-wig/story-OlXgEfHRwrWk11FtK3X00M.html

The Delhi assembly’s one-day session on Thursday witnessed stormy scenes as AAP leaders Somnath Bharti and Mahendra Goyal tore a copy of the farm laws. “I refuse to accept these black laws which are against farmers,” he said.The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also geared up to raise an alleged scam of Rs 2,500 crore in the BJP-ruled city municipal corporations during the sitting.The Aam Aadmi Party, staunchly protesting the laws, has voiced its concerns regarding the impact on the earnings of farmers. Dubbing the laws as “anti-farmer and anti-common man”, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that the new farm laws will lead to immense inflation and will only favour a few capitalists.Kejriwal, along with AAP leaders, ministers, MLAs and volunteers had observing a day-long fast in support of the protesting farmers earlier this week, stating that the new farm laws ‘gives license to inflate’.“These laws are anti-farmer and anti-aam aadmi and are aimed to benefit a few capitalists.

The MHA had earlier asked the West Bengal government to immediately release the three IPS officers for central deputation.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has reacted sharply to the fresh communication calling it “a colourable exercise of power and blatant misuse of emergency provision of IPS Cadre Rule 1954”.In a series of tweets, Mamata Banerjee said, “This act is nothing but a deliberate attempt to encroach upon the State’s jurisdiction & demoralize the serving officers in WB. This move, particularly before the election is against the basic tenets of the federal structure. It’s unconstitutional & completely unacceptable!” “We will not allow this brazen attempt by the Centre to control the State machinery by proxy! West Bengal is not going to cow-down in front of expansionist & undemocratic forces,” she wrote in another tweet.The ministry of home affairs has posted three West Bengal IPS officers - Bholanath Pandey, Rajeev Mishra and Praveen Tripathi - for central deputation for five years following the Bengal government and police’s failure to respond to MHA’s letter. The 3 IPS officers have already been given responsibilities -- Bholanath Pandey as BPRD SP, Praveen Tripathi as SSB DIG, Rajeev Mishra as ITBP IG, the ministry has indicated.The three IPS officers have been posted at the Centre with immediate effect. While Bholanath Pandey has posted as SP BPRD, Praveen Tripathi has been deployed as DIG - Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and Rajeev Mishra has been posted as IG ITBP. MHA officials said that the West Bengal government and DGP failed to cooperate with the Centre and their letter; dated December 11 (in which the three officers refused to appear before the Union ministry), was “unsatisfactory”. A senior officer said the three officers have to report at their respective postings immediately or they may face further action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goi-s-order-of-central-deputation-for-3-ips-officers-of-bengal-despite-state-s-objection-is-colourable-exercise-of-power-mamata/story-CJ8YKgwepauU2vXXaIclTI.html
17-12-2020||India||Can farm laws be put on hold for the time being, asks CJI Bobde | 10 points||A day after the Supreme Court rapped the Centre over the ongoing protests of farmers as the negotiations didn’t yield results, a bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde on Thursday asked the attorney general for India if the government can give a commitment that the far laws will not be implemented while the court if hearing the petitions.The Centre told the apex court that if the implementation of farm laws is put on hold, then farmers will not come forward for negotiations. When the bench told that this is to enable talks, the AG sought some time to get back on this issue.During the hearing, the Supreme Court bench made some significant observations regarding the ongoing protests, the plight of Indian farmers etc. The protesters, on the other hand, remained unfazed as the agitation against three farm laws remained unfazed.Here is how the hearing on Thursday proceeded:> Farmers have rights to protest, but the protest has to be non-violent, the bench observed.> The apex court wants to facilitate further talks between the farmers and the Centre, it said.> An impartial and independent panel is likely to be set up. Apart from farmers and government’s representations, experts like P Sainath are likely to find a place in the committee.> Meanwhile, the protest can go on, the bench said.> Attorney General KK Venugopal said the large gathering at various border points of Delhi increases the Covid-19 risks. “None of them (protesters) wears a face mask. They sit together in large numbers. Covid-19 is a concern. They will visit villages and spread it there. Farmers cannot violate the fundamental rights of others,” the AG said.> The Punjab government has no objection to the Supreme Court’s suggestion that a group of people will act as the facilitator between the Centre and the farmers, P Chidambaram, who represented the Punjab government, said. It is for farmers and the Centre to decide who will be the members of the committee, he said.> Sitting in protest won’t help, said CJI“Blocking Delhi may lead to people in the city going hungry. Your (farmers) purpose can be fulfilled by talking. Just sitting in protest won’t help,” the CJI said.> Sympathetic to farmers: CJI“We are also Indian, we are familiar with the plight of farmers and are sympathetic to their cause. You (farmers) have to only alter the way the protest is going. We will ensure you can plead your case and thus we are thinking of forming a committee,” the CJI said.> The CJI also asked the AG if the government can commit that the farm laws will not be implemented while the court is hearing the petitions and that no executive actions will be taken under the laws in order to facilitate the negotiations.> The AG said if the implementation is put on hold, then farmers will not agree to negotiation. The bench said that the suggestion is to facilitate negotiation and then the AG sought some time to get back on this point.Farmers are not a mob, the bench noted. “We are worried over plight of farmers and the way things are going,” the CJI said.

The remarks were made by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde while hearing a petition seeking to remove protesting farmers from Delhi border areas. The petitioner - a law student - has cited inconvenience at border areas of the national capital and threat of Covid-19 as grounds for seeking the removal of protesting farmers.“A protest is constitutional till it does not destroy property or endanger life. The Centre and farmers have to talk; we are thinking of an impartial and independent committee before whom both parties can give its side of story to resolve impasse on farm laws,” news agency ANI quoted the CJI as saying.“The independent committee can have P Sainath, Bhartiya Kisan Union and others as members. You (farmers) cannot instigate violence and cannot block a city like this,” CJI Bobde further said.He also said that the committee will give a finding which should be followed and the protest can go on in the meanwhile.Attorney General KK Venugopal said that the farmers are violating Covid-19 guidelines which could lead to spread of the infection in their villages. “None of them wears a face mask, they sit together in large numbers. Covid-19 is a concern, they will visit villages and spread it there. Farmers cannot violate the fundamental rights of others,” said Venugopal.The hearing is continuing in the case.On Wednesday, the top court had issued a notice to the Centre and others. The bench comprising CJI Bobde, justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian also indicated that the court may form a committee having representatives of the government and the farmer unions across the country to resolve the deadlock over the legislations.The Centre has told the Supreme Court that it will not do anything against the interest of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protest-a-constitutional-right-but-supreme-court-hears-plea-seeking-removal-of-protesting-farmers-from-delhi-borders/story-yDlS1y467nS8CWx9POMPRJ.html

It is not true that the winter session of the Parliament was cancelled due to the unprecedented Covid situation because Bihar elections were held under the same situation. Prime Minister Modi addressed rallies, with thousands of people attending. Seeing the work that BJP chief JP Nadda has started in West Bengal, it seems Covid has passed West Bengal,” the editorial said.

It cited British PM Boris Johnson’s acceptance of the invitation for being part of the Republic Day celebrations in India.“During Covid-19, the USA held presidential elections where Trump lost and Biden won. Covid did not halt the elections in a big democracy. But we do not let a four-day winter session take place. America held elections that led to change of power; this is a superpower’s democracy, [While] we have put a lock on the biggest temple of democracy,” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-rejects-logic-for-scrapping-parliament-s-winter-session-offers-own/story-8dRoCgqv3b26s9WyHl5hnJ.html
17-12-2020||India||India, Bangladesh sign seven agreements, revive railway link||India and Bangladesh signed seven agreements in areas ranging from hydrocarbons to agriculture and revived a cross-border railway line that was snapped 55 years ago at a virtual summit on Thursday, giving a boost to connectivity initiatives and energy cooperation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his opening remarks at the summit with his counterpart Sheikh Hasina, described Bangladesh as an important pillar of India’s “neighbourhood first” policy. Both countries, Hasina said, could move up global and regional value chains by further integrating their economies, and connectivity initiatives such as the revival of the Chilahati-Haldibari rail link will be catalysts for this process. Hasina used the summit to raise the sharing of Teesta waters and repatriation of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar – two issues on which Dhaka has repeatedly sought greater cooperation from New Delhi. She highlighted the need for early signing of an interim agreement for sharing Teesta waters finalised in 2011, and Modi reiterated “India’s sincere commitment and continued efforts” in this regard, according to a joint statement. The agreement on the Teesta, held up by opposition from West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, has become an irritant in bilateral ties. Pointing to India’s election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2021-22, Hasina “expressed Bangladesh’s expectation to see India assist in the repatriation of the forcibly displaced Rohingyas back to Myanmar”, the joint statement said. Modi appreciated Bangladesh’s generosity in sheltering 1.1 million forcibly displaced persons from Myanmar’s Rakhine state and both leaders reiterated the importance of their “safe, speedy and sustainable” return. The seven agreements signed on Thursday cover cooperation in the hydrocarbons sector, agriculture and textiles, high impact community development projects to be carried out by India, trans-border elephant conservation, supply of equipment for improving garbage disposal in Bangladesh’s Barishal city, and creation of a CEOs Forum. The agreement on hydrocarbons will help streamline investments, technology transfers and joint studies and promote hydrocarbon connectivity. The two countries agreed to strengthen sub-regional energy cooperation, especially with Nepal and Bhutan, and speed up work on the 130-km India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline. Both leaders directed officials to speedily conclude a joint study on a bilateral comprehensive economic partnership agreement. Modi began his remarks by greeting Hasina in Bengali on the occasion of Bijoy Dibosh or Victory Day, which marks the surrender of Pakistani forces in Dhaka on December 16, 1971. Hasina, who spoke in Bengali, responded by saying December 17 was a special day for her and her family as it was on that day in 1971 when Major Ashok Tara of the Indian Army freed herself, her mother, sister and brother from Pakistani forces. “Bangladesh was freed on December 16, but we were freed on December 17,” she said, paying tribute to three million Bangladeshi martyrs of the war of independence and Indian military personnel killed in action and their families. Tara, then aged 29, had won the Vir Chakra in the battle of Gangasagar when he was assigned the responsibility of freeing the wife and family of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh. Tara completed the task with only three more Indian soldiers despite having to take on a numerically superior Pakistani contingent. Modi said strengthening ties with Bangladesh has been of special importance to him since his first day in office, and expressed satisfaction at bilateral cooperation amid the Covid-19 pandemic, including the supply of medicines and equipment. Modi assured Hasina vaccines will be made available to Bangladesh as and when produced in India, and also offered a partnership in vaccine production. Hasina referred to several new initiatives, such as trade through rail routes and the first trial run of Indian cargo from Kolkata to northeast India by ship, and said, “We happily recognise the growing dependency of the economies of Bangladesh and India. “A good number of Indian nationals are employed in the manufacturing and service sectors of Bangladesh, and are remittance earners for India. On the other hand, India receives the highest number of tourists and medical patients from Bangladesh.” The two leaders virtually inaugurated the revived rail link, which was snapped during the 1965 war with Pakistan and will connect Assam to Bangladesh via West Bengal, launched a stamp on Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman, and inaugurated a digital exhibition of Rahman and Mahatma Gandhi focusing on their contributions to the independence movements of the two countries. The joint statement said the filming of a biopic on Rahman, being directed by Shyam Benegal, will begin in January. The two sides also discussed key issues such as terrorism and border management, including Bangladesh’s concerns about the death of its nationals in incidents along the frontier. “Recognising that terrorism remains a threat to global peace and security, both sides reiterated their strong commitment to eliminating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” the joint statement said. Modi and Hasina agreed to complete border fencing in all pending sectors of the border at the earliest, beginning from the Tripura sector. “Both leaders also agreed that loss of civilian lives at the border is a matter of concern and directed the border forces concerned to enhance coordinated measures to work towards bringing such border incidents to zero,” it added.The Bangladesh side sought the early implementation of India’s commitment to remove remaining restrictions on use of land ports by Bangladeshi travellers in a phased manner, beginning with checkpoints in Tripura and West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bangladesh-sign-seven-agreements-revive-railway-link/story-lvH3HEckn9dbBWnhb886BK.html

17-12-2020||India||Supreme Court dismisses UP govt appeal against Allahabad HC order on Kafeel Khan||The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed Uttar Pradesh government’s appeal against Allahabad high court’s decision to set aside detention of Dr Kafeel Khan under National Security Act (NSA).A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde, however, clarified that the observations made by the Allahabad high court in its September 1 decision will not impact the outcome of the criminal cases against Khan. These cases, the bench said, will be decided on own merits.Khan, a paediatrician whose brush with controversy began with the 2017 Gorakhpur hospital tragedy in which more than a hundred children died reportedly due to shortage of oxygen and he was suspended, was booked under the NSA last year over an allegedly inflammatory speech against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU).After severely indicting the state government for booking Khan under the NSA, the Allahabad high court had in September quashed the detention order and allowed the habeas corpus petition filed by his mother, Nuzhat Parween.Khan was released after spending seven months in jail.Challenging this order by the high court, the central government and the Uttar Pradesh government have jointly filed an appeal, maintaining that Khan flouted prohibitory orders and delivered a provocative speech to AMU students with an attempt to disturb law and order in Aligarh by inciting Muslim students against other communities.The petition added that Khan’s speech, on December 13, 2019, incited about 10,000 AMU students to march towards Aligarh city.The plea further stated that Khan has a history of committing various offences, which had led to disciplinary action, his suspension from service, registration of FIRs against him and the invocation of the NSA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-dismisses-up-govt-appeal-against-allahabad-hc-order-on-kafeel-khan/story-E6McOs9qKKly1xhqwqiaHP.html

Last month, the health committee had placed a report that focused on the functioning of the health ministry and related agencies to tackle the pandemic. The House panel is expected to take a wider view of the issue and look into the roles of the disaster management authority, lockdowns, problems of the migrant workers in the early days of the pandemic, the Centre and state cooperation and the efficacy of the guidelines the home secretary issued from time to time. The panel also wanted to hear the views of representatives of West Bengal government but it was postponed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-to-submit-report-on-govt-s-covid-management/story-XywX6QUebhLQ90NksGpcEL.html
17-12-2020||India||Will Kunal Kamra face contempt proceedings for his tweets? Supreme Court to decide tomorrow||The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its order on contempt petitions filed against comedian Kunal Kamra. The petitions against the stand-up comedian were filed by two law students Shrirang Katneshwarkar and Skand Bajpai and a lawyer Abhijudaya Mishra.A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah will pass the orders on Friday.Attorney General K K Venugopal had last month given his consent for initiating contempt proceedings against Kamra for his November 18 tweet, saying it was “grossly vulgar and obnoxious” and tended to lower the authority of the Supreme Court.The consent of either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General is necessary, under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, for initiating contempt proceedings against a person.Kamra had allegedly criticised the top court in his tweets which the Attorney General said were in “bad taste”. Venugopal had also said that it was time people understood that attacking it brazenly will attract punishment.The petitioners claimed that Kamra started publishing tweets on November 11 when the top court was hearing the appeal of journalist Arnab Goswami against the Bombay High Court’s order rejecting his plea seeking interim bail in the 2018 abetment to suicide case.Kamra had refused to retract his tweets and apologise.“The tweets I recently put out have been found in contempt of court. All that I tweeted was from my view of the Supreme Court of India giving a partial decision in favour of a Prime Time Loudspeaker,” he said in a statement addressed to Venugopal and the judges on his Twitter page. “My view hasn’t changed because the silence of the Supreme Court of India on matters of other’s personal liberty cannot go uncriticized.

17-12-2020||India||Non-invasive oxygen therapy, steroids prevent Covid deaths, agree experts||Non-invasive oxygen therapy, antiviral drug Remdesivir and convalescent plasma therapy in the early stage of the disease, and steroids in the later stages help patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19), said experts from the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) and the University College of London Hospital (UCLH) during the National Grand Round held on Wednesday to discuss the treatment protocols in both the countries. The national grand round is a virtual platform for doctors across the country to get information about the trends and latest treatment protocols for Covid-19 in the country. The doctors did not dismiss Remdesivir or plasma therapy completely, despite the World Health Organisation’s Solidarity trial showing no impact on mortality, duration of hospitalisation, or need for mechanical ventilation with the use of the former and Indian Council of Medical Research’s own PLACID trial showing no impact on mortality or severity of illness with the use of the latter. Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know today“Convalescent plasma, which was used in the previous pandemic of 1918, held a lot of promise. However, trials from the world over did not show the kind of benefits that were expected. It has been widely used in our country, but the effect has not materialised in the real life clinical practice. Most of the trials have an inherent problem – limited data from patients with mild disease, efficacy with early administration unknown, and no standardisation of antibody titres,” said Dr Neeraj Nishchal, assistant professor of medicine at AIIMS. “There is a need to conduct a trial where the patients are given the therapy in early stages of the disease, we may have a group of patients who may benefit from this therapy. Further studies are needed before ruling out plasma therapy as an option,” he said. As for Remdesivir, intensive care specialist Prof Mervyn Singer from University College of London said if he were a patient, he would want the drug. “I think it’s important to look at the evidence. Personally, I have a challenge with the platform trials as they are very vague about the randomisation of patients and the matching. For e.g; for Remdesivir, the randomised control trials with a placebo arm have shown a benefit in terms of time in hospital. The platform Solidarity did not show it,” he said. A platform trial assigns patients to multiple groups that are administered different therapies for a disease, whereas, a randomised control trial assigns patients to two groups: One that receives the therapy and other that doesn’t (or gets a placebo) to test the efficacy of the therapy. He went on to explain, “The opposite is true for steroids. The recovery trial showed this huge effect and none of the other randomised control trial showed anywhere near as big an effect.” The doctors said that steroids – the only medicine to have shown mortality benefit in Covid-19 – were not used early on in the pandemic as Covid-19 was thought to be mainly a respiratory infection. “When the pandemic started, the WHO guidelines did not recommend giving corticosteroids in patients based on experiences with previous viral pneumonias like H1N1, SARS, and MERS. However, as we started seeing cytokine storm (an excessive immune response) in patients, we thought steroids might help. It was later included in the national guidelines in May,” said Dr Nishchal. Initially, in the UK, doctors were also advised to intubate the patients early on to help them breathe. Dr David Brealey, consulting intensivist at UCLH discussed the case of a 41-year-old bar owner who had Covid-19 and was kept on CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) for an extended period rather than being put on the ventilator. The doctors started realising that the patients were better off with non-invasive ventilation and it did not lead to higher rates of infection among healthcare workers if proper precautions were taken. With the realisation that they only had 12 of these life-saving CPAP machines, the doctors from the hospital also went on to design a non-electrical CPAP machine that was manufactured quickly by a Mercedes factory meant to produce engines for Formula 1 racing cars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/non-invasive-oxygen-therapy-steroids-prevent-covid-deaths-agree-experts/story-PmgvtwXuTFprQnKeINbYpL.html

The suspects were warned, but they didn’t pay heed, prompting the troops to open fire,” said a senior BSF official.He said when the area was searched, two bodies were found on the ground. One of the suspects was carrying an AK-56 rifle. A preliminary investigation suggested that the suspects were trying to smuggle some drugs and weapons into the Indian territory. He said the two men who were gunned down were trying to set up PVC pipes to pierce the barbed wire for smuggling. They had more accomplices with them who managed to flee, taking advantage of the dense fog, he said. The process to identify the deceased men was on, he said.In an another incident, which occurred around a kilometre further ahead,the same battalion recovered three packets of heroin (weighing a kg each). BSF officials said this incident took place at around 2.10am. This is the second such incident in the past four months at the Punjab border. In August, the BSF had shot dead five Pakistani intruders in self defence after the infiltrators opened fire on the Indian troops along the India-Pakistan International Border in Punjab’s Tarn Taran district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-pakistani-intruders-shot-dead-at-international-border-near-amritsar/story-tbTlgQcGe3ueVq8QRlGHsL.html

The subsonic missile with a range in excess of 300 kilometres and a 450-kilogramme warhead is part of the weapon suite on Rafale Omni-role fighter of the IAF.In simple terms, it means that the IAF’s Rafale can demolish targets located in mountains and high plateaus at 4,000 metres instead of the previous calibration of 2,000 metres. The tweaking of the software has been done by the missile manufacturer MBDA in consultation with the top brass of IAF.ALSO WATCH | 2nd batch of 3 IAF Rafale aircrafts arrive in India from France While the next batch of three Rafale fighters are expected to arrive after 2021 Republic Day, there are plans that the aircraft will be refuelled mid-air by India’s close ally UAE air force using Airbus 330 multi-role transport tankers as they fly towards Ambala air base. As of now, seven Rafales are being used for training IAF pilots in France. The complete fleet of 36 aircraft is scheduled to reach India by the end of 2021. One squadron of this potent fighter will be based at Ambala, the other at Hasimara airbase, which is perched on the Siliguri corridor.Rafale carries a beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile Meteor with a range of more than 100 kilometres, the potent SCALP or storm shadow cruise missile and the Hammer precision-guided ammunition. The SCALP missile is used to target command, control, communications, air bases, ports, power stations, ammunition storage depots, surface ships, submarines and other strategic high-value targets.Also Read: Indian Rafale fighter jet adds Hammer stand-off weapon to its lethal arsenalAlthough both China and Pakistan have developed air-launched cruise missiles, the SCALP is a unique weapon that has a fire-and-forget mechanism. Once launched from the fighter, the cruise missile drops to a terrain-hugging role between 100 to 130 feet from the ground to avoid detection by the enemy radars and jamming systems. Before approaching the target, the missile again goes up to a maximum height of 6,000 metres and then drops perpendicularly on the high-value target. The primary charge first penetrates the target, the secondary charge then blows it to smithereens.With IAF having to defend on both the fronts and mountainous terrain on either side, airpower will have a very significant role to play in the worst-case scenario. The infantry, apart from the airborne special forces, will be used to defend both the Line of Control (LoC) and the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The SCALP’s range will be crucial to degrade enemy’s fight power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-east-ladakh-iaf-tweaks-rafale-s-terrain-hugging-deep-strike-missile/story-0Iz4losbaZDVNVG5PQBKhK.html

17-12-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling case: CM’s secretary appears before ED||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s additional private secretary CM Raveendran on Thursday appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for questioning in connection with the gold smuggling case. Raveendran has already been summoned four times by the Central agency. He was first summoned last month, but he could not appear as he had tested positive for Covid-19. Later, he stayed away citing post-covid complications. He was issued fresh summons after he was discharged from Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital last week. Raveendran has also moved the high court, seeking anticipatory bail but the ED has opposed it, saying he was not made an accused in any case. The court is expected to hear his plea later in the day. CM’s other secretary, senior Indian Administrative Service officer, M Sivasankar, is already in judicial custody in connection with the case. Raveendran was summoned on the basis of Sivasankar’s statement, said a senior official of the multi-agency probe team, requesting anonymity. Also read | Main accused in Kerala gold smuggling case says her life under threatLast week, the CM had defended him saying he was keeping away from questioning due to ill-health. He said the Central agencies can’t do anything against him as “he holds a good track record”.

The gold smuggling racket was uncovered on July 5 after the seizure of 30 kgs of the metal from a consignment addressed to the United Arab Emirates consulate in the state Capital. A multi-agency team headed by the National Investigation Agency is probing the case and 34 people have been arrested so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-cm-s-secretary-appears-before-ed/story-7i1uCbvHgKbpXcNCjjLhRL.html
17-12-2020||India||Gehlot govt finishes 2 crisis ridden years with few hits and misses||The last two years for the ruling Congress government in Rajasthan have been challenging. If in the first year the party witnessed a debacle in the Lok Sabha elections by losing all 25 seats within four months of coming to power; the second year of the government wasn’t a cake walk either because of the coronavirus outbreak and the revolt by the deputy CM, Sachin Pilot, against the leadership of chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Amid the Corona pandemic outbreak, the drift between Gehlot and Pilot came out in the open following allegations by the CM that efforts were being made to topple his government by the BJP, as was done in Madhya Pradesh. The crisis which continued for over a month, ended on a happy note with a floor test with Pilot and his followers casting their votes in support of Gehlot government but the time in between was full of uncertainties and political machinations involving action by central agencies such as Income Tax and Enforcement Directorate. As differences within the Congress grew sharper over the handling of Pilot’s rebellion, he was removed from deputy CM’s post and that of the state party chief. His two loyalists, Vishvendra Singh and Ramesh Meena, too, lost their cabinet berths. During the political crisis, the Pilot camp MLAs, around 18, camped outside the state, while the Congress MLAs moved to hotels for a month in Jaipur and Jaisalmer. The fight between the two groups reached the Assembly Speaker, governor and the Rajasthan high court. The crisis ended with the Congress central leadership intervening and the government passing the floor test in the state Assembly. However, on December 5, Gehlot again blamed the BJP of trying to topple the state government. The year had begun on a challenging note for the Gehlot-government with an Italian tourist testing positive for covid-19 in March. Rajasthan was the first state in the country to impose a lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. With its ‘Bhilwara model’, the state government was appreciated nationally for containment of disease during the initial days. While Bhilwara district administration managed to break the chain of the virus, cases in other areas kept on increasing and the high number of Covid cases in Ramganj area of the state capital caused grave concern. The crisis made CM Gehlot lead the corona management efforts in the state himself including enlisting opposition’s support for the anti-virus campaign and enhancing the state’s medical infrastructure. The state politics witnessed many twists and turns, especially the panchayat, zila pramukh and local body elections held a few days ago. The results of these elections surprised many with the Congress losing ground in rural areas, and gaining support in urban areas. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP), which had extended its support to the ruling government during the political crisis and Rajya Sabha elections, is now considering breaking ties since party leaders allege that the Congress supported BJP in the Zila Pramukh elections to keep their local ally out of power in some key regions. The state is also facing farmers’ unrest because of the three farm laws passed by the Union government. The state government in November, to counter the new farms laws, had passed three Bills in state assembly following in the footsteps of the Congress-ruled Punjab and Chhattisgarh. The Bills are waiting for the governor’s nod. Meanwhile, working on the promises made in the manifesto, the state government has waived Rs 7,692 crore short-term crop loan, benefitting 20.50 lakh farmers; and Rs 290.14 crore of mid and long-term loan. The state is also providing old age pension to farmers, which has benefitted 2.79 lakh farmers with the total disbursement under this scheme reaching Rs 317 crore so far. Also Read: Post-Covid centre to be opened at Ayurveda District Hospitals in RajasthanHowever, some of the manifesto promises such as farm loan waiver of commercial banks; regularization of contractual employees; education policy, and right to health are still pending. Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas claims that Rajasthan government’s management of the pandemic is unmatchable. “We are the first in the country to ensure that no one sleeps hungry. The test and treatment of Covid-19 was made free of cost, the state government distributed 2 crore masks and provided ration to 6 crore people,” he said. He also claimed that though the results were not as expected in the panchayati raj institution (PRI) polls but the Congress had increased its vote base besides taking a slice of BJP’s vote bank in local body polls. He added that at the time of inflation, unemployment and high gas prices, the state government was providing unemployment allowance to the youth.Political analyst Rajan Mahan said the performance of the government could have been more impressive but for the major challenges like the loss of all 25 Lok Sabha seats, the pandemic and the internal political crisis. “Though the government did come up with good initiatives such as loan waiver and the unemployment allowance for the youth, the buzz, however, was not about the achievements but the friction inside the party between Gehlot and Pilot,” he said. Mahan added that sooner they resolve the differences, the better it is for the Congress. Also Read: IITs, IIMs, ISRO result of Nehru’s vision: Rajasthan CMBJP leader and former chief minister Vasundhara Raje said that this is the first time in seven decades when the government is “invisible” in the state, alleging it was neither visible to the public nor to the Congress workers.In the name of development, this government could not run even two steps in two years, she alleged further. “This government is deceiving the public from day one-- the first announcement to waive the entire loan of farmers in the next 10 days has not been fulfilled in 2 years. The government has failed in every exam,” said Raje. BJP state president Satish Poonia claimed that the Gehlot government had failed on all fronts. “The CM is insecure and this government is of jugaad. Congress government didn’t come with a clear mandate and is running with support of six MLAs from BSP, who are still under question and the independents,” he said. Poonia claimed that the political crisis inside the Congress continues, evidenced in the ‘dismissal’ of the state chief. “It’s the people who are suffering because of their infighting. A weak government does not have a long life,” he said. The Congress promise of loan waiver in 10 days has left 59 lakh farmers of the state waiting. The 27 lakh registered unemployed persons are waiting for unemployment allowance. The 2.5 lakh persons on contract are waiting to be regularised. The promise of addressing complaints in a time bound manner is yet to be fulfilled. Law and order is deteriorating, as per NCRB data, there has been an increase of 4.7 lakh cases in the last two years, Poonia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-govt-finishes-2-crisis-ridden-years-with-few-hits-and-misses/story-Gj4MEGMp2muPLRHVA6z9ZJ.html
17-12-2020||India||Contempt notice to Konkan collectors for failure to transfer mangrove land to Maharashtra forest department||An environment group has issued contempt notices to all Konkan district collectors, the Konkan divisional commissioner, and state agency Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) for failing to hand over mangrove land under their jurisdiction to the Maharashtra forest department.The direction to hand over mangrove areas to the forest department was first issued by the Bombay high court (HC) on October 6, 2005, that mangroves on government owned lands (including those belonging to state agencies) be handed over to the forest department within a period of 12 weeks from their declaration as protected forests. The HC reiterated its order on September 18, 2018. However, while district bodies are yet to hand over 1,592.8 hectare area (ha), state agencies such as JNPT have failed to transfer approximately 1,147 ha to the forest department falling under their jurisdiction.Also read | Activist withdraws plea against diversion of forests land, work at Bandra-Versova Sea Link may resumePetitioner before the Bombay high court (HC) in various matters pertaining to mangrove and wetland conservation, environment group Vanashakti, issued the contempt notice through its counsel between last Friday and Tuesday. A period of seven days has been given to complete the transfer process or a contempt petition will be filed before the HC, the group said. “Not transferring mangrove lands to the forest department for almost 15 years shows that there is no sense of rule of law and no fear of the law. This is a fit case to get an order of civil imprisonment of responsible officers or head of respective departments,” said Vanashakti counsel Zaman Ali.A similar contempt notice had been issued to planning agency City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. (Cidco) in October. However, the agency did not respond. “We are now forced to approach the HC for implementation of its orders and for mangrove conservation,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.Of the 30,200 ha mangrove forests across Maharashtra as per the Forest Survey of India, the state government has notified 15,312 ha as reserved forest under section 4 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 (the remaining area falls on private land). According to the state mangrove cell, 1,592.8 ha is yet to be handed over to them. Maximum area is under the Raigad collector’s jurisdiction (1,195.5 ha) followed by Mumbai suburban (242 ha), Sindhudurg (115.3 ha), Palghar (34.1 ha), and Thane (5.6 ha).HT had reported on December 4 that state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray had decided to expedite and ease the transfer process of mangrove areas under the control of state agencies from January onwards after rectifying data gaps between the forest and revenue department. “The process is underway and results are expected soon. The enquiry into most areas under revenue department will be completed by January 15,” said a senior official from the environment department.Stalin countered that if the process was not completed over 15 years, it was difficult to expect any improvement within a month. “The main beneficiaries of this contemptuous act are the real estate sharks. We have reminded all departments time and again to abide by court orders but the connivance at the level of higher officials is mind-boggling,” he alleged.Konkan divisional commissioner Annasaheb Misal said the matter was being monitored by the state. District bodies said they had not received the notice and would respond accordingly. A senior official from JNPT said they needed to check their records before they could comment on the matter.What does the law say?Destruction of mangrove forests across Maharashtra and construction within 50m of mangrove areas was banned by the Bombay high court (HC) first in 2005 after a petition by the Bombay Environment Action Group. In September 2018, the HC bench of justice Abhay Oka and justice Riyaz Chagla passed its final order, which read: “Destruction of mangroves offended the fundamental rights of the citizens and hence it was a mandatory duty of the state and its agencies to protect and preserve the mangroves. All mangroves in the state are to be declared as protected or reserved forests, including land belonging to government agencies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contempt-notice-to-konkan-collectors-for-failure-to-transfer-mangrove-land-to-maharashtra-forest-department/story-mIEooGLybzcbcs8Qtx4pJJ.html
17-12-2020||India||EC team in West Bengal to oversee poll preparedness||The Election Commission of India (EC) has started taking stock of the poll preparedness in West Bengal for the crucial 2021 state assembly elections. A team of the poll panel led by deputy election commissioner Sudeep Jain arrived in Kolkata on Wednesday and is likely to meet some of senior IAS and IPS officers including the district magistrates, superintendents of police and police commissioners in various districts of south and north Bengal over the next two days. As polls are expected to be held during pandemic, the state’s health secretary and home secretary are also likely to brief the team about the preparedness. “An EC team has come from Delhi. The team would be taking stock of the poll preparedness and holding meetings with bureaucrats and police officials. They are also likely to meet representatives of political parties in the state,” said a senior officer of the poll panel. Meanwhile, the poll panel has also started the process of checking all 78,000-odd polling booths across the state to provide assured minimum facilities, such as toilets, drinking water and ramps, on the polling day. Earlier this week, a delegation of the Bharatiya Janata Party from West Bengal met the chief election commissioner Sunil Arora, requesting early deployment of Central police forces and enforcement of the Model Code of Conduct to avoid widespread political violence during the campaign period. The state’s ruling Trinamool Congress, however, has rubbished the fears. “It is only after this team goes back and submits a report that we are expecting the EC’s full panel to come to the state,” said a senior officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-team-in-west-bengal-to-oversee-poll-preparedness/story-pHIKZhbAmA2ZRohG16IfHI.html

Ghanashyam Das, who won from the Dihira seat, was sworn in on Tuesday as an executive member of the council, which administers four districts, in presence of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal at Kokrajhar--the BTC headquarters. In April last year, police in Guwahati had arrested Das, who was a member of BTC at that time as well, on charges of raping a 15-year-girl, employed as a domestic help with a family in the city’s Patharquari area. “The matter came to light after the girl delivered a child at a private hospital and the child welfare department was informed by authorities. Questioning of the girl revealed she was allegedly raped by Das,” said Miguel Das Queah, a Guwahati-based child rights activist. Das had allegedly raped the girl on the pretext of warding off some evil influence on her employer’s family. Based on the girl’s testimony, Queah had filed an FIR against Das and the BTC-member-cum-tantrik was arrested by the police on various charges including provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He was released on bail a few months later.

Significantly, the victim and her child, who were kept at a home for girls in Guwahati, have been missing for the past few months. “We are planning to file a missing person report this week seeking the whereabouts of the victim and her child. We will also ensure that Das is not able to influence the victim,” said Queah. HT was not able to reach out to Das, who along with other members of the ruling coalition in BTC, is holed up in a Guwahati hotel. President of GSP, Nava Sarania, who is the Lok Sabha MP from Kokrajhar, didn’t respond to calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-gsp-member-elected-to-btc-is-an-accused-in-minor-s-rape-case/story-CrjpjfIiuvgUAD8KRIOpVP.html

A senior forest official said the animal strayed out of the Gangarampur tea garden and reached a wooded area in the backyards of Rangapani cancer hospital. It mauled a man around 6.30pm. The forest department then deployed three teams to capture the animal. But the big cat managed to injure range officer Sanjay Dutta and two others when the teams were trying to tranquillise it. “The forest staff killed the leopard in self-defence,” said VK Yadav, chief wildlife warden of the state. All four injured persons were shifted to hospitals. The leopard’s carcass was taken to the forest range office for a post mortem. Man-animal conflict is common in and around the tea estates and forest of north Bengal where people are often attacked by leopards and other wild animals, including gaur and elephants. Several elephants have also died due to electrocution and train accidents in recent times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leopard-shot-dead-in-west-bengal-after-it-injures-four/story-IYqynjazRAbXTwLcWedPzO.html

Chodankar, 53, was appointed the Goa Congress chief in April 2018, replacing veteran leader Shantaram Naik. In the just concluded zila parishad elections, the Congress faced a near-rout, winning just four of the 37 seats it contested. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept the polls, winning 33 out of 49 seats. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also opened its score, winning one seat. The Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) won three seats, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) one and independents seven. Since the results were declared, Chodankar had come under fire from his Congress colleagues for the poor show in the polls that were billed as semi-final before the assembly elections in 2022. Congress party’s Lok Sabha member from South Goa, Francisco Sardinha, claimed that no senior leader was consulted regarding the selection of candidates. Former Goa Congress president Ravi Naik also blamed Chodankar for the debacle and demanded his resignation from the post. Chodankar had earlier offered his resignation soon after the party’s debacle in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to share accountability with Rahul Gandhi who had stepped down as the Congress president. Meanwhile, the name of Congress legislature party (CLP) leader and former chief minister Digambar Kamat as the new state unit president is doing the rounds. A Congress functionary said if Kamat is appointed as the state unit chief, Curtorim legislator Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco could replace him as the CLP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-congress-chief-resigns-after-party-s-rout-in-zila-parishad-polls/story-uIsXxEza02SuCJiwtC8TsO.html
17-12-2020||India||Kerala election result: Which party stands where and other key takeaways||The ruling CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala appeared set for a sweep in the local body polls in the state on Wednesday, often considered a semi-final before the assembly elections due in April-May next year.The United Democratic Front (UDF) was in the second spot, leading in over 400 local bodies, as the votes polled in the three-phase elections that concluded on December 14 were taken up for counting on Wednesday.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remained a distant third, though it seemed to have made some gains, leading in Pandalam, the centre of protests against women’s entry into Sabarimala, among others.Here are the key details and significance of Kerala local body polls for different parties/fronts:LDF: The Left Democratic Front is leading in 514 of the 941 grama panchayats, five of the six city corporations and 11 of the 14 district panchayats, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said, describing the strong performance as people’s victory. The Left front was also ahead in 108 block panchayats, Vijayan told reporters.ALSO WATCH | Kerala local body polls: Covid-19 patients cast votes donning PPE kits The remarkable surge of LDF comes at a time when the front and its government were passing through one of the toughest periods since coming to power in 2016 as it had to face a barrage of allegations, including over the gold smuggling case, levelled by the opposition.The chief minister’s former principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, had been arrested in the gold smuggling case being probed by various central agencies.A close look at the poll outcome shows political realignment in the LDF (Kerala Congress Mani and Loktantric Janata Dal joined the ruling coalition), the government’s effective Covid-19 control measures and its welfare programmes including free ration paid it rich dividends. Its high-pitch campaign that central agencies are targeting its leaders and trying to sabotage welfare programmes also helped it to attract sympathy votes, said political observers. A minority consolidation against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also helped it in a big way, they added.UDF: The Congress-led United Democratic Front was eying a repeat of Lok Sabha outcome - it had won 19 out of 20 seats last year. But out of the six corporations, it emerged victorious only in Kannur (north Kerala) and Kochi. The UDF, leading in 375 grama panchayats, 44 block panchayats, 45 municipalities and three district panchayats, however, asserted it has not lost ground in any of its traditional bastions and claims of a rout were ‘baseless’.Congress leaders said they will examine reasons for debacle and will do enough introspection. “Political climate was conducive for the party. We will examine reasons and take corrective measures,” said party leader T N Prathapan, who is a member of Parliament from Thrissur.BJP: The state president of the party, K Surendran, alleged that the UDF and LDF worked together to contain the BJP’s surge. “Last week, LDF convenor A Vijayaraghavan said the CPI(M) had taken enough measures to stop BJP on its tracks. In many wards, Congress workers gave their vote en bloc to the CPI(M) to sabotage BJP’s chances in Thiruvananthapuram,” he said, adding that the ruling dispensation also distributed secret leaflets in many places for minority consolidation against the BJP.One of the reasons cited by political experts in Kerala for the BJP’s lacklustre performance is growing infighting. Many senior leaders like Shobha Surendran, P M Velayudhan and K P Sreesan kept away from the campaigning this time. There are two groups in the party - one led by minister of state for external Affairs V Muraleedharan and other by senior leader P K Krishnasdas. After the elevation of Surendran as the state president many leaders are keeping away from party activities protesting his style of functioning. His opponents in the party said they will approach the party central leadership for change of office-bearers.Though the BJP could not put up a spectacular show, it still seemed to be on course to better its 2015 record, when it won 14 grama panchayats and Palakkad the municipality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-election-result-which-party-stands-where-and-other-key-takeaways/story-e9FreWf9LaZODVRUzr9q7J.html
17-12-2020||India||Odisha minor was sexually assaulted, SIT tells HC; BJP to walk for justice||The day Odisha unit of BJP announced a padyatra in all the 147 assembly constituencies of the state to demand justice for the family of the 5-year-old girl who was brutally murdered in July this year, a special investigation team (SIT) investigating into the incident told the Orissa high court that the minor could have been sexually assaulted before being murdered.The SIT headed by IG-ranked cop Arun Bothra which submitted its first report in a sealed envelope before the Orissa HC found that the five-year-old girl was sexually assaulted before being murdered.“The investigation revealed that the minor was stripped before she was murdered. That she has been raped before being killed was confirmed from the samples collected from her clothes,” the SIT report said.The minor girl’s decomposed skeletal remains were found from the backyard of her house on July 23, nine days after she had gone missing. SIT officials said the frock of the minor victim bore semen stain and the undergarment was missing. The SIT during its probe recorded statements of many witnesses and collected blood samples of at least 34 villagers.The samples of the semen have been sent for DNA testing. The identity of the accused is yet to be ascertained, but official sources said the person could be a person from the girl’s village.Initially, the local police were investigating the case which was later taken by the crime branch and later by the SIT on November 29.The incident triggered a political storm in the state after the girl’s parents attempted immolation in front of the state Assembly last month blaming higher education minister Arun Sahoo of shielding the prime suspect in the case. While alleging that their daughter may have been a victim of an organ donation racket, the parents also blamed the police for harassing them instead of going after the culprits.Since then, opposition BJP has made it a political issue with the party now planning to take out a padayatra from Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar to the minor victim’s village in Nayagarh district, demanding justice for the girl.Last week, the state government had suspended the woman inspector of the local police station for her unprofessional approach in investigation of the case and transferred her supervisory officer over similar charges. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) too had found irregularities in the probe carried out by the local police.State BJP unit president Samir Mohanty said padayatras would be held across 147 assembly constituencies in the state demanding justice for the girl’s family. “The National Crime Records Bureau data suggests that the recovery rate of missing children in Odisha was 27.1% in 2019, the lowest in the country. The NCRB data in the last two years (2017-19) mentioned 5,503 children were missing. So many children vanishing from their homes have disturbed every common citizen of the state. BJP will fight to provide justice to all these families,” Mohanty said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-minor-was-sexually-assaulted-sit-tells-hc-bjp-to-walk-for-justice/story-OfS3kp9HRDzZgYNHSPr40O.html

On Wednesday, day 21 of the protests, the Supreme Court took up petitions seeking directions to authorities to remove the protesters from the national capital’s borders. A 3-judge bench of the top court, headed by chief justice SA Bobde, issued notice to the Centre in this regard and will resume the hearing on Thursday.Here are developments from day 21 of the anti-farm law protests:1. In its observations, the CJI-headed bench noted that if urgent measures are not taken, the protests may “soon become a national issue.” The apex court suggested formation of a committee comprising government representatives, farm union members and members of farm unions from the rest of India.Also Read | Supreme Court steps in to resolve deadlock over farm laws: ‘Talks set to fail’2. The bench also observed that the Centre’s negotiations have not worked properly and are “bound to fail again.” On comparison with the Shaheen Bangh protests, it said, there can’t be a precedent in a law and order situation.ALSO WATCH | ‘BKU leaders from UP support the farm laws’: Union Agriculture Minister 3.

Meanwhile, reacting to the developments in the apex court, the All India Kisan Coordination Committee (AIKCC), a large platform of farm unions which is spearheading the agitation, called it a big “moral victory for the farmers” but also stressed that the movement will continue till the three laws are repealed.5. In a tragic development on Wednesday, a Sikh cleric died by suicide at the Delhi-Haryana Singhu border, the epicentre of these protests. In a suicide note, Sant Baba Ram Singh of Karnal wrote that he was “hurt to see the farmers’ plight” and the “government’s oppression.”6. The Opposition lashed out at the Centre after death by suicide of the Sikh priest. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, in a tweet, remarked that the Modi government’s “brutality has crossed all limits.” He too demanded withdrawal of the anti-farmer laws.7. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), meanwhile, continued its outreach to clear what it alleges is “misinformation” being spread by the Opposition on the farm laws. In Gwalior, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, once again stressed that the laws will benefit farmers from across the country.Also Read | ‘Does he know anything about farming?’: MP CM slams Rahul Gandhi amid stir8. Farmers, majority of whom are from Punjab, have been protesting against these laws since September, when these were passed by the Centre. Initially, they blocked rail tracks in Punjab. Then, in last week of November, they arrived in Delhi to put pressure on the government to repeal the laws.9. The protesting farmers have blocked various highways leading to the capital city and say that they have enough ration and other essential items with them to last for months. They have warned that they will block Delhi’s borders till their demands are met.10. In recent days, they have also been joined by small groups of farmers from other states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan. A group of farmers from Rajasthan has been sitting on the Delhi-Jaipur highway since Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-law-protests-enter-day-22-supreme-court-to-resume-hearing-on-blockade-of-delhi-s-borders-10-points/story-RRr8Geh28EN905BPsCkLtO.html

17-12-2020||India||Sikh religious leader dies by suicide at Singhu border||Baba Ram Singh, the priest of a gurdwara in Haryana, died after shooting himself on Wednesday afternoon at the Delhi-Haryana border in Singhu, where he reached last evening and joined farmers from Punjab and Haryana protesting against three farm laws passed in the Monsoon Session of Parliament. He was 65.In a suicide note, Singh, a resident of Singhra village in Haryana’s Karnal district,said he wanted to expose the “cruelty of the government”.In a handwritten note in Punjabi, he said: “Farmers are in pain, they are protesting on the roads for their rights. The government is not giving them justice, which is cruel. It is a sin to endure persecution and also a sin to oppress. Some have stood for the farmer rights and against the cruelty. People have returned their awards to show protest. I am sacrificing myself.” HT has seen a copy of the note.Sonepat’s superintendent of police Jashandeep Randhawa confirmed that the police had received information that a man shot himself dead at Kundli-Singhu, where the farmers are protesting. Ravi Kumar, station house officer of the Kundli police station, said the suicide note had been recovered and that its authenticity was being ascertained.“The Kundli police is investigating the case. A thorough probe will be done,” the SP added.Tens of thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have gathered on Delhi’s borders, demanding the repeal of three farm laws that allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, and lay down new rules for contract farming.Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal expressed his anguish on the priest’s death. “Anguished to hear that Sant Baba Ram Singh ji Nanaksar Singhra wale shot himself at Singhu border in Kisan Dharna, looking at farmers’ suffering. Sant ji’s sacrifice won’t be allowed to go in vain. I urge GOI not to let situation deteriorate any further & repeal the 3 agri laws,” he tweetedCongress leader Rahul Gandhi expressed his grief over his death and said many farmers have given their lives for the agitation. “The cruelty of Modi government has crossed all limits. Leave stubbornness and repeal the three farm laws,” he tweeted.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, “The news of Sant Baba Ram Singh Ji’s suicide is very painful. Condolences to his family in this hour of grief. Our farmers are asking for their rights, the government should listen to the voice of the farmers and all three black laws should be withdrawn.”Amarjeet Singh, a close associate of Singh, said he shot himself in his own vehicle. “From the dharna site, he was rushed to a private hospital in Panipat where he died during treatment,” he said.Gloom descended on Singhra village after the news of his death spread.Residents of the village as well as the priest’s followers from Karnal as well as from nearby districts gathered at the Gurudwara and accused the Central government of not solving the farmers’ issue and forcing Singh to take his life.“He had dedicated his life to Sikh Sanghat and his supreme sacrifice will not go waste as it will unite all farmers,” said Angrej Singh Pannu, another of his associates.Singh, who moved to Karnal in 1983 from Ludhiana in Punjab, was popular in the community and had thousands of followers in Karnal and nearby districts.He used to organise weeklong satsangs (prayer meetings) and langars (community kitchens) for thousands of people , village residents said.His body has been kept at the Singhra village Gurudwara and will be cremated on Thursday.Additional police forces have been deployed in and around the village in a preventive measure, the local police said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sikh-religious-leader-kills-himself-at-singhu-border/story-eH8CZacuGKy6KwiFR7bcFJ.html
17-12-2020||India||Panel grills Facebook head for inaction on Bajrang Dal||The parliamentary panel on information technology on Wednesday reproached Facebook India head Ajit Mohan over the social media company’s reluctance to ban the Bajrang Dal although an internal report, according to the Wall Street Journal, termed the Hindu nationalistic group a “dangerous” organisation. It is the second time in five months that the panel has found reason to rebuke the company for not heeding its own internal assessments.The question was raised by Congress party MPs and members of the panel, Shashi Tharoor, Karti Chidambaram and Nasir Hussain, people familiar with the matter said. Tharoor heads the panel, which met representatives of Facebook to question them on its efforts to safeguard citizens’ rights, prevent misuse of online news platforms and ensure women’s security in the digital space.“The MPs wanted to know why Facebook hadn’t acted on the internal report that had called the organisation dangerous,” said a person aware of the proceedings of the meeting, requesting anonymity.Wall Street Journal reported that an internal assessment by Facebook had described the Bajrang Dal as dangerous, but the company did not act on the report because of financial and safety concerns. WSJ on December 14 reported that Facebook “balked at removing the group” because its security team warned that action against Bajrang Dal “might endanger both the company’s business prospects and its staff in India”.Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone had denied the allegations stating that the company has a “careful, rigorous and multidisciplinary” approach when it comes to enforcing a ban on individuals or organisations on the social media company.“We enforce our Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy globally without regard to political position or party affiliation,” Stone said, according to the report.People familiar with the matter said Mohan dismissed the WSJ report as “fake news”.“Some MPs also wanted to know why Facebook hadn’t flagged it as fake if the article wasn’t true,” said the first person cited above.A second person aware of Wednesday’s proceedings said the social media company contended that Bajrang Dal may remain on Facebook, but any hate posts on its page would be taken down.“The MPs also wanted to know why Facebook can’t take down a post suo moto {on its own} if its violates its hate policy,” the second person said. They pointed out that by the time someone complains about a post, it may have “already served its purpose.”Facebook told HT that the social media platform was transparent and allowed people to express themselves freely.“We thank the Honorable Parliamentary Committee for their time. We remain committed to be an open and transparent platform, and to giving people a voice and allowing them to express themselves freely,” a Facebook spokesperson said.Among other issues discussed were Facebook’s grievance redressal system, which the panel said should be based in India and not in the United States.The panel also quizzed Facebook on its fact-checking mechanism and revenue model. “It also has to be ascertained whether Facebook is a publisher or an intermediary, there has to be accountability,” said the second person. “Facebook’s ability to manipulate the reach of a post was also brought up at the meeting. Why is it that anti-government posts don’t get same traction as pro-government ones.”The panel also sought background information on all 268 Facebook India employees.Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra :also asked Facebook “whether or not it monetizes data,” said the first person mentioned above.The person added: “Facebook was evasive on the issue. It shows they may not be selling the data but they have a system that allows them to monetize it.”It’s not the first time that Facebook has found itself in the middle of a controversy in India following a Wall Street Journal report. According to an August 14 report in the newspaper, .Facebook’s then-South Asia public policy director Ankhi Das intervened to stop Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party legislator T Raja Singh from being banned from the social media site over possible fallout for the company’s business interests in India.Singh was eventually banned permanently from Facebook and Das resigned from the company in October to “pursue my personal interest in public service.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-grills-facebook-head-for-inaction-on-bajrang-dal/story-AaHvtAZS2knL9QPA7GoejP.html
17-12-2020||India||Supreme Court steps in to resolve deadlock over farm laws: ‘Talks set to fail’||The Supreme Court stepped in on Wednesday to try and end the impasse between farmers’ unions and the Centre over the contentious new laws to open up trade in agriculture, observing that the protest will soon become a national issue and that recent events suggest government negotiations with the unions were “bound to fail again.”The organisation spearheading the protest said in its initial reaction that the court’s decision was moral victory for the farmers, but insisted that the laws should be repealed.Also Read| ‘Tolerating is also sin’: Haryana priest dies by suicide amid farmers’ stirA bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde will hold a joint hearing of the government and the farmers’ organisations on Thursday, indicating that the court will set up a committee of representatives of both sides to discuss and resolve the dispute.“It doesn’t seem the negotiations between the government and farmers will work,” the court said.The CJI-led bench is already seized of a clutch of petitions that have challenged the validity of the laws passed in September. These will also come up for hearing on Thursday. At least six factions of the BKU will be there at Thursday’s hearing. Permission was granted to implead major farm unions as respondents in the case, including the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU - Rajesh Tikait), BKU - Sidhupur (Jagjeet S. Dallewal), BKU - Rajewal (Balbeer Singh Rajewal), BKU - Lakhowal (Harinder Singh Lakhowal), and others.The three laws triggered a massive protest by farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, who have massed at the borders of Delhi since November 26. The laws allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules.Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices. Protesters decided to call off further negotiations on December 8, after a meeting with home minister Amit Shah, claiming a stalemate.The government has offered to amend the laws substantially; the farmers’ unions want nothing short of their repeal.“The SC’s order, in which it suggested a committee for negotiations, are a big moral victory for farmers. But talks will help only if they are about withdrawing the three laws,” said Avik Saha, secretary of the All India Kisan Coordination Committee, a large platform of farm unions spearheading the protests.The AIKSCC said the Prime Minister was misinforming the nation about the Acts not affecting farmers’ land, about minimum support prices and diverting attention from the real issues by invoking the bogey of “Opposition fooling farmers”.“The Movement in Delhi will continue till 3 Acts are withdrawn. Farmers always ready to explain their issues to either the court or government. We will come up with more detailed views after studying the SC order,” said Darshan Pal, another farmers’ leader.During the hearing on Wednesday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Union government, complained that “some other interests” have taken over the farmers’ protests and that the protestors’ representatives turn their chairs, showing their backs to the union ministers during the talks.“They come with placards, written ‘Yes or No’. The government was ready and is still ready to engage in talks with the farmers. But the problem is that their stand is either you repeal the laws or we don’t want to talk. I can submit that the government will not do anything which is against the interest of the farmers,” added the law officer.But the bench was not impressed. “What is the point of saying this when they perceive it to be against their interests? Your negotiations do not appear to work and are bound to fail again. What’s the point of saying something very good when it serves no purpose since the farmers are not before us (the court)?”The bench, which included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, pointed out that while the bunch three petitions were filed before it by lawyers with different kinds of prayers, no farmers’ union or representative is a party to the hearings.The court issued notices on the petitions but it underscored the need to give an audience to the farmers’ representatives for a suitable adjudication of the issues, which ranged from clearing the road blockades to directing the government to ensure the farmers’ demands are met.Responding, the SG said that he was aware that the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) was at the forefront of the protests and that his office would be sharing the contact details of their leaders so that they can be heard tomorrow.At this, the CJI told Mehta: “Tentatively, we will form a committee comprising representatives of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, the government, and other farmers’ organisation from other parts of India because this will soon become a national issue. So, we will have other organisations from other parts of the country too.”One of the petitioners cited the need to move the farmers to a designated spot and clear the roads in the backdrop of the Supreme Court’s judgment in the Shaheen Bagh case wherein it was held that public roads cannot be blocked indefinitely by protestors. The Shaheen Bagh protest was against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act .The bench, however, said no order can be passed without the court hearing the other side. “What were the number of people in Shaheen Bagh? How many blocked the road? Will the numbers not matter? Who will take the responsibility? There cannot be any precedent in a law-and-order situation,” it added.The Delhi government’s standing counsel Rahul Mehra also appeared in the case. While he questioned the petitioners for filing half-baked public interest litigations (PILs), Mehra said that it was very important that some urgent steps are taken by the Centre given the fact that farmers have been compelled to protest in the open in a cold winter.At this, SG Mehta retorted: “Mr Mehra seems to be appearing for some union and not a government. Which union are you appearing for, Mr Mehra?” This triggered a sharp response from Mehra, who said he can also comment on why and for whom Mehta was appearing in the matter.The bench asked the two lawyers to refrain from personal comments and fixed the matter for a hearing on Thursday, pointing out the court will be on a winter break after Friday. Senior advocate Harish Salve is also expected to appear in this matter on Thursday for a new petition or application.Zia Haq in New Delhi contributed to this report||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-steps-in-to-end-deadlock-over-farm-laws-talks-set-to-fail/story-6VYwXLRlFFkTgreR3juruN.html
17-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The US Food and Drug Administration’s endorsement of the Moderna vaccine’s safety and efficacy on Tuesday — a regulatory clearance is expected as early as Friday — came with a bonus: details, hitherto unknown, that indicated the vaccine’s ability to prevent or, at the least, reduce the transmission of Covid-19. As this columnist has previously written, what most of the Phase 3 clinical trials of vaccines against Covid-19 sought to measure as an outcome was effectiveness in preventing infection. The vaccines developed by Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Astra Zeneca/Oxford, and the Gamaleya Institute, have all proved to be effective, albeit to varying degrees, though all do exceed the bar of 50% set by the US regulator.Based on the trial data published in the public domain, only AstraZeneca seemed to have tested for the vaccine’s impact on transmission — it found that the vaccine did reduce transmission — although this nugget was almost immediately forgotten in the criticism that was justifiably and understandably targeted at the vaccine developers for data based on what was clearly a mash-up of Phase 3 clinical trials. It’s probably the reason the vaccine won’t be approved in the US on the basis of these trials; an approval in the UK, one of the places where Phase 3 trials were conducted, is expected in days.Also Read: Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin safe, says Phase 1 trial dataNow, FDA’s in-depth report on the Moderna vaccine candidate publicises data that was absent in the company’s initial data released in mid-November. According to this report, the company presented data that showed that the first shot of its two-dose vaccine actually managed to reduce asymptomatic infections — something that could, if established through further research, mean that it reduces transmission of the viral disease.Vaccines that don’t just prevent infections but also reduce or stop transmission could effectively crush the pandemic — and mean a faster return to normal. For instance, it could mean vaccinated people no longer have to wear masks because they cannot be transmitters. Similar data for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which is currently being administered in both the US and the UK, isn’t available, although the company is believed to be working on this.While the Pfizer vaccine awaits regulatory clearance in India, it is likely that most Indians will not receive it. A vaccine dashboard maintained by Unicef puts the number of vaccine doses for which India has struck agreements with companies at 200 million — which is probably more accurate than the 1.6 billion number doing the rounds. Of this, 100 million doses (of Covishield, the two-dose AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine) are through an agreement between Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance and Serum Institute of India (SII), which is making the drugs locally, and another 100 million, through an agreement between Gamaleya and Hetero Drugs. The Indian government isn’t party to either deal, although there would seem to be an unstated understanding that the government will, pending the vaccine’s approval in India, acquire most of the output of SII that hasn’t been spoken for already.India is also likely betting on Covaxin, the vaccine being developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with the Indian Council for Medical Research. Phase 3 trials for Covaxin (also a two-dose vaccine) are currently underway, and interim results are expected around the end of the year. Bharat Biotech has sought emergency-use approval on the basis of data from its Phase 1/2 trials (this is as yet unpublished), but India’s drug regulator has rightly asked the company to come back with data from its Phase 3 trials. Again, while no formal deal exists (or has been publicised), the understanding would appear to be that, pending approval, the government will acquire much of Bharat Biotech’s output.SII is conducting its own Phase 3 trials of Covishield in India, and when that data is released it will be interesting to see if there is any indication that the vaccine prevents transmission, as suggested by the interim analysis of its Phase 3 trial data that was released last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-4m1ON9EOnatmZ1lwX03v8M.html
17-12-2020||India||US defence bill slams China on LAC aggression||A US defence spending legislation that has been cleared by both chambers of the US Congress expresses “significant concern” with Chinese aggression along the border with India, and urges Beijing to settle the dispute through “existing diplomatic mechanisms” and “refrain’’ from using force and coercion.The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), 2021 seeks to convey this message as an expression of the “sense of Congress”. Though it is neither a demand nor a threat tagged with enforceable consequences, it is a significant show of support for India and solidarity, passed by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and Republican-controlled Senate.The legislation is now awaiting the signature of President Donald Trump. He has until December 23 to sign the bill into law or veto it, as he has threatened to. However, since the legislations passed both the House and Senate with two-thirds majorities, the measure has enough support to override a presidential veto.In Section 1206 of the bill titled “Sense of Congress on the aggression of the government of China along the border with India and growing territorial claims” the bill says, “Continued military aggression by the Government of China along the border with India is a significant concern.”And that the “government of China should work with the government of India toward de-escalating the situation along the Line of Actual Control through existing diplomatic mechanisms and refrain from attempting to settle disputes through coercion or force”.It goes on to point to China’s other aggressive actions in the region and around, and says that Congress believes that “attempts by the Government of China to advance baseless territorial claims, including those in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and with respect to Bhutan, are destabilizing and inconsistent with international law”.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signed the NDAA last Friday, starting the 10-day notice period for the President to sign it.Trump has threatened to veto the bill if it did not contain provision taking away immunity enjoyed by social media platforms from prosecution for content published by them, under Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act. He wants to punish Twitter, Facebook and other platforms for censoring and labelling objectionable content published by him and his conservative allies.The $740 billion defence spending bill doesn’t contain that provision, in a rare joint snub by both Republicans and Democrats, which has set up a confrontation with lawmakers of both parties, who are determined to override his veto.Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Indian American member of the House of the Representatives who led the effort to include this language int the bill, said in a statement, “Violent aggression is seldom the answer, and this is especially true for the Line of Actual Control, which is the disputed border region that separates the People’s Republic of China from India.”He added that the inclusion of this language in the bill and its enactment by the US government will send a clear signal that “China’s military provocations of India will not be tolerated” and that the US is “committed to standing with our allies and partners like India in resolving the border standoff using diplomatic means”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-defence-bill-slams-china-on-lac-aggression/story-iVWUrpSAi7YkbyD7dzZb6N.html
17-12-2020||India||Dissent in TMC official, Suvendu Adhikari quits as MLA||Dissidence within the Trinamool Congress (TMC) became official on Wednesday when former cabinet minister Suvendu Adhikari resigned from the West Bengal assembly and held a closed-door meeting with some rebel lawmakers for the first time, triggering speculation that Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit to the state this weekend could be marked by defections to the BJP. Shah will address rallies and party workers in three districts on December 19 and 20. Adhikari and the rebels assembled 165km away from Kolkata, at the residence of the TMC’s Burdwan East Lok Sabha MP Sunil Mandal. Asansol city’s outgoing mayor and legislator from West Burdwan district’s Pandabeswar, Jitendra Tiwari, and dissident leaders from at least three districts attended the meeting. They did not make any announcement till the time of going to press.Adhikari also wrote a letter to governor Jagdeep Dhankhar in the evening, seeking protection and expressing fear that he and his associates may be implicated by the police and the administration in “criminal cases out of political motivation and vendetta”. Adhikari did not say a word to the media but Dhankhar tweeted, “Suvendu Adhikari former minister @MamataOfficial has by way of representation sought my intervention so that police @WBPolice @KolkataPolice and administration are dissuaded from implicating him and associates in criminal cases out of political vendetta. Taking expected steps.” Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who was on a three-day tour of north Bengal, called up Tiwari during the day and asked him not to take any drastic steps till she returns to Kolkata and meets him on Friday, TMC leaders said. Tiwari has accused urban development minister Firhad Hakim and the government of depriving Asansol of central funds meant for development. Adhikari resigned from the legislative assembly around 4pm on Wednesday, 18 days after quitting the cabinet in which he held three departments. He represented East Midnapore district’s Nandigram seat where a long land movement helped TMC chief Mamata Banerjee oust the Left Front government in 2011. Adhikari went to the assembly house and submitted a handwritten letter at the secretariat since the speaker, Biman Banerjee, was not present in his office. The letter raised several technical questions since Adhikari did not put any date on it and did not write or sign it before the speaker, something anti-defection rules of the assembly demand. “I have not received any letter. The secretary has no authority to accept an MLA’s resignation letter. I have to review the matter,” the speaker said in the evening. The dissidents started speaking out in different districts of south Bengal since Tuesday, hours after the chief minister addressed rallies in north Bengal where the BJP won seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019. On Wednesday, while Banerjee headed for more rallies in north Bengal, several lawmakers in south Bengal, where the BJP did not do so well in the Lok Sabha polls, raised a voice against organisational decisions and election strategist Prashant Kishor. Mandal, the two-time Lok Sabha MP from Burdwan East constituency, which was one of the strongest citadels of the Marxists till he wrested the seat in 2014, told local media that the TMC needs reforms. The rebel leaders met at his home in Kanksa. Questioning the necessity of Kishor and his company, I-Pac, Mandal said, “Is it acceptable that those of us who worked on the ground among people and rose from the ranks have to take instructions from paid employees of I-Pac on where and how to hold processions? People of Bengal are sensitive and intelligent. Processions do not ensure votes.” Posters appeared in his support in several parts of East Burdwan. Statements against the TMC leadership were also made by Dipak Haldar, the legislator from Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas district and Biswajit Kundu, the legislator from Kalna in East Burdwan district. Adhikari’s aides said he may join the BJP on December 19 or, he may do so on December 18 as he had plans to fly to Delhi on Thursday. Adhikari, his father and two brothers represent two Lok Sabha constituencies and an assembly seat in East Midnapore. They also run the civic body at Contai, their hometown. “The entire Adhikari family will eventually join the BJP. It is only a matter of time,” said a senior TMC leader who did not want to be named.Reacting to Adhikari’s resignation from the assembly, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said the rebel leader would be welcomed when he joins the BJP. Saugata Roy, the TMC Lok Sabha member who held reconciliatory talks with Adhikari, said, “Suvendu is taking one step at a time before joining the BJP. This is not unexpected for us.” The developments took place while the chief minister addressed people and party leaders in north Bengal. “People cannot change their character every day. You can change clothes every day but not idealism. Do you, the common people, have faith in me? Those who are with the party since its birth are still there. A few of those who joined us later are leaving. It will not make any difference,” Banerjee said at a rally in Cooch Behar. Mihir Goswami, the TMC legislator from the Cooch Behar South seat, joined the BJP last month. In a parallel development, forest minister Rajib Banerjee’s followers put up more posters in different districts, including East Midnapore. The minister, too, made significant statements at a public programme on Tuesday. Without naming the TMC, he said he had been deprived.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissent-in-tmc-official-suvendu-adhikari-quits-as-mla/story-siWUiysSl62bJFf0QzoYUN.html
17-12-2020||India||JEE Main to be conducted 4 times a year from 2021: Govt||The Union government on Wednesday said it will conduct the marquee Joint Entrance Examination (Main), or JEE Main, four times a year from 2021 in 13 languages including English, just days after it said that a proposal is being evaluated for conducting it more than twice.The first of the four attempts allowed in JEE Main in 2021 will be conducted between 23 February and 26 February and there will be no negative marking for optional questions this time, Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ said. “We have examined the suggestions received from students and various quarters, and it has been decided that JEE-Mains will be held in four sessions in February, March, April and May,” Pokhriyal said.JEE Main will be conducted in English, Hindi and 11 other languages, instead of just English and Hindi as is the practice now, to give opportunities to students from regional language backgrounds, the minister said.The regional languages will include Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Bengali and Assamese.The new format will help reduce the chances of JEE Main clashing with other competitive examinations or board examinations, the minister said. “The move will ensure that students do not miss out on opportunities due to clash of exams or due to the COVID-19 situation at present,” the minister said.The education ministry had on 10 December said it is exploring the possibility of holding JEE Main three or four times a year. The syllabus will be the same as the previous year. The ministry on Wednesday said students will be given the choice of answering 75 questions (25 each in physics, chemistry and mathematics) out of 90 questions (30 each in physics, chemistry and mathematics).The top performers of JEE Main, around 150,000 of the candidates, are shortlisted for giving JEE Advanced, the second leg of the JEE entrance system, which opens the door for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology. JEE Main results are also used for admission into engineering colleges in several states and some of the top centrally-funded engineering and tech schools.A candidate has the option to apply for one session (February) or more than one session, March, April, May 2021 together and pay the examination fee accordingly. “However, if a candidate appears in more than one session then his or her best of scores in 2021 will be considered for preparation of merit list or ranking. The question paper will contain 90 questions, in which the candidate will have to attempt a total of 75 questions. In the new paper pattern, there will be no negative marking in the 15 alternative questions,” Pokhriyal said. “The candidates have to attempt 75 questions out of 90, or 25 questions out of 30 in each section of chemistry, physics and maths,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jee-main-to-be-conducted-4-times-a-year-from-2021-govt/story-sAHRc221Kr8WH8dQqjH6MP.html
17-12-2020||India||Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin safe, says Phase 1 trial data||India’s first domestically produced vaccine against Covid-19, Covaxin, triggered robust immune response, and reported no major adverse events shows findings from the Phase 1 placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind trial on the safety and immunogenicity published by Bharat Biotech in a pre-print study on Wednesday.Only one serious adverse event was reported, which was found to be not vaccination related, according to the study.The results of Phase 1 results of Covaxin had not been publicly released yet even though the data was first presented to Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on October 2 when the company applied for approval to start Phase 3 trials.“BBV152 induced binding and neutralising antibody responses… Vaccine induced neutralising antibody titers were reported with two divergent SARS-CoV-2 strains. BBV152 is stored between 2°C and 8°C, which is compatible with all national immunisation programme cold chain requirements,” says the paper, which is yet to be peer-reviewed.To be sure, data given in the study released on Wednesday only pertains to the first of the three-phased clinical trials for vaccine authorisation. In Phase 1, initial testing of the vaccine candidate is carried out in small numbers of healthy adults to primarily test its safety. The results of this phase do not play a role in the market authorisation.Other organisations that have been developing Covid-19 vaccines published data from their Phase 1 trials several months ago. Moderna Inc, for instance, published its Phase 1 data in July. The Pfizer/Biontech vaccine, which has already started being administered in the United States and Britain, released data from their vaccine’s Phase 1 results in August.Phase 2 involves larger numbers of subjects and is focussed on data about a vaccine’s ability to safely produce its desired effect (immunogenicity). The Phase 3 is the pivotal study on which licensing is based and it checks for the effectiveness of immune reaction triggered by the vaccine. Efficacy of the vaccine will be determined only in Phase 3 trials. The results of Phase 3 are finally presented as the data on which authorisation is obtained. Bharat Biotech has not yet submitted results of Phase 3 trials, which began in mid-November. On December 7, the firm had applied to DCGI for emergency use authorisation for Covaxin, following which the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) recommended that it present the safety and efficacy data from Phase 3 trials in order for its application to be considered . Bharat Biotech has developed the whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (BBV152) in collaboration with ICMR. In the Phase 1 study, a total of 375 participants were randomised equally to receive three vaccine formulations (n=100 each); the control arm had 75 participants. Vaccines were administered on a two-dose intramuscular accelerated schedule on Day 0 (baseline) and Day 14. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. The secondary outcomes were immunogenicity. The follow-up visits were scheduled on days 7, 28, 42, 104, and 194. Experts, however, say much depends on the Phase 3 trial results. “At this stage, there are many promising vaccine candidates but Phase 3 trial results will be significant in terms of which ones finally materialize,” said public health expert Professor K Srinath Reddy, who is also a member of the National Task Force on Covid-19 management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-safe-says-phase-1-trial-data/story-YQuKS072LuBSa1BNdzNrGM.html
17-12-2020||India||‘Good music should continue to happen…’||Singer Shilpa Rao has reasons to be happy these days. With so much music happening for her and appreciation coming her way has made her all cheerful.Initially she couldn’t believe the news. “We all love to be appreciated and especially when it comes in a form of the biggest global award nomination, what else one can ask for. I remember when I heard the news that Anoushka Shankar’s album ‘Love Letters’ which, also features my song ‘Those Words’ has been nominated in the Best Global Music Album category for the 63rd Grammy Awards, I was all numb. I wanted to authenticate the news first as so much fake news is happening around us. So, when I was able to confirm it, I was simply elated,’ she said. “Also, it’s an all women album and that makes it more special for us all,” she added. The singer of ‘Ghungroo Toot Gye’ (‘War’) fame is waiting to get back on stage and in studios soon. “Of course, we all want to resume normal life as soon as possible. I miss the time in studios and live singing. Giving real performances is what I am waiting for,” Shilpa said. Music kept Shilpa busy since last couple of months. “During this phase I have kept myself busy with recording, shooting at home, posting videos online. I recorded a song for ‘Ludo’ from home. Anoushka’s collaboration song too happened in the same phase where we shot the video sitting in our homes, so work was happening any which way. Also, I think music made all of us happy during such tough time. So good music should continue to happen,” she said. Next year Shilpa will be seen on TV as well as in more musical collaborations. “Apart from cutting music albums, both private as well as for films, I’ll also be seen on TV for Indian pro music league, a fun musical show where I’ll get to captain a team from Mumbai,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/good-music-should-continue-to-happen/story-k8hug4eT6WSmw02nT8149O.html

17-12-2020||India||EC seeks action on 4 for unaccounted cash during 2019 Madhya Pradesh assembly elections||The Election Commission ordered Madhya Pradesh chief election officer on Wednesday to lodge a criminal case against four bureaucrats for their alleged role in the use of black money during the 2019 assembly elections in the state.The bureaucrats include IPS officers Sushobhan Banerjee, Sanjay and V Madhu Kumar and state police officer Arun Mishra. “(The) Commission deliberated upon a report, received from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), intimating its search operations in Madhya Pradesh and its findings of extensive use of unaccounted cash during the General Elections 2019 in Madhya Pradesh,” the EC said. “It is reported that these entities/individuals engaged in unauthorized and unaccounted cash contributions to individuals on behalf of certain political party, which is reported to be corroborated during searches against persons by Income Tax department under Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961...”The Commission has directed the chief electoral officer of Madhya Pradesh to lodge criminal action with the Economic Offences Wing. It has also asked the Chief Secretary, Madhya Pradesh for similar action against State officer. “It was a search and seizure operation carried out by the CBDT. The Commission has found actionable evidence in the report,” said an EC official.Banerjee allegedly received Rs25 lakh from Pratik Joshi, whose residence was raided by the income tax department last year. Joshi was known to be a close associate of Ashwani Sharma, an alleged power broker. They were purportedly in touch with Kamal Nath’s aide and former officer on special duty Pravin Kakkar. Kakkar is currently under investigation by the Income Tax department. According to the CBDT report, Mane received Rs30 lakh, Mishra 7.5 crore and Kumar got over 13 crore. Congress claimed that money seized belonged to the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders. On April 9, 2019, Kamal Nath alleged that the BJP was trying to exert pressure on him. Congress MLA PC Sharma said, “BJP-led central government is misusing the central investigating agencies for a long time. But now the government has started pressurising ECI to work in the favour of BJP. This is nothing but a conspiracy against Congress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-seeks-action-on-4-for-unaccounted-cash-during-2019-madhya-pradesh-assembly-elections/story-ynNR9VlMaGG0mJyBeZ6z3J.html
17-12-2020||India||India deteriorates to 131 in UN Human Development Index||India has dropped two spots on the Human Development Index, according to the 2020 Human Development Report published by the United Nations Development Programme on Wednesday. Asia’s third-largest economy ranked 131 among 189 countries in 2019, according to the report that measures national progress not by income or gross domestic product alone, but by development indicators such as educational attainment, health outcomes and standard of living. Bhutan and Namibia have overtaken India, and were placed at the 129th and 130th spots. “India’s HDI value for 2019 is 0.645 -- which put the country in the medium human development category -- positioning it at 131 out of 189 countries and territories. Between 1990 and 2019, India’s HDI value increased from 0.429 to 0.645, an increase of 50.3 percent,” the report said. Norway came out on the top of the index, followed closely by Ireland and Switzerland. Among a clutch of South Asian nations, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Cambodia and Pakistan were ranked under a grouping of countries with medium human development. In contrast, among emerging Asian economies, Malaysia ranked 62, figuring in a category of countries with very high human development. Sri Lanka, Thailand and China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam ranked lower that Malaysia, but were ahead of India and classified as economies with high human development. India’s gross national income per capita fell to $6,681 in 2019 from $6,829 in 2018 on a purchasing power parity basis, the report said. India figured in the bottom third for most development indicators, including quality of health and education and an adverse sex ratio, according to the report. The country also ranked in the bottom third for a high percentage of people in vulnerable employment. India, however, figured in the top third grouping of countries with a lower unemployment rate and high representation of women in elected local governments. The idea of human development, pioneered by economists Mahbub al Haq through the UNDP’s Human Development Reports, and Amartya Sen, who weighed in with a conceptual and theoretical framework for it, has now become an influential paradigm for development. According to the pioneers of human development, such as Sen, human development is about people, not the economy and involved enlarging of choices that people value, such as longer and healthier life and education, along with income. According to this approach, economic development, or growth, is only one of the things necessary for the fulfilment of some larger goals of human well-being. The first Human Development Report 1990 defined human development as the “process of enlarging people’s choices”. Apart from income, this basket includes basic critical necessities, such as livelihoods, good health, freedom, nutrition and even dignity. In other words, a general sense of well-being. The philosophical underpinnings of such an approach is that the people are at the centre. Human beings aren’t mere resources for the economy or a factor of production. “The concept of human development is that people must have access to certain choice that enhance their capabilities. India’s slip on the global ranking is concerning, underscoring the need for higher investment in social infrastructure rather than a preoccupation with industrial development,” said Ashish Pai, a member of India’s first state-level human development index brought out by Madhya Pradesh in 1995.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-deteriorates-to-131-in-un-human-development-index/story-4iv8XeFjClpWmgna2NPWXL.html
17-12-2020||India||House panel to review working of RTI watchdogs, experts wary||A parliamentary standing committee, for the first time, will scrutinise the working of the transparency watchdogs, the Central Information Commission (CIC) and the State Information Commissions (SICs), a move that has caused consternation among Right to Information (RTI) activists who see it as an attempt to “usurp” the powers of state legislatures.As the information commissions are statutory bodies, the CIC is required to submit annual reports to Parliament and the SICs to state legislatures through their administrative wings, the ministry of personnel and training at the Centre and the services departments in the states.These annual reports are rarely debated in Parliament or state legislatures although members have raised questions over the efficacy of the RTI law in short-duration discussions and during the zero hour, where a member can raise an issue approved by the presiding officers.Rajya Sabha secretary general Desh Deepak Verma has listed 12 issues for examination by the parliamentary standing committee in the current financial year (2020-21), which includes a review of the working of the Central Information Commission and State Information Commissions. Other issues listed on the agenda include reviews of the working of virtual courts, guardianship and adoption laws and functioning of Alternate Dispute Resolution Mechanisms.Committee chairperson and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Bhupendra Yadav was not available to comment on the matter. A Rajya Sabha official familiar with the development said the committee decides on the agenda after gathering inputs from all members, including 10 MPs from the Rajya Sabha and 20 from the Lok Sabha.“The committee has taken a decision to review the information commissions as there were lots of media reports about their functioning,” said the official, who requested anonymity.The committee has the powers to summon any official and seek suggestions from non-government organisations to review the performance of any organisation, including the information commissions, he added. A report by the Satark Nagarik Sangathan (SNS) released in connection with the 15th anniversary of the RTI law on October 9, 2020, said that around a third of information commissions in India were headless, with a fourth of information commissioner posts lying vacant.It added that the Jharkhand and Tripura information commissions were defunct. The report said nine states, including Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan, did not have a chief information commissioner, whose appointment under the RTI law is a statutory requirement.Since then, Rajasthan has appointed a chief information commissioner.The Centre on November 10 filled the post of chief information commissioner, a position that had been vacant since August with the appointment of Yashwardhan Kumar Sinha.Another report filed by Transparency International India on the same day said that around 33 million RTI applications had been filed with various government departments across the country in the past 15 years, showing the widespread use of the watershed law that empowers citizens to raise governance questions with public authorities.Only about 9% of these RTI applications resulted in a second appeal, meaning that over 90% of the applicants were satisfied with the government’s response, something that transparency law activists see as RTI’s biggest achievement.“We have no problem with a review of the chief information commission by a parliamentary standing committee as the legislature has powers to review,” said Anjali Bhardwaj of SNS. “We want the committee to give terms of reference of the review and the exercise should not be used to weaken the RTI Act. Earlier, the central government had weakened the RTI law by bringing new service rules for information commissioners.”The Centre, in October 2019, notified rules downgrading the information commissioner’s post, which was on par with that of an election commissioner, to equivalence with the post of a secretary in the Government of India. The new rule also reduced the term of an information commissioner from five to three years and empowered the Centre to remove the officer, which, Bhardwaj said, had undermined the spirit of the RTI Act in the name of rationalisation.Venkatesh Nayak of the National Campaign for People’s Right to Information (NCPRI) wondered how a parliamentary panel could review the functioning of the state information commissions, which come under purview of state governments and state legislatures.“This is another attempt to usurp the powers of the state legislature, to which state information commissions submit their annual reports,” Nayak said. Agreeing with him, Bhardwaj said the standing committee should take transparency and federalism into account in the review of the functioning of information commissions. The importance of that RTI Act in India can be gauged from a 2019 verdict of the Supreme Court, which said the law had the potential to bring about good governance, which is an integral part of a vibrant democracy. “Attaining good governance is also one of the visions of the Constitution,” the court said.The RTI is a central law, which was adopted by the states without any substantial change. State governments have, however, effected some changes in the appointment of information commissioners and the functioning of the state information commissions by amending some rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-to-review-working-of-rti-watchdogs-experts-wary/story-EuoR42llk6TnRYHBwnK1DM.html
17-12-2020||India||MP varsity faces flak for unique first-aid diploma||The Madhya Pradesh- government run Atal Bihari Vajpayee Hindi (ABVH) University has started a new diploma course in first aid that it has tried to popularise by effectively promoting quackery, and to which it has tried to lend a veneer of respectability by creating a First Aid Council of India (FACI), which has signed off on the programme. “Neem Hakeem, Jhola Chaap doctor (read quacks) or any other person can start their first aid centre to earn money after getting first aid specialist diploma course,” said an advertisement issued by the university in different newspapers and on social media platforms on December 14 to promote the one-year diploma course. The course fee is Rs28,000. Doctors and experts have raised objection to the course saying it promotes quackery.The university, which was started in Bhopal in 2011 with a vision to promote Hindi, has introduced three diploma courses - First Aid Specialists, Natural Pharma and Yoga and Natural Therapy.Governor Anandiben Patel is chancellor of the university. Additional secretary to governor Rajesh Kaul said, “The university is an autonomous body and the executive members are free to take decision related to the course. If we receive any complaint, we will take action.” “These are the first-of-its kind courses,” Ramdev Bhardwaj,the university’s vice-chancellor said in a message to media persons to promote the course. “Various state governments and the central government have many times discussed the proposal of starting a first aid course but no institution in India has ever introduced one. We have taken the initiative and it is essential for every people to learn lifesaving first aid methods.” Ajay Sahu,the director in charge of the diploma courses, said this course provides an opportunity to everyone, including class 12 graduate and even medical practitioners without degrees, to become self-reliant. His reference is to local (often unlicensed) medical practitioners. “The course basically needs a basic understanding of health which a student having cleared class 12 has. It is not a subject-specific thing so doesn’t need any basic qualification and knowledge of any particular subject.”“Even, World Health Organization (WHO) promotes first-aid programmes. We are following the 300-page manual of WHO for the first-aid course.The videos, audios and booklets prepared by experts and medical practitioners will be provided to students.They will be running online due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” Sahu explained.He also claimed this course did not need any kind of permission or recognition. To buttress his claim, he shared with HT, replies of the Medical Council of India (MCI) and ministry of Ayush to the Right to Information (RTI) applications he had filed, stating that the area (first-aid) does not come under their purview.Dr Rajan Sharma, president, Indian Medical Association, which is protesting against allowing Ayurvedic doctors over 50 surgeries like allopathic doctors, said, “This does not sound like a healthy trend wherein non medical colleges are offering medical courses, even if short-term. The Indian Medical Association has also been running such training programmes for a while now. IMA is also not against Ayush systems; the body, however, has a problem with trivialising modern medicine. There should be no mixing of streams. You will end up in a mess, with our future generations suffering in the long run. It will also indirectly promote quackery.”National Medical Commission (NMC), which has replaced MCI to regulate medical education, declined to comment since the issue was of another ministry. Sahu said FACI was registered with the ministry of corporate affairs under the Companies Act in October, a few weeks before the course was ready for promotion.Interestingly, the university formed the First Aid Council of India, an autonomous body, which claims that it works to promote first aid treatment in India. An advertisement for the programme, featuring photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, claims FACI is opening a research centre in the university campus in Bhopal to promote national health. FACI president Shabab Aalam declined comment through a representative. Objecting to the course, Madhya Pradesh’s National Health Mission (NHM) additional director and former chief medical health officer (CMHO), Bhopal, Dr Pankaj Shukla, said, “The reply of Medical Council or Ayush ministry that the course doesn’t come in their purview doesn’t mean that the course can be run without their permission. The university should take permission from (the state government’s) directorate of medical education for the course and from the CMHO for running the first-aid centre because it is a medical course.”He also said anyone opening a first-aid centre without possessing requisite qualifications would be committing a crime. “If these diploma holders start their own first-aid centre in any part of the country, they would be sent behind bars for violation of the Clinical Establishment Act. The university is promoting quackery. ”A former faculty member of the university and now professor at Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), Amravati, Anil Saumitra said the university was being forced to launch such courses to stay afloat.“The university started with a vision to promote Hindi by developing different courses in the Raj Bhasha (state language).” But because of improper planning, a programme in engineering failed to take off, he said. “Now, the university is facing existential (financial) crises and is forced to start such courses,” he added.Despite repeated calls and messages, vice chancellor Bhardwaj couldn’t be reached for comment.

17-12-2020||India||No decision on scrapping quota for IIT faculty recruitment: Govt||The Union education ministry said on Wednesday that it had taken no decision on implementing a controversial proposal to exempt IITs from quota norms for faculty hiring even as a political controversy brewed over the suggestion.The proposal was made by an expert committee, headed by IIT Delhi Director V Ramagopal Rao and comprising representatives from four top IITs and three government ministries. The panel, set up by the ministry in April, also told the ministry that IITs were institutes of excellence and matters of faculty hiring should be dealt with the board of governors of these colleges.“There is no such decision by the ministry,” said a senior ministry official on condition of anonymity. The panel was asked to look into the reservation process for students and teachers and submitted its report to the ministry in May.It comes at a time when several IIMs are carrying out special drives to recruit faculty members from scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and other backward class communities, in line with government guidelines.The panel noted that the IITs were institutions of national importance, set up by an act of Parliament and having a mandate to contribute to the development of India and the world. It said that vacant positions should not be blocked for a long period of time.“Since IITs have flexible faculty structure and there is no specified tier-wise faculty strength, all appointments are through open advertisement, without specifying specific numbers to be hired. It is important that this aspect of the selection process be retained,” the report said.The panel made some specific recommendations.One, bringing IITs under the list of institutions exempt from reservations.“This must be immediately reconsidered for inclusion of IITs in the schedule taking into account the nature of these institutions, duties, and their activities. The matter of reservations in these institutions may be vested with their respective board of governors to deal with as per the board resolutions, statutes, and byelaws,” the panel said.Two, a new “preparatory” programme to attract quality PhD candidates from reserved categories. If this was not possible, the panel recommended that reservations for all categories -- including economically weaker sections – could be capped at the position of assistant professor, and not extended to higher posts of associate and full professor. Three, vacancies not filled up with adequate representation from reserved categories in a particular year due to non-availability of suitable candidates be de-reserved in the next year.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) didn’t react to the recommendations. But the Congress attacked the Centre and accused it of being anti-Dalit.“It has become a habit of the Narendra Modi government to take every possible opportunity to hit at the very edifice of affirmative action and reservation. They take every opportunity to convolutedly and covertly and also overtly exhibit their anti-Dalit bias…So what’s being proposed is a clear undermining of power and protection provided to the marginalised amongst us,” said Congress spokesperson Pranav Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-decision-on-scrapping-quota-for-iit-faculty-recruitment-govt/story-YSQBwvTWbmWRDlZflfKWMJ.html
17-12-2020||India||5 judges elevated as CJs, 4 chief justices transferred||Effecting a major revamp in the ranks of the higher judiciary, the Supreme Court collegium has elevated five judges as chief justices of high courts and transferred four chief justices.The decision was taken at the meeting of the collegium held on Monday that was chaired by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and attended by the two other senior-most judges, justice NV Ramana and justice Rohington F Nariman.The list of transfers has raised some eyebrows, particularly that of justice JK Maheshwari, the chief justice of the Andhra Pradesh high court, who has been asked to swap positions with Sikkim high court chief justice AK Goswami.Others who have been transferred include chief justice RS Chauhan of the Telangana high court to the Uttarakhand high court and chief justice Mohammad Rafiq from the Orissa high court to the Madhya Pradesh high court. Replacing them will be the judges who have been elevated as chief justices.There has been friction between justice Maheshwari, who took over as Andhra Pradesh chief justice in October 2019, and Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. In March this year, the high court put a spoke in the state government’s decision to paint panchayat buildings with the colours of the ruling party . A month later, the high court set aside Reddy’s decision to introduce English as the medium of instruction in government schools.For months, the tussle between the government and judiciary in the state continued over several issues, finally reaching a flashpoint in September when the high court issued a gag order barring the media from reporting the contents of a first information report (FIR) in a land scandal in the city of Amaravati involving former advocate general Dammalapati Srinivas and daughters of a sitting Supreme Court judge, justice NV Ramana. In October, Reddy wrote a letter to CJI Bobde, complaining that justice Ramana was trying to influence cases in the high court to destabilize his government. This letter was released to the media by Reddy’s principal advisor Ajeya Kallam at a press conference on October 10.Notable among those elevated are justice S Muralidhar, whose parent high court is Delhi. The collegium has recommended that he be moved as chief justice of the Orissa high court. Justice Hima Kohli, the senior-most judge in the Delhi high court after chief justice DN Patel, has now been recommended to become chief justice of the Telangana high court.In March, justice Muralidhar was transferred from his parent high court in Delhi to the Punjab and Haryana high court. The decision to transfer him created a controversy because it came soon after he pulled up Delhi police for not registering a first information report (FIR) against three leaders of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) for allegedly inflammatory speeches they made in the run-up to the February riots in Delhi.Justice Muralidhar, however, put the controversy to rest by clarifying in his farewell address at Delhi high court that the CJI had sought his consent in February to be transferred to the Punjab and Haryana high court.Justice Muralidhar began his legal practice in Delhi in 1987; he is credited with the decision in the Naz Foundation case (2009) in which he and then Delhi high court chief justice AP Shah decriminalized homosexuality, then punishable under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. This verdict, reversed by the Supreme Court, was eventually upheld by a Constitution bench in 2018.The other judges who were recommended for elevation as chief justices include justice Sanjib Banerjee, justice Pankaj Mithal and justice Sudhanshu Dhulia. Justice Banerjee, who is currently serving in the Calcutta high court, has been recommended to be moved as the new chief justice of the Madras high court. Justice Mithal’s parent high court is the Allahabad high court where he is currently serving as a senior judge on the Lucknow bench. He has been recommended to become chief justice of the Jammu and Kashmir high court. Justice Dhulia, who is currently serving in the Uttarakhand high court, has been elevated as chief justice of the Gauhati high court.The five other judges recommended for inter-high court transfers include acting chief justice of the Madhya Pradesh high court Justice Sanjay Yadav, who will move to the Allahabad high court. Similarly, justice Rajesh Bindal, who is the acting chief justice of the Jammu and Kashmir high court, will move to the Calcutta high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-judges-elevated-as-cjs-4-chief-justices-transferred/story-8SAhdXlOUvxypvc1RkloHO.html
17-12-2020||India||Discussion on uniforms and ranks: Rahul Gandhi walks out of House panel meeting||Congress Member of Parliament Rahul Gandhi and his colleagues walked out of a Parliamentary standing committee meeting on defence on Wednesday, saying they were not allowed to speak during a discussion on uniforms and ranks. Gandhi , according to people familiar with the proceedings, expressed an opinion that such matters were best left for the forces to discuss and suggested that the panel focus on more substantive issues. At this point, the people said, the chairman of the panel, Jual Oram asked Gandhi to stick to the agenda of the day , listed as ``an introduction to the rank, structure of the Defence forces including their uniforms, stars and badges, and review of working of cantonment boards.’’The meeting was attended by Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat, Army Vice Chief Satinder Kumar Saini and Defence Secretary Arun Kumar. According to some of the members who attended the meeting and spoke to Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity, Rajya Sabha member Lt Gen (retired) DP Vats was asking the officers why the Indian defence establishment couldn’t have a uniform rank system, that is same designations in the Army, Navy and Air Force like the US does in its three services. Gandhi, according to a BJP MP and a Congress MP, responded by saying the forces were the best judge of this and that suggesting otherwise was an insult to the senior defence officers present at the meeting. The Congress MP added that Gandhi had been asking for a discussion on the border standoff with China for some time now and was disappointed that the committee, instead of taking that up as an agenda was discussing something else. The BJP MP claimed that Gandhi came late for the meeting and was absent in a previous committee hearing when it was decided that MPs needed a briefing to familiarise themselves with the ranks of the forces and how to differentiate between them. Chairman Oram is believed to have told Gandhi to allow the members ask questions and voice their opinions on the scheduled topic, but according to the prople cited above, Congress MP Rajeev Satav, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut and a few others asked that Gandhi be allowed to speak his mind.When this request was denied, Gandhi and two other Congress MPs, Satav and Anumula Revanth Reddy, walked out. The people cited above said Gen Rawat and the other officers were silent throughout these proceedings which lasted about 45 minutes.BJP MP Pratap Simha who was present at the meeting said that Gandhi’s actions didn’t convey his respect for the forces.If he has so much respect for the forces then why did he meet the Chinese ambassador at the height of the Doklam standoff?’’HIS reference was to a july 2017 meeting between Gandhi and Ambassador Luo Zhaohui at a time when Indian and Chinese forces were locked in a weeks-long standoff at the Doklam trijunction area near Bhutan. The Congress’ explanation at the time was that it was to be briefed on bilateral issues and he had also met with former NSA Shivshankar Menon. Gandhi himself had tweeted that it was his job to be informed on critical issues and he had also met with the Bhutan ambassador.General Vats told HT that the subject being discussed was an important one . “I doubt Rahul Gandhi will be able to distinguish between one rank and another,” he added. Oram declined comment. A defence officer familiar with the proceedings said that India follows the British system where the three services have their own ranks and uniforms. There is no plan to change this, the officer added on condition of anonymity. “What Rahulji said is absolutely right. When India is faced with an unprecedented crisis at the LAC border, the parliamentary standing committee is discussing ranks and uniforms of armed forces! Instead of discussing ways to better prepare our forces logistically in these challenging times, the committee chooses to spend time on matters that should only concern the Armed Forces. The main issue is that BJP leverages India’s defence forces for political gains and wants to escape accountability to people’s representatives on issues of national importance,’’ said Satav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discussion-on-uniforms-and-ranks-rahul-walks-out-of-house-panel-meeting/story-o0UMLVmjl7sdDEVRTy8aCP.html
17-12-2020||India||SC seeks govt reply on uniform divorce laws||The Supreme Court on Wednesday set the ball rolling on a contentious debate over uniform grounds for divorce and maintenance/alimony across the country that are both gender- and religion-neutral.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued notice the ministry of home affairs, ministry of law and justice, and ministry of women and child development on two separate petitions filed by a lawyer and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay. The petitions highlighted Article 44 of Constitution which is a directive principle asking states to implement a Uniform Civil Code for all citizens. But their main thrust was on discriminatory practices existing within personal laws that violate Article 14, which offers the right to equality, Article 21, which promises the right to dignity. as well as Article 15, which prohibits discrimination. Such practices place women at an inferior position to men, the petitioner contends.The petitions prayed that regardless of religion or gender, grounds for divorce or maintenance for men or women should be the same. To put this point through, the petitioner engaged two leading women senior advocates, Pinky Anand and Meenakshi Arora, to convince the court that the issue at hand was not of encroaching on personal laws but of gender justice and equality.Initially hesitant to issue notice, the CJI-headed bench asked Anand: “You are taking us into a direction which will encroach upon personal laws and demolish what they seek to achieve.” Anand explained that discriminatory practices exist within personal laws of each religion, but the court has seen those issues from the prism of gender equality and gender justice.She cited a 2017 decision by a Supreme Court Constitution Bench in the Shayara Bano v Union of India case striking down the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional. Anand also referred to a 1995 SC decision in the Sarla Mudgal case wherein the court asked the government to involve the Law Commission of India in framing a comprehensive legislation that rationalizes the personal laws of minorities in keeping with the modern day concept of human rights.The petition highlighted the discriminatory grounds for divorce existing among Hindus vis-à-vis Muslims, Christians and Parsis. For instance, adultery is a ground for divorce for Hindus, Christians and Parsis, but not for Muslims. Incurable leprosy is a ground for divorce among Hindus and Christians but not Parsis or Muslims.Impotency is a ground for divorce for Hindus and Muslims but not for Christians and Parsis. Similarly, underage marriage is a ground for divorce among Hindus but not Christians, Parsis or Muslims.The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said: “Can we remove these discriminatory grounds without entering into the personal laws. Triple talaq was found to be a practice not approved by the religion. Government may know the pulse of the people, but how do we encroach upon personal laws.”Arora, who argued in favour of uniform grounds for maintenance, pointed out that when religious practices infringe on rights guaranteed under the Constitution, such practices should not get any protection from the courts.“Different grounds of divorce are based on and reinforce patriarchal and stereotypical notions about women. Personal laws discriminate against women in marriage, inheritance and guardianship of children. For this reason alone, it completely contravenes principles of equality and dignity under Articles 14, 15 and 21 and the global conventions,” the petition stated. The Court underlined another concern. “The question that arises is which grounds to adopt – Hindu, Islam or Christianity.” The bench spotted an alternative prayer mentioned in both petitions where it asked the court to direct the Law Commission of India to examine all personal laws and suggest uniform grounds for divorce and maintenance considering the best practices of all religions and international conventions.The bench cited this prayer contained in the petitions and said, “This can be considered. We will issue notice but with great caution.”Upadhyay later told reporters: “It is unfortunate that 70 years since our Constitution was adopted, no government has taken steps to implement Article 44. This shows they are not interested in gender justice and equality. With the Court issuing notice, I am convinced that the Centre will respond to my prayer for uniform grounds for divorce and maintenance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-govt-reply-on-uniform-divorce-laws/story-oEIEMvf8CDRO6XG8vgIk3M.html
17-12-2020||India||An uneasy calm in Shaheen Bagh, one year after protest||A year ago, when Road Number 13A in Shaheen Bagh, which connects Noida to Delhi, was blocked by locals protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act, it took Delhi Police by surprise. What started as a sit-in protest by a group of around 100 residents snowballed into one of the largest and most prominent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the country. For 101 days the road, blocked by hundreds of anti-CAA protesters, became a symbol of resistance to the government’s new law. It was cleared on the morning of March 24, 2020, the day before the national lockdown was imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease.This year, as another protest -- this time over three farm laws that aim to liberalise the farm economy -- continues to rage with thousands of farmers on a similar sit-in protest at several of the Capital’s entry points, police are ensuring that nobody starts a protest within the city -- including in Shaheen Bagh’s Road 13A. At Batla House, about 5km away from Shaheen Bagh, when a group of protesters gathered on Tuesday to mark the first anniversary of the violence outside Jamia Millia Islamia, they were quickly forced to disperse. And sometime last week, as the number of protesting farmers swelled at two entry points into Delhi (from Haryana), Singhu and Tikri, police brought personnel from the Border Security Force to guard the streets of Shaheen Bagh. “No government wants a repeat of what happened last year. Until last week, there were some 5-6 local police personnel who would patrol the market during the day but not at night. But now armed commandos are guarding this place, round-the-clock. They don’t want this road to serve as a spot for the farmers’ protest,” said Kuki Solanki, 40, who runs a garment shop in the local market at Shaheen Bagh. On Wednesday, when HT visited the market, a busload of armed BSF personnel were alighting, and starting to march across the market. The officers declined to speak. “You know why we are here -- why state the obvious?” a BSF subinspector, who asked not to be named, said.Sporting AK-47 rifles , the BSF personnel patrolled the lanes along the market, which leads to the residential areas of Shaheen Bagh. A police quick reaction team (QRT) vehicle, along with police commandos and local police officers, was also on the roads. The officers walked the streets looking for potential threats -- those with banners against CAA , or the farm laws. Their anxiety is understandable. When the protest first started, no one outside the national capital, and not many residents of the Capital, knew of Shaheen Bagh, a small colony in the more famous Jamia Nagar neighbourhood of southeast Delhi.But as the protest grew, people from across the city made their way to Shaheen Bagh. They came to see the replicas of the India Gate monument where names of those who died in the anti-CAA protests across the country were etched. They came to hear revolutionary poems being read out by passionate young men and women. And they came to spend time with the grand old women of Shaheen Bagh, the Dadis or grandmothers. In September, 82-year-old Bilkis,one of the women, was named one of the 100 most influential people of 2020 by Time magazine.The 101-day long protest had its share of critics, including thousands of commuters who used road 13A to commute between Delhi and Noida daily. For 101 days as the protesters blocked the important Delhi-Noida link and there were massive traffic jams across the city. Police had to divert traffic on to the Delhi-Noida Mathura road leading to serpentine traffic jams in the morning and evening peak hours. Multiple petitions were filed in courts urging them to intervene and ask protesters to vacate the road. The Supreme Court appointed two interlocutors to speak to the protesters and ensure that the road was cleared. The talks did not make any headway. Much later, in September, after the pandemic achieved what the courts or police could not, the Supreme Court observed that the right to protest in public places should be balanced with the right of the general public to move freely without hindrance.“The Covid pandemic came in the middle of our fight against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The voices have drowned in the noise of this pandemic, but they are not dead. They will rise again. The protesting farmers also learnt about the way to protest from the Shaheen Bagh protesters. The residents will come back until justice is done,” said a member of the Shaheen Bagh residents welfare association.  CAA, which was passed on December 12, 2019, replaced the Citizenship Act, 1955, to fast-track the grant of Indian citizenship to members of the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities from the Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The exclusion of Muslims triggered widespread protests across the country as did the linking of citizenship with religion.Several residents in the area -- most did not want to be named -- said they believe Shaheen Bagh was the most successful sit-in protest, particularly because there was no violence right till the end.But traders said the “successful protest” came at a cost. At least 15 shops in the roughly 200-shop market have shut permanently in one year -- not just because of Covid, although this served as a double whammy for shops that had been put of business for three-and-a-half months by the protest.When lockdown norms were relaxed in May, one shopkeeper said the fear of the virus had kept the shoppers away. About 60 other shops have not reopened yet.“People think it is risky to start a business here. The police are constantly on guard. What happened last year has led people to believe that this place is under the radar of government agencies and can be shut down in case of the simplest law and order problem. Maybe they are right too. They will start a shop in Batla House or Sarita Vihar nearby but not here,” said Ishrafat, 24, who works at a garment store. Nasir Hussain, president of the Shaheen Bagh market welfare association said: “Many shopkeepers did not return. They suffered heavy losses first during the blockade and later because of the lockdown.”Most traders said they do not expect a “spontaneous” gathering of locals again, at least not in Shaheen Bagh. “Delhi is known for protests but a protest like that will not happen here again. It was a spontaneous gathering of women, children and those who dared to speak truth to power. Maybe in other parts of the city but not here. The place is under constant surveillance,” said Mustafa K, 45, a resident. Delhi Police, however, have a different take on the Shaheen Bagh protest. They have alleged that the protest was not a spontaneous gathering of Shaheen Bagh residents but one planned and funded by those who were later involved in the 2020 Delhi riots, which left 53 dead and over 400 injured. The residents and others involved in the protest deny this contention.Professor Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for Study of Developing Societies said“ It would be wrong to say that the Shaheen Bagh protest created a template for sit-in protests such as the current one by the farmers. Shaheen Bagh was one of the longest ones and will be remembered in history. The fact that women, children and families came together for a cause was unique. It was an example of how protests can be undertaken if people are committed. But it may not be remembered best for what many would have liked to remember it. It did not achieve anything. The pandemic and social distancing norms cut short the protest. It ended in a dramatic manner. The Mandal agitation achieved results. Even the anti-corruption movement resulted in something...”On Wednesday, as police teams continued to patrol the market, a team of officers of the crime branch and special cell were still at work, investigating the riots and connecting dots to prove how the sit-in protest site at Shaheen Bagh was used to fuel the anger and orchestrate the Delhi riots, one of the worst in three decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-uneasy-calm-in-shaheen-bagh-one-year-after-protest/story-ICbGQmdhTarXDLa8PbekiN.html
17-12-2020||India||LDF sweeps Kerala local body elections||The ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) on Wednesday pulled off an emphatic victory against the odds in Kerala local body elections, considered a semi-final before assembly elections due in April-May 2021. Even LDF leaders and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF), which won 19 out of the 20 Lok Sabha seats in Kerala in the 2019 general elections, were surprised by the outcome. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) remained an also-ran in the fiercely contested elections. The local body elections took place in the backdrop of mounting challenges to the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led government of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, whose secretary is in jail and a minister has been questioned by law enforcement agencies several times in connection with a gold smuggling racket uncovered in July.Powerful party secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishan was forced to proceed on leave after his son was arrested in connection with a narcotics haul in Bengaluru. Many central agencies have also pitched their tents in the state, probing a series of alleged kickback scandals. Although the Congress and BJP tried their best to exploit these sensational cases to their advantage, the LDF pulled off a victory that is considered a personal triumph for the CM.A close look at the poll outcome shows that a political realignment in the LDF (the Kerala Congress Mani and Loktantric Janata Dal joined the ruling coalition), the effective battle it waged against Covid-19 and welfare measures it launched, including free rations, paid rich dividends.Its high-decibel campaign that central agencies were targeting its leaders and trying to sabotage welfare programmes also helped it attract sympathy votes, political observers said. Consolidation of the minority vote against the BJP also helped, they said. In the LDF surge, many Christian-dominated forts of the Congress like Kottayam and Pathanamhtitta crumbled and the party suffered a humiliating defeat even in the wards of opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala in Haripad (Alapuzha) and former chief minister Oommen Chandy in Puthapally (Kottayam). The poll results raised question about the UDF’s prospects in the 2021 assembly elections. “The Congress will have to do enough introspection and check differences among its leaders,” said senior journalist and political commentator John Mary, adding that overconfidence contributed to the party’s crushing defeat. The BJP remained a distant third although it managed to wrest one more civic body -- Pandalam (Pathanamthitta) -- besides iPalakkad that it already held. Its effort to win the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation fell flat. Its hopes of pulling off a Hyderabad-like performance in the state capital failed to materialise -- out 100 corporation seats, the LDF won 52, NDA 35, UDF 10 and others three. Out of six corporations, the LDF won four -- Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Thrissur and Kozhikkode. UDF emerged victorious only in Kannur (north Kerala). Kochi produced a fractured verdict. Out of 944 local bodies, LDF managed 514, UDF 377, NDA 25 and 29 went to others. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said: “We are humbled by the trust and the confidence of the people of Kerala. This is a victory for secularism and inclusive development.”“It is a victory of the alternative policy being pursued by the CPI(M). People gave a befitting reply to the Centre’s plan to destabilise the state government using its agencies. We salute the people of the state. This mandate will help the LDF to retain its power in assembly elections also,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said in Delhi. Congress leaders said they will examine the reasons for the UDF’s debacle and introspect on the verdict. “Political climate was conducive for the party. We will examine reasons and take corrective measures,” said party leader T N Prathapan. BJP state president K Surendran said both LDF and UDF helped each other and cross-voted to contain the saffron party’s surge. “Last week LDF convenor A Vijayaraghavan said the CPI (M) had taken enough measures to stop BJP in its tracks. In many wards, Congress workers gave their vote en bloc to the CPI(M) to sabotage BJP chances in Thiruvananthapuram,” he said, adding that the ruling party also distributed leaflets in many places for minority consolidation against the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ldf-sweeps-kerala-local-body-elections/story-we303xhZtsCxDWc46Ra7xL.html
17-12-2020||India||Farm unions urge Centre to stop ‘parallel negotiations’||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions leading the protests against three agricultural laws, has asked the government not to hold parallel negotiations with farmers and stop vilifying farmers as anti-national elements. In a letter to agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, the group said: “Please don’t hold parallel negotiations. We have already said that your proposals for amendments are not acceptable to us.”The letter also asked the government not to spread misleading information. “The government is open to talking to all kinds of farmers, including those on protest. Discussion and dialogue is the only way for a solution,” farm minister Tomar had said on Tuesday after meeting a group of farmers. The government has so far met four delegations of farmers who say they support the farm laws. “Yesterday, the PM made a wrong claim that milk production has been promoted by non-government private sector, while it is the government- aided cooperative sector which has helped milk farmers, and later the entry of the private sector stressed the milk sector,” said Avik Saha, a leader of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha.A massive farmers’ rebellion was set off by the three laws pushed by the government in September that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules.“PM {Narendra} Modi’s document Putting Farmers First says that the laws “open up avenues for agribusiness” and it is the corporates and MNCs who these laws and government is helping, not the farmers,” the letter said. Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices. Farmers decided to call off negotiations on December 8, after a meeting with home minister Amit Shah, claiming a stalemate. The government on December 9 sent a written proposal to amend some provisions of the laws for greater oversight on deregulated markets, sparing farmers from penalties for stubble burning, which causes pollution, and promising to keep providing farmers subsidised power instead of direct cash transfers, but farm unions say they will not call off their protest until the laws are repealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-unions-urge-centre-to-stop-parallel-negotiations/story-6nRETSos4fzJkfB4OrgHEO.html
17-12-2020||India||Amid farm stir, Cabinet clears Rs 3.5k crore sugar export subsidy||The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved a Rs 3,500 crore subsidy to export sugar by millers amid a glut, a farmer-friendly move through which India is set to offer sugar export subsidies for a third year in a row to pare surplus stocks and ensure domestic prices don’t crash. Export subsidies are necessitated when exports becomes unviable because international prices are lower than domestic prices. “Cabinet has taken the decision to help farmers directly by depositing money of subsidy into their accounts. The subsidy will be given on 60 lakh tonnes of sugar exports at the rate of Rs 6,000 per tonne,” Union minister Prakash Javadekar said on Wednesday. The minister said the subsidy will benefit 50 million cane farmers in the country. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka are among the three largest cane-producing states. India is the world’s largest sugar consumer, but 90% of the country’s output goes into commercial food products while 10% is bought by household consumers. The decision comes amid a persistent standoff between large farm unions and the government over three recent laws that aim to liberalise the farm economy. The subsidy is likely to be highlighted by the government as a key step towards as it battles the massive agitation by farmers against moves to deregulate agricultural markets. “The decision to continue cane subsidy is welcome. This will however have no impact on our agitation (against the new laws),” said Rakesh Tikait of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait faction). Plentiful stocks, the highest since 2012, cheaper imports and mounting dues millers owe to the tune of over Rs 12000 crore have accentuated woes of sugarcane farmers. The subsidy will help farmers get speedier payments and millers to stay profitable. “Farmers sell their sugarcane to the sugar mills, however the farmers are not getting their dues from the sugar mill owners as they have surplus sugar stock. To address this concern, the Government is facilitating the evacuation of surplus sugar stock. This will enable payment of dues of the sugarcane farmers. Government will incur about Rs 3,500 crore for this purpose, and this assistance would be directly credited into farmers’ accounts on behalf of sugar mills against cane price dues and subsequent balance, if any, would be credited to mill’s account,” an official statement said. The country could produce over 31 million tonnes of sugar this season, well above the expected domestic demand of about 26 million tonnes. “The subsidy amount is lower than last year but considering that the world sugar prices are higher as compared to what they were at the same period in the last season, the industry is confident to perform well again in 2020-21,” said Abinash Verma, the chief of Indian Sugar Mills Association. This subsidy will cover costs on account of marketing, handling, upgrading, costs of international and internal transport and freight charges on export of up to 60 lakh tonne of sugar limited or the maximum admissible export quota allocated to sugar mills for sugar season 2020-21. “This decision will benefit the five crore (50 million) sugarcane farmers and their dependents, as well as the five lakh (500,000) workers employed in the sugar mills and related ancillary activities,” Javadekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-farm-stir-cabinet-clears-3-5k-cr-sugar-export-subsidy/story-y7X7UuJ0Lqj4vF3lUSBynL.html
17-12-2020||Editorials||Kerala: The Left has an advantage | HT Editorial||The ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF)’s impressive showing in the Kerala local body elections and the disastrous performance of the United Democratic Front (UDF) led by the Congress sets the stage for the assembly polls in the state next year. The LDF has taken 516 gram panchayats to the UDF’s 374 and 10 district panchayats to the UDF’s four. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to make much headway, though it did notch up a few gains in the gram panchayats.Several factors worked to shore up the Pinarayi Vijayan government. Facing allegations of gold and drug smuggling, it kept the focus firmly on its handling of the 2018 floods and the Covid-19 pandemic. It stitched up an advantageous alliance with the Kerala Congress (Mani), a regionally powerful party which has considerable influence in the Christian heartland. The LDF has made major inroads into the UDF’s traditional votebanks, which suggests that the UDF’s negative brand of politics has not worked. The government gave local bodies a substantial role in both health and education which has paid off now. The Congress was not able to project any achievement and its ill-thought-out deal with the Jamaat-e-Islami’s Welfare Party of India gave the LDF a handle to accuse it of aligning with communal forces. While the BJP did not fare as well as it had hoped, it has been able to capitalise on the Sabrimala controversy to make some gains in areas where the issue got most traction. But this is nowhere enough to pose a real challenge a resurgent LDF in the Assembly elections. The biggest loser, however, is the Congress which seems unable to even defend what were once its strongholds in Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/kerala-the-left-has-an-advantage-ht-editorial/story-pvWHJlfNOMRm312zaSlh4H.html
