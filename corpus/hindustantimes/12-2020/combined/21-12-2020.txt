21-12-2020||News||How much India should invest in the Indo-Pacific||Recently, the office of the United States (US) Secretary of State issued a policy brief that was termed simply, “The Elements of the China Challenge”. The first page starkly spelled out the US goal — “in the face of the China challenge, the United States must secure freedom”. The urgent need to counter China, that President Donald Trump made central to his foreign policy positions, was outlined by his administration in different issue areas. But it was particularly outlined with respect to the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” or FOIP — a region widely considered to be the locus of great power competition in the 21st century. The concept of the “Indo-Pacific” has now been adopted as a fundamental part of US national security strategy. Subsequently, cooperation between America and its partners in the Indo-Pacific, and the development of the Quad (the US, Japan, Australia, and India) has been likened to everything, from a system as organised as a structured alliance (a possible Asian NATO) to a diplomatic treaty (“nascent pact”) to a vague international outlook (“shared vision”). In all of these imaginings, the US sees India’s participation as important for the success of an Indo-Pacific architecture. But what are the advantages and disadvantages for India in being a full participant in a re-imagined security, diplomatic, and economic architecture?In some ways, the advantages are obvious. The stability of the Indo-Pacific region is not just key to the security of the US but to the security of all countries that reside within the region. But, at the same time, there is a persistent threat of instability given the competing ambitions of two rising powers, China and India, and the hostile relationships of Asian nuclear powers. This makes the region a vital area of strategic interest for India. The countries that are considered to be the crucial pillars of the regional order — the Quad — are also all democracies. The incoming Joe Biden administration has made it clear that it sees an emerging partnership of democracies as crucial for establishing an alternative value system to that of China. And although Australia, Japan, and even India have downplayed the idea of any Indo-Pacific system as being exclusive, in other words, anti-China, the fact remains that containing China is an important glue holding together participating countries. Given the border clashes over the past few years, India needs the idea of an international rules-based order to ensure a FOIP, stymieing China’s activities, particularly in the maritime domain.But FOIP also brings thorny issues that India must navigate. The concept of the Indo-Pacific itself remains elusive. The Quad countries themselves are divided on it. Other than the Quad, ASEAN nations, who are crucial to the Indo-Pacific but have a back not front seat, are wary of the concept. Each country or bloc, thus, offers not only contradictory but sometimes even competing ideas about how they imagine the region. The US often talks of an Indo-Pacific strategy; Japan refers to FOIP; India talks about an Indo-Pacific framework; Australia simply uses the generic Indo-Pacific as a region descriptor; and ASEAN talks of an Indo-Pacific outlook. These differences are not simply about the nomenclature but go deeper. Geographically, Japan thinks of the Indo-Pacific as composed of two continents (Asia and Africa) and two oceans (Pacific and Indian). India talks about it as extending from the East Coast of Africa across the Indian Ocean, including parts of West Asia, to the Western and Southern Pacific. The US does not think of either Africa or West Asia as part of the Indo-Pacific. These differences are not simply about the nomenclature but go deeper. While the US is explicit about the Indo-Pacific containing China and particularly the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Japan and India have thus far eschewed declaring that it is centred on any open confrontation with China. Australia largely avoids direct discussions of how to deal with Chinese encroachment. And ASEAN, for its part, is more focused on obtaining better infrastructure, and is less concerned about China and the broader implications of BRI in the region while being constantly worried about creating an overt anti-China stance.These differences mean that there is currently no clear normative foundation on which a pan-regional architecture can be built. If FOIP is to be more than a security alliance, containing China cannot be the only raison d’etre. India’s position has itself has evolved on the Indo-Pacific. On one hand, in 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi explicitly noted, in a clear nod to China, that, “India does not see the Indo-Pacific as a strategy or as a club of limited members”. On the other, this year, India finally invited Australia to join the Malabar naval exercises, boosting Quad security cooperation, and exacerbating Chinese worries. At some point, India will have to jump off the fence and land on a side — and there are indications that this may be happening but hard choices lie ahead. This is particularly so because the idea of the Indo-Pacific is still evolving, and because President-elect Biden has already made it a clear priority. India will need to decide whether it will be a founding architect as the US hopes, or a more passive bystander in what could be one of the key framings of international order for decades to come.Manjari Chatterjee Miller is associate professor of international relations, Frederick S Pardee School of Global Studies, Boston University, and a research associate at the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies, University of OxfordThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-much-india-should-invest-in-the-indo-pacific/story-RTpV0XMBjBIO2p0oVW3D8O.html
21-12-2020||News||The equitable and efficient deployment of vaccines||As we together continue to strengthen all aspects of COVID-19 response, we must not only reinforce and build the capacity of immunisation systems, but also ready them to meet our next challenge — to equitably and efficiently deploy vaccines against Covid-19.Almost all countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region plan to procure a first tranche of vaccines from the WHO-supported COVAX Facility, the vaccine pillar of the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator. For the allocation framework to be effective, and for at least 2 billion doses to be delivered to all participating countries globally by the end of next year, immediate and sustained increases in international and global funding are required. Rapid advances in research and development on vaccines against Covid-19 have seen more than a handful of vaccines reach phase 3 trials, and some have already gone for emergency use authorisation, or are likely to do so very soon. Anticipation is building.As and when vaccines are found to be safe and effective, countries will need to activate detailed plans to efficiently deploy the initial tranches of Covid-19 vaccines to cover up to 20% of the most vulnerable of their population, and to carry out coordinated and equitable deployments thereafter. WHO will continue to provide member-States its full support to help finalise such plans, with a focus on several key areas.First, defining priority groups for vaccination. The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunisation has, in recent months, published critical guidance that considers priority groups for vaccination based on different epidemiologic settings and vaccine supply scenarios. Informed by the guidance, countries must make evidence-based, context-specific decisions, accounting for the risk-profile of different groups based on age, underlying health and comorbidities, and socio-demographic risks, among other factors. Across all settings, and whatever the supply scenario, it is imperative that frontline health personnel are provided first access.Second, enhancing service delivery, communication and vaccine demand. Across the region, countries must identify platforms to deliver vaccines to target populations, while also strengthening infection prevention and control protocols. But of increasingly urgent need is the development and roll-out of comprehensive plans to identify and train an adequate number of health workers and volunteers to administer the vaccine. Crucially, communities must continue to be engaged, listened to and provided high-quality, scientifically sound information, which will in turn drive vaccine demand.Third, strengthening vaccine cold chain and logistics. Even to reach an initial 20% coverage, countries may have to increase cold chain capacity, which will require additional resources. Logistics working groups will need clear terms of reference and standard operating procedures, not only to coordinate the deployment of vaccines, but also to source and deliver ancillary products. To address these and other challenges, WHO will continue to work with international and global partners to mobilise the financial, material and technical resources required.Complacency must not set in. Although vaccine manufacturing has already started, reaching sufficient availability will take time. In a crisis such as this, there are no silver bullets. Today, tomorrow, and for many more months to come, we must continue to implement the basic public health measures that we know work, and which have defined our “new normal”. Wash your hands. Wear a mask. Maintain physical distance and avoid the three Cs — crowded places, close-contact settings, and confined and enclosed spaces.Almost a year since Covid-19 emerged, we have cause for optimism. Countries in the region are to be commended for beginning immunisation planning as early as July, for carrying out vaccine readiness assessments, and for continuing to act in solidarity and with recognition that vaccines are a global public good. Now is the time to firm up and finalise such plans, for the equitable and efficient protection of vulnerable populations, and for the health and well-being of all.Poonam Khetrapal Singh is regional director, WHO South-East Asia RegionThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-equitable-and-efficient-deployment-of-vaccines/story-XCVyhR9GUvpxzve4QRrYSJ.html

21-12-2020||City||woman shot at point blank range||New Delhi: Delhi police have arrested a 23-year-old-man who had allegedly shot a woman at point-blank range, injuring her severely, after she turned down his marriage proposal on Friday in Mohan Garden near Dwarka. The woman was shot inside her house in front of her family members. Police said the man is married and has two children, and had been pestering the woman to marry him after they came in contact on social media, about ten months ago. Police have identified the arrested man as Karan Singh, a resident of Sonepat in Haryana who used to work as a financer. Police have also arrested one of his friends who had accompanied him when Singh shot at the woman. The associate was identified as 22-year-old Praveen Singh from Panipat, a school dropout who worked in a private company. Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said they received information at Mohan Garden police station on Friday reporting that a 23-year-old woman, who worked as a beautician at a parlour, had been shot at by two men who barged into her house and opened fire at her in front of the other family members. Meena said when a police team reached the spot they found that the woman had sustained one bullet injury in her abdomen and had been taken to a nearby private hospital. The woman’s family members told police that one of the men who tried to kill her was Karan Singh, who had been forcing her to marry him for long time. He had shot her at point-blank range but the woman had survived the bullet injury and is at present under treatment at the hospital, the DCP said. A case of attempt to murder was registered and search for Karan Singh was started. Meena said, as local enquiry revealed that the two men had come to the woman’s house on a bike, CCTV footages from the spot were checked to track the two-wheeler. “During investigation, we found that the bike used by the duo was stolen and had a fake number plate. Following hours of technical surveillance and local enquiry, our team got a tip off that Singh would come to Goyla Village area with his accomplice who was also involved in shooting. On this, a trap was laid and both of them were arrested on Saturday,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-shot-at-point-blank-range/story-61AFK8RW5iF0mkBu2WUdsM.html

Family members who could not figure out last night if they should go ahead with the wedding after their home was among six shanties gutted in a fire, were extended help from all quarters. Saris and silver ankletsA trader in Sector 20 turned up in the morning with saris, salwar kameez sets and silver anklets for the bride and bottles of water and beverages for the wedding. A retired deputy superintendent of Chandigarh police handed over a cheque of Rs 21,000 as shagun to her. The welfare arm of Allengers, a company making medical systems, donated Rs 1 lakh.“Till late last night we did not know whether the wedding could be organised, but help came from all quarters,” said Rahul, the bride’s brother-in-law, who runs a makeshift tea stall.Of the Rs 1 lakh contributed by Allengers Care Foundation, which works to uplift and support underprivileged sections of societies, Rs 50,000 was given in cash for wedding expenses and Rs 50,000 credited to Rupali’s account, Rahul added. “The trader and his wife who brought the saris wanted to ensure Rupali does not go empty handed to her new home. Retired deputy superintendent of Chandigarh police, Ashwani Kumar, handed over cheque of Rs 21,000 as shagun to her.” Mayor Raj Bala Malik and MC commissioner KK Yadav gave Rs 10,000 each to the bride while area councillor Shakti Prakash Devshali gifted Rs 5,000.No expenses for venueMalik also said that community centre charges would be waived for Rupali’s wedding. “It’s because of people’s blessings that my daughter could get married.

21-12-2020||Gurugram||Farmers protesting at Haryana border start relay hunger strike||Farmers camping on the Delhi-Jaipur national highway at Jaisinghpur Khera in protest against the new farm laws started a relay hunger strike on Monday in a step aimed at further intensifying the ongoing agitation.A group of 11 representatives from different farmer groups at the site are sitting on a 24-hour-long hunger strike to highlight their demands seeking a roll-back of the three new farm laws. Farmers from states such as Rajasthan, Haryana and Gujarat have been protesting at Jaisinghpura Khera (near Shahajahanpur) on the Delhi-Jaipur highway for the past nine days after the Rewari Police stopped them from proceeding towards Delhi. National vice president of All India Kisan Sabha and former CPI(M) MLA Amra Ram, who was among the 11 people on hunger strike, said that the relay hunger strike would continue till the government revokes the three laws. “The union of farmers has taken the decision of holding this relay hunger strike at every protest site. At every blockade, 11 people will be on a hunger strike for 24 hours. Today, 11 protestors including me started our fast that will be broken tomorrow, when the next set of 11 people start their fast,” said Ram. He said the agitation was intensifying with each passing day. “Our caravan of farmers is covering a stretch of over three kilometres now. We will not relent till the government takes back the laws,” said Ram. Addressing a press conference at the Haryana-Rajasthan border on Monday, farmer leaders criticised the BJP-led Central government for furthering the interests of corporates and prioritising foreign investments in agriculture. They said the new farm laws had put the lives and livelihood of nearly 70 crore people who survived on agriculture at stake. “The three new farm laws will remove government control from the farming market. Corporates and big businessmen will start free storage facilities and entice farmers into entering in contracts with them. This will increase the debt burden on the farmers and further weaken the food security,” stated the Samyukt Kisan Morcha through a statement.Sanjay Madhav, the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that with the movement intensifying, farmers will be skipping a meal on December 23. The day is celebrated as Kisan Diwas (farmers’ day) every year. Madhav said that farmers across the country were also planning to bang plates during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann ki Baat session scheduled on December 27. BJP Haryana spokesperson Raman Malik said that criticism of the laws being pro-corporate was flawed. “There are clauses to ensure that the farmers are not short-changed. Land of the farmers stays sacrosanct in every situation. Farmers are only liable to the advances that they receive, whereas a heavier liability rests with the corporates,” said Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-protesting-at-haryana-border-start-relay-hunger-strike/story-ZhwIFHMdmsnDVTGL8mgiWL.html
21-12-2020||City||Covid blues: Double whammy for Ludhiana kite traders as prices rise, sales dive||The ripples of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, coupled with the farmers’ agitation, are being felt in the city’s kites business as well. Even as kite flying is expected to pick up in Ludhiana in the run up to Lohri, the prices of kites and strings are noticing an uptick of 15-20%. Apart from low supply due to the pandemic, high transportation cost, as the transporters have to take a detour on their way from Uttar Pradesh to Punjab due to the farmers protest at Delhi borders, is also contributing to the price rise. This is double whammy for traders, as Gurpreet Singh, a shopkeeper in Daresi, explains: “While the demand for kites has anyway dropped due to financial constraints caused by the Covid outbreak, the higher prices will elicit an even poorer response ahead of Lohri.” According to traders dealing in kites, their stocks were supplied from Tulsipur and Rampur in Uttar Pradesh. But due to the farmers protesting at Delhi borders, transporters were forced to take alternative routes, which was making transport costlier and ultimately reflecting in the cost of kites.Bittu, a shopkeeper in Model Town market, says the demand for kites was at an all-time low. “As kite business is seasonal, we normally offer the products from December 1. But, this time we opened the shops in the mid of December. Yet, customers were few and far between,” he adds.Another shopkeeper in Daresi area, Gaurav says, “Even the supply of wood, used to make kites, has been hit. Bigger kites are manufactured in Punjab itself, but the wood used for them is not available nowadays. Any wood available is being supplied at higher rates, which is showing up as 15-20% spike in kite prices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-blues-double-whammy-for-ludhiana-kite-traders-as-prices-rise-sales-dive/story-CjxNj2sGvdEywpVqwN6UBL.html

21-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC rejects bail plea of developer jailed for not completing projects in Gurugram, Manesar||The Delhi high court dismissed the bail plea of Sunil Kumar Dahiya, ex-director and promoter of Vigneshwara Developers Pvt Ltd and Vigneshwara Developwell Pvt Ltd, stating that there is a danger of “flight risk” if he is released on bail and there is the likelihood of him “absconding”.Justice Suresh Kait, while rejecting the bail plea of Dahiya — an accused in four cases registered by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police for failure his to complete construction of projects in Gurugram and Manesar on account of financial constraints — said that the accused, being a rich and influential person, is also likely to tamper with the evidence.It also noted that both Dahiya’s father and brother have been declared proclaimed offenders (PO).“…there is a danger of flight risk, if the petitioner is released on bail, as his father and brother were declared proclaimed offenders and Section 174A of IPC was added against them. There is every likelihood of the petitioner (Dahiya) absconding, he, being a highly influential and rich person, also likely to tamper with the evidence once he is released on bail,” the court said in a judgment of December 14.Dahiya was arrested by the police on October 30, 2014, and has not been released on bail since. Charges are yet to be framed in the four FIRs against him. The cases were registered against him on the complaints of associations of homebuyers.Dahiya’s counsel, senior advocate N Hariharan, had contended that while construction of the Manesar project is at an advanced stage, construction in Gurugram could not commence since the zoning plan for the same was approved by the Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) only in August 2014, shortly before Dahiya was arrested in October 2014, when all operations came to a halt.He had contended that after his clients’ efforts, a scheme was approved by the company court for settlement. He said that while the scheme was approved by 80% of the homebuyers, the associations have been opposing this.However, the counsel for the complainants had said that the accused, in connivance with his accomplices, had allegedly hatched a fraudulent payment module and entered into sham agreements. They submitted that by way of those sham agreements, Dahiya parked the properties of the investors along with his accomplices, including his shell companies.They also said that he entered into a lease agreement, sale agreement and buyback agreement (in his favour) on the same date, concerning the same bartered property with different persons, further displaying the value of the bartered properties lesser than the actual market value. The counsels also said that the accused failed to allot the units to homebuyers.The complainants also said that while the project at Manesar is only 40-50% complete.The court, in a judgment on December 14, said that Dahiya had no intention in implementing the settlement scheme reached with the homebuyers as he did not appear before the division bench in the Company Court. The judge also said that he had not deposited Rs 2.60 crore, as per the settlement order passed in January this year.“Therefore, considering the conduct of the petitioner (Dahiya) of having the audacity to sell of the properties, while being behind the bars and under the custody of the authorities concerned, and properties were fraudulently bartered from the members of the complainants by showing them dream project which was nothing but a mirage. It is not unlikely that the petitioner would dispose of the unsold properties in a fraudulent manner upon being released on bail as in the past and leave the associations bereft of their rights to make good of the unsold properties,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-rejects-bail-plea-of-developer-jailed-for-not-completing-projects-in-gurugram-manesar/story-Sj5Z2MD6RvzxpokD0O3XII.html

21-12-2020||Noida||Luksar jail inmates to start quarterly magazine from January||Noida: A group of inmates have planned to launch a quarterly magazine from the Luksar jail premises from January. The 48-page magazine will be managed, edited, printed and circulated entirely from inside the campus by the inmates. They also shared the cover page of the magazine – Salakhon ki Siyahi – on Monday. There are about 2,800 under-trial and convicted inmates in the jail, out of which 50 persons will work on this magazine. “Some of the inmates are literate and they know basic reporting and editing skills. The jail administration conducts various activities for them from time to time, which need to be documented and communicated. The inmates will report for the magazine and edit and make pages. Initially we will publish 100 copies and will increase circulation depending on the feedback and demand,” said jail superintendent Vipin Mishra.Officials too will write articles for the magazine. Primarily, the magazine will be for the inmates and for the jail library, as well as for official purposes. Anand Kumar, director general of prisons, Uttar Pradesh, inspected the prison premises on Monday during a visit. He also inspected the community radio programme running from the jail. “The jail should be a correctional home and not a place for punishment. There is an effort to sensitise the inmates to leave a life of crime and lead a normal life once they are out. We are also imparting different skills to the inmates so that they become employable. In UP, inmates of various prisons made a total of 27 lakh masks for the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, which is appreciated,” he said in the jail’s radio programme.As of now, authorities at the Luksar prison have suspended meetings between inmates and their families due to the pandemic. The DG said that as the situation is returning to normalcy, the government may resume letting them meet each other from February-March, 2021.Love Kumar, additional commissioner of police (law and order), Gautam Budh Nagar was also present and appreciated the inmates’ efforts. On Monday, some NGO workers too visited the jail and provided woollen clothes to the inmates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/luksar-jail-inmates-to-start-quarterly-magazine-from-january/story-RvkhcueaApzJ7dDGH2i3NO.html
21-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s Covid positivity rate lowest in 6 months||The weekly Covid-19 positivity rate in Chandigarh has seen a sudden drop to 5.2%, which according to health department officials is the lowest in six months.Positivity rate is the number of people found positive among every 100 sampled, and points to the extent of infection spread among the population being tested. However, the rate is still more than double the national average of 2.3%, and puts Chandigarh among the top five States and Union Territories. Kerala tops positivity rate at 9%, followed by Ladakh (7.3%), Nagaland (7.2%), Goa (6.8%) and Chandigarh.In the recent weeks, there has also been a dip in the number of tests, though the drop in positive cases is much more significant.“The mobility of people has decreased, mostly due to the chilling temperature. Even the footfall of those coming to the city has decreased. Earlier, we used to test 200 to 300 people at important transit stations, such as the railway station and bus stand. Now the number has gone down,” said Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, director, Chandigarh health department.In absolute terms, too, infection spread has been curtailed with new cases being reported in the range of 60 to 80, she said, adding that the number of patients visiting outpatient departments has also decreased. “It reflects upon the testing levels, as most patients undergo voluntary testing,” she said, adding that positivity rate will drop further if people adhere to safety precautions. Meanwhile, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Twitter appealed to the citizens to take all precautions and commended doctors for the dip in positivity rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-covid-positivity-rate-lowest-in-6-months/story-jMWDBfYm1a0atjFxQBbrfI.html
21-12-2020||Noida||2020 saw 33% fewer vehicle registrations in Gautam Budh Nagar||Noida: There were fewer vehicle registries in Gautam Budh Nagar this year, as compared to last year. According to the transport department, about 60,000 vehicles were registered this year, as compared to 90,000 last year. Officials said the reason behind this is the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.AK Pandey, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO, administration), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the department 33% fewer vehicles than the previous year. “These include two-wheelers, four-wheelers, autos, goods carriers, etc. The department’s revenue also decreased from Rs 325 crore in 2019 to Rs 216 crore in 2020,” he said.The transport office was closed in April and May due to the lockdown. After restrictions eased, however, though owners have started registering their vehicles, fear of the pandemic and social distancing norms are keeping people away.There are around 7.34 lakh vehicles registered in Gautam Buddha Nagar. The district transport department has 4,50,159 two-wheelers, 2,11,853 four-wheelers (private), 2,210 two-wheelers (commercial), 14,392 cabs, 17,720 good carrier, 18,393 autos, 5,045 e-rickshaws, 3,206 buses, 1,332 school buses, 490 ambulances, 7,291 tractors and 2,730 other vehicles registered with it. Manish Shrivastava, general manager (sales), Ace Honda in Sector 11, said the pandemic did affect sales in the last few months. “We used to sell about 140 cars in a month before the pandemic. This has come down to 100 now. After Navratri got over, however, we did notice an uptick and more people are coming to buy cars,” he said. He added that as the demand has been less due to the pandemic, suppliers have also limited manufacturing accordingly.Explaining the process of registration, Shrivastava said that when a customer makes the payment to buy a vehicle, the dealer gets his/her details such as ID card, photo and other required documents and applies for registration at www.vahan.nic.in using the dealer’s log in. The form is filled, registration amount is paid online and a slip is printed. The dealer then sends the file to the ARTO, which verifies the application and allots a registration number to the vehicle. Since high security registration plates (HSRP) have been made mandatory, dealers apply for it on a separate portal and fix the HSRP on new vehicles. The entire process takes about a week’s time, he added.Anurag Kulshrestha, president of TRAX, an NGO working towards road safety, said that he sees a positive sign in this registration data. “I find that most academic institutions and offices have still not opened their premises to employees or students, and a significant number of people work from home these days. The district saw fewer registrations this time due to this, which is a good sign, as regular working conditions mean more registrations, resulting in more vehicles on road,” he said. He further said that 60,000 registrations despite the pandemic and lockdown also suggest, however, that instead of taking public transport, people are choosing to use private vehicles instead due to health concernsHe added that in the coming days, the number of registrations might increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/2020-saw-33-fewer-vehicle-registrations-in-gautam-budh-nagar/story-2Xo8aBvlIo4uHqcPxxA6vI.html
21-12-2020||City||Murdered Ludhiana farmer’s body recovered from canal, third accused nabbed||Ten days after a 42-year-old farmer from Tajpur Bet was allegedly murdered by his wife and her two accomplices, police arrested the third accused on Monday.The victim, Lakhvir Singh, was bludgeoned to death in his sleep and dumped in Neelon Canal on December 12. The body was recovered near Behlolpur, around 25km away from Neelon Canal Bridge, on Sunday.His wife, Gurpreet Kaur, and her accomplice, Gurdeep Singh of Kadian Kalan, are already in custody of police. The third accused to be arrested was identified as Gurpreet Singh of Hawaas village. The murder weapon and a muffler used to strangle the victim were also recovered.In his disclosure to the police, Gurpreet Singh said Gurdeep had promised to transfer some of Lakhvir’s properties to his name after his death. Therefore, he helped Gurdeep execute the murder.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 4) Rupinder Kaur Saran said Gurpreet Kaur and Gurdeep were arrested on December 18 and were since in police remand. Their interrogation led to the arrest of Gurpreet Singh. After dumping the victim’s body in Neelon Canal, Gurpeet Kaur had informed his relatives that her husband had gone to Delhi to take part in the farmers’ protest on December 12. But, finding her claims fishy, the victim’s uncle, Malkit Singh, of Durgi village, Doraha, had filed a police complaint.The three accused are facing a case under Sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-murdered-farmer-s-body-recovered-from-canal-third-accused-nabbed/story-cIB5Oh9WYwuR55YiuvlSuJ.html
21-12-2020||Chandigarh||Awareness first, no fine for now, says Chandigarh MC chief ahead of waste segregation launch||As the municipal corporation makes yet another attempt to start door-to-door collection of segregated waste in Chandigarh from Wednesday, it has decided not to impose any fine on defaulters for now.“We will not immediately start imposing fine on people for not segregating wet and dry waste. Initially, our aim is to involve them in the initiative and make them participate of their own volition,” said MC commissioner KK Yadav. “After some time, after assessing the situation and citizens’ participation level, we will decide on imposing fines.” The MC had fixed ₹200 fine for each violation in residential units. In commercial areas, it varies from ₹2,000 to ₹10,000, depending upon the category of the unit.As some resident bodies complained that they came to know about the MC’s plan only through media reports and there was no public notice, Yadav said: “Mass media campaign will start on radio and newspapers to spread awareness. Also, councillors and resident welfare associations will be involved in waste segregation at source.”The MC also plans to conduct workshops for garbage collectors. “Among other things, the distinction between dry and wet waste will be made clearer in these awareness campaigns and workshops,” said the MC chief. Earlier, in a letter to mayor Raj Bala Malik, Congress leader Devinder Singh Babla complained that residents were not aware about the garbage segregation plan and there had been no efforts made by the corporation too.Badnore to flag off new vehiclesAfter failing to make much headway in the past three years, the MC will start door-to-door collection of segregated waste in Sectors 1-30 on Wednesday. Other areas will be covered in a phased manner in the next couple of weeks. This time around, the MC will be using more than 490 twin-bin garbage collection vehicles. While it already has 100 such vehicles, it has purchased 390 more. Of these, 100 have already been received and will be flagged off by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Tuesday. These vehicles will then drive around the city creating awareness about the project. From January 1, the MC plans to cover remaining sectors and colonies, while the final phase will be launched in Manimajra on January 7. The new system will take off ahead of the upcoming Swachh Survekshan. The MC’s failure to implement it has been a key reason for the city faring poorly in the rankings in the past couple of years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/awareness-first-no-fine-for-now-says-chandigarh-mc-chief-ahead-of-waste-segregation-launch/story-X6eWrZOduhnUS9tSTt57UL.html
21-12-2020||Noida||Unlike upscale localities, densely populated clusters low on Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: The Covid-19 infection is more prevalent in Ghaziabad’s planned upscale localities than the densely populated clusters of the district, showed the data of the district health department. Experts and district officials have attributed the reason behind lower cases in the densely populated areas to “herd immunity” and enhanced surveillance.Even in December so far, posh areas of Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara, Raj Nagar and Shastri Nagar, among others, have reported more positive cases, while densely populated clusters like Khoda, Loni, Pasonda, Shaheed Nagar, Kaila Bhatta and Dasna have seen reduction in cases. Such localities have small houses which are closely constructed and also have a greater number of occupants as compared to the planned localities. As per the data, for instance, Khoda, which has a population of about 5-6 lakh, has recorded overall 359 Covid-19 cases since March to December 19. However, it received only 16 cases in December. Likewise, Kaila Bhatta, which is another densely populated area with an estimated population of about two lakhs, has 244 cases that include 10 in December. Shaheed Nagar has 34 overall cases with only one case in December so far. The highly populated area of Loni has only 32 cases in December against the overall 734 cases during the period from March to December 19. Dasna, on the other hand, has overall 1,078 cases with only 69 in December so far, showed the data. “The primary reason we can think of is about the precautions taken up by the local population and other measures like effective surveillance and testing taken up by the health department. In Khoda and Loni, we had earlier introduced our ‘sector scheme’ which also helped in controlling outbreak of infection. Otherwise, these areas are such that it would have become difficult for us to control the infection if it had spread,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Unlike the densely populated clusters, the spread of infection is high in upscale localities. Indirapuram recorded 3,209 positive cases, including 382 in first 19 days of December, while Vaishali witnessed 1,544 cases (187 in December). Similarly, Vasundhara has total of 1,528 cases (207 in December), Raj Nagar 2,014 cases (109 in December) and Shashtri Nagar has 2,831 cases (254 in December). Experts said that it is possible that people in densely populated clusters may have acquired “herd immunity”. “People in densely populated clusters, of course, have better immunity. It is also possible that they have acquired some sort of ‘herd immunity’ in which the infection may have come and passed on without giving them symptoms,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. The first sero survey which was conducted in 11 districts, including Ghaziabad, in early September indicated that about 22.1% of people whose blood samples were tested were found positive for prevalence of antibodies. Most of the samples in Ghaziabad were primarily collected from areas like Loni, Dasna, Muradnagar and other densely populated clusters, the health officials said. “Densely populated clusters had initially shown high incidence of cases, but over a period of time the cases have declined considerably. It is also due to efforts taken up with increased testing and surveillance. The sero surveillance comes into play in this regard and the prevalence of antibodies may even be high in some populated clusters. So, it may be possible that infection may have come and passed away without giving symptoms,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.“In villages too, we don’t have seen a spike in Covid cases,” Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/unlike-upscale-localities-densely-populated-clusters-low-on-covid-19-cases-in-ghaziabad/story-EMFBNKrwm9IjeQgF5qjTfJ.html

The plant will service Noida’s all 56 sectors and the compost so produced would be used in the city’s green belts and parks, officials said. The plant is expected to help the authority save at least ₹4 lakh a month on buying compost, the officials said, adding that it will also help reduce such waste reaching the overloaded landfill site.“The authority will use compost from this plant at all city parks, green belts and other green zones. We have directed the horticulture department to prepare a detailed roadmap to make use of compost produced by the plant,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority.According to the authority, it will collect two tonnes horticulture waste from 56 sectors and bring it to the Sector 8 plant, where four pits have been constructed. The pits -- each having dimension of 5 feet deep, 5 feet wide and 50 feet in length -- will produce 30kg of compost daily, the officials said. “As per the process, a shredder machine will cut the waste into small pieces and then we will put the same into pits. The waste is put in layers covered by cow dung and water. The process takes a month to produce compost. The cycle will continue to produce regular compost after a month when one cycle will be over,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty, Noida authority.The authority said that the compost that will be produced at the nursery will be adequate to meet the demands of the city parks. “The best part about this plant is that it will reduce the waste that goes to landfill. Besides, we will be able to make sure our parks are not littered with horticulture waste,” said Singh.The officials said that as of now one plant is adequate, and if need be in future then another plant will be made at any other location.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-starts-waste-to-compost-plant-to-get-rid-of-horticulture-waste/story-Ak2DV2F2ekHd6pPsSOjHZK.html

The accused was, however, acquitted of charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act as the victim was found to be adult when the incident took place, said the special public prosecutor. The man was pronounced guilty of rape despite his wife, the complainant in the case, turned hostile in the court. The incident took place on February 15, 2015, and an FIR was lodged against the accused under IPC Section 376(C) and POCSO act at Sector 24 police station in Noida. In the FIR, the victim’s mother, a domestic maid, said that she had gone to work. “I have two daughters aged 16 years and 9 years. My husband sent the younger daughter out on some pretext and locked the door and raped the elder daughter. Neighbours came to her rescue when the younger daughter informed them of her father’s wrongdoing,” the mother had said in the FIR.A charge sheet was filed against the accused on January 6, 2016. The accused claimed he was innocent and told the court that the victim was having an affair and he had warned her not to meet that person. Upset over this, she has lodged a false case against him, the man told the court.During the trial, the complainant turned hostile and said she had lodged a complaint against her husband for misbehaving and molestation, and not rape. But the victim confirmed her statement that she was raped by her father.“Additional District Judge Niranjan Kumar has held the accused guilty under IPC section 376 C and awarded seven years simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs 5,000. He was, however, acquitted of charges under POCSO act as the victim was found to be adult on the date of incident.

21-12-2020||City||Encroachments by Ludhiana MC staff, kin removed||Taking action against the permanent encroachments spread in around an acre of government land near Rose Garden, the municipal corporation (MC) on Monday demolished around 50 encroachments in the form of houses despite resistance by people. The land was encroached for over three decades by encroachers including MC’s class IV employees and their relatives among others. A heavy police force was deployed to avoid any untoward incident. Municipal town planner SS Bindra and assistant town planners (ATP) from all the four zones of the MC were present at the site. Though the encroachers raised a hue and cry over the sudden demolition which left them without a shelter in this biting cold, the MC officials said that notices were being served to them since last year.A resident Sunil said, “The MC did not serve any notice prior to the anti-encroachment drive and the last notice was served in 2019. As we are living here for over three decades, the civic body should have given us time to vacate the houses and arrange alternative accommodation. It is unfair on MC’s part that some houses have not been demolished as its owners have been given time to vacate.” Assistant town planner MS Bedi said, “There were around 60 houses and most of them have been demolished. Some encroachers had started demolishing the houses by themselves. If they fail to clear the land in a day or two, we will again conduct an anti-encroachment drive in the area. The MC has been serving to the encroachers in the past but they failed to vacate the land.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/encroachments-by-ludhiana-mc-staff-kin-removed/story-HoLpwpa9E8xtq5JaJ6yOFN.html
21-12-2020||Noida||City’s wetlands to see waterbird census in January||The Wetlands International (South Asia) and the forest department will begin the annual waterbird census across Noida’s wetlands in January, officials said. Wetlands International said they have already begun enlisting volunteers to cover the three major wetlands – Okhla Bird Sanctuary, Surajpur Wetland and Dhanauri Wetland. The Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) is an annual count of waterbirds in India and Australia in January. The count not only gives an idea of the birds at the wetland but also the health of the wetland -- a good numbers of waterbirds indicates that it has adequate feeding, resting, roosting and foraging spots.Also expected in the count are migratory birds that arrive from the cold central and north Asian countries by October, and fly back by March and April. The migratory birds expected to be found include the black-tailed godwit, common pochard, river tern, black-bellied tern, greater spotted eagle, spotted redshank and Eurasian curlew.“Migratory birds would have already arrived at the wetlands making it the right time for the census. Seven wetlands across Delhi-NCR will be covered between January 2 and 18, 2021. In Gautamm Buddh Nagar, we will begin with Surajpur on Janaury 2, followed by Dhanauri on January 5 and Okhla on January 17,” said TK Roy, ecologist and conservationist, AWC. Roy said that although the wetlands had healed from human impact during the lockdown following the Covid-19 outbreak, it deteriorated soon after the restrictions were lifted. “The picture after the relaxation has not been not very positive. Several wetlands, for example the Najafgarh Jheel in Delhi, suffered human activities like fishing. Also, the migration observed so far was slower this season across northern India. We have our fingers crossed,” said Roy. “We had cleaned the Okhla wetlands and made it more amenable for the birds. Let’s hope for a better turnout this year. We will provide logistic support and all possible help to Wetlands International,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, GB Nagar. The previous edition of the census at Surajpur wetland and Okhla Bird Sanctuary found a drop in the overall population of waterbirds and species diversities. It was also the first time that the census was held at the Dhanauri wetland, which is proposed to be declared a Ramsar site and Sarus sanctuary. The 2020 census recorded 2,092 birds from 39 species in Surajpur (In 2019, it was 3,034 birds from 42 species). At the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, the count was 8,776 birds from 62 species as against 12,212 birds of 63 species in 2019. Dhanauri had 6,227 waterbirds fromm 59 species.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/city-s-wetlands-to-see-waterbird-census-in-january/story-y7JVxQXxfTbZ7I9jv2o1BI.html

21-12-2020||Noida||Farmers supporting farm laws submits memorandum to Union agriculture minister||A five-member delegation of farmers from western Uttar Pradesh that supported the Centre’s new farm laws met Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday and submitted a memorandum of demands.The farmers, under the banner of the Hind Mazdoor Kisan Samiti (HMKS), arrived in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram on Sunday and held a rally in support of the new laws. They were going to go to Delhi, but their rally of around 300 tractor trolleys was stopped and the delegation was allowed to go instead. “We met the Union minister and extended our support to the government. We also handed over a memorandum of our demands in which we said that the new laws would end the exploitation by middlemen. We supported the continuation of the minimum support price (MSP), demande that it be hiked and that the farmer should have the right to sell their produce anywhere,” said Satish Kumar, secretary, HMKS The memorandum also said that under the contract farming law, the buyer’s right should be over produce and not the field. “We also submitted some of our issues pertaining to waiver of electricity bill, timely purchase of crop so that we can prepare for the next crop in time and also get our payments in time. We also submitted that cases against farmers for burning of stubble should be taken back,” Kumar said. The pro-farm law rally ended in Indirapuram on late Sunday night and farmers returned to their respective districts. On the other hand, the other group of farmers protesting at the UP Gate against the three farm laws continued their ongoing protest and also initiated a relay fast on Monday in which 11 farmers began a 24-hour fast. “They will complete their fast at 8am the next day, then another set of farmers will arrive and begin their fast. This will continue like that. We also urged all farmers to skip one meal on Kisan Diwas, which falls on December 23. This will strengthen our movement,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) who was part of the batch that began the relay-fast. Kisan Diwas, or National Farmers’ Day, marks the birth anniversary of farmer leader and fifth prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh. The BKU led by Rakesh Tikait at the UP Gate had been staging protest since November 28 along with farmers in large numbers who have arrived from Punjab, Uttarakhand and other parts of Uttar Pradesh. They have been demanding rollback of the three farm laws and a new law on MSP. The protesters at UP Gate are also gearing up to beat the winter chill and roped in dozens of tents and “Desi geysers” at the site. The tents, about 18, were erected on the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway which is blocked since December 3. Farmers said that the tents will provide them protection from winds and can accommodate 2-8 people. “The ‘Desi geysers’ are in form of metallic cylinder shape with one opening for pouring down cold water while the outlet will give warm water. In between we have opening for filling up coal or wood which will help heat up water. These have come from Jalandhar, Punjab,” said Shamsher Rana, national media co-ordinator of the Tikait led, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-supporting-farm-laws-submits-memorandum-to-union-agriculture-minister/story-LkMrCmchA8HIDjSAAJX1rI.html
21-12-2020||Noida||Annoyed with stoppage of tractor-trolleys in UP, farmers block Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway of NH-9||Ghaziabad: Farmers protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws on Monday briefly blocked an operational Delhi to Ghaziabad carriageway on the National Highway-9 at UP Gate to mark their unhappiness over allegations that their supporters were being stopped from reaching them.Rumours of police blocking farmers at district borders had been doing the rounds for a few days. The Ghaziabad district administration had then said they would speak to their counterparts on the matter and assured they had not stopped their supporters. On Monday, the Ghaziabad district officials were at it again, and managed to get the blockade lifted in 45 minutes.“The issue is that our supporters’ tractor-trolleys were stopped at Pilibhit and Rampur. We have told officials that our fight is with the Centre and not with the state governments of UP or Uttarakhand,” said Rakesh Tikait, leader and spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU’s) Tikait faction. “After assurance from officials that the matter would be looked into, we allowed traffic through.”Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said, “We have referred their issue to senior officers and the blockade of NH-9 was lifted. To cater to commuters, we had to divert the traffic through Kaushambi.”The protesters at UP-Gate are continuing with blockade of Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway since December 3 while the Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway is operational for normal traffic.However, in two previous instances, the protesters had blocked the Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway as well.The first instance was on December 8 during the “Bharat Bandh” call when the other side of the NH-9 was blocked from 11am to 3pm while a brief blockade was also made on December 14 when the farmers had given a call for protests at district headquarters.Meanwhile, Tikait on Monday also announced more measures to be taken up at the protest site which has presence of farmers from western UP, Punjab and Uttarakhand.“It has also been decided during the co-ordination committee meeting on Sunday that no loud music will be allowed at the site after midnight. Further, the relay-fast has also been started and farmers have been urged to skip one-time meal on ‘Kisan Diwas’ on December 23. I would also urge our volunteers to ensure that there is no nuisance created with the people of the press,” Tikait said during a briefing at UP-Gate.“The media persons are showing our protest continuously and we know that ‘kalam aur camera pe bandook ka pehra hai (pen and camera are under the scanner of guns)’. Still, they are doing their job and we must thank them. Every volunteer must ensure that no trouble-maker tries to create nuisance here,” he said.Sardar VM Singh, another farmer leader said on Monday morning that it was painful that the tractor-trolleys were getting stopped midway.“If the government wants to hold talks and resolve our pain, so they must not stop farmers and on the other hand they say that we are opening doors for talks. Such things cannot go together. People are coming from a lot of places and when people are coming peacefully, they must not be stopped. Otherwise they will stop there and will hold protest. Our farmer leaders will also meet corporates in Mumbai and urge them to speak to the government to resolve the issues of farmers who are on roads and help them in rollback of farm laws,” he told reporters at UP-Gate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/annoyed-with-stoppage-of-tractor-trolleys-in-up-farmers-block-delhi-ghaziabad-carriageway-of-nh-9/story-HyrHJRaQFpOyNFQQwOf4wM.html

21-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Over 600 farmers protest outside authority office, demand higher land compensation||Noida: A group of more than 600 local farmers whose lands were acquired for development protested in front of the Noida authority’s office in Sector 6 on Monday, seeking higher land compensation and residential plots.The group was led by the Bharatiya Kisan Parishad (BKP) which since February has been demanding a hiked land compensation of 64%, 10% residential plots (10% of total land acquired), and Abadi settlement, among others.“We have been demanding residential plots for a very long time with no appropriate response from the authority. Today’s protest was organized to demand for our enhanced compensation,” said Sukhveer Pahalwan, president, BKP.The farmers from about 80 villages blocked the busy Udyog Marg outside the authority office around noon after which diversions were placed on either side of the protest site for commuters. The traffic in the area remained affected till around 4pm when the group was finally dispersed, the police said.“We had information about their movement today. But they were supposed to gather at the Noida stadium and then march to the authority office. Police personnel were deployed at both the sites. But the famers started gathering simultaneously at both the points,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.Police officials said that the gathering was in violation of Covid-19 guidelines and section 144 that is imposed in the district. So, the farmers were detained by the Noida police and nearly 125 of them were brought to the Surajpur police lines from where they were released after two hours, the officials said.“The gathering was unlawful and we will register an FIR against them. We are trying to identify them,” said a senior police official.A case under section 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) was also registered against an unidentified man who tried to hurt a police man on duty with his car, the police said. Noida authority officials said that talks regarding the farmers’ concerns are already underway. “We had a meeting regarding these issues a few days back, and all progress updates are being shared with them,” said Ritu Maheshwari, CEO, Noida authority. Meanwhile, some members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu), who are camped at the Chilla border against the Centre’s new farm laws for the past three weeks, have gone on one-day hunger strike. “As decided by all organizations protesting against the new farm bills, 11 of our brothers will go on 24-hour hunger strike in different batches. We will continue to protest till the central government listens to our demands and takes appropriate action,” said Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president, BKU (Bhanu). The Noida-Delhi carriageway at the Chilla border has been closed since December 11 and the traffic continues to be rerouted via the DND flyway. Another faction of BKU is protesting at the Dalit Prerna Sthal and was on Monday joined by a large delegation of farmers from Bijnore. “Till the government does not take back the three farm laws, our farmer brothers from across the country will continue to join us to show their support,” said Dr SK Giri, national spokesperson, BKU (Lok Shakti).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-over-600-farmers-protest-outside-authority-office-demand-higher-land-compensation/story-QSVVJBlXD4T6BxejlzqZXO.html
21-12-2020||Gurugram||Health department seeks assistance from government agencies for Covid-19 vaccination||The district health department has sought assistance from eight government departments and agencies regarding the roll-out and implementation of Covid-19 vaccine, along with social mobilisation and awareness. From identification and management of Covid-19 session sites to providing volunteers who will be deployed as vaccination officers, departments have been asked to give their inputs. The timeline, however, has not been decided. The eight departments and agencies include Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) and departments of women and child development (WCD), district development and panchayat,Ayush, the police, education and information technology. A Covid-19 vaccine task force meeting was held earlier this week with district administration regarding the matter. Health officials cited that these government departments will be asked to provide inputs regarding the manpower needed only after the total number of session sites are finalised. “A letter has been written to all of these departments seeking their inputs,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. “The Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will be required in the identification, planning and logistics of the session sites in urban areas. Likewise, for the rural areas, district development and panchayat department has been roped in.”Singh added that the women and child development (WCD) department will be required in supportive supervision and monitoring of vaccination. “These departments will also be providing vaccinating officers 3 and 4 to look after the crowd management at session sites. Only Ayush department alongside the health department will provide vaccinators who will be authorised to give the vaccine injection,” said Singh. Notably, at every session site, there will be five vaccination officers including a vaccinator.On the other hand, the police department will provide the vaccinator officer 1, who will check the registration status of the beneficiary at the entry point of the session site. The information technology department will provide vaccinating officer 2, who will work on the Co-WIN platform for the verification of the documents and uploading the data base. Only registered beneficiaries will be inoculated in the first phase of vaccination that includes health care workers, front-line workers and people above 50 years of age. According to Singh, education department will be required in supporting management of vaccination session as it is likely that some of the session sites will include schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-seeks-assistance-from-government-agencies-for-covid-19-vaccination/story-BfrTVTqJujfNvm49cYVTyN.html
21-12-2020||Gurugram||No violations committed at Ghamroj bundh finds probe||A district-level committee, constituted last month by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to probe allegations of unlawful excavation of the Ghamroj bundh, has filed its report before the court stating that no violations were found in the matter. However, the committee has also observed that a portion of the bundh had been damaged and subsequently restored by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). This development follows on the heels of a public interest litigation filed by activist Prem Mohan Gaur, a resident of Hajjipur village on Sohna-Palwal Road, who frequents Ghamroj village and first noticed the bundh being excavated in August, to make space for a rest area that is part of the NHAI’s upcoming toll complex on NH-248A. The bundh is a traditional water harvesting structure that runs for two kilometres along Sohna Road in the revenue estate of Ghamroj village, aiding flood control and groundwater recharge.Gaur’s petition alleged that excavation of the bundh is in contradiction of Sohna’s Master Plan 2031, which states that the structure must be retained in its current state. Tampering with the structural integrity of the bundh — which arrests water run-off from Aravalli hills that skirt around the village — may also pose a risk of flooding in the region and negatively affect groundwater recharge in the area, environmentalists have warned. Taking cognisance of these concerns, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on November 9 constituted a district-level committee to look into the matter and submit a report. The committee, consisting of officials from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board(HSPCB), NHAI, department of town and country planning(DTCP), as well as the forest and irrigation departments, conducted a field inspection on December 7. “After joint inspection of the site, it is submitted that the Ghamroj bundh, where it was damaged by the NHAI, has been restored and that there is no violation on Ghamroj bundh as on today,” states the undated report — a copy of which was obtained by Hindustan Times on Monday. Shakti Singh, regional officer, HSPCB and nodal officer in the matter, said, “As per the NGT’s instructions, we have carried out a site survey and found that a portion of the bundh had indeed been breached. The irrigation department subsequently instructed the NHAI to restore the portion, and this has now been completed. The same has been conveyed to the NGT, who will decide on the further course of action.” Confirming these details, Vikas Mittal, the NHAI’s technical director overseeing the project, said that the NHAI has halted all work on the bundh land. “At present we are only filling up the portion behind the bundh, which is not a forest area but in fact a privately owned land acquired by us. The structure of the bundh has been restored and no further work will be carried out until the NGT is satisfied with the report.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/no-violations-committed-at-ghamroj-bundh-finds-probe/story-jSm4L8w6zFtJOgt7DsCaLM.html
21-12-2020||Gurugram||Over 25K flower saplings planted along expressway||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has planted over 25,000 flower saplings along the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway as part of a mission to make the city greener, officials said on Monday.The MCG, along with the residents’ welfare associations (RWA) of DLF Phase-2 and in collaboration with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), prepared more than 45 flower beds and planted more than 25,000 flower saplings on a 1,200 square metre portion of land between Cyber City and Iffco Chowk, opposite the expressway.The planting of saplings along the expressway is part of the MCG’s Green Gurugram Mission. Under this, the MCG is planning on planting more than 40 varieties of anti-pollution plants and flower saplings across the city. The Green Gurugram Mission commenced on November 29.Flowers such as ice plant, snapdragon, calendula, sweet William, dahlia, daisies, African daisies and flox were planted along the stretch. All saplings were sourced from MCG’s nurseries in sectors 15 and 46.On December 2, following a meeting with the NHAI, MCG and highways officials jointly decided to plant more than a million flower saplings between Iffco Chowk and Sirhaul toll along the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway to increase the city’s green cover and check air pollution.After covering this stretch, the MCG and NHAI will plant flowers between Iffco Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk in the next phase, said officials privy to the matter.“The entire plantation exercise took around seven days. First, the land was prepared for the plantation by clearing the green belt area next to the national highway. DLF officials also supported this initiative by providing horticulture-related staff to prepare the land and plant saplings. Plants were provided by the two MCG nurseries and by Sunday, the plantation in most areas was complete. The 1,200 square metre green belt areas are expected to bloom by the end of January and make the city both beautiful and help reduce localised air pollution,” said Dheeraj Kumar, joint commissioner, Swachh Bharat Mission, MCG.Kumar said that the DLF Phase-2 RWA also organised a camp for its residents, before the plantation drive, and distributed 25,000 saplings to them, free of cost.DLF Phase-2 RWA general secretary, CP Singh, said that this unique initiative of Mission Green Gurugram will bring positive vibes to the community. “We are facing huge challenges in environmental pollution. This project is a big step towards removing dust and cleaning the air around us. Residents of DLF Phase 2 and the RWA will jointly maintain these saplings and help the MCG in its Green Gurugram Mission,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/over-25k-flower-saplings-planted-along-expressway/story-RZMHP4Kc5S2nWmlJj0FkKK.html
21-12-2020||Gurugram||Man robbed of his car at gunpoint in Sector 102||Two unidentified men allegedly robbed a 34-year-old businessman of his car at gunpoint in Sector 102 after driving him around for over an hour on Sunday night. The police said the suspects approached the victim while he was standing outside his car and getting some construction material loaded on a truck. The police said the suspects took victim at the gunpoint and snatched his car keys. When he tried to raise an alarm they threatened to kill him. They drove the car towards Dwarka, said the police. According to the police, the incident took place around 8.30pm when the victim, a resident of Rohtak, was getting portable cabins loaded on a truck. He was standing nearly 100 metres away from the truck near his Creta SUV when two unidentified men came towards him after crossing the road. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that two of the suspects alighted from their car and walked up to the victim’s car. One of the suspects pointed a gun at the victim and asked him to hand over the keys. “When he objected, one of them pulled out a pistol and threatened him. One of the suspects then got behind the wheel of his car and drove towards Dwarka Expressway. The other suspect, who had parked car on the other side of the road, followed the victim’s car,” he said. Navin Kumar, the victim, called police control room and informed them about the incident. A team from Rajindra Park police station reached the spot and conducted investigation. The police said they are checking the footage from CCTV cameras in the area to identify the suspects. A case was registered under sections 392 (robbery), 379 B (punishment for snatching) , 34 (common intention ) of Indian Penal Code(IPC) and section 25/54/59 of The Arms Act at Rajindra Park police station on Monday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-robbed-of-his-car-at-gunpoint-in-sector-102/story-RrJpDG3k0q3dJ3OYHNyXAI.html
21-12-2020||Gurugram||Driving licence, birth and death certificates to be linked with Family ID card||A variety of government services, such as driving licence, vehicle registration and birth and death certificates, are likely to be linked with Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP) or Family Id card scheme from January next year, according to district administration officials. Those privy to the matter, however, said that it might take more than a month to link these services as the administration is yet to complete the verification of the existing database of families.Additional deputy commissioner Prashant Panwar, who is also the district nodal officer for PPP scheme, in a statement issued by the administration said, “From January 1, 2021, government services like driving licence, vehicle registration, certificates for birth, death, income and domicile will be linked with the PPP.” Earlier this month, the state administration linked marriage registration with Family ID. Linking birth, death and marriage records would mean automatic update of the family data, as per the government website. Besides, three government schemes, such as disability pension, old age allowance and widow pension, have also been linked with the ID. Under the scheme, an eight-digit ID will be provided to every family residing in Haryana. With the database of the families, automatic self-selection of beneficiaries will be done for receiving benefits under various schemes or services. “Various camps are being held at different locations to update and verify data. In Gurugram, more than three lakh people have already been linked under PPP. The process of data verification for internal use is currently underway. Over 4,000 people are getting registered under PPP every day,” Panwar said.Another official privy to the matter said that linking birth and death certificates with PPP would take another month as the verification of existing data base available with the government is yet to be completed. “The verification process is yet not over. Therefore, the process of linking schemes with PPP has been taking time. The plan was to link marriage, birth and death certificates with the PPP before moving on to driving licence and vehicle registration. To pace up the verification process, government departments have been told to circulate PPP forms.” The directorate of school education has already approached private schools and circulated Family Id card forms to parents. The process has been completed in case of government schools. Likewise, the food supply department has also been approached to verify data base of people registered under Public Distribution System. According to the Panwar’s statement, citizens have to submit Aadhaar number of every family member, a photocopy of the bank passbook and the voter card. “However, voter card is optional now. Those who are covered under any government scheme need to have the bank passbook. The permanent account number(PAN) is also optional,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/driving-licence-birth-and-death-certificates-to-be-linked-with-family-id-card/story-nAWJDncsPTNBu18Q4zFvrM.html
21-12-2020||Gurugram||Man held for killing wife, passing it off as suicide||A 30-year-old man was arrested two days after he allegedly killed his wife and tried to pass it off as suicide by hanging her body from a ceiling fan in their house in IMT Manesar on Sunday night, said the police. According to the police, they received a complaint from Ranjeet Kumar, brother of the deceased, on Sunday, levelling murder charges against his brother-in-law whose name also happens to be Ranjeet Kumar. According to the police, the husband hails from Madhepura in Bihar. The suspect works as a security guard in Sector 7 of IMT Manesar and had retuned from his village two months ago. The police said he had shifted to his home town during lockdown and returned with his wife in October. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, Gururgam Police, said that the brother received a call on Saturday that his sister had committed suicide and had been declared dead upon arrival in a private hospital in IMT Manesar. “The brother, who works in Chandigarh, boarded a bus for Gurugram within half-an-hour after hearing the news. When he reached the city, his brother-in-law requested him to cremate the body without waiting for the autopsy report,” he said. Boken said the family received the post-mortem report on Sunday and was shocked to know that Sudha Kumar was strangulated to death and later hanged from a ceiling fan. Dr Deepak Mathur, forensic expert, who conducted the autopsy, said that the cause of death was asphyxia following ante-mortem strangulation. “The deceased was strangulated and had marks on the neck. She was later hanged to pass it off as a suicide case,” he said. The police said the suspect had a strained relationship with his wife. She was found hanging in her house in Manesar and the suspect had claimed she committed suicide, said the police. However, the woman’s family alleged that she was murdered by the suspect after the investigating officer informed them of the post-mortem report. A case of murder was registered on the basis of a complaint lodged by the woman’s brother and an investigation launched, the police said. During questioning, the suspect allegedly admitted to have murdered his wife. He hanged her body from the ceiling fan to make it look like a suicide, police said. The police said the couple was married for five years and has a three-year-old daughter, who lives with her grandparents in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-held-for-killing-wife-passing-it-off-as-suicide/story-prv3xJ0e7cr8dmlPFrfhzO.html

Officials at the Ludhiana Central Jail had also complained that the health of inmates is deteriorating due to the presence of fly ash in the air. While we are working on the National Clean Air Programme to decrease air pollution, these dyeing unit owners continue to put the lives of residents at risk. Residents of these areas are unable to sit out or do any outdoor activity due to flying ash entering their nose and mouth,” said Talwar while adding that if the owners fail to take corrective steps, the PPCB officials will not let these units operate and it will be sealed.2-acre land for dumping ashTalwar said that they are working on a proposal to provide two acres of land to the dyeing industry for dumping flying ash coming out of the machinery near the main dump site of MC at Tajpur road.

21-12-2020||City||Didn’t let development derail despite economic stress, virus under control: Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur||Three years since he was unexpectedly catapulted to the top job in Himachal Pradesh, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, 55, is firmly in the saddle politically. But he faces the uphill task of keeping up a bevy of poll promises, made tougher by an unrelenting Covid-19 rampage that has battered the state’s economy, already weighed down by a surging debt burden of ₹56,000 crore. With his understated, hands-on style of governance, the BJP leader from Mandi, who enters his fourth year at the helm on December 27, has been quick to reset his priorities to blunt the opposition’s charge of below-par performance. In an exclusive in-person interview with Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak in Shimla on Sunday, Thakur exuded an air of quiet confidence in his ability to deal with the challenges ahead. Edited excerpts: Overall, it has been a satisfactory performance. The last one year, since March, has been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic which adversely impacted the state financially and also certain big projects that were in the pipeline. But we didn’t let the health emergency delay or derail initiatives that we had taken at the outset of our term. That has earned us goodwill. There is not a single major issue that the people hold against my government. Since its inception, Himachal Pradesh has seen two parties’ rule by rotation. Every five years, the new government used to begin its term with a spirit of revenge against the last regime by scrapping its decisions and registering cases against its leaders. This trend was going on for long. I put an end to the politics of vendetta. My conviction is that people elect us to work for them; not fix our political opponents. We also launched the Jan Manch scheme in which all ministers, along with officials, hear public grievances at a pre-decided venue on the first Thursday of every month. That provided on-the-spot redressal to people and reduces their footfall in government offices. On the social welfare front, our government reduced the limit for old age pension from 80 to 70 years and expanded the ambit of the Narendra Modi government’s Ayushman Bharat scheme that benefited 22 lakh of state’s 70 lakh population. For those left out, we introduced the Him Care scheme for free treatment. Similarly, as a state version of the Centre’s Ujjwala Scheme that covered 1.5 lakh families, we implemented Grahini Suvidha, covering another 2.86 lakh beneficiaries. Today, Himachal Pradesh is the only the state where each household has a cooking gas facility. During the global investors’ meet in November last year, memoranda of understanding (MoUs) worth ₹96,000 crore were signed. It was the first such initiative to make Himachal an investment destination. Within a month, ground breaking for a Rs 13,000-crore project was held. The Covid-19 crisis came as a setback to the process. Still, projects of Rs 9,000 crore are under implementation. As the pandemic subsides, plans are afoot for the groundbreaking of another ₹10,000-crore projects in two months. The virus has spiked in different states at different times. Here, the infection is peaking now. The spike in two months has coincided with the onset of winter and the wedding season. Indoor social gatherings are a big factor in the spread of infection. Up to 100 positive cases were reported after a wedding. There was casualness in adhering to the government-imposed caps on the number of attendees. So, we had to re-impose restrictions and tighten enforcement. The limit for social gatherings has been restricted to 50. Night curfew is in place in four worst-hit districts of Shimla, Kullu, Kangra and Mandi. As a result, the number of daily cases has dropped from 800 to 300. With 9,000 tests daily, our testing, despite being a small state, is much higher than others. Now that the wedding season is over, the case load has shown a sharp decline from 1,000 to 300 in the past week. We will review the night curfew on December 23. Except coronavirus, the opposition has no other issue. They feel it’s a godsend. Otherwise, they were issueless. This is not a manmade or government-made crisis. This should not be exploited politically. The government expected the opposition to behave responsibly and offer suggestions to deal with the crisis. Unfortunately, that has not happened. I’m amazed at their charge. This year, we had a 10-day monsoon session which, in my 24 years in the Vidhan Sabha, was never for more than five or six days. We had to call off the winter session as both Dharamshala and Shimla (the winter and summer capitals) are reeling under a spike in Covid cases. Also, there’s no constitutional obligation to hold the same. Our budget session, due by March 18, is round the corner. Most Congress leaders had privately conveyed to the government against holding the winter sittings. There is no question of running away from the debate. The blame lies on the Congress that has ruled the state for 50 of 70 years since Independence. When the crisis erupted, government hospitals had only 50 ventilators. Their number today is 700.The reality is that neither the world nor the country nor the state was prepared for such an unprecedented health emergency. Yet, even in a short span, we scaled up health infrastructure and set up four well-equipped makeshift hospitals. We have suffered an economic loss of at least Rs 30,000 crore. The state’s GSDP has shrunk by Rs 4,000 crore. The hardest hit is tourism that has been a big generator of employment and revenue. Industrial, agriculture and horticulture sectors were less impacted. Drug manufacturing at Baddi, one of Asia’s major pharma hubs, went on even during the lockdown. Apple and cherry crops got good market prices this season. Infrastructure projects suffered as the lockdown kept away labour from other states and the construction season got curtailed. The impact is definitely there. We have rejigged our funding priorities for ongoing projects. Implementation of some of them has been slowed but not stopped. We shall try and speed them up next year. Ours is perhaps the only state that has not slashed employee’s dearness allowance. There has been no cut in outlay for social welfare schemes. Rather, some of them have been supplemented. Our government had inherited an outstanding debt of Rs 47,000 crore. We had to borrow more in the last three months as the Centre relaxed the limit. The present debt burden now stands at Rs 56,110 crore. Himachal is one of the few states getting a monthly revenue deficit grant of ₹952 crore. We were expecting a big cut in that. Luckily, we have been spared that. Now, the Centre has given us ₹450 crore special assistance, which is interest-free for 40 years. That is a big relief. Also, there has been only a 10% cut in central taxes. We are pressing for external-aided projects. A Rs 1,892-crore tourism infrastructure project funded by Asian Development Bank is at an advanced stage but it has been on hold. There has also been a pause on the centrally funded national highway projects. We are expecting the finance commission’s green signal on state-specific projects. We are also taking up the setting up of a greenfield international airport at Mandi and expansion of airports at Shimla and Kangra. We have put a full stop on haphazard expansion in education and health sectors, which was the norm in the previous Congress government that opened 60 degree colleges a week before the assembly elections. Hundreds of schools and hospitals were announced and many had a budget provision of only Rs 1 lakh! Instead of numbers, we are focusing on infrastructure and staffing. I have filled up three cabinet vacancies after two-and-a-half years and refrained from making wholesale political appointments to public sector undertakings. The previous Congress regimes used to fill all that within a week of coming to power and spend lavishly. We have succeeded to a considerable extent. A vehicle is the basic necessity for the movement of elected representatives. We can’t tell them to take a horse or cycle in place of car. More than the government, it was an individual case. Soon after the scam surfaced, the government acted swiftly and arrested the health director, that too amid the pandemic. State party president Dr Rajeev Bindal resigned on moral grounds. Had he not done that; the opposition would have kept harping on the issue. That would have hurt us more. I stand for a zero tolerance on corruption. There is a limited scope for government jobs. In the agreements signed with private investors, there is a provision for preference to local work force. I feel there is no need to make it legally binding for private investors, particularly at the start of a project. It may not be practical. The need is to enforce the existing mechanism. To address unemployment, we are focusing on two fronts. One, promoting self-employment ventures under the Mukhyamantri Swavalamban Yojna that offers loans up to Rs 40 lakh with 25% subsidy. Second, we are pursuing big ticket investments, which have not happened at the scale we had planned due to the Covid situation. We have aggressively bid for one of the three bulk pharma hubs that the Centre will allocate to the states soon. That involves investment of Rs 10,000 crore and can be a game-changer on employment generation. With (Narendra) Modi ji, Amit Shah ji and Nadda ji around, this (factionalism) is a thing of the past. It’s over now. The party organisation is strong. Senior leaders do what the party assigns them. They support and guide us. To do better than what we have done in three years; specifically, in the delivery of social welfare schemes. I’m pushing for the international airport project, crucial to boost tourism. We have also set the target for fast-tracking the four-laning of the stretches from Kiratpur to Manali, Solan to Shimla and Mandi to Pathankot and Mandi to Matour. In politics, you have to be ready for every situation. You may get a big responsibility or a small one or no responsibility at all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/didn-t-let-development-derail-despite-economic-stress-virus-under-control-himachal-chief-minister-jai-ram-thakur/story-5daStRB7kUZl5YtdkQB8NI.html
21-12-2020||Kolkata||‘Is there secularism in India?’: Mamata Banerjee demands national holiday on Christmas||“Is there secularism in India? I am sorry to say that a typical politics of hatred is going on,” Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday evening, taking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) head-on in a veiled attack. Significantly, she made the statement while greeting Kolkata’s Christian community at the inauguration of the Christmas carnival at Allen Park on Park Street. The carnival will be held amid restrictions because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Why is Christmas not a national holiday? What harm have the Christians done? I made the same demand last year. The BJP government came and changed it… Some people can only divide the country. We celebrate Christmas as a public holiday in our state,” said the chief minister. “Don’t they have any respect for the sentiments of Christians?” she added. Banerjee’s remarks appeared to refer to the BJP government’s decision in 2014 — it came to power that year — to celebrate December 25 as “Good Governance Day”, a move that triggered widespread controversy amidst apprehensions that the holiday will be scrapped. To be sure, Christmas remains a public holiday as per the Centre’s list. “We all respect the Constitution but they have no respect for its values,” Banerjee said. Also read: DDC election results on Tuesday; counting to begin at 9 amReacting to Banerjee’s allegation, BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said, “It is she who violated secular values by declaring monthly stipend for the Imams of the state’s mosques. A person who makes political statements from administrative meetings everyday has no right to talk about the Constitution.” Reacting to the chief minister’s demand for Christmas to be declared a national holiday, political commentator and columnist Suvashis Maitra said, “Banerjee is right. But the actual meaning of secular governance is not encouraging any or all religions but to keep equal distance from them.” This was not the only attack she unleashed on the BJP on Monday, less than two days after Union home minister Amit Shah welcomed seven MLAs, a TMC Lok Sabha member and three more legislators from other parties into the BJP during his two-day tour of the state. Shah visited Visva Bharati, Bengal’s only Central university that was set up by Rabindranath Tagore in Birbhum district, and also led a massive BJP rally in the heart of Bolpur town on Sunday. Before attending the inauguration of the carnival, the chief minister, while addressing a press conference at the state secretariat, said, “I am going to Birbhum district on December 28 to hold an administrative meeting. On December 29 I will lead a rally that will highlight the culture associated with Rabindranath Tagore and people of the soil will take part in it.” The TMC alleged that people were ferried from several districts by the BJP to make Shah’s rally successful. TMC’s Birbhum district unit president Anubrata Mondal announced that Banerjee will lead a rally at the same spot but only locals will take part. After visiting Visva Bharati, Shah had said, “I am fortunate that I could visit Visva Bharati and pay homage to a great man who had spread India’s culture, philosophy, knowledge and literature around the globe. Both Mahatma Gandhi and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who represented the two main lines of nationalist thought at that time, drew inspiration from Tagore.” Asked for her reaction on Shah’s remarks, Banerjee said, “I have to research unionism, pluralism, racism and such issues. Now we are being told that Rabindranath was born in Santiniketan while the fact is that he was born at Jorasanko (in Kolkata). People like Rabindranath Tagore, Netaji Subhas Bose, Mahatma Gandhi, Vivekananda are hailed by people around the world because they held true world views,” said Banerjee. Banerjee also attacked the BJP for questioning the success of her government. “Our social security schemes are benefitting people right from their birth to death. Bengal is going ahead and some people are jealous,” she said at Allen Park. Talking on the same issue at the secretariat, she said, “You can call the BJP a party of cheats. They only spread garbage of lies. It is the Centre that declared Bengal topper in the country in rural road construction. And now the country’s home minister is dishing out lies prepared by his party’s workers. This does not suit you (Shah). Please crosscheck the facts before speaking,” said Banerjee. Also read: Maharashtra orders night curfew for 15 days, quarantine for travellers from abroadReferring to the data on the state’s non-performance that Shah quoted before the media on Sunday, she said, “I will give a specific reply to this tomorrow (Tuesday).” In the evening, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar also targeted the state government on various issues, ranging from law and order to non-implementation of the Centre’s social welfare schemes. “The nation is moving in one direction while this state is moving in another. This is a danger for democracy,” said Dhankhar. “I can’t understand from which point of view a representative of the nation’s government is called an “outsider”. People (doing it) should read the Constitution,” said Dhankhar, referring to the TMC’s latest strategy of branding the BJP’s central leaders as outsiders. Dhankhar also lashed out at the police and the administration, saying both were controlled by the ruling party. “It becomes a threat to democracy when the police and the administration start working for a political party. I recently visited Diamond Harbour and the governor was not even shown respect through a guard of honour. Is Diamond Harbour someone’s jagir (kingdom)? I have some sensitive information but I don’t want to create a controversy. I will treat Diamond Harbour as a test case. It is part of West Bengal,” said Dhankhar. Incidentally, BJP national president JP Nadda’s convoy was attacked in Diamond Harbour on December 10. Diamond Harbour is the Lok Sabha constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, the chief minister’s nephew. The TMC did not react to Dhankhar’s statements till 9 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/is-there-secularism-in-india-mamata-banerjee-demands-national-holiday-on-christmas/story-LmNnkcCQPc95v5HyGoRkXK.html
21-12-2020||City||Sixth schedule for Ladakh: Apex Body of People’s Movement to intensify campaign||The Apex Body of People’s Movement (ABPM) on Monday decided to reach out to opinion makers in Leh and Kargil districts to press for its demand of getting constitutional safeguards under the sixth schedule for Ladakh.Former BJP MP Thupstan Chhewang said, “Due to Covid-19 pandemic, the apex body could not initiate desired action but now we feel that the situation is improving. Therefore, we should expedite our campaign and bring all opinion makers from across Ladakh on board.” “We will start holding interactive sessions with all the stakeholders from Leh and Kargil districts,” he added. Chhewang said the pandemic also hampered a second meet of the apex body members with home minister Amit Shah. “We have again contacted the home minister on Monday and expect an invite soon to deliberate upon the issue,” he added. “After conferring UT status to Ladakh, constitutional safeguards under the sixth schedule are required and that is why the apex body was formed,” he said. Former BJP unit president of Ladakh and ex-minister Chering Dorjay said, “Soon after Leh hill council polls, home minister Amit Shah had invited a delegation of apex body. However, Thupstan Chhewang had contracted Covid-19 infection. Thereafter, the farmers’ agitation started and the meeting could not be held.” Dorjay said though the BJP has not backtracked from its promise of providing sixth schedule to Ladakh and that home minister Amit Shah was very positive about it, the local leadership appeared reluctant. “We are apprehensive because local leadership of the BJP in Ladakh, including Leh hill council, is not speaking anything about sixth schedule despite the fact that it was a top priority in their election manifesto,” he said. Dorjay also recalled how a delegation headed by Thupstan Chhewang had asked the Leh hill council to bring a resolution on sixth schedule but it remained reluctant. “Now, we expect an invite to meet the home minister in Delhi,” he added. The Apex Body of People’s Movement , an apolitical body, which has former BJP MP Thupstan Chhewang, Dorjay, Thiksay monastery head Rinpoche Nawang Chamba Stanzin and former minister Nawang Rigzin Jora, has been demanding constitutional safeguards under sixth schedule of the Constitution to Ladakh on lines of north-eastern states. The umbrella group includes political parties and religious organisations as well as all-powerful Leh-based Ladakh Buddhist Association. The safeguards also guarantee more teeth to the two hill development councils of Leh and Kargil with legislative powers. Thupstan Chhewang, the former BJP MP, had resigned from his post and primary membership of the party in November 2018 for not conferring UT status to Ladakh region and other promises made by the BJP in 2014 general elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sixth-schedule-for-ladakh-apex-body-of-people-s-movement-to-intensify-campaign/story-PaPopfElvKihWVjXKTAUiM.html

On April 4, 2016, all police personnel, including home guards, had taken a similar pledge not to consume liquor or allow its sale in the state. In 2019 also, the exercise was repeated on the CM’s directive. Even after this, there is no effect on Bihar policemen. Complaints against police personnel consuming liquor, their involvement in alcohol business is received regularly.Bihar police personnel had taken similar oaths in 2016, 2018 and 2019 to follow the prohibition.Policemen across the state gathered in uniform to take an oath on Monday morning - some at their police stations, others in big open grounds. In capital Patna, Bihar’s police chief SK Singhal administered the oath to several policemen.“I do solemnly swear I will never consume liquor in my lifetime. I shall be liable for stern action if I am ever found involved in any activity involving liquor,” read the oath.Also read: Maharashtra orders night curfew for 15 days, quarantine for travellers from abroadEver since the state went dry closely to five years back, several lakh litres of illicit liquor had been seized while 450 policemen, found either drunk or hand-in-glove with the liquor traders, were suspended. “Of them, 95 cops were dismissed from service after the prohibition law was amended and made quite stringent,” said a senior official in the state home department.In a bid to make the prohibition successful, chief minister Nitish Kumar has made the Station House Officer at each police station accountable for any illegal sale or consumption of liquor. “If liquor is found/seized in any area, be it for sale or consumption, the SHO of that particular station will be suspended and divested of the charge for the next ten years,” an official, adding that 23 police personnel were dismissed from service and pension amount of five retired police officials was deducted for their negligence in connection with the 2016 hooch tragedy in Gopalganj district.In 2020, Bihar police seized 26.91 lakh litres IMFL and country-made liquor while 48,187 people were arrested till November 2020.Earlier, the DGP had issued a letter to all IGs, DIGs, SSPs and the SPs. The CM had issued a directive to this effect during the review meeting on law and order in the state on December 9. The police headquarters has already sent the format of the oath message to the respective police districts, including rail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/for-the-fourth-time-bihar-policemen-take-oath-against-alcohol-consumption/story-zI8hPIQ7ngX4Fvulhj42YI.html
21-12-2020||Lucknow||Manish Sisodia to launch AAP’s ‘UP mission 2022’ in Lucknow on Tuesday||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia will be visiting Uttar Pradesh’s capital city, Lucknow, on Tuesday to officially launch the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) campaign for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. Sisodia will be the first high-profile AAP leader to visit the state after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in which AAP faced a drubbing in Uttar Pradesh.Ahead of Sisodia’s visit, AAP volunteers on Monday started posting pictures allegedly of dilapidated buildings of UP government schools with hashtag ‘Selfie with Sarkari School’ from across the state. Ever since Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced AAP’s decision to contest the UP assembly polls, there has been a war of words between AAP leaders and BJP ministers on the issue of Kejriwal model versus Yogi Adityanath’s “good governance”, with emphasis on government schools and healthcare sector. Brajesh Kumar Mishra, associate professor of political science, Jai Narayan PG Degree College, said, “The way the BJP government is reacting on the statements of AAP leaders, it points at a strategy to create another centre of opposition among non-BJP parties in Uttar Pradesh and confuse non-BJP voters.” Also read: Maharashtra orders night curfew for 15 days, quarantine for travellers from abroadThe BJP will be more than happy if AAP cuts into opposition’s vote bank, Mishra added. Before the 2022 assembly polls, the AAP will test its political prowess in Uttar Pradesh’s panchayat elections due in March next year. “With nothing to lose, AAP will resort to all sorts of ‘methods’ to gain public attention and remain in news,” said a political commentator not willing to be quoted. AAP’s UP Twitter handle has posted several pictures showing UP schools in poor condition. The tweets were also tagged to the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/manish-sisodia-to-launch-aap-s-up-mission-2022-in-lucknow-on-tuesday/story-VVO5Edf3lAO2sEuoIvfs9O.html
21-12-2020||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee to spend additional Rs 8,700 cr on development before assembly polls||The West Bengal government has increased its expenditure on social welfare and development schemes by an additional Rs 8,700 crore, chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced on Monday afternoon. “The government spent Rs 20,212 crore in 2020-21 on development expenditure apart from the beneficiary schemes. But after witnessing the demand for such schemes at the camps being held for the ‘duware sarkar’ (government at the doorstep) programme, we have decided to release an additional Rs 8,700 crore over the next one month,” Banerjee said at a press conference at the state secretariat. The money, she said, will be allocated to various departments, ranging from panchayat to health.In the last financial year, the total expenditure on beneficiary schemes was Rs 15,000 crore but in the current fiscal it has gone up to Rs 24,255 crore, she said.Banerjee said, “The ‘duware sarkar’ programme, which started on December 1, will continue till January 25. In all, 20,000 camps will be held in four phases. It’s a new model in India and the world.”“Senior bureaucrats, nodal officers and volunteers are working till midnight every day. Because of their hard work, 1.12 crore people have attended 11,056 camps till December 20. This is commendable,” said Banerjee.Also read: Maharashtra orders night curfew for 15 days, quarantine for travellers from abroad“This is a unique project. For example, out of 7.14 lakh applications we received for the Khadya Sathi (food security) programme, 3.18 lakh people have already been included. For the Swasthya Sathi (healthcare programme) 27.13 lakh applications out of 42 lakh applications have been approved,” said the chief minister. Similar work is being done to help people under schemes such as pension for farmers, pension for tribal people and stipend for the handicapped, girl students, sex workers, Anganwadi workers, folk artists and even members of the third gender and the LGBT community. “The volunteers working at these camps will be also given a tiffin allowance of Rs 5,000 each for two months, in addition to a certificate of recognition,” announced the chief minister. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was quick to react. “The chief minister’s announcement made it clear that she treats people only as vote bank. The TMC government does not have a human face. It works only for political benefits,” said Samik Bhattacharya, chief spokesperson of the BJP state unit. Bhattacharya also questioned the data dished out by the government, saying the statistics on the state’s healthcare scheme do not match with the ground reality one notices at hospitals. “The state’s debt burden now stands at almost Rs 4,90,000 crore. That is something the next government will have to face,” said Bhattacharya, “Duware sarkar will become a global model for its failure,” he quipped. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar too called a press conference and questioned the state government’s refusal to implement Central welfare schemes. “In spite of writing letters to the government asking why are farmers in Bengal being deprived of the annual sum of Rs 8,000 that the Centre gives, the government didn’t reply,” said Dhankhar.“After this, the chief minister wrote to the Union agriculture minister. I was shocked to read it. She wrote that this money should be given to the state government. Why should that be done when the beneficiaries are getting the money directly in their accounts across the country?” said Dhankhar. Incidentally, Banerjee said that on Monday she wrote another letter to the Union agriculture minister making the same request. “The state is the implementing authority for all Central schemes. We will give this money to farmers. Why should the BJP reap political benefits?” she told reporters at the secretariat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/mamata-banerjee-to-spend-additional-rs-8-700-cr-on-development-before-assembly-polls/story-p7Ou6d1eBVk9N0uHJhyTDN.html

The deceased’s father, who lives in Brahmapuri of Phillaur, told the police that his daughter got married in 2017 and had a two-year-old son.Lately, her in-laws had been harassing her to buy them a new car. On Sunday night, his daughter called him over the phone to complain that her husband and in-laws were torturing her for the car and would kill her, following which he had assured to pick her up on Monday morning.But the next day, his son-in-law called to inform her that his daughter had hanged herself to death.

Questioning the government for its failure, all these years, to place the entire facts and circumstances before the court, when the matter was being examined, JKPCC has asked as to why the government failed to bring those aspects before the court earlier.“The government was silent about the matter and the BJP leaders and ministers were misleading the public for elections but they have now gone into hibernation after names of several senior leaders of their party surfaced among beneficiaries,” Sharma said. The names of ruling party leaders didn’t make headlines but more skeletons from the cupboard shall appear, with passage of time, if in-depth and independent investigations are held into controversial land deals of senior BJP leaders, he added. Seeking stern action against all those who illegally manipulated the benefits under Roshni or any other laws, Sharma said, “The tirade against land encroachers and land grabbers must be vigorously pursued but those who are genuine people like small farmers, landless people and others should be taken care of,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-congress-questions-bjp-s-review-petition-on-roshni-land-scam/story-36rnXvRM5KMciAoRnGnbUK.html

An army of good Samaritans have taken it upon themselves to distribute blankets to fight the cold weather. ‘Robins’ from the Robin Hood Army, a volunteer-based zero funds organization distributed a total of 60 blankets on Sunday in Kondhwa and around 175 in Jejuri. “Today we had around 60 blankets to donate which came from two donors. This was just for the Kondhwa region. Today, we also had a successful drive in Jejuri, 65 kilometres from Pune, where we have given about 200 grocery kits and 175 blankets” said Umme Sutarwala, volunteer coordinator for the Wanowrie chapter, who has been with RHA for almost four years now. The organisation prefers to accept donations in kind rather than cash like ration, blankets, and their “happiness pack” which contains 12 kilograms of rice, five kilograms of dal, two kilograms of sugar, one kilogram of salt, and two litres of oil. This has been the updated plan of action. The basic motive of RHA was to serve hot fresh meals to people but because of Covid-19 they had to adapt as the demand for action was on the rise during the pandemic. “We have our regular drives every Sunday where we have food for around 150-200 people from various restaurants and donors. This weekend we had blankets since it is winter and not everyone can afford winter clothing,” added Sutarwala. The Robin Hood Army was started in 2014 by Harvard graduate Neel Ghose along with three other counterparts in New Delhi. In about six years, they have grown into an organization with over 75,000 robins working tirelessly in 200+ cities all over India and abroad. “As long as we have generous donors, money is not that big of an issue, especially in Pune. We keep getting calls from donors who want to give more. So it is not an issue. We do have to scout for donors to start with but once they are set up, it becomes smooth sailing.” explained Darshan Narang, a resident of Kondhwa, who has been volunteering with RHA for 3 years. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, the RHA volunteers were feeding hundreds on regular basis. The volunteers picked up surplus food from restaurants, caterings at weddings, and housewarming parties. “The major reason RHA can work so smoothly is there are no monetary donations involved. We have people who come of their own will and all our volunteers are extremely dedicated to make the globe hunger-free. Mixing in money in this system can attract people with ill-intentions and will corrupt the system put in place,” added Sutarwala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/army-of-robin-hoods-distribute-blankets-as-mercury-dips-in-pune/story-6APQDqu0o6PLv97ymD0miL.html
21-12-2020||Pune||Vikhe Patil students discover six preliminary asteroids||Two students from the Vikhe Patil Memorial School, Lohegaon, have claimed the discovery of six preliminary asteroids as part of a global campaign run by the Kalam Centre Asteroid Search Campaign, organised by the Kalam Centre, New Delhi, in association with International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC). The campaign was run from November 9 to December 3, 2020, as part of a Nasa citizen science project, conducted by Hardin Simmons University, USA. Under this programme IASC and the Kalam Centre, deployed a unique platform which gave selected participants an opportunity to discover near-Earth objects and main-belt asteroids. Participants were selected through a rigorous screening process and a worldwide event organised from November 9 to December 3. Only 22 participants were shortlisted and selected across the globe. These were later trained to analyse data and spot potential asteroids close to Earth. At the end of the campaign, these young minds discovered 27 preliminary asteroids. A total of 10 teams participated in the campaign. Arya Pulate and Sherya Wahgmare of Vikhe Patil, were from team SLV III, and discovered six preliminary asteroids. “Selected participants were provided highly specialised training in order to operate the advanced astronomical software, Astrometrica. This software is used to analyse images from the ‘Pan Starrs’ (The Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System) telescope, located in Hawaii, USA. It uses a 1.8 m (60 inch) telescope to survey the sky to look for asteroids, comets and near-Earth Objects (NEO).” said Ashok Vikhe Patil chairman of the Dr Vikhe Patil Foundation. Srijan Pal Singh, former advisor (Technology and Policy) to Dr Kalam and founder, Kalam Centre, congratulated the students and said, “These discoveries are crucial contributions in our knowledge of cosmos. Knowing the asteroids around and mapping them is an important element in our bid to understand and monitor these flying rocks around our planet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/vikhe-patil-students-discover-six-preliminary-asteroids/story-m6Tx3gK53ayInbD7abuSBP.html
21-12-2020||Pune||Two-year-old with 60 per cent burns discharged after rare recovery||In a rare case of total recovery, a 2-year-old baby boy who was 60 per cent burnt is saved successfully by doctors at a city hospital. The boy has now been discharged after 45 days of recovery with minor scars of plastic surgery which doctors believe would fade away as he grows. Aman Seth (name changed) accidentally dragged the hot water vessel over himself on October 12. When this incident happened at Aman’s home, his parents immediately brought him to Noble hospital. Under a critical condition, he was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). He had a severe burn totalling 60 per cent of his body area. Of the total 60 per cent burns, doctors said that Aman was suffering from a 20 per cent third-degree burn. The third-degree burn is a severe burn that often leads to the destruction of the entire skin. This burn goes to the innermost layer of the skin making the burn site look white. The child also faced severe water loss as most of the skin barrier was lost. This led to low blood pressure and reduced blood supply to major organs of the body. However, within the first few hours of admission into the PICU, the child was stabilised. Explaining the treatment process, Dr Abhishek Ghosh, a cosmetic surgeon from Noble hospital said, “In this, initially we cleaned the skin by removing foreign debris, infection, and other residual material. Collagen dressing which helps wound healing was done. For the third-degree burns, we performed tangential excision of the burnt skin followed by the skin grafting procedure. It is a surgical procedure that involves removing skin from one area of the body and transplanting it to any other area of the body. Once the patient was stable, we shifted the patient from PICU to the general ward.” Treating the young boy with a 20 per cent third-degree burns was a challenging task for doctors. Dr Shreegopal Bhandari, a paediatrician from Noble Hospital, said, “Around 60 per cent burns for small kids becomes an intense injury because the body surface area of kids is less when compared with adults. In the cases where a child is suffering from 60 per cent burn, the mortality is also very high. According to medical journals, the mortality rate in a child below five years, where there is a major component of third-degree burns is as high as 60 per cent. Keeping the infections away was a challenging task as a large area of the skin was lost and the skin is the major protective barrier against infection. These cases are very challenging from the anaesthesia point of view too and need highly skilled anaesthetics. We ensured that dressing is done properly and the child does not catch any infection.” After satisfactory wound healing, the child was discharged. Doctors mentioned that he would be able to live a normal life now. “We are happy that our child is completely recovered. When the accident happened, seeing the condition of our child we had lost all our hopes. But doctors counselled us and ensured that the child would recover. We followed all the instructions given by the doctors and we are so happy that our child is back to normal routine now,” said his parents. Dr Minakshi Nalbale- Bhosale, paediatric surgeon from Sassoon Hospital said, “Managing a young child with third-degree burns is a challenging task. Proper ICU care, optimal fluid resuscitation and infection control are critical in managing such cases, which are often associated with high morbidity and or mortality. Primary prevention of such injuries by parental education is the need of the hour. Children should always be kept away from sources of fire or hot water.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/two-year-old-with-60-per-cent-burns-discharged-after-rare-recovery/story-ADRvQjv9s8a9VKfW3Sow9M.html

21-12-2020||Pune||State govt extends hospital room price caps, private hospitals unhappy||The state government of Maharashtra has extended its notification to cap price on beds reserved for Covid-19 beds in private hospitals. The notification has been in place since May 21 wherein the state government had capped the prices for oxygen beds and ICU beds for Covid-19 patients across all private hospitals in the state. Keeping the view, the current pandemic situation still persistent in the state, the government has extended the notification up to February 2021. The notification issued on December 15 states that the state government is satisfied that Maharashtra is threatened with the spread of Covid-l9 epidemic already declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and accordingly in the exercise of the powers conferred as per the enabling provisions of various acts including the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, 2003 and the Maharashtra Essential service Maintenance (Amendment) Act, 2011 or MESMA. Since the state of Maharashtra is still grappling with Covid-l9 epidemic, the government of Maharashtra has decided to extend operations of the notification issued on May 21. The notification had priced the cap on hospital facilities including oxygen beds and ICU beds. Despite a fall in the number of Covid-19 cases, the state government’s extension on price capping is not fair, allege private hospitals. Dr Sanjay Patil, hospital board chairman, IMA said, “The private hospitals were facing a huge loss during the peak of the pandemic and the notification was in place only for three months. Now with this extension, private hospitals are not happy. This means that the losses would continue further. The number of Covid-19 patients has gone down but the maintenance cost due to Covid-19 remains the same. The sanitation and separate ICU beds mean that the staff needs to be separate and the entire infrastructure and manpower is divided which means more incurring cost but less profit. The government must allow private hospitals to charge as per their management decisions since people now have the choice to opt between government hospitals or private hospitals.” Dr H K Sale, executive director, Noble Hospitals said, “The non-Covid-19 patients are still not convinced to return for the non-emergency operations like hip or joint replacement surgeries. Extending price capping on Covid-19 beds means extending the losses which we have been incurring for months now.” Pune district has about 2,411 Covid-19 patients in hospital isolation of the 8,857 active Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-govt-extends-hospital-room-price-caps-private-hospitals-unhappy/story-y8VvZIByKlQ89DU0gPFglJ.html

21-12-2020||Pune||Planning is important for merging areas into PMC limits||Though the Congress party is part of the coalition ruling the state, the Maha Vikas Aghadi, the party is demanding a fool-proof plan for the 23 merged village’s development, along with financial support. Aba Bagul, Congress Party leader in the corporation, said, “The PMC’s financial condition is not a sound one.”“We cannot provide basic facilities to 11 merged villages even after three years. The state government should have a foolproof plan for the development of the 23 villages. They should give funds to acquire land for development. “Water is the major issue, so the government sanction an extra water quota for these villages. “Otherwise, 23 villages will turn into a congested Dhankawadi-like area,” he pointed out. Equal attention to the development of 23 villages Prithviraj Sutar, Shiv Sena party leader in the PMC, said, “The state government should have financial support and manpower to develop the 23 merged villages. “There should be a proper plan. Due to lack of development funds, we are not able to provide basic infrastructure to the 11 prior merged villages. We should not overlook the development of Pune city. “We should give equal attention and facilities to Pune city and the 23 merged villages.” He added, “The state of public amenities in 23 villages merged in 1997, including Kharadi, Ambegaon and Dhanori, has remained unsatisfactory even after all these years. Many of the localities don’t even have basic infrastructure.” Now, the NCP, which is part of MVA government, is taking it further. Political observers feel NCP is keen to merge these areas ahead of the 2022 civic elections, given that most of these parts are dominated by the NCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/planning-is-important-for-merging-areas-into-pmc-limits/story-6hMCxBAcerhxweeNI5DmcJ.html
21-12-2020||Pune||Planning, finance key to merger success for PMC||Part 1 - The Pune Municipal Corporation is now the largest corporation in Maharashtra in terms of area covered. The merger of 34 fringe areas, 23 of which were finalised this month, puts PMC in a tough spot in terms of ensuring sustainable development. In this four-part series, HT investigates who is to benefit from the merger and how; exposing challenges faced and revealing expectations of Pune’s new residentsThe state government’s nod for the merger of 23 areas (villages), surrounding Pune city, may have initiated the process of further expansion of the city’s limits. However, the decision may leave the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) with an additional burden in terms of resources, that the civic body may find hard to deal with; especially when it is grappling with a shortage of revenue in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The latest decision, after Urban Development minister Eknath Shinde cleared the merger proposal, is part of a 2014 notification issued by the state government, to merge 34 fringe areas into the PMC. Accordingly, the state facilitated the merger of 11 areas into the PMC on October 27, 2017. The decision was taken after a court intervention. A citizen’s action committee approached the high court over a delay, to which the government said the 23 areas will be included within the PMC by October 2020. While citizens from most of these areas want to be part of the PMC, fast becoming a “smart city” under the Centre’s scheme, the civic body is expressing concern over a lack funds. Mahesh Pathak, principal secretary, Urban Development, Maharashtra, said that “not much budget has been provided” to the PMC despite the go ahead for the merger. Despite repeated phone calls and text messages, Pathak gave that brief response via SMS. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “The corporation has already many problems we have to concentrate on. The State government has asked the corporation to submit a response on what will happen after the merger of the 23 villages. We have already sent our response to the state government.” While Kumar was not specific about the contents of the response, other civic officials say the decision may put a burden on the PMC, already grappling with lack of basic amenities in the 11 areas merged in 2017. In 2017, the PMC had estimated it would require ₹5,741 crore for the development of the 34 areas, including the 11 have already been merged. The civic body officials say the estimate has now increased to ₹9,000 crore as of 2020. Sanjeev Kumar Patil, Wagholi Housing Societies Association (WHSA) said, “Wagholi is the highest populated village of the 23 merged. Wagholi population has expanded rapidly with large real estate projects coming up in this eastern suburb of the city. “Despite being located on the highway, the area lacks basic amenities like road, water, garbage disposal, and drainage. “The local body has failed to provide facilities to citizens. We want accountability and responsibility from government machinery,” said Patil. Sonali Kulkarni, another resident from Sus, a suburb on the west, said, the area has large projects where people working in IT firms live. “However, Sus does not even have proper drainage or tar roads, which makes vastlt inferior to neighbouring Hinjewadi, where the roads are much better. At least Sus’ inclusion in the PMC will facilitate its development,” said Kulkarni, an IT engineer. Girish Bapat, BJP’s member ofparliament (MP) from Pune, who was guardian minister during the Fadnavis government era, submitted an affidavit in court, which stated: “ State government should give funds so that PMC can make time bound program for the development of 23 merged villages. In these villages, there is less revenue generation and more expenditure. It will adversely affect existing city’s development. Government should give grants to five years in instalments to the development of these villages.” Expansion of Pune city After the merger of these 23 areas, Pune will emerge as one of the biggest municipal corporations in Maharashtra, covering an area of 516.18 sqkm kms, which is more than the Mumbai municipal corporation’s 437.71 sq km. There is an addition of 2.78 lakh of population to the existing 35 lakh population of Pune city, as per the 2011 census. Over the last 23 years, Pune has expanded thrice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/planning-finance-key-to-merger-success-for-pmc/story-YuhBDRcvytEvOrpwLFun8I.html
21-12-2020||Pune||‘PMC has asked state for funds to devp villages at time of merger announcement’||Twenty-three villages will now be merged into the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. Already, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the civic body is facing a financial crunch. How will it go about providing infrastructure to these new areas?It was decided three years ago, that 34 villages would be merged into the city. Eleven villages came earlier, and now 23 more will be merged. It is true that we would require huge investment in these areas to create basic infrastructure like roads, water lines, sewage, and electricity, in the first stage. Later, we would need to provide basic amenities like health facilities, gardens and playgrounds. We have requested the state government, at the time of approving the merger, to provide the PMC with funds.Villages which were merged earlier, still do not have enough infrastructure? In this scenario, what will be the impact on the development of these new villages being merged into the PMC?We have requested the state government to assign funds to the PMC at the time of the meger. It is true, infrastructure lags the development plans. We are trying to improve the infrastructure in these periphery areas. The budget, will allocate funds to each area.The 24x 7 water scheme is being implemented in the city. Complaints have come in, across party lines, that it’s going on at a snail’s pace?It is true that the work is behind schedule… due to various reasons. The administration’s whole focus was on the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a completely different challenge. Despite the pandemic, the administration ensured that other development works have not been affected. Some works are behind scheduled but have not stopped.The 24x7 project has currently seen the city being dug-up for laying of cables and ducts for other service lines. The contractor has not erected ducts anywhere.It is true that the water pipeline laying work is without ducts. We are discussing why this has happened. There are some technical problems with ducts along with the water pipeline. But, the administration is looking at how to move ahead.What is the vaccination plan for the Covid-19 vaccine?Central and state governments are planning the vaccinations. PMC will be prepared for the a vaccination drive. The PMC health department has already drawn up a list of medical practitioners and front-line warriors to get vaccinated in the first stage. Training is on for medical practitioners about the vaccination programme. Once the detailed guidelines came from the government, we will follow it.The city has faced a series of health crises in the recent past - swine flu, dengue, and now Covid-19. Are we pro-actively prepared to handle such situations?Covid-19 has given us many lessons. The PMC is preparing a new health policy which would address short-term, as well as long-term solutions. It is in the pipeline so cannot share details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-has-asked-state-for-funds-to-devp-villages-at-time-of-merger-announcement/story-WfmO8yfq1wjOAkLRpEemUP.html
21-12-2020||Pune||New proposal for Purandar airport likely to be submitted by Jan-end: Sanjay Jagtap||The civic administration is working to submit a detailed proposal for the new site for the Purandar international airport and by January 2021, it is likely to be submitted to the Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.Recently, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and local MLA Sanjay Jagtap met the defence minister regarding the Purandar airport and suggested a new site for the airport. Jagtap said, “With the defence authorities involved in the project, they are conducting various studies for it. Soon, a proposal will be submitted to the defence minister. However, since various agencies are involved and studies are going on, I would not able to disclose details about the new site. The new site is in Purandar taluka and by January end, everything about the project will be clear.”Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh, said, “As instructed by the central government, Maharashtra Airport Development Company is preparing a report for same. They will submit it to the government. I am not aware if it has been submitted or not.”On December 8, Pawar met the defence minister and tweeted, “Met defence minister Rajnath Singh, defence secretary and civil aviation secretary in New Delhi to discuss the proposed international airport at Purandar. Maharashtra government has proposed to set up a new international airport in order to reduce the heavy air traffic load at Pune international airport. I insisted on the need to expedite the work of the airport.”Besides Jagtap and former Air chief marshal (Retd) Bhushan Gokhale were also present for this meeting on Tuesday.Jagtap, who was present for the meeting, said, “Defence minister instructed the administration to submit the comparative studies for both the existing site and the proposed site. As directed by the minister, authorities are working on it.”BackgroundThe existing site for the airport had been chosen in 2016 by the then Devendra Fadnavis government as the previously selected area in Khed tehsil of Pune district received opposition from locals. After shifting the site to Purandar, the Fadnavis government expedited the process for all necessary approvals and the state government, the Centre, defence and environment ministry issued permissions. However, with new site being considered, state government will have to seek permissions from the air force, civil aviation and environment ministry, which may consume further time. As per the existing plan, 2,832 hectares of land has been reserved for the Purandar airport, which would be named as the Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje Pune International Airport. A total of seven villages were getting affected due to existing site and farmers from these villages Pargaon, Rajewadi, Munjewadi, Vanpuri, Kumbalvalan, Ekhatpur and Udachi Wadi were opposing the land acquisition process.Total land acquisition cost is expected to be Rs4000 crore for the existing site.

21-12-2020||Pune||To increase goat, sheep meat production, state launches scheme||The state government has launched the Balasaheb Thackeray agribusiness and rural transformation project to increase the number of goat and sheep with lower income groups. The department has launched the scheme in order to provide poor people in rural areas an opportunity to get income as meat from goat and sheep are high in demand and their prices are sky rocketing across Maharashtra.There is constant demand for goat and sheep meat in Maharashtra and all over India, and hence, the price of goat meat reached Rs600 to Rs700 per kg recently. The meat prices remain constant and are not prone to much fluctuation like poultry or any other agricultural product.Additional commissioner of animal husbandry department DD Parkale, said, “Our department has launched the Balasaheb Thackeray agribusiness and rural transformation project to increase goat and sheep numbers. Main intention behind the scheme is to provide assured income for the rural lower income group people.”Parkale said, “There is constant demand for goat and sheep meat and the prices remain steady all over the year. Considering this, the department decided to increase sheep and goat numbers with lower income groups. State and region level committees have been formed for it. Animal husbandry department will provide all the support to the farmers and goat producers. We are even forming farmers’ produce companies which would tie up with buyers. It will help conduct business directly with buyers.”Vijay Kamble, president of mutton association from Kolhapur, said, “Demand for mutton remains constant. We are facing the problem of goat produce. Sometimes we even procure goats from other states. If the production is increased, it will help keep the prices constant, otherwise mutton prices would increase in the future.”Ahilya Devi, a mutton shop owner from Pune, said, “Demand for mutton will increase in the future as there is shortage of goats every year. We need to travel up to 100kms every week to procure goats.”Chance at revenue- Goat meat price -Rs600 to Rs700 per kg in most of the cities. Maharashtra ranks second in goat meat production after West Bengal.

21-12-2020||Delhi||Suspend air travel from UK: Arvind Kejriwal urges Centre over new Covid-19 strain||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has urged the central government to immediately ban all flights from the United Kingdom after a new strain of the coronavirus was detected and which has been spreading rapidly in the country. “New mutation of corona virus has emerged in UK, which is a super-spreader. I urge central govt to ban all flights from UK immediately,“ Kejriwal said in a tweet.While the Centre is yet to announce any travel ban or suspension of flights between India and UK, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan assured that the government is alert and there is no need for panic about the discovery of the new strain of coronavirus, news agency ANI reported. The health ministry’s Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) convened an urgent meeting on Monday to discuss the issue.Travel ban from England is being implemented by many countries across the world and also being mulled upon by many others following the detection of the new mutation of the coronavirus. The BBC reported that European nations including Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium have started implementing a travel ban from the UK.While British health officials and prime minister Boris Johnson have said that there is no sufficient evidence to suggest that the new strain is more deadly, the new variant has transmitted more rapidly. Following this rapid spread, a new layer of tier 4 restrictions have been announced in the UK and also leeway given for Christmas celebrations have been scrapped. Also, the officials said that there is no sufficient evidence to suggest that the new strain of the virus would impact the efficiency of vaccines being administered currently for Covid-19.The Covid-19 vaccination program has been ongoing for almost two weeks now with close to 400 vaccination centres operating in the UK. The UK is currently reviewing Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine for which it has placed a pre-order of 7 million doses.In addition to the European nations, other countries including Canada, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have also announced the suspension of air travel to the UK to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus variant in their countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/suspend-air-travel-from-uk-arvind-kejriwal-urges-centre-over-new-covid-19-strain/story-tHcz1GJKbxlOcU4i6atC0N.html
21-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal asks for ban on flights from UK ahead of Centre’s meeting on new coronavirus strain||With the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) finally under control in Delhi after the surge in cases in November, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged the central government to ban flights from the United Kingdom where a new, infectious strain of the virus has been detected. “New mutation of corona virus has emerged in UK, which is a super-spreader. I urge central govt to ban all flights from UK immediately,” tweeted Kejriwal. The new strain of the virus—which accounts for one-third of the current cases in London—is believed to be 70% more infectious that the other strains in circulation. The United Kingdom announced a surprise lockdown in London and other parts of the country amid the surge in cases due to the new strain of the virus. Also Read: Govt is alert, no need to panic: Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on new strain of coronavirus in UKThe new strain of the virus was first detected in September and has been shown to increase the spread of the disease in labs. So far, there is no evidence to suggest that it leads to more deaths. “The government is alert, there is no need to panic,” said union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan. The union health ministry has called an urgent meeting of the joint monitoring group on Monday to discuss the particular strain. The new strain has a mutation in a very important part of the virus—the receptor binding domain on the spike protein. This is the part of the virus that first comes in contact with human cells and helps the virus enter the body. The strain is also being monitored closely by scientists as the vaccines that have been approved or are under development target the spike protein of the virus. However, experts believe that the vaccines will be effective against the virus for now. “If we let it add more mutations, then you start worrying. This virus is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape, it has taken the first couple of steps towards that,” Prof Ravi Gupta from the University of Cambridge told BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cm-kejriwal-asks-for-ban-on-flights-from-uk-ahead-of-centre-s-meeting-on-new-coronavirus-strain/story-jwgBAgZSs54Vz0TyII4KsI.html
21-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra farmers to start their vehicle march to Delhi from Nashik today||Over 5,000 farmers from Maharashtra will kickstart a vehicle march from Nashik to Delhi at 3.00pm on Monday, to join the farmers protesting at the borders of the national capital since the past three weeks. All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) will flag off the March with a public meeting in Nashik at 1.30pm. Farmers from 20 districts of the state will gather at Nashik and travel 1,266 kilometres to Delhi and join the protests at the Rajasthan-Haryana border on December 24. Ashok Dhawale, president, AIKS, said in the statement, “The vehicle jatha will begin with a massive public meeting at Nashik at 1.30pm. About 5,000 farmers will join this meeting and participate in the vehicle march. Most of them will accompany us till the Maharashtra border. Thereafter, 2,000 or so farmers will continue to travel to Delhi.” The vehicle march will be met by farmers at Ozar, Pimpalgaon Baswant, Chandwad, Umrane, Malegaon, and Shirpur and Dhule districts of Maharashtra before entering Madhya Pradesh.Also Read: Govt asks farmers to come for talks, spell out objectionsThe purpose of organising this march is to counter the government’s argument that only farmers from Punjab and Haryana are affected by the three laws, and that this is not a pan-India protest. Dhawale said, “The government is running a propaganda that whatever is happening in Delhi is only because of farmers from Punjab and Haryana. When thousands of farmers from Maharashtra will travel around 1,300 kilometres to participate in the protest, it will effectively counter the government’s argument.” The massive farmers’ protest was set off by the three farm laws pushed through Parliament by the government in September. These allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules. Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business, gut the mandi system and gradually end the regime of minimum support prices (MSP) that acts as a protective net for cultivators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-farmers-to-start-their-vehicle-march-to-delhi-from-nashik-today/story-ppk0a1YniTxDe5bJCKg9WM.html
21-12-2020||Mumbai||BJP using the Ram temple public donation drive as part of 2024 election campaign, alleges Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena has alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to use the public donation drive for the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya to fund its campaign for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. In an editorial in Saamna, the mouthpiece of the Sena, it alleged that the decision of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust to depute 400,000 volunteers to meet 1,200,000 families across the country for collecting donations had political overtones. “This is just a campaign in the name of Ram temple. It is time for political parties to stop using the Ram temple issue and focus on developmental issues,” said the editorial. It called such a political campaign disrespectful to those who laid their lives for the creation of Ram temple. “Who are these volunteers who will collect money? Who has appointed them?” questioned the editorial. Also Read: Ram temple fund drive to start with contributions from prominent personalities: Trust officialThe editorial questioned the very concept of public donation for the construction of the temple. “Lord Ram was the king of Ayodhya and we have all fought a war for the construction of his temple. This involves the pride of India. People have sacrificed their lives for this campaign. Hindus across the world have donated generously for this construction. Then what is the purpose of this donation drive?” questioned the editorial. The Shiv Sena has already donated Rs1 crore for the construction of the temple. This announcement comes on the heels of the decision of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust to not use government money and construct the temple using donations from the followers of Lord Ram. This campaign will take place from January 15 till February 27. The BJP, however, has derided the Sena for its opposition to public donation. “Those who believe in extorting will never be able to understand the concept of public donation. This money is for Ram Mandir which is a national monument and not for someone’s private property. Hence it will be constructed by public money and not by extortion,” said a BJP press release. It said that Sena’s assertion that it was time to delink Ram temple from the political agenda was understandable as it had turned secular for power. It also taunted the Shiv Sena saying that it was ironic that the party which was creating obstacles in development was talking of developmental politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-using-the-ram-temple-public-donation-drive-as-part-of-2024-election-campaign-alleges-shiv-sena/story-XKzxAu0DH0TcrtIsuZ4adK.html

Thousands of farmers have taken to the streets leading up to the national capital from several states, especially Punjab. The protesting farmers have made it clear that they were not willing to accept anything other than a complete rollback of all the three laws. The Centre, however, has proposed amendments to the laws, all of which have been rejected after discussions between the representatives of both parties.The sets of representatives have discussed possible future courses of action a number of times but all have resulted in a stalemate. The contentious farm laws were passed by the central government in the Lok Sabha on September 17, and in the Rajya Sabha on September 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tikri-singhu-borders-closed-as-farmers-stir-enters-day-26/story-ZVLidBIdQ3CIdEBke2zfQJ.html

A special child with mental and learning problems, Mithun was found in Assam’s Dhubri three years ago with no clue how he managed to leave his home and reach another state. He was soon placed by the district child welfare committee in care of Destination, a Guwahati-based NGO that works with special children. Mithun kept mostly to himself and didn’t speak at all. Also Read: Man spent 8 months in UP jail as bail order did not mention his full name“Maybe he was unfamiliar with the language as his mother tongue is Bengali and the children in Destination spoke Assamese. After spending six months with us, he said in Bengali that he wants to go home. That’s how we guessed he could be from West Bengal,” said Chumki Bora, superintendent, Destination. “But he was unable to give us his proper address. It took us nearly two years to from whatever little information he used to provide us. We contacted police in Siliguri in West Bengal, but didn’t get any response from them,” she added. A breakthrough took place last month when the chairperson of Cooch Behar child welfare committee in West Bengal visited Dhubri. The issue was discussed with him and instructions issued to try and trace the address. “The child welfare committee there managed to trace the address and locate his parents. Once they sent us documents and old photos of Mithun, we were sure about his identity. His parents reached Guwahati on Saturday and we handed him over to them,” said Bora. The father, a vegetable vendor, said that Mithun had gone to watch a prayer meeting and went missing after that. They had lodged a police case and carried out a search in their area for many months, but failed to get any result. “Despite our efforts not yielding any positive outcome, I was always hopeful that I will find my child one day. I am very happy that we were finally able to trace him and are now taking him back home,” Mithun’s mother Anita told journalists on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-years-after-he-went-missing-from-west-bengal-special-child-reunited-with-parents-in-assam/story-97aPhUYXZ5kUzwbSkSVvnM.html

Muzaffarpur of Bihar recorded the worst AQI reading of 453. An AQI reading of above 401 is considered “severe”, which not only affects healthy people but severely harms those with pre-existing breathing issues, children and the elderly. Lucknow was followed by Moradabad (391), Kanpur (364), Bulandshahr (364), Varanasi (358), Ghaziabad (346) Greater Noida (346). The AQI reading in these cities was categorised as “very poor”.Also Read: Air quality in Noida and Ghaziabad slips again, enters ‘very poor’ zoneMeerut, Baghpat, Aligarh, Agra and some other cities of Uttar Pradesh recorded higher than normal AQI readings. Particulate pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10, along with vehicular and industrial emissions, comprised the major pollutants that contributed to higher AQI readings. According to experts, the cold weather also contributed to these factors and lead to higher AQI readings.“Particulate matter takes longer to settle down in cold weather because the air becomes dense. This not only causes a rise in AQI readings, but also leads to smog formation,” said senior environmentalist Devesh Kumar.The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, like previous years, has largely been ineffective in controlling the spike in air pollution. Though the board has issued directions to districts and government bodies suggesting ways that could improve air quality, the measures seem to have failed to show results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-s-cities-continue-to-be-plagued-by-polluted-air/story-N1BuFIt9Urb72EyFzGI23O.html

21-12-2020||Kolkata||Will ensure TMC wins 18 seats in North Bengal: Bimal Gurung||Gorkha Janmukti Morcha’s (GJM) founder-president Bimal Gurung held his first public meeting in Bengal’s Darjeeling town on Sunday afternoon and announced that he will help the Trinamool Congress (TMC) win at least 18 assembly seats in north Bengal when elections in the state are held next year. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice since 2009 with support from the GJM and other parties demanding creation of a separate state since it promised to find a permanent political solution to the hill issue and accord scheduled tribe status to 11 Gorkha communities. “I have joined hands with chief minister Mamata Barerjee. We will win 17 to 18 assembly seats in north Bengal. The BJP betrayed the Gorkhas and wasted our 12 years,” Gurung said at the meeting. He said Banerjee has assured him that she will find a permanent political solution to the Gorkhaland issue. There are six assembly seats in the Darjeeling hills, of which the TMC holds one while the BJP has none. The CPI(M) has one seat, the GJM has two while the remaining two are in control of the Congress. The Gorkha community has presence in the adjoining districts in the plains as well. The two GJM legislators from Darjeeling offered support to the BJP after the 2016 assembly polls but Gurung has now withdrawn his support. Gurung went into hiding in 2017 after being charged under anti-terror law by the Mamata Banerjee government for the violent Gorkhaland movement. He appeared before the media in Kolkata in October and announced that he was shifting his allegiance to Banerjee. Since then, the rivalry between Gurung and Binoy Tamang, his former lieutenant who has been heading a pro-TMC faction of the GJM since 2017, has intensified. Though Tamang and his men are opposed to Gurung’s entry into Darjeeling, the erstwhile fugitive leader was received with a warm welcome on Sunday. Gurung told his followers that he will start calling the shots in hill politics very soon. Without directly naming Tamang and his associate Anit Thapa, chairman of the board of administrators in Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), Gurung said, “They cannot deliver anything despite all the support they have.” Since the TMC failed to wrest the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat from the BJP in 2019 despite having the support of Tamang and Thapa, Gurung targeted the duo. “Why should they be supported (by the TMC)?” he said. “The two must leave within 10 to 12 days,” Gurung said. Local people said Gurung hinted that he wants Tamang and Thapa to step down from the GTA. Gurung returned to Siliguri town on December 6 and addressed a rally.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidates were elected chairmen of 12 local bodies and independents of two. In Alwar, the Congress formed the governing boards in two municipal councils and the BJP won four. It was a clean sweep for the Congress in five districts. The Congress won two seats in Baran, eight in Bharatpur, three in Dausa, two in Dholpur and three in Karauli. In the capital, Jaipur, the Congress won nine councils out of 10. In Jodhpur, Sawai Madhopur and Kota, it was one each for the BJP and Congress. In Sri Ganganagar, both BJP and Congress won four councils. In Sirohi, BJP won the only council. After the results were declared, Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasara tweeted: “Today after the end of the election for chairman in Rajasthan’s 50 municipal bodies, the Congress party managed to get control of 36 boards and BJP was reduced to only 12 boards. Thanks once again to all Congress workers and leaders for this expected result.” State BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said that ahead of local body elections, the delimitation of seats was done by the Congress on the lines of religion and caste which suited the party. “The Congress also misused government machinery to form their boards in majority,” Pareek said. On December 12, the Congress had defeated the BJP in elections to 50 urban local bodies in 12 districts of the state. The results come a few days after the BJP performed better than the Congress in rural local body elections in 21 of the state’s 33 districts. Results for urban local bodie elections show that independent candidates will play the role of kingmakers in the formation of boards in most districts. Of 1,775 municipal wards, results were declared for 1,774 on December 12; the Congress bagged 619, independents 597, BJP 547 and the rest others. The voting to elect representatives of 1,775 wards in 50 municipal bodies was held on December 11. Amid Covid-19 restrictions in the state, a 79.90% voter turnout was recorded. The highest turnout, 90.32%, was recorded in the Bharatpur Nagar municipal body. The lowest turnout, 64.39%, was recorded at Sawai Madhopur Nagar Parishad. Out of 14,35,000 voters in 12 districts, 11,46,000 voted.

21-12-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab commission agents plan strike against tax raids||The Arhtiyas , or commission agents, of Punjab plan to keep their shops shut in a protest over raids by the income tax department. There are two federation of Arthiyas in Punjab -- the Punjab Arthiyas Association led by Ravinder Singh Cheema and Federation of Arthiyas led by Vijay Kalra. Cheema and Kalra said collective raids have been conducted on the Arthiyas by the income tax ( I-T) department for the first time. The IT department has conducted a search on Arhtiya’s across the state in the past couple of days amid the farmers’ protest.According to the Punjab government, 14 prominent Arhtiyas across the state have received tax notices from the department.“Our shops will remain closed from Monday onwards in the protest against the central government over the revengeful act for supporting the ongoing farmers’ agitation,” Cheema said.He said the contentious farm laws enacted in September were not only against farmers, but also the Arthiyas because these laws will hit the government-controlled mandi system. “We will be also holding a joint meetings with the Federation of Arthiyas too on future steps”, added Cheema. The Federation of Arthiyas held a state level meeting on Sunday. Kalra said members of the federation would keep their shops from Tuesday to Friday. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday criticised the Centre for its “intimidatory tactics” against Arhityas supporting the protesting farmers, and termed the I-T department’s raids a pressure tactic to weaken the farmers’ agitation.Farmer unions protesting at the Singhu and Tikri borders condemned the I-T raids and threatened a stir against the department if the raids continue. Ruldu Singh Mansa, president of Punjab Kisan Union, said, “We have sent our team to Punjab to hold a meeting with arhtiyas. We have also asked the arhtiyas to protest at the I-T department offices.” Farmers and Arthiyas have often been at odds over disputes over supplies and loan repayments, since these commissioning agents also offer informal financing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-commission-agents-plan-strike-against-tax-raids/story-3OcUNjMMZ2UQvynCHgYezM.html
21-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi winter 2020: Warmth of home, a cozy bed and sunshine to beat the winter chill||Delhi winter is chillier than usual. And this time as well, as we brace ourselves for a winter that has already started making new records. But, many denizens are thankful for not having to step out due to #WorkFromHome set-up. And that’s why it is this year, after so many, that the small pleasures of Delhi-NCR winter months are being cherished by many on their social media handles. When was it last that you enjoyed a calm morning without having to worry about reaching work in time? “I can’t remember the last time I read the newspaper peacefully in the morning. I would just catch up with the news on my phone, on the way to work, and only get to read the whole paper before I’d go to sleep,” says Harish Kumar, a Gurugram-based HR executive. “Now that I’m home, I manage to wake up, and actually enjoy the sunlight in my balcony, with a cup of coffee and my newspaper. This winter is different,” he adds. For some like Delhi-based web producer Priya Choudhary, who have cut down on their travel time thanks to WFH, mornings now mean getting a window to read books and practice yoga. “It’s easier and healthier to exercise early. I love winters, but I hate leaving my flat, changing and going out in the cold. So I’m glad to be home, and not stuck in a metro train, commuting to work and missing out a bright winter morning,” adds Choudhary. And not just mornings, winter evenings, though chilly, have become an excuse for bonfire get-togethers to come knocking. Pooja Bhateley, a Delhi-based data analyst, says, “My friends and I were planning a trip to the hills this December, but since the Covid-19 situation is bad, we postponed it to next year. However, what we did is organise a small bonfire party in my balcony, since this is the perfect weather for it! And we could all start it early evening since almost all of us are working from home. Plus it’s safer than going to a public place.”Amid all this, the housemate who is making the most of everyone staying indoors, this winter, is the furry being! Shailash Prasad, a Gurugram-based corporate employee, says, “My dog, Zap loves his nap and cuddles and used to fight when I had to leave the house for work. So we both are enjoying this winter at home. While I work, he sleeps and then eats, only to sleep again.” Prasad shares that while he hasn’t shopped for woollens since he isn’t really going out, Zap has been flaunting his new jackets! “I’ve been enjoying walks on the terrace with Zap and my girlfriend; we unanimously agree that winters are bearable only if one is home,” he adds.

21-12-2020||Delhi||They have turned our lives upside down: Singhu village on farm laws, stir||It is a sunny December afternoon and Ramesh Sharma is sitting on a charpoy in the lush green lawn of his house overlooking the wheat fields. One can hear the rousing speeches made by the farmers’ leaders over megaphones at the nearby Singhu border on the national highway. “You know, these protesting farmers have made our village famous all over the world. But their protests have also disrupted our lives,” he says. Sharma is a resident of Singhu, the last village before entering Haryana, in north Delhi. It also gave the name to the border, Singhu border, which is one of the major sites for the farmer protests around the Capital against the central government’s new farm laws. The village is home to about 250 families. Being close to Delhi’s industrial areas such as Narela and Kundli, a rental economy has developed in the village over the years, but more than half of the families depend on agriculture. They mostly grow rice and wheat, which they sell at the Delhi government’s Agricultural Produce Market Committee Mandi (APMC) Mandi in Narela, about five kilometers away. The new farm laws and protests have divided the residents. Also Read: Farmers to start relay hunger strike from today to mount pressure on govtAsk Sharma, who has a 2-acre farm, what he thinks of the farmers’ demands and after a long pause, he says: “The farmers should have the right to sell their produce wherever they want. These new laws, in my opinion, will facilitate that.” As we talk, Satish Kumar Sherawat, another farmer joins in. He tells us that he came straight from the border protest site, about a kilometer from the village. “I go there every morning for two hours. Their fears are not unfounded. The corporates will first offer a great price for our produce, much more than what government mandis offer. That will lead to mandis becoming irrelevant and then non-existent. Then farmers will be left at the mercy of the big companies,” says Sherawat, who has five acres in the village. “The only solution is that all three farm laws be scrapped.” So, does the village support the protests with supplies? Sherawat answers with a sheepish smile: “No, they can help us more than we can help them.” It is the season for the wheat crop and almost all of Singhu village is growing it on hundreds of acres of farmland. On the village’s well-paved roads, snaking through the lush green fields, one sees parali (stubble) -- stalks of the previous season’s paddy pulled out from the ground after harvest -- dumped on the verge at many places. Many farmers in north India resort to burning their stubble to quickly prepare the ground for the wheat crop. This spikes the already high pollution levels in the national capital region (NCR) and the north Indian plains. But Sharma is quick to point out: “We do not burn it, we sell it to dairy farms in Delhi and NCR, where it is used as animal fodder.” He then points to a dense cluster of low-rise houses in the distance. “That is a Haryana village. Unlike them, we get uninterrupted supply of electricity.” Also Read: Western Railway diverts, short terminates trains due to farmers’ protest in PunjabThe Singhu village is also home to a shuttered rice factory, several grain godowns and large milk dairies, run by both villagers and outsiders. With families expanding, land holdings in the village have decreased. Many village youngsters have set up businesses, others have found jobs in the nearby industrial areas. The village is also home to many retired and serving Delhi transport corporation (DTC) employees. DTC employee and resident Narendra Singh had sold his farmland in the village a few years back. He is fiercely opposed to the farmers’ protest in his village’s vicinity, saying the three-week-old protest had turned their lives upside down. “There were around five petrol pumps on the highway near our village; all of them are closed because of the protests. The DTC buses do not come any more as the village’s narrow main road is choked with vehicles taking a detour because of the blockade,” says Singh. “Sometimes it takes us two hours to cover a distance of a km from the highway to home during peak hours. Traffic policemen have appeared in our village, which is quite a curious sight.” Still others, like Satish Kumar, says the new laws miss the nuance. Kumar has rented 27 acres in the village to farm for Rs 12 lakh a year. More than the APMC mandis, it is the disappearance of the arhtiyas (commission agents) that worries him the most. “Whenever I need money for agricultural or personal needs, I approach these arhtiyas. They know that I am a farmer and will bring my crop to them, and so they readily give me a loan. Sometimes, I have taken as much as Rs 8 lakh from them to pay the land rent,” says Kumar. And how much does he pay as interest? “About 24 per cent per annum. I know it is high, but the arrangement suits me as I do not have much land of my own it is not easy to get such loans from the bank,” he says. In another part of the village where multi-storey houses are clustered together, a group of elderly people are busy playing cards. While most support the protesting farmers, calling their worries about the new laws as ‘genuine’, a couple of others are worried about how the protests are going to end. Also Read| Kisan Diwas on Dec 23, toll collection to be halted in Haryana from Dec 25: Farmers intensify stir“I think both the government and the protesting farmers are being unreasonable. Farmers cannot say ‘my way or the highway’. Most of the union leaders, who have been shouting themselves hoarse there do not seem to have read the laws,” says Ran Pal Sherawat, who owns 2.5 acres here. His elder brother, Om Prakash Sherawat, gets philosophical as he seeks to describe the stalemate. “You must have heard the saying that rulers and children are very difficult to deal with when they get obstinate. Now, we are beginning to get worried how and when these protests will eventually end. Sometimes we fear violence; our relatives keep calling us from all across the country to know if everything is fine in the village,” says Om Prakash. “While we are happy that our village is now famous, we do not want to it to become a site of a violent farmers’ revolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/they-have-turned-our-lives-upside-down-singhu-village-on-farm-laws-stir/story-OTIPZjYTCeemXlB13tRBAP.html

21-12-2020||City||Footfall, donations improve but normalcy yet to return to Golden Temple||Though footfall and donations from devotees are gradually increasing at the Golden Temple, complete normalcy is yet to return to the Sikh holy shrine. The staff of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which manages the affairs of the shrine, says that though the number of devotees has considerably increased as compared to the initial months of the lockdown, it is still far from what was seen before the pandemic outbreak.SGPC honourary chief secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami said that the shrine is currently getting only 60-65% of its normal footfall. The dip in footfall is clearly visible as before the pandemic, the bridge on the sarovar (holy tank), which leads to the sanctum sanctorum, used to be jam-packed with devotees. Now, the rush is much lower and devotees can be seen waiting in queues while ensuring physical distancing. The wait time for reaching the sachkand (sanctum sanctorum) has also come down. Dhami attributes the low footfall to the fact that air and rail connectivity have not fully resumed due to which devotees from other states and countries are unable to visit. This in turn has led to a dip in donations. Notably, a major chunk of donations came from NRIs. But most of them are unable to visit due to restrictions on international travel. Dhami says the dip in donations has had an adverse impact on the functioning of SGPC, which runs scores of educational, medical, sports, religious and human welfare institutions. It may be recalled that during the initial months of the lockdown, the average daily footfall had dipped to 1,000 and the average daily collection of offerings had come down to around Rs. 10,000 a day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/footfall-donations-improve-but-normalcy-yet-to-return-to-golden-temple/story-vq4Met5fWpDFJQLejkHHCJ.html

On the other hand, Congress’ Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia held 10 meetings between 10am to 7pm.No bog rallies this timeFormer city mayor Ahluwalia said: “Campaigning this time is different and difficult because of the pandemic. We have to take all precautions and are not holding big gatherings. Also, because these are direct elections, we have a large area to cover in a limited time.”Ahluwalia said that social media was playing a major role this time. “I attend meetings as per the schedule made by the party. Apart from this, I also make separate visits to families. Rest, messages are being conveyed to a large number of people via Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp, and we have a separate team for that.”Naveen Garg, district media in-charge of BJP, said: “There are no big rallies this time. The candidates are holding nukkad meetings in which a few families of an area gather and vote appeal is done.”He added: “Daily, over 20 such small meetings are held across the wards by senior leaders of the BJP. Apart from this, candidates go door-to-door to ensure people in their areas are covered.”The BJP has also created a 15-member IT and media cell to manage Twitter, Facebook and other social media accounts of the party. “The main work of the cell is to reach out to as many people as possible and give them every detail related to the campaign. Apart from this, the cell keeps an eye on rumours spread by the opposition and clearing false allegations,” Garg added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-mc-elections-candidates-reach-out-via-small-gatherings-social-media-amid-pandemic/story-h5hr4uEyZt3RNAnP47jKsM.html
21-12-2020||Mumbai||Wear masks for at least six more months, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray tells citizens||People will have to wear a mask for at least six more months as the Covid-19 danger is yet to pass, said Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday, as the state recorded 3,811 fresh infections, taking the tally to 1,896,518. Thackeray said residents should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to avoid imposition of restrictions such as night curfews and lockdowns, and urged them to see the examples of United Kingdom (UK) and other European countries where lockdowns have been reimposed to contain the pandemic.On Sunday, active cases increased to 62,743 and its percentage against the total reached 3.30%. The toll went up to 48,746 as 98 casualties were reported, of which, 47 were in the past 48 hours, 11 were in the past week and the rest 40 deaths were from before last week, officials said.“Today’s Covid situation in Maharashtra is before the world. We have yet to completely contain it, but it is in control to some extent for sure. We have got busy in our routine life, but as the head of the family, it is my responsibility to caution you that the danger is yet to pass,” the chief minister said in his live address to people of the state.Maharashtra has been maintaining its trend of relatively fewer cases for more than close to two months now. For the past 16 days, it is reporting fewer than 5,000 cases, indicating an improvement in the situation. Health officials, however, are still wary that it may change in January when the state may hit a potential second wave.“Recently, union health minister Harsh Vardhan said the people will have to wear masks even after taking a shot of Covid-19 vaccine. In my view, wearing a mask is necessary for six months at least. Use masks at public places for the sake of your family and for the society at large. Masks can protect us from the pandemic. We will have to be vigilant, while welcoming the new year,” Thackeray saidHe said that he doesn’t believe in imposing lockdown or night curfew as suggested by the experts and wants citizens to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour on their own. “I have got suggestions from experts for imposing night curfew or lockdown ahead of the new year, but I don’t feel it is required. We have learnt what to do and what will happen if certain things are not followed from the past. If you stay away from Covid-19, it will stay away from you,” the chief minister said.A comparison of data with the last month showed that the state has reported 85,070 cases in the last 15 days, whereas 88,061 cases were reported in the corresponding period last month.Showing a decline, Mumbai has clocked 586 cases, highest in the state, on Sunday, taking the count to 286,850. Of them, active cases are 7,996. There were 16 deaths reported and the toll in the city has reached 10,996.Nagpur city contributed the second-highest number of infections in the daily caseload and it has recorded 374 cases. Their tally reached 108,393.Pune city recorded 339 cases, third-highest number of cases. Its case count stood at 188,302.The state has completed a total of 12,119,196 Covid tests with 59,961 conducted on Sunday.

21-12-2020||Mumbai||20 million people in Mumbai at risk due to cyclones, sea level rise: Study||The threat of increasing cyclonic events, storm surges and sea level rise could paralyse the financial capital, affecting the lives of more than 20 million people, a study has revealed. It further warned that coastal cities with high population density and delicate infrastructure were left with no more than 10 years to act against the impacts of climate change.Findings for Mumbai city and the Maharashtra coastline by not-for-profit policy research institute Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) as a part of its recent report assessing patterns of extreme climate events through district-level profiling showed that south Mumbai was highly vulnerable to the combination of sea-level rise and storm surge.“Storm surge and cyclone trends across the west coast are worrying because of their compounding effects. The storm surge often leads to an abnormal rise of sea level threatening the safety of citizens. Through spatial maps we were able to estimate that around 20 million people were at risk in Mumbai owing to this threat,” said Abinash Mohanty, programme lead, CEEW and author of the study.According to data used from National Disaster Management Authority, India Meteorological Department, Press Information Bureau, and international bodies such as World Meteorological Organisation, the study found that the decadal increase in cyclone events had increased six times from two cyclones in 1970-1979 to 12 during 2010-19 that had impact along the Maharashtra coast. At the same time, the number of affected districts increased from two during 1970-79 to six during 2010-19, an addition of another three in 2020 (including the impact of severe cyclone Nisarga), taking the tally to nine for the 2010-20 period. South Mumbai witnessed a threefold increase in the frequency of extreme flood events over the past five decades with two flood events per decade from 1980-2009 that shot up to six in 2010-19.Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri, and Raigad were identified as the cyclone hotspot districts in Maharashtra. “Cyclones of various categories have severely hit the eastern coast but on the contrary, the west coast has also witnessed a fivefold increase in cyclonic storms’ frequency and intensity making these districts susceptible to annual pre and post monsoon extreme climate events,” said Mohanty.A similar analysis report by McKinsey & Company Inc, released in February, showed almost three million people living within a kilometre of Mumbai’s coastline were under threat from coastal flooding, storm surges and sea-level rise from now till 2050 with extreme weather events and storm surges accelerating by 1.5 times with 100 km/hour wind speed being the new normal.The Maharashtra government said it was aware of the increase in cyclonic events and associated threats from sea level rise to coastal cities. “Maharashtra’s climate action policy has factored in these threats and our focus is to protect natural ecosystems, climate resilience for new constructions and linear infrastructure, and effective implementation of coastal protection norms. All state departments are in the process of preparing their own climate policies through the state’s action plan, and simultaneous implementation is being done at district and region-wise levels,” said Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary, state environment and climate change ministry, adding that the department will be hosting a climate action summit in February-March 2021 to address these and many other such issues.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations has said warming of oceans (rising sea surface temperature) has been triggering sea-levels to rise faster. Since 2005, the sea-level rise has risen by more than 2.5 times during the last century, posing a serious threat to communities, livelihoods, and economies. Studies have estimated that the rate of rising seas over the Arabian Sea is about 0.5–3 mm/year, whereas it is 0.75–6 mm/year over the Bay of Bengal. “Considering IPCC’s projections of a 1m rise across by 2050 under a high emissions scenario, many cities of Mumbai’s size can be inundated,” said Mohanty.Dr Anjal Prakash, research director and adjunct associate professor with Bharti Institute of Public Policy at the Indian School of Business and lead author, IPCC’s 6th Assessment Cycle report, said, “Mumbai as a prominent hotspot, facing challenges of frequent cyclonic storms and sea level rise, coastal green space (mangroves) is vital to be protected under a city-specific policy banning construction, waste dumping and ensuing sustainable utilisation of the sea resource.”Among solutions, the study said that apart from limiting our emissions and retrofitting the existing infrastructures, restoring natural shock absorbers like mangroves and wetlands could fetch triple dividends of climate-proofing. “It will help halt micro-climate changes, and generate green economic opportunities. We are left with only a decade to act against devastating impacts of climate change,” said Mohanty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/20-million-people-in-mumbai-at-risk-due-to-cyclones-sea-level-rise-study/story-oShLJ45DEPFzLHtUdYUh6H.html
21-12-2020||City||Mumbai Metro-7, 2A gear up for operations; 18 women among 1st set of operators||With the city expected to get two additional Metro lines in May 2021, the Maha Mumbai Metro Operation Corporation Limited (MMMOCL) has readied a batch of 41 station controllers and train operators, of which, 18 are women.MMMOCL is a newly-formed government body that will operate and maintain all the upcoming metro lines in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).MMMOCL is looking to hire 1,100 staffers for the two lines — Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E) and Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar).Of the batch of 41, there are 30 station controllers and 11 train operators. DK Sharma, managing director, MMMOCL, said, “The batch was trained for 22 weeks at the L&T Academy in Hyderabad during the lockdown. They also received hands-on training on Mumbai Metro-1. We have also trained the station controllers to undertake for operations in case of an emergency.”Apart from being trained in operation and maintenance, MMMOCL is also looking to get all the employees trained in disaster management. “A batch of 30 staffers have been trained at the civic body’s facility at Parel,” said Sharma, adding that each employee will be trained in fire-fighting, administering first-aid or combatting any major hazard. MMMOCL has also planned mock drills for the employees with the National Disaster Response Force, Sharma added.Of the women trained for operating metros, 24-year-old Adeshree Thakare from Amravati was the first to operate a locomotive, used for shunting the trains, at the Charkop depot earlier this month. “I never thought I would get to operate a train in my life. The technology has advanced so much that it has become easier for women to opt for these jobs that were perceived to be male-oriented professions. It’s a very exciting opportunity and I am looking forward for the inauguration of the two lines next year,” said Thakare. Meanwhile chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday visited Akurli and DN Nagar Metro stations, among other sites, to review the works of the two corridors. He also visited Charkop depot, where the trains will be housed.The trial-runs for the two metro lines are expected to start from January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-metro-7-2a-gear-up-for-operations-18-women-among-1st-set-of-operators/story-1fTvB6kv3YD4qNs5FxsFDP.html
21-12-2020||Mumbai||Kharghar-Panvel belt near Mumbai breathes unsafe air for 17 hours a day: Study||Air pollution levels on the outskirts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) are above safe limits for nearly two-thirds of the day, with peak pollution during early morning hours posing a threat to morning walkers and joggers, according to a month-long air study carried out by environment group Waatavaran Foundation across the Kharghar-Panvel-Taloja belt. The air has suspended particulate matter (PM) of different sizes. Many of these are a complex mixture of dust, pollen, soot and smoke and are hazardous, making them responsible for lower visibility and smog. Of this, PM2.5 is the smaller kind, with a diameter not more than 2.5 micrometers. They are fine particles that can stay in the air for days or weeks and are small enough to invade the narrowest of lung airways and cause health ailments. The study found extremely high levels of PM2.5 in the air, especially between 6am and 8am, and average air quality above safe standards for 17 hours every day. Air quality only improved during afternoon hours. Read more: Mumbai’s winter pollution more toxic in 2020; PM2.5 levels 25-30% higher than 2019: CSE“The idea was to understand what local residents in these areas were breathing daily while highlighting the failure of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the civic bodies to provide a dedicated air quality monitoring system in these areas,” said Bhagwan Kesbhat, founder, Waatavaran Foundation. The data from five locations – Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Taloja; Sector 13, Panvel; Navade, Taloja; Sector 7 and 36, Kharghar, showed average PM2.5 levels over 31 days was 101.12 microgrammes per cubic metre (μg/m3), which is almost twice the national safe standard (60μg/m3), and four times the World Health Organization (WHO) standard (25μg/m3). The highest PM2.5 concentration was at 7am at 141.1μg/m3 (average data from five monitors). MIDC Taloja had the most polluted air among five locations at 197.4 μg/m3 at 7am. “The average PM2.5 level at MIDC for 31 days was 139.27μg/m3, which is 2.3 times the national standard and 5.5 times the WHO standard,” said Farah Thakur from Waatavaran, who analysed the data. PM2.5 data was accessed using five low-cost air quality monitors between November 13 and December 13, and then analysed. Waatavaran will submit their study and suggestions to the Panvel Municipal Commissioner, local elected representatives, state environment department and MPCB. “Robust pollutant monitoring is the key to frame effective policies and ensure timely implementation. Our recommendations entail curbs on industrial pollution, road dust resuspension, and to make Panvel region zero waste burning for overall emission reduction,” said Kesbhat. Panvel resident Srinath Kolare said, “The study findings are critical at a time when low-cost real estate development is being planned in these areas . It is alarming as 7am is the time when children normally go to school and would be breathing such polluted air.” MPCB said they already had plans to expand their air quality monitoring network across other areas in the MMR. “Air quality spikes could be mostly due to vehicular emissions in these areas. We already have monitoring stations across Kalyan, Thane, Dombivli and Navi Mumbai. A study to determine the efficacy of low-cost monitors is underway, and based on its results, we will set up more stations on the outskirts of MMR for better data monitoring, pollution abatement, and action on ground,” said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB. Experts said the study showed that about half a million people in Panvel are constantly exposed to poor air quality. “Vehicular traffic, industry and road dust appear to major sources. Pollutants from these can cause recurrent lung infections, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart ailments and stroke in the elderly. It is now up to the local authorities to take this issue seriously and plan strategies to reduce pollution,” said Dr Sundeep Salvi, director, Pulmocare Research and Education (PURE) Foundation, Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kharghar-panvel-belt-near-mumbai-breathes-unsafe-air-for-17-hours-a-day-study/story-DWRiTz8fyayQu9PO4A6qVO.html
21-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC to tehsildars: Give Maratha students EWS certificates||In a relief to students from the Maratha community aspiring to join various undergraduate professional courses under the government quota, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) directed the tehsildars to issue Economically Backward Class (EWS) certificates to the students after verifying their bona fides. On July 28, the state government had issued an order stating that students from Maratha community would not be able to apply for EWS quota seats as they were already given reservation under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) quota. However, as the Supreme Court (SC) stayed the implementation of the 12% SEBC quota in education in September, the students were left without the benefit of any reservation and hence approached HC, seeking relief under the 10% EWS quota. The court has also directed the state medical common entrance test (CET) cell and respondent medical colleges to consider the EWS certificates of such students and not be prejudiced against them in the light of the July 28 order. A division bench of justice SV Gangapurwala and justice Shrikant D Kulkarni, while hearing the petitions of eight aspiring students, was informed by the respective counsels for the students that they belonged to the Maratha community and were desirous of pursuing the undergraduate courses in medical education. The bench was informed that the students were covered under the SEBC Act and wanted to apply for the 12% seats reserved for Marathas under the law. However, as the Apex court had stayed the implementation of SEBC quota on September 9 and had referred the issue of constitutional validity of SEBC Act to a larger bench, the students were left with no option for benefitting from quota, and hence wanted to apply under the EWS quota. The counsels also informed the court about the state’s July 28 order which barred students from Maratha community to avail benefits under EWS quote. In the light of these submissions, the counsels sought directions to the authorities to issue EWS certificates to Maratha community students and grant them admission under the quota. The counsels assured the court that the students were willing to give an undertaking that they would not seek reservations under any other quota for education purpose once they were issued the EWS certificates and got admission under it. After hearing the submissions, the court directed the state medical CET cell and colleges, “If the petitioners are issued EWS certificates in the state format, and an undertaking is filed by the petitioners that during their entire educational career they would not claim benefit under any reservation – either vertical or horizontal except EWS category – then the petitioners be considered for admission from EWS category.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-to-tehsildars-give-maratha-students-ews-certificates/story-ttQJHRGCXRiEtph8fN6nYO.html
21-12-2020||Mumbai||33 years after being notified, Maharashtra govt appoints WII to reorganise boundaries of Malvan Marine Sanctuary||Thirty-three years after it was first notified, the state mangrove cell under the Maharashtra forest department has appointed the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, to carry out spatial mapping of critical marine habitats of the Marine Malvan Sanctuary (MMS) in Sindhudurg district and reorganise its boundary. According to a letter issued to them by the mangrove cell last week, WII was appointed for the nine-month-long study (January to September 2021) at a cost of ₹36.02 lakh to identify the new coordinates suggesting the safety of protected and endangered coastal and marine biodiversity, including protection of important coral reefs.The rationalisation was proposed after the Management Effectiveness Evaluation (MEE) 2017-18 report (a global framework to evaluate the performance of protected areas) released by the Union environment ministry marked a “poor performance” of the sanctuary, flagging several discrepancies, including inadequate management, an archaeological structure located in the sanctuary’s core zone, free movement of fishers and tourist operators leading to pollution, and failure to carry out settlement of rights and concessions of local residents. The report called for the reorganisation of the boundaries by excluding areas of human intervention, proper protection of marine biodiversity, and local livelihood. Neenu Somraj, deputy conservator of forest (mangrove cell), who issued the letter to WII, said, “At present, the sanctuary is a multipurpose use area, which may have already disturbed the marine, especially coral biodiversity there. So there is no point to protect a sanctuary just on paper. Our mission is to avoid any over utilisation or exploitation of marine resources while identifying coral rich areas (inside as well as outside the present boundary), tag and protect it.” She added that it was a win-win situation for both, the administrators and the fishers. “We will be considering active fishing areas and exclude them from the sanctuary to ensure their livelihood is protected,” said Somraj. The final decision was taken during a meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray with Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) and various state bodies in the last week of November to discuss the issue. Located in Malvan taluka, MMS was notified on April 13, 1987, across a total area of 29.122 square kilometre (sq km) (3.182 sq km core and buffer area of 25.94 sq km). The core area encompasses within its boundary the historic Sindhudurg Fort built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (recognised as a monument by the Archaeological Survey of India), the Padmagad Island, and a combination of underwater rocky areas and sandy beaches. The diverse habitat with coral reefs, intertidal zone and mangroves are home to 331 of 367 marine species, including 18 coral species, recorded along the entire Sindhudurg coastal and marine ecosystem. “The spatial study will help identify the appropriate location of the sanctuary and suggest conservation measures. Thereafter, we will submit the final report before the State Board for Wildlife, based on approvals to the National Wildlife Board. We will also need permission from the Supreme Court based on its order from 2000 where de-notification or changes in sanctuary area needs Apex court approval,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell). According to the management plan for MMS prepared by the forest department, the present coordinates include the north-east border of the buffer zone, which is about 50 metres (m) from the seashore near Malvan Port, while the eastern border comprises a semi-circular sandy beach (Dandi beach), which is about 500m parallel to the shore at Malvan. Towards the south, the sanctuary expands covering the buffer zone near Mandal Rock of Malvan Port, while the core zone covers the Sindhudurg Fort. The Padmagad Island is along submerged exposed rocks which extend to about 3.182 sq km. “The WII study will allow us to reorganise the boundaries in such a way that it will allow fishermen and locals to carry on with their livelihood activities such as fishing and tourism, and at the same time, it will allow us to conserve some areas of rich biodiversity,” said Manas Manjrekar, deputy director, Mangrove Foundation. Significance of the marine sanctuary Malvan is home to globally significant species protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, including the whale shark, Bryde’s whale, Blue whale, Sperm whale, Indian Ocean humpback dolphins, Finless porpoises, otters, Olive Ridley, Green and hawksbill sea turtles, white-bellied sea eagle, swiftlets among others. Being studied by conservationists since 1980, MMS is among 11 ecologically and economically critical habitats identified along the country’s coastline by the Integrated Coastal and Marine Area Management programme of the Centre’s Department for Ocean Development. The presence of the 16th century Sindhudurg Fort by the founder of Maratha Empire Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj further adds historical significance and heritage value to the south Konkan taluka. Threats to the sanctuary Unregulated water sports, marine adventure activities such as snorkelling, SCUBA diving, and dolphin watch. Clearing of sand dune vegetation for beautification purpose for tourism.Increase in water pollution due to unregulated tourism and untreated municipal and rural sewage and solid waste disposal directly into the open sea. Vehicular traffic on beaches and light pollution disturb the turtles nesting along beaches. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Oil spill, fishing boat, vessel accidents.Collection, hunting, unnecessary handling of marine life for tourism purposes and trade of scheduled and endangered species.

21-12-2020||Mumbai||2,500 staff trained for Mumbai civic body’s vaccination drive||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is all set to execute the first phase of the Covid-19 vaccination. It has trained a group of 2,500 individuals at civic hospitals to assist with the administration of the vaccine. These staffers have also been trained to deal with various scenarios that may occur during the vaccination drive. Each vaccine administration team will consist of five people, including the vaccinator, support staff and security personnel. There will be 500 teams in total, and each of them will assist one doctor.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “While the preliminary training for the vaccination drive is over, a detailed training is still ongoing. The detailed training includes identifying people [who need to be administrated the dose on priority basis], handling Covid-19 mobile application designed for distribution and scheduling of vaccines and [ensuring] precautions to be taken during vaccination. By December 31, we want to complete all our preparations.”The BMC has already devised a vaccine distribution strategy for around 40% population in the city that has been tagged as ‘vulnerable’. Around 1.25 lakh healthcare workers will get the Covid-19 shots in the first phase of vaccination, followed by frontline workers such as police force and conservancy workers in the second phase. In the third phase, citizens above the age of 50 and those suffering from comorbidities will be vaccinated.Kakani said initially there will be eight civic hospitals (King Edward Memorial Hospital, BYL Nair Hospital, Cooper hospital, Sion hospital, Bhabha hospitals at Kurla and Bandra, Rajawadi Hospital and the Jogeshwari trauma hospital) that will be utilised for administering the vaccine to the healthcare workers in 15 days after the vaccine arrives. The second dose will be administered in 15 days after a buffer of 28 days. BMC is in the process of procuring deep freezers and has set up a central vaccine storage facility at Kanjurmarg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-500-staff-trained-for-mumbai-civic-body-s-vaccination-drive/story-hjsu0mCk5pptbS1cXftBtO.html

21-12-2020||City||Bombay HC refuses pre-arrest bail to man accused of duping friend of ₹87 lakh||The Bombay high court (HC) has refused to grant anticipatory bail to a man who allegedly duped his close acquaintance of Rs87 lakh on the assurance that he could help her solve her matrimonial issues and help in curing her husband’s health problems by performing religious rituals through a priest. As the problems did not subside, the woman lodged a complaint against him under the relevant sections of the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013 (Black Magic Act). The court held that as the man had intentionally swindled the woman and he was unable to substantiate his claims of repaying her or give her the whereabouts of the priest, his custodial interrogation was required, and rejected his application. A single-judge bench of justice Sandeep K Shinde, while hearing the anticipatory bail application of Burzin Daruwalla was informed by his advocate Yogesh Dalvi that his client was booked by Ambernath police station under sections 406 (breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as under the provisions of the Black Magic Act.According to the complaint, the woman had paid ₹10.9 lakh in 2015 to Daruwalla and also loaned him ₹76.38 lakh from 2015- 2019. In return Daruwalla had promised to perform rituals and gave finger rings to her, assuring that on wearing them, her problems would be solved. The case registered at Ambernath police station further states that Daruwalla kept demanding more money and told the complainant that the rituals were not making a difference as she was follow not following the norms. However, the woman did not buy the claims and asked Daruwalla to return the money. When he refused to do so, she lodged a complaint against him. After hearing the submissions and perusing the evidence placed before it – including messages between Daruwalla and the woman– the court noted, “The messages over a period of three-four years clearly suggest that the applicant had dishonestly inducted the complainant to part with huge money on the pretext of performing puja/rituals to resolve her family issues. The messages clearly suggest that the applicant knew well since inception that the promise made by him was false.” The court also noted that there was no evidence to support the man’s claim that he had repaid ₹60 lakh to the complainant.In light of the above submissions, justice Shinde ordered, “In my view, custodial interrogation of the applicant cannot be denied to the prosecution. Anticipatory bail application is, therefore, rejected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bombay-hc-refuses-pre-arrest-bail-to-man-accused-of-duping-friend-of-87/story-7o2BkvDwLnWS2uO9e7zw1K.html
21-12-2020||Mumbai||A year on, LGBT match-making app has 8K registered profiles||A year after its inception, Umeed Matrimony, an application that facilitates match-making for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community across India, have registered more than 8,000 profiles and matched over 100 couples, according to the founders. While the LGBT community is yet to get equal marriage rights, it hasn’t deterred the community members from finding a right partner. Sameer Seerjeesh, founder of Umeed app and Vanya Foundation — an NGO working for the welfare of transgender community, started the app in 2019. The service is offered free of cost to everyone. Seerjeesh, a resident of Mira Road, said, “Usually we see the community being neglected in the society, but the time is changing. We created Umeed as a platform for the LBGT community to find their match. It is not a dating app, but for likeminded people to get together and explore potential relationships.” While consensual same sex relationships has been decriminalised in the country, same sex marriages are still not recognised. Read more: For marriage ‘equality’ that is truly equalSeerjeesh started the app after he found there is no such app for the LBGT community. “We found that there are some agencies who help these people find a match. However, they charge a huge fee for the same. We developed an entire app at an affordable price and launched it for free for the community.” Speaking about the journey of the app, he said it had a slow start as they had to first make a database and also know if the community is interested in such a service. He added that it later gained momentum. He added, “We promoted the app through different events held for the community and managed to enrol 500 profiles before we launched it. We have helped around 100 couples find their match through the app in the past one year. They might not enjoy the same rights as other couples, but all of them are happy. We also follow up with all those who uninstall the app to know the reason and 90% told us they found a match. The remaining 10% go through failed relations, though have assured to retry the app.” More than 50% people do not prefer to upload their photos on the app. However, this situation too will gradually change, said Sreejesh. On the topic that these couples do not get the benefits of marriage under the law, he said, “The court might have decriminalised relations between same sex couples but these couple still cannot get their marriage registered nor get any documentation for the same. They can avail personal or home loans on joint account, however do not enjoy other legal rights. There are many activists who are fighting for the cause and we believe the scenario will change.” The app is also getting profiles from Thailand, South Africa and Philippines with more than 30 profiles from foreign countries. A 30-year-old marketing executive from Nagpur, who joined the app, said, “I was not aware that there are so many people like me in my community. The app helped me find the right match.” Rekha Thakur, secretary of Vanaya foundation, added, “We have been undertaking many educational, cultural and social initiatives for the LGBT community, especially transgender people. We provide them education and means of employment. Umeed regularly works with us in these initiatives and approached us last year with the idea of the app. We loved the idea as we know of many people who spend a lonely life, and helped Sreejesh by promoting the app through our programmes.” Case Studies A 30-year-old Ghatkopar resident, who works with a private airline, said his family was forcing him to get married. “I was scared to tell them that my interest is different. They knew it but were not ready to accept it,” he said. After the Umeed app was launched, he approached his sister. “I asked her to go through the profiles and choose a match for me so that I can live with a person my family also likes. They grudgingly choose one person and I also got along with him. Not we are married and happy. Though there are still some issues with the families, we have managed to work around them.” A 25-year-old boy from Orissa who came to Mumbai in search of job said, “Staying in a rural village in Orissa, I was not aware about my identity till I came to Mumbai. I was a constant target of joke for everyone in my village. But Mumbai is completely different where people know each other and respect the community. The app is just helping hand for me and I am happy that I will get my life partner soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/a-year-on-lgbt-match-making-app-has-8k-registered-profiles/story-RzaFH0x2ZEq2ayL06wFqbN.html

21-12-2020||City||CISF arrests foreign national from Mumbai airport with heroin worth ₹2.5 crore||Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officials on Saturday had arrested a 31-year-old woman from Uganda at Mumbai airport for allegedly trying to smuggle 501 grams of heroin – estimated to be worth Rs 2.5 crore – on a flight to Delhi. The accused had concealed the drugs in the false cavity made in her footwear. During investigation, she revealed the name of another foreign national who had supplied her the drug for smuggling it to Delhi. According to sources in the Air Intelligence Unit (AIU), CISF officers on Saturday had intercepted a foreigner who was to depart to Delhi from Mumbai by flight 6E637 during the security check. They then found a white-coloured powder and some lumps of drugs weighing around 501 grams concealed in the cavities of her sandals. The field drug test kit revealed that the drug were heroin, AIU officers said. During the investigation, the accused identified herself as Mbabazi Oliver Joselynand and admitted that she was travelling on a fake identity – Jane Nalumansi. She also stated that she overstayed in India and her passport was impounded by the immigration department. Thereafter, she was taken into custody and AIU officials were informed. AIU subsequently seized the contraband and arrested the woman under relevant sections of Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.

21-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants bail to man accused of raping minor after reports show her age to be 18 years||The Bombay high court (HC) recently granted bail to a man who was accused and booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act for raping a minor after the ossification report indicated the survivor’s age to be 18-19 years and not 14 years, as claimed in the complaint. The court also took note of the fact that the applicant and complainant had a consensual sexual relationship, and hence granted bail. A single bench of justice PD Naik, while hearing the bail application, was informed by advocates Devendra Shukla and Hare Krishna Mishra that their client, Farahan Shaikh, was booked by Shanti Nagar police station in Bhiwandi under sections 376 (committing rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and provisions of Pocso Act. The first information report (FIR) was lodged on January 2, 2019 and the applicant was arrested on January 14. As per the complaint, the survivor had claimed she was 14-years old and she and Shaikh lived in adjoining buildings. She had come to know through an acquaintance that Shaikh intended to marry her and wanted to talk to her. However, after she turned down his proposal, Shaikh allegedly started to harass her. The complaint further stated Shaikh also sexually assaulted and threatened her to not disclose it to anyone. On January 2, the day the complaint was lodged, the survivor said Shaikh had called her at his residence in the presence of his parents and sister. The applicant allegedly told her that he would not marry her and the sister assaulted her. The advocates for Shaikh submitted that the story was concocted and fake, and said even if her allegations were assumed to be true, the relationship appeared to be consensual. They further submitted that the survivor and her family members had suppressed her age while filing the complaint and sought bail for Shaikh. Additional public prosecutor AA Takalkar, however, submitted that prima facie the documents on record indicated that the victim was a minor and the relationship was non-consensual. Opposing the bail plea, the police submitted that since the victim was threatened, it was a forcible sexual assault and arguments by the accused can be considered during trial. After hearing submissions and examining the documents, the bench observed, “From the tenor of the FIR lodged by the survivor, it appears that according to her, there was a sexual relationship between the applicant and the survivor on the terrace on several occasions. Her version also reflects that once her brother had accompanied her.” Justice Naik then observed, “There are discrepancies relating to documents regarding date of birth of the victim. The ossification test report on record indicates that the victim is aged about 18 to 19 years. Considering the factual aspects, the case for grant of bail is made out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-man-accused-of-raping-minor-after-reports-show-her-age-to-be-18-years/story-1zp3s5rG95Dl9APUF9UBeJ.html
21-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM invites BJP, Centre for dialogue on Mumbai Metro car shed||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his address to the state on Sunday, took potshots at the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Central government for allegedly “obstructing” shifting of the Metro-3 car shed from Aarey Colony at Goregaon to Kanjurmarg. He said it would be improper if both the state and the Centre started stopping each other’s projects, while referring to a petition filed by the Centre before the Bombay high court (HC), claiming ownership. Thackeray also invited the Centre and the Opposition party in the state — Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — for a dialogue to resolve the dispute, saying he took the decision in the interest of the people and not to satisfy his ego. The Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) had recently moved the car shed of Metro-3 line from Aarey to Kanjurmarg. However, the Centre went to the HC, which recently ordered an interim stay over the land transfer. This has turned the ongoing battle between the Centre and the state uglier. The BJP has been alleging that Thackeray took the decision to satisfy his ego. The state is now also looking at the land allotted for the bullet train project for the car shed. In his live address to people on Sunday, Thackeray questioned the Centre’s move stating, “It is unfortunate that the Central government went to court. Why did they do this? It is people’s property, not mine or yours’.” “The state gave its most priced land in the Bandra-Kurla Complex for the bullet train project. We never created any hurdles. The International Finance Centre went to another state, we didn’t create an issue on it. Then why create hurdles for this land (Kanjurmarg),” he said and criticised the Centre for not providing the saltpan land for the long-pending pumping station in Mahul that would provide relief during flooding in Mumbai. Explaining his decision to shift car shed, the chief minister said they decided to choose Kanjurmarg plot, so that they can build a car shed of two more lines apart from Metro-3. “The size of the plot at Kanjurmarg is 40 hectares, whereas at Aarey, we were getting only 25 hectares and to expand the project, we will require more land after 25-50 years. Also, at Kanjurmarg we can construct car sheds for three lines— Metro-3, 4 and 6. Isn’t (this plan) more beneficial? How am I wrong in proposing this? How is it about my ego,” Thackeray asked. He further said, “Of the 30 hectares allotted in Aarey, five hectares would be left untouched as it is a thick forest. Then why was it allotted for the project? This only means that in the future, there will be more tree-cutting and more forest land will be utilised, all for just one car shed.” He also said the plan did not have any provision for stabling lines where the rakes would be kept when not in use, which was “shocking”. “Aarey is an option for five years. Kanjurmarg is for 50 years,” he stressed. CM Thackeray said he was ready to give all credit to the BJP for solving this. “This issue can be easily resolved. We are ready to give you [BJP] credit for this. It is not about my ego. It should not be about your ego also.” He also replied to former chief minister and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis’s remarks, stating that the MVA government is only continuing projects that were initiated by the BJP government. “What do you want me to do? Do you want me to review these projects or stay them? I will only look at its progress,” Thackeray said, adding that in the past few weeks, he had made a visit to several ongoing works, including the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi corridor and the Mumbai-Pune missing link project. In his response, Fadnavis told the media that the Opposition was ready to cooperate, if the chief minister gives up the insistence on Kanjurmarg land and opts to build car shed again at Aarey Colony. “The site at Aarey Colony was approved by the Supreme Court. The state had gone far ahead on the project as an expenditure of ₹100 crore has also been made. If you have any doubt, then take a decision that not a single inch of additional land will be given to the car shed at Aarey in the future, we are ready to support it,” the former chief minister said. He said that they were also ready to have a discussion, saying, “My only request is don’t be adamant and open the way to build a car shed at Aarey Colony in the interest of the people. If it is built in time, Mumbai Metro-3 will be ready in the coming year, else it will have time and cost overruns. We don’t want credit for anything. Let the CM (Uddhav Thackeray) take the credit, but we want Metro-3 ready in time,” Fadnavis said. CM Thackeray also said that many were hoping that the MVA government will fall but they not only completed one year but also successfully faced a health pandemic and political attacks while maintaining development of the state, taunting the BJP but chose not to name them. “On November 28, the state government has completed one year. Many were hoping that it would fall but the government not only completed its first year but also tackled the most difficult health situation, the world had faced in the last 100 years. Not only this, we faced political attacks and also brought development,” he said. Meanwhile, NCP chief Sharad Pawar has intervened to resolve the matter between the state and Centre. “Pawar saheb told the CM on phone that coordination is necessary. He has also discussed the issue with the leader of Opposition and will speak with the Prime Minister, if required,” state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-invites-bjp-centre-for-dialogue-on-mumbai-metro-car-shed/story-ZJdefZHPwbO74inUo1JNNL.html

The victim’s father has filed a complaint at the Sector Beta 2 police station.In the complaint, he stated that his son has been studying in the private school for five years. “The juvenile, a neighbour, studies in class 12 in the same school. He is five years older to the victim and used to go to school with my son in the same bus. His father is our family friend and hence the two children were also friends.

The child is improving now,” he said.In October 2018, the child had disclosed the matter to his family, the complainant added. “We confronted the juvenile in front of his parents. He apologised and said he will not repeat,” The complainant alleged. He added that about three months ago, the juvenile and his family moved to another society in Greater Noida. “However, when my child did not recover from the trauma, we decided to take legal action. We filed a complaint with the police and also called Childline, an NGO, for counselling. It appears my child is improving now,” he said.

21-12-2020||Noida||Property registration up in Noida but stamp department still lagging in revenue target||Noida: Though more than half the financial has already passed, the Noida registry department has collected only ₹750 crore this fiscal so far, who is not even half of its annual target of ₹3,148.45 crore, even though the registration of properties has increased ever since the lockdown restrictions were eased. According to officials, April to November in 2019, the department had collected ₹900 crore and ₹850 crore during the same period in 2018. S K Tripathi, assistant commissioner, stamps, and assistant inspector, general registration of Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the department had not registered any property in April and that revenue was zero that month. In May, June and July, however, the department collected ₹12 crore, ₹60 crore and ₹110 crore, respectively as stamp duty. In August and September, the department collected ₹116 crore and ₹130 crore in revenue, respectively, through stamps and registration. In October and November, the registry department collected ₹322 crore. “We have so far collected ₹750 crore from April-November despite the lockdown, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We aim to collect ₹700 crore in the next four months,” Tripathi said. The officials said that they are getting applications for registration of small properties but no big developer has come for registration after the lockdown. They added that the department used to register about 1.25 lakh properties annually at its six offices in the district but this year, Tripathi said, a 30% fall in registration is being estimated. The UP government has given ₹3,148.45 crore as annual revenue target to the department for the financial year 2020-21. For the last four years, figures show that the department has not been able to meet the target due to slump in the real estate sector. The registration department’s data shows that in the 2019-20 financial year, the department had collected ₹1,856.48 crore against the annual target of ₹2,597 crore. In 2018-19, it had collected ₹1,879 crore against a target of ₹2,532 crore. In 2017-18, it had collected ₹1,685 crore, falling short of its target of ₹2,522 crore. Similarly, in 2016-17, the revenue collected was ₹1,761 crore against a target of ₹2,223 crore.Pankaj Bajaj, the president confederation of real estate developers’ association of India (CREDAI -NCR), a developers’ body, said that the real estate market is now improving after the lockdown.“The government should reduce the stamp duty so that more people can come for the registration. This will immensely boost the government’s revenue and also the real estate sector,” he said. The district administration revises the stamp duty annually, which comes into effect from August 1. Tripathi said that the stamp duty will be revised by March 31 in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/property-registration-up-in-noida-but-stamp-department-still-lagging-in-revenue-target/story-VzDcavM5xtfEDOdGvIZ9jK.html

21-12-2020||Noida||Yeida plans land acquisition around airport||The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) will acquire more land along the 165-km Yamuna Expressway in connection with the Noida International airport project.“We need land around the site of the airport for our different schemes that include urban schemes, industries and infrastructure projects. For urban schemes alone we need 1,500 acres more. We are yet to decide on the exact measure of land to be acquired,” said Arun Vir Singh chief executive officer of Yeida.Yeida’s plans will see the extension of the Gautam Buddh Nagar industrial area to neighbouring Bulandshahr district. “Chola railway junction in Bulandshahr is located near airport. Extending the industrial area will also extend the rail connectivity to the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor on which the work is underway,” said Singh.As per Yeida’s requirements for industrial projects, the authority will need to acquire land in Gautam Budh Nagar, Aligarh, Mathura and Agra, said officials.Yeida was established in 2001 to generate employment and develop urban areas along the expressway that connects Greater Noida with Agra. It has 268,862 hectares notified for development and has acquired 12,481 hectares for various developmental projects. But it has to fast-track land acquisition in view of the airport project, work on which is scheduled to begin by mid-2021 and completed in three years.So far, Yeida has 58,397 hectares (ha) notified in 131 villages of Gautam Budh Nagar and 40 villages of Bulandshahr district. In Aligarh it has 34,291 ha notified, 88,968 ha in Hathras, 75,751 ha in Mathura and 11,455 ha in Agra. An area identified for planned development is said to be notified. The UP government had handed over 1,334 ha for the airport and is expected to hire a total of 5,000 ha to develop the airport to its full capacity, said officials. Yeida will start land acquisition once it gets the approvals from the state government, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/yeida-plans-land-acquisition-around-airport/story-OfAgvm7pABkRotGDbKcQZO.html
21-12-2020||Noida||Let our supporters reach us, say farmers camped at Noida border||Traffic remained affected at Noida’s Chilla border with Delhi on Sunday as farmers completed 20 days of protest against the Centre’s new farm laws at the site. The border first closed on December 1 when farmers from Uttar Pradesh were stopped from going to Delhi. After negotiations, the border was opened on December 13 but was shut again on December 15 when members of the Bhanu faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) alleged that their supporters from other districts were stopped from reaching them. Traffic from Noida to Delhi has since then been re-routed through the DND Flyway.The group is being joined daily by farmers from different districts but not without struggle.“We were leading a group of nearly 70-80 farmers from Firozabad too this border on Friday when the police stopped us at the district outskirts. We then used other routes to reach Noida on Saturday night,” said Suresh Chandra Bhati, state secretary, BKU, Bhanu.BKU (Bhanu) Uttar Pradesh president Yogesh Pratap SIngh, who has been at the sit-in from the beginning, said that the campers will stay put as long as their demands are unmet.“They should allow our supporters to reach us. Every day groups are being stopped in various districts. The state government is making it difficult for our supporters to reach us. We want them to be able to raise their voices in support and the government should allow them,” said Singh.The group on Sunday afternoon also paid tribute to all the farmers who had lost their lives in the ongoing agitation. They also wanted to hand over a memorandum of demands to the administration but were unable to do so.Members of the Lokshakti faction who have been camped at the Dalit Prerna Sthal during the movement also carried out a rally in the area against the new farm laws on Sunday evening.A spokesperson for the faction said that they are continuously trying to address the farmers regarding developments in talks with the central government while they feel that efforts are being made to hijack the peasant movement.Meanwhile, traffic in the area from Noida to Delhi continues to move via the DND and Kalindi Kunj routes.“We are constantly monitoring the situation and any changes will be shared with the public. The situation is under control and there are no law and order concerns for now,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Rajesh S.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/let-our-supporters-reach-us-say-farmers-camped-at-noida-border/story-53E4QkWEykPlEk0gatHDJP.html
21-12-2020||Noida||Western UP farmers hold rally in Ghaziabad to support farm laws||Ghaziabad: Amid the ongoing protests by farmers at the UP Gate in Ghaziabad, another group of about 2,000 farmers on Sunday reached Indirapuram from different parts of western Uttar Pradesh and held a rally in support of the Centre’s three new farm laws. Officials of the Uttar Pradesh police said that the pro-bills farmers had come in about 300-350 tractor-trolleys and other vehicles to Indirapuram. Sunday’s was the first pro-farm law rally in Ghaziabad, the police said, adding that the farmers held the rally at Ramlila Ground in Indirapuram under the banner of ‘Hind Mazdoor Kisan Samiti’. Their vehicles made various stoppages at Meerut, Modinagar, Muradnagar and Raj Nagar Extension before proceeding towards Indirapuram, the police said. A major traffic jam also ensued between Arthala and Mohan Nagar where the farmers and officials indulged in heated exchange of words. However, senior police officials said that the traffic jam was for a brief period and was cleared up soon. “They (farmers) were trying to proceed on a different route and our officers asked them to follow a designated route allotted to them to proceed to Indirapuram. This resulted in brief disruption in traffic. These farmers had arrived with about 300-350 tractor-trolleys and other vehicles, and we had made arrangements to ensure that no inconvenience is caused to commuters,” said Praveen Kumar, inspector general of police (Meerut range). The leaders of Hind Mazdoor Kisan Samiti’ (HMKS) said that they were supporting the three farm laws and should also be included in talks between the government representatives and protesting farmers. “It seems that opposition to the three laws has some political motive behind it. When the Prime Minister has several times said that the new laws will not harm interests of farmers, other groups are continuing to oppose the laws. However, we have no personal differences with them as they are also farmers like us,” said Satish Kumar, secretary, HMKS. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that the pro-farm law farmers had planned to go to Delhi via the UP Gate, but they were stopped and taken to Indirapuram. “We did not permit them to go to Delhi, and they were taken to Ramlila Ground in Indirapuram where they held their rally. They were also not allowed to move to the UP Gate as another group of farmers is protesting there and could have raised law and order concerns. We have asked them to hold the rally in Indirapuram and return,” Pandey added. The farmers said that they accepted the request of the Ghaziabad district administration. “Since our rally was held at Indirapuram, a small delegation will go to Delhi and try to meet the Union agricultural minister. We have also demanded that if there are talks of protesting farmers with the government, farmers supporting the new agriculture laws should also be included. We have intent that talks should be held and the ongoing stalemate should end. Like other farmers, we too have our demands such as waiver of electricity bills and free plying of old tractors. But we support the new farm laws,” Satish Kumar added. Amit Kumar, treasurer of the association, said, “Those who are now opposing the farm laws had initially supported the laws. We maintain that rumours are being spread among farmers that their land will be taken over. However, it is not so. Even the Prime Minister has several times assured that the minimum support price (MSP) will remain. However, some people are trying to mislead farmers.” The farmers protesting at the UP Gate have been demanding rollback of the new farm laws and had also been demanding a new law on MSP. At least six rounds of talks with the government had been held so far, but failed to end the stalemate. “We are not opposed to farmers who are supporting the new farm laws. They have right to raise voices like we are doing to oppose the new legislations. We want that they should continue with their work and we will continue with our protest,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). The BKU supporters from western UP and farmers from Punjab and Uttarakhand have been opposing the three farm laws and continuing with their agitation at the UP Gate since November 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/western-up-farmers-hold-rally-in-ghaziabad-to-support-farm-laws/story-LGXml50kYezLsqijT6j7cJ.html
21-12-2020||Noida||Farmers claim passage to UP Gate protest site denied||A day after the famers holding protest at the UP-Gate in Ghaziabad raised concerns about tractor-trolleys with farmers heading to the site being stopped at different districts in western UP, officials of the district administration met and assured them that this was not the case. Farmers’ leaders Rakesh Tikait and Sardar VM Singh on Saturday had raised the issue claiming that the local administrations and the police in Amroha, Bareilly and other districts were stopping farmers. “We had given them an ultimatum of 24 hours to resolve the issue or we would be forced to block roads. The meeting was successful,” said Shamsher Rana, national media co-ordinator of the Tikait-led Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) faction. Shailendra Kumar Singh,additional district magistrate (city) said that farmers were assured that no vehicle were being stopped in Ghaziabad and that they would speak to their counterpart in other jurisdictions of Meerut division.Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range) denied the farmers’ allegations. “We have allowed a number of farmers’ vehicles to come to UP Gate and there is no reason to stop them. However, at some points we are checking vehicles to ensure that no anti-social elements were proceeding to the site. This may have delayed some farmers,” Kumar said. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey also said no vehicle was stopped in his district. The farmers at UP Gate have been proteting since November 28, and have also blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the National Highway-9 since December 3. Twice they had tried to hold up the Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway, but vacated it soon. Meanwhile, senior Congress leader and former chief minister of Uttarakhand Harish Rawat visited UP-Gate and lent his support to the struggle. Rawat stayed for about half-an-hour at the site and also wore the green and white cap of the BKU. “I have come here to say ‘Kisan Ekta Zindabad.’ I am also a farmer and have come here to participate with them in their agitation as a farmer. The farmers are giving supreme sacrifice and no one has been able to win against god and farmers,” Rawat, said. He did not offer any political comments, but paid tributes to the farmers who died during the agitation. Farmers at UP Gate on Sunday held a prayer meeting from 11am to 1pm for them. Rawat also paid floral tributes at the site but was not allowed by farmers to use the dais for any address. The farmers maintained that the ongoing protest would not allow any politician or their parites to be a part of it. “It is farmers’ struggle and their own fight. If the opposition parties want to support our agitation, why not they ask their MPs to stage a similar protest at Jantar Mantar in Delhi?” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the BKU faction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-claim-passage-to-up-gate-protest-site-denied/story-LoSTv0IKMkmUUK533XCndL.html
21-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi sees season’s coldest day at 3.4°C, next week may be colder||The National Capital on Sunday recorded the coldest morning of the season, with the minimum temperature falling to 3.4 degrees Celsius. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast said that the temperature might rise marginally on Monday before it dipping again. On Sunday, the minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for Delhi, was 3.4 degrees Celsius, five notches below the season’s normal, making it the lowest recording this season so far. The maximum temperature of the day was 22.4 degrees Celsius. Scientists said that because of a fairly good wind speed, which cleared the fog and kept the sky clear, the day time temperature rose. The Palam observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 6 degrees Celsius, while at the Lodi Road observatory, the temperature fell to 3.3 degrees Celsius. On Saturday, the minimum temperature at Safdarjung had been recorded at 3.9 degrees Celsius. Also Read: In the cold winter, keeping the Gods warmKuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that the cold winds from Jammu Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Ladakh were coming into the national capital, which had been keeping the temperature low. “From today (Sunday) evening, a western disturbance will impact the hills and its affect on Delhi will increase the minimum temperature of the city by one or two degrees on Monday,” Srivastava said.This relief, however, will be temporary, he said. “From Tuesday again, the minimum temperature will start to dip. It is also possible that it falls to around 3 degrees Celsius,” he added. Dense fog cover in the early hours of Sunday also led to a deterioration of air quality, which slipped from ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ category. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the overall air quality index (AQI) on Sunday was 321, categorised as ‘very poor’. On Saturday the AQI was 290 in the ‘poor’ zone. The IMD has forecast that because of the western disturbance, even though there will be no rainfall in Delhi or surrounding areas, it will lead to a spike in the moisture levels. This might in turn lead to an increase in pollution levels this week. Also Read: Srinagar records 2nd coldest December night of decade as intense cold wave sweeps J-KUnion ministry of earth science’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said the cold day conditions could intensify in the Delhi region and surface winds are likely to slow down. “The current better dispersion conditions are likely to decrease. Hence, AQI is forecasted to deteriorate to middle end of very poor category on December 21, and further deteriorate to the higher end of very poor on December 22, before falling further on December 23,” the Safar analysis said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-sees-season-s-coldest-day-at-3-4-c-next-week-may-be-colder/story-4V4FYjfRS7tMHKsMzeEBUL.html
21-12-2020||Delhi||Govt drafts plan for agricultural market in Tikri village, sets 2023 target||The state government has drafted a plan to set up an agricultural produce market in northwest Delhi’s Tikri village, equipped with a cold storage facility, an 8 MW solar generation plant, a pneumatic waste disposal system and a parking facility for 1,500 trucks, a senior government official said. The new market would help decongest Azadpur, the biggest agricultural produce market in Delhi, which receives around 5,000 trucks of fruits and vegetables per day that leads to severe traffic snarls in and around the market. The site for the new market, which has been pending for long, is located on the north-western periphery of Delhi, around 19 kilometres from Azadpur. The market will be located along the National Highway-1 and spread over an area of 70.62 acres. “Like Azadpur, the new market in Tikri too will deal with fruits and vegetables. It is expected to be ready by early-2023. The government plans to name it Nutri-Mall of Delhi,” the official. The senior official said that the project will have a built-up area of 2.75 million square feet, of which 1.8 million square feet has been allocated for a wholesale market, 0.7 million square feet to a retail market and 0.25 million square feet to cold storage and other facilities. “It will be Delhi’s first modern mandi (market). The new mandi is being planned by a group of experts, keeping in mind the best utilisation of space,” said Adil Khan, the chairperson of the agricultural produce market committee (APMC) in Azadpur, who is also a member of a committee supervising work related to the new market in Tikri. Mandi is a colloquial term for agricultural produce markets. Anil Malhotra, a wholesale trader based in Azadpur and a member of the APMC, said, “Space is a major problem in Azadpur. The new market will be a big relief. The land for the new market was procured by the Azadpur APMC more than 20 years ago and the government’s plan to construct a new market has missed several deadlines.” While presenting the budget in 2017, Delhi finance minister and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said that the work to set up a new market in Tikri will be completed by 2019. Senior government officials attributed the delay to hassles concerning permits from multiple agencies which, they said, have been settled now. “The delay, however, has given the government more time for better planning,” said the senior government official quoted above. Delhi currently has two mandis for grains, at Narela and Najafgarh, and four mandis for fruits and vegetables, at Azadpur, Ghazipur, Okhla and Keshopur, which are authorised by the government and managed by separate boards and committees. With only 800 hectares of agricultural land, Delhi is largely dependent on agricultural produce from other states. The mandis in Delhi broadly serve two purposes — first, they act as the lifeline for the supply of fruits, vegetables and food grains and second, they act as transit points for supply between states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-drafts-plan-for-agricultural-market-in-tikri-village-sets-2023-target/story-OLim7ieOfQHhv5eSnXNKKL.html
21-12-2020||Delhi||AAP to hold door-to-door campaign to highlight Rs 2,400 cr scam in MCDs||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday said they will organise protest marches and hold door-to-door campaigns across all 272 municipal wards in the city on Tuesday to protest against the alleged misappropriation of funds to the tune of Rs 2,400 crore by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-run civic bodies in Delhi. The BJP, however, dismissed the allegations as “baseless”.“AAP will take out padyatras in all 272 wards in Delhi on December 22 to highlight the Rs 2,500 crore scam in BJP-ruled MCDs. AAP workers will meet with the people in all wards and will inform them about this scam . They will visit every house to expose the BJP and its misdeeds in front of the people of Delhi. When BJP is claiming that there has been no scam in MCD, why are the party leaders scared of a CBI investigation into the matter,” said the AAP in-charge of municipal affairs Durgesh Pathak.On Friday, the Delhi Assembly had passed a resolution demanding a CBI probe into the matter.Delhi BJP’s spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “This is a baseless allegation. The purpose of daily propaganda by the AAP leaders is to malign the image of the BJP which rules all three MCDs. The AAP leaders themselves know that there has been no scam and that is the reason the Kejriwal government is not officially writing to the CBI for an inquiry.”The party has alleged that the north MCD waived off Rs 2,400 crore rent due from the south MCD, resulting in a loss to the public exchequer. The north civic body has denied any wrongdoing. The north civic body’s mayor, Jai Prakash deemed the allegations baseless and a diversionary tactic. The Delhi government has also launched an inquiry into the allegations. The inquiry will be headed by an official of the rank of an additional chief secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-to-hold-door-to-door-campaign-to-highlight-rs-2-400-crore-scam-in-mcds/story-4nVnWAbj8xtfOtFQxxoAvL.html
21-12-2020||Delhi||Call centre used to dupe foreigners busted; frauds amount to at least Rs 70 crore, say cops||The Delhi Police on Saturday busted a fake call centre in Peeragarhi and arrested 42 employees, who used to dupe foreigners by posing as officials of law enforcement agencies in phone calls. In the three years of their operation, the gang has duped nearly 3,500 citizens of the US and other countries of at least Rs 70 crore, said Anyesh Roy, the deputy commissioner of police (cyber crime unit). In one instance, they had managed to dupe an individual of $45,000 (over Rs 33 lakh), the officer said.The police said the employees were offered heavy incentives to keep persisting with the potential victims, by forcing to either “pay up” or face an immediate arrest for “imaginary offences.”For instance, the caller who made the $45,000 deal was offered an incentive of Rs 90,000 and the team leader and the deal “closer” got Rs 1,80,000 each, apart from their monthly salaries, said police.The DCP said that the racket was busted on Saturday after the police received a tip-off about 26 men and 16 women working at the fake call centre. Those arrested included the alleged owner, Rajat, and four team leaders.The officer said that the modus operandi was to call up foreigners and talk to them in their local accent. The caller would pose as an officer of the law enforcement agencies, such as the Social Security Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration or the US Marshal Services, depending on the country the victim belonged to.“They would tell the victims that they were found involved in a crime. For example, they would tell someone that their bank account was found to be making a financial transaction with a drug cartel in Colombia,” said the officer.The victims would then be threatened with an immediate arrest and given two choices. “The first option was to be immediately arrested, have their bank accounts frozen and assets seized before being able to pursue legal help. The other option was to go for a dispute resolution, which was quicker and simpler,” the officer said.Those who opted for the second option had the choice to either convert all the money in their bank accounts to Bitcoin or gift cards and transfer the same to the callers’ accounts. “There was a long written script which the callers followed. These calls often went on for four to five hours, during which the victim wouldn’t be allowed to disconnect the call,” the DCP said.If the caller — who was the lowest level employee in the hierarchy — managed to trap someone, his or her superiors would take over the call to finalise the deal. The new employees were usually hired through referrals of existing employees, but not before a rigorous interview, the DCP said.The employees’ salaries ranged from Rs 20,000, for a recruit, to Rs 75,000 for shift managers. “There were also New Year and Christmas bonuses, as well as holiday packages, offered for the employees,” the DCP said.The officer said that 90 digital devices and Rs 4.5 lakh in cash have been recovered so far, even as the police continue to probe the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/call-centre-used-to-dupe-foreigners-busted-frauds-amount-to-at-least-rs-70-crore-say-cops/story-oR2pxcwuowgjMuj91Xeh4N.html
21-12-2020||Delhi||From January 1, updated driving licence, registration certificate must for all drivers||If your driving licence or vehicle registration certificate has expired, you must apply for its renewal soon because a government move to exempt holders of lapsed documents from prosecutions is set to end on December 31.Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to curb its spread, motorists were exempted from challans or prosecution if found driving with expired documents such as driving licenses (DLs), registration certificates (RCs) and fitness certificates. Senior transport officials said that after being in place for nine months, the exemption would be lifted from January 1, 2021, unless there are specific directions from the ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) to extend it further. As per the amended Motor Vehicles (MV) Act, driving without a valid licence attracts a penalty of Rs 5,000. To prevent a backlog of applications and avoid long waiting periods for appointments, Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said he had directed the transport department to relax the rule in cases where an applicant is mandated to visit only a motor licensing office (MLO) located near the address mentioned in his application. “I held a meeting to review the application process of all transport-related documents. People can get their DLs and RCs renewed now as the provision is fully operational at all the 13 RTOs (regional transport offices) of Delhi. Since the exemption is till December 31, I request people to renew their documents by applying online,” said Gahlot. To apply for renewal of DLs, one can visit parivahan.gov.in, click on “driving licence-related services” and then again click on “DL services”, after which one needs to type out the DL number and fill out other details, upload documents and make a payment to book a slot to visit the nearest RTO. At the RTO, the biometric details will be checked and documents verified, after which a DL will be issued. The process is similar to renew RCs. Records with the state transport department showed that as of Sunday the waiting period to get an appointment at an RTO for renewal of DL —post online application submission — ranged from two to 60 days. “This month, the rush to get DLs and RCs has increased . But it is manageable as each of the 13 RTOs is capable of processing 200 renewal requests every day. Also, the process of renewal is far easier than getting a fresh document,” said KK Dahiya, special commissioner (transport). He said the rush was more also because, under the amended MV Act, DLs, if not renewed within a year of their expiry date, are deemed invalid and a motorist then has to start from scratch by applying for a learner’s license and appearing for all the tests again. Earlier, a DL could be renewed anytime within five years of the date of expiry.The problem, however, is being faced by those who have applied for a learner’s or a permanent driving license as the waiting time to visit the RTO and give the required tests has gone up to as long as three months in some busy zones — like Janakpuri and Loni.Minister Gahlot said that in the review meeting held last week, it was decided that the number of appointments or slots that will be booked per day per RTO will be increased to pre-Covid times. For this, the transport department has been asked to analyse demand in the month of January and fix the number of slots accordingly. “Directions have been issued to ensure that the waiting period should not be more than 45 days in any zone. I have asked the transport department to decongest some of the busy RTOs by shifting applications to the less crowded ones. The idea is to evenly distribute the load among all 13 RTOs so as to reduce the waiting periods,” Gahlot said. He said it was found that many are failing the driving tests on the automated test tracks despite having good driving skills because of the sensors and cameras being “over-sensitive”. “A committee has been constituted to check the entire system operating the automated test tracks. The panel will also revisit videos of those who have failed the tests to understand the problems better. Also, I have asked the MLOs to strictly keep out-of-turn cases for DLs and RCs only up to 5% of the total slots booked on any day. Reasons will have to be cited for use of this discretion in each out-of-turn case,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/from-january-1-updated-driving-licence-registration-certificate-must-for-all-drivers/story-421EcoJA9cpjv5vsHeiozN.html
21-12-2020||Delhi||Virtual carols, mass: Tied down by curbs, Christmas spirit in Delhi goes online||With Delhi still recording over a thousand Covid-19 cases every day, Christmas celebrations in the Capital have largely moved online with churches switching to online mass and carolling as churches and religious groups work to keep the festive cheer alive on digital platforms.Christmas celebrations across the world revolve around the traditions of the Christmas tree, the guiding star, nativity scenes, songs, and skits on the birth of Jesus along with the rendering of Christmas carols and gift-giving among other revelries.Reverend Mohit Hitter, priest in charge of the Cathedral Church of the Redemption, said celebrations have moved online due to the limit on gatherings. “We are observing an online mass. Due to the restrictions on large gathering and rules of physical distancing, we cannot have carols in person. So people are carolling at home and we share these videos on social media and chat platforms. All other events, too, have moved online and we will livestream them,” he said.He added that most members of the church have been attending mass online since the pandemic struck. “People outside the community too have reached out to us, and said they miss out on Christmas celebrations, food, and the general festive spirit. We are not happy but there will be a Christmas next year as well and maybe we could double up the celebrations then,” he said.Norris Pritam, vice-president of the New Delhi YMCA, said the organisation had organised several virtual Christmas music concerts last week that were watched by hundreds. On Sunday, the organisation also participated in a virtual candlelight service by the Christ Methodist Church playing pre-recorded Christmas carols in Hindi and English.“We had a pipe-organ concert where people were playing the instrument from 10 different locations including one person each in Germany and South Korea. Among these, two organists from India may have had connectivity problems that disrupted the sync. So we asked them to record and send their bits to us, and we played them from our end,” he said. The nearly two-hour-long concert played 21 carols including O Come All Ye Faithful, Joy to The World, and O Little Town of Bethlehem.Royall McLaren, director at Delhi Christian Chorus, the oldest choir group in the Capital, said, “We have been unable to practise during the pandemic, so there will be no concerts, online or offline, because we need to work for at least three or four months. This is the first time we will not be performing during Christmas in the past 50 years.”Similarly, the Capital City Minstrels (CCM), a popular choir group in the city, said they will record their carols and post it on social media. Neeraj Debraj, CCM president, said, “It is impossible to perform live concerts and coordinate multiple voices using video-conferencing apps. The only way virtual concerts can work is if soloists are performing. We were engaged in virtual rehearsals since June where separate instrumental tracks were given to each choir singer as per their classification (tenor, base, soprano, alto etc) and everybody would sing their part. These tracks will be brought together by a video editor to create a comprehensive choir recital.”Neena George, 55, a resident of Dwarka who works as a nurse, said apart from the midnight service, this year, people will also miss the community activities. “We will stream the mass virtually this year. But carolling and singing competitions will be missing. Usually, a big part of the Christmas tradition is to go for the cake-mixing, where people gather in large numbers and go to a bakery. The activity is an all-nighter and was a big part of our Christmas celebrations. But we will be missing that as well this year.”While many churches have switched to digital options, a few churches across the capital are allowing services in smaller numbers following all Covid-19 safety guidelines. Reverend Sunil Ghazan, presbyter-in-charge of St Martin’s Church in Delhi Cantonment, said their church will reopen on Sunday with Covid-19 protocols in place. They had shut in November after the government capped gatherings at 50 people at a time.“Upon revisiting the guidelines, we understood that 50% of the existing capacity was allowed. So, we will be having the worship service beginning Sunday and will also continue with the virtual streaming of services. Safety protocols like compulsory mask and gloves, alternate seating arrangements, constant sanitization, thermal screening etc will be followed. We will also discourage the elderly and children below 14 years of age from coming to the church,” he said.Rev Ghazan, who is also the secretary of the Diocese of Delhi, said that a few more churches under the Church of North India are also likely to reopen before Christmas. “For Christmas, our church (St Martin’s Church) will be taking bookings for the visit over WhatsApp. If it is filled, we may hold another service,” he said.However, unlike previous years, when the days leading up to Christmas would be filled with nativity plays by Sunday school children, community lunches or dinners, celebrations with underprivileged children, and choir concerts, most of these events will take place online this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/virtual-carols-mass-tied-down-by-curbs-christmas-spirit-in-delhi-goes-online/story-O4w7iKun1HmVfdjVnGO2sL.html

21-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers to start relay hunger strike from today to mount pressure on govt||Farmer unions protesting at Delhi’s borders on Sunday, decided to step up pressure on the government to repeal the new farm laws and announced a relay hunger strike at all the protest sites from Monday onwards, while asking agitators from across the country to join them.Addressing a press conference at the Singhu Border on Sunday evening, Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav said, “We have decided to start a 24-hour relay hunger strike, starting Monday, at all the protest sites in Delhi as part of our ongoing agitation. At least 11 people will sit on strike at a time. We request farmers protesting in different parts of the country to also join us.”The agitation at Delhi’s four key borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate, and Chilla – entered into its 25th day on Sunday. The farmer union leaders on Sunday also requested all agitating farmers to skip a meal on December 23, which is celebrated as Kisan Diwas (farmers’ day) every year. Rakesh Tikait, leader of Bharatiya Kisan Union Tikait (BKU) faction in Uttar Pradesh, said, “On this Kisan Diwas, farmers across the country will skip a meal. Those who provide food to the nation will stay hungry because of the government’s anti-farmer’s stance. I request everyone not to cook lunch that day and join the farmers.”Also Read| Rs 10 to Rs 1 lakh: People from different walks of life donate for farmers’ causeAppealing to the agitating farmers to maintain peace at the protesting site, farmer leader Jasbir Singh Bhatti said, “The government has been trying to defame the ongoing movement. They have been propagating propaganda against us. I request the government not to defame us and appeal to the protesting farmers, especially the youth, to maintain peace.”Farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dalewal said that the agitating farmers will make all toll plazas free in Haryana between December 25 and 27. On Sunday, farmers protesting at Delhi borders observed ‘shaheedi diwas’ and paid tribute to those who have lost their lives in the agitation against the three farm laws. At Singhu borders, posters and banners with photos of farmers who died during the protests were put up at different locations and people were seen lighting candles and offering floral tributes.Joginder Singh, a farmer from Bhatinda who has been camping at the Singhu border since November 27, said, “At least 24 farmers have died in the last 25 days across the country. But the government is still not listening to our demands. Their deaths will not go to waste. We won’t go home till the government withdraws the three new farm laws. We are ready to die in this battle like our brothers.”Similarly, farmers also held candle light marches at different locations to mourn the deaths of fellow protesters. Addressing a gathering at Ghazipur border, VM Singh, leader of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, said, “Their sacrifice has further strengthened our movement. We will have to take care of their families now.”Also Read: Farmers rally to pay tribute to protesters who died during farm laws agitationAt the Chilla border, protesting farmers were seen paying tributes to those who died during the ongoing agitation.

21-12-2020||Delhi||A wall of requirements set up at Chilla protest site||A banner, serving as a “wall” that lists essential items, has been set up at the Chilla border protest site to help farmers seek and receive daily necessities to keep them going with their agitation. Set up on Sunday evening by a group of half-a-dozen working professionals and students, this wall serves as a reception point for donations at the site, which is one of the four border points in New Delhi, where farmers are agitating. Farmers are being urged to mention essential items, if not already available at counters, on the wall. As of Sunday evening, the only requirement was for a pair of slippers, which the organisers hurried to fetch. “If someone doesn’t donate the slipper, we will procure them,” said Anukriti Singh, who works for an NGO and is one of the organisers of this facility. Also Read| They have turned our lives upside down: Singhu village on farm laws, stirBesides the slippers, the wall received a host of essential items such as toothpaste, blankets and socks. They were collected by the farmers as soon as they were placed. “I had arrived here with very basic essentials. I did not even have a toothpaste. I picked up one paste and a blanket to keep me warm,” said Paramjeet Singh, a farmer from Chandpur village in Bijnor. Apart from the usual essential items, the organisers have also stocked the place with Neem Datun. “This wall is on the concept of Neki Ki Deewaar, in which those with extra items donate them here and those needing them collect them. We expect the wall to be filled with writings of essential items needed and then those to be supplied by Good Samaritans,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-wall-of-requirements-set-up-at-chilla-protest-site/story-GAWBVk1UoI6EvsfHpdZhTP.html
21-12-2020||Delhi||Rs 10 to Rs 1 lakh: People from different walks of life donate for farmers’ cause||At Delhi’s Singhu border, four farmers have been assigned the critical job of accepting voluntary donations and documenting the list of contributors daily. From donations of Rs 10 to a lakh rupees, monetary aid has been pouring in at the border, a road between Delhi and Haryana, which has been at the centre of the protest against the three farm laws. For the last 20 days, Amreek Singh, Jasbinder Singh, Kamaljeet Singh and Kuldeep Singh sit behind a makeshift stage between 9am and 5pm with their registers, to note down the names, contact numbers, and addresses of their donors, only after which they accept the fund. They also provide an acknowledgement slip to the donors and sometimes, announce the name of the donors from the stage. According to their register entries, seen by HT, the donations range between Rs 10 and Rs 1 lakh. Among the donors are farmers, workers, businessmen, teachers, students, activists, writers and homemakers. Jasbinder Singh, a member of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha, a Punjab organisation, said, “The movement is supported by people from different walks of life. People are contributing according to their economic status. The contributions range from Rs 10 to Rs 50 and from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh.” The farmers said that they receive a contribution of Rs 2 to Rs 3 lakh daily. “We collect the money, document the record and then submit the amount to our management committee by the end of the day. These funds are used on the daily expenses for the stage, including microphones, speakers, mats and tents. We have recently provided 25 large waterproof tents and hundreds of tarpaulin sheets to the protesting farmers from the same funds. Besides, we have decided to help the families of farmers who lost their lives during the protest with these donations,” said Amreek Singh, a member of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Kadian). Amid allegations of farmers receiving “foreign funding” and “funds for their protests”, he said that a section of people is propagating a “false narrative”. “They are saying that farmers are receiving money from Canada and other foreign countries. Those who are sending money are also our brothers and sons. They are not terrorists. Besides, people should know we are not asking for even a penny from anyone. People from across the states and different walks of life are willingly contributing for the cause,” Amreek Singh said. On Sunday, around 300 people had contributed by 4pm. The majority of them, according to the entries, were from Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, and Punjab. Some of the donors were also from the southern states of Telangana and Karnataka. Among them was Zeba, a social activist from Delhi. “None will be able to survive without farmers. We are here because of them. If farmers are fighting for a cause, we should help them,” she said. Amarjeet Kumar, of Bihar, who works as a farm labourer in Punjab’s Ludhiana district, also contributed Rs 100 on Sunday. “If farmers will not be there, who will give us work? I just want to be a part of this historic movement with my small contribution,” he said. Baljeet Singh, the head of the IT cell set up by farmers under the banner of Kisan Ekta Morcha, said, “We have not even put up posters and banners requesting people for donations. They are walking in to contribute. The contributions are regularly helping us manage the stage and other works here. We will soon be installing two 20x10 foot digital screens at the protest site so that farmers can see what is happening on the stage. The cost of maintenance of those screens will be Rs 15,000 per day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rs1-to-rs-1-lakh-people-from-different-walks-of-life-donate-for-farmers-cause/story-gRK61mnvwdgDjp1rW5MMdO.html
21-12-2020||Gurugram||GMDA starts installing smart cameras to detect red light violations||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has started installing 315 red light violation detection (RLVD) cameras at 29 locations across the city, officials said on Saturday.According to GMDA officials, the RLVD cameras will be placed atop traffic signals to capture the entire intersection or crossing and spot red-light violations. They further said that the cameras have been linked to the traffic signals, with light sensors detecting the changes.The cameras will automatically turn on as soon as the traffic light turns red and subsequently, the automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) will capture the image or the video of the number plate of the offenders’ vehicle and automatically send it to the centralised server at the traffic police tower in Sushant Lok-1 as well as the GMDA’s integrated command and control centre (ICCC) in Sector 44.Nippon Electric Company (NEC) is the GMDA’s main contractor for the project as a master system integrator.GMDA officials said that based on the image or video, the software will automatically generate an e-challan and send an SMS, along with the evidence, to the registered owners of the vehicles.“At least 60 RLVD cameras have so far been installed. Work on installing the remaining cameras is ongoing and we are aiming at completing the project by mid-2021,” said Kapil Bardeja, chief executive officer (CEO) of Vehant Technologies, GMDA’s sub-contractor for the project.The total cost of the project is Rs 60 crore and the 29 locations include Bakhtawar Chowk, Rezangla Chowk, MG Road, Galleria Market, Jharsa Chowk, Iffco Chowk, Huda City Centre, ABW Tower, Rajiv Chowk, Subhash Chowk, Bristol Chowk, Vatika Chowk, Signature Tower, Hero Honda Chowk, IMT Manesar Chowk, Atul Kataria Chowk, and Sector 55/56 crossing.The GMDA’s Smart City advisor, who did not wish to be named, said that RLVD cameras are part of GMDA’s bigger objective of installing 2,000 smart cameras across the city. The official said that besides RLVD cameras, there are four other types of smart cameras.“The RLVD and ANPR will be used for traffic violation purposes. Besides these, the GMDA is also installing fixed cameras which would be used for surveillance and artificial intelligence, Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras that will provide a 360-degree view of an important street or landmark, and dome cameras, which would be installed in specific public areas for face detection purposes,” the advisor said.He said that in the first phase, the GMDA is looking to install 1,200 smart cameras at 222 locations and 800 cameras at 136 locations in the next phase. “We had carried out a survey and identified 358 locations falling under GMDA’s jurisdiction where smart cameras needed to be installed. Of the 358, we further identified 222 locations such as major road networks, flyovers, crossings, underpasses, and junctions where smart cameras need to be installed on priority. We are aiming to finish the first phase work by March 31 next year,” the advisor said.Of the 1,200 smart cameras in the first phase, more than 700 have already been installed in the city, as per GMDA calculations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-starts-installing-smart-cameras-to-detect-red-light-violations/story-UEhq2jJ1zPq13ixsdkdTjI.html
21-12-2020||Delhi||DDA requests Delhi govt to revise compensatory plantation policy||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has requested the Delhi government to revise the compensatory plantation norms—10 saplings have to be planted for every tree that is cut—under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, as it is increasingly becoming difficult to provide land for compensatory plantation in the Capital.Citing land constraints, the land-owning agency has requested the government to revise the number of trees to be planted under compensatory plantation from 10 saplings to two for every tree that is cut.DDA officials said that in this financial year alone they have received compensatory plantation requests from various development agencies for approximately three lakh trees, for which 300 hectares of area is required.Citing the increase in Delhi’s green cover from 268 sqkm to 324 sqkm in 2019, DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said that the Delhi government’s compensatory plantation policy of planting trees in 1:10 ratio has played an important role.Jain said, “Given the land constraints, it is becoming increasingly difficult to support compensatory plantation and compensatory afforestation for development projects. Therefore, having achieved its purpose, the policy of Delhi government needs to be revisited. We have taken up this issue with the Delhi government.”He added, “As per the third-party audit conducted by Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, the survival rate of saplings planted by DDA is in the range of 80-90%.”A senior official with the environment department, requesting anonymity, said, “We have received the DDA’s proposal. The matter was discussed and is under consideration, but no decision has been taken so far.”Apart from compensatory plantation, the Delhi government recently approved a tree transplantation policy under which development agencies have to transplant 80% of the trees affected by their projects to a new location. A senior DDA official said that more land is required for transplantation.The official said compensatory plantation is done in areas earmarked as green spaces for recreational purpose in the master plan. As per the Master Plan of Delhi-2021, “green /recreational use constitutes 8,722 hectare of land (including 1,577 hectare under the Northern, Southern and Central Ridge)”. Compensation plantation is mainly done in green spaces other than the ridge area.A senior DDA official said that over the years, land for compensatory plantation allotted to the development agency has been part of biodiversity parks, the Yamuna floodplains, district and regional parks, etc. The compensatory plantation is done either by the development agency such as NHAI, PWD, DMRC etc itself or the forest department on behalf of the development agency. DDA will be doing compensatory plantation for various agencies for the first time this year due to land constraints.This year, DDA has allotted land to plant around 298,000 saplings and allotted 50 hectares in Dwarka to various development agencies. In the past few years, it has allotted land for over 200,000 saplings for compensatory plantation to various agencies, said a senior DDA official.The official said, “For the first time, we are now providing land for compensatory plantation before meeting our annual plantation targets. This time we will be doing compensatory plantation for various agencies. As for tree transplantation, we have told agencies to do it near the project site.”While environmentalists and urban planners agree that availability of land is an issue, they say it is now time to prioritise development projects. Some agree that there is a need to re-look at the compensatory plantation policy.Vijay Dhasmana, ecologist and curator of Aravali Biodiversity Park, Gurugram, said, “Land is a scarce resource. The DDA is right in their view that there will be no land left if we continue with present compensatory plantation guidelines. The problem is that there is no vision for holistic development of the city.”AK Jain, former DDA planning commissioner, said that the present policy has been a deterrent against indiscriminate tree cutting for development projects and people, therefore, it should continue. “There is a need to prioritise development projects in order to decongest the city. As for shortage of land, it shouldn’t be just DDA’s responsibility to provide land. The Delhi government has large land parcels in the green belt along the Delhi Haryana border which can be used for compensatory plantation.”Environmentalist Kanchi Kohli, a researcher with the Centre for Policy Research, said, “The proposal represents an urban imagination which treats trees and green public spaces as a burden. We start with proposals for tree removal, rather than tree protection. If we continue to approach urban land only as real estate and to build concrete infrastructure, there will never be enough land for compensatory plantation. We have at least four decades of evidence to show compensatory afforestation has been a failure, that too by design.”But considering the pace at which development work is going on in the city, especially in urbanised areas, some experts say that there is a need to rework the compensatory plantation policy.Sabyasachi Das, former DDA planning commissioner, said that plantation can’t be done on land earmarked for commercial or other development uses as future requirements have to be kept in mind. “Earlier, we used to give land on the Yamuna floodplains. But there is a limit to which plantation can be done in the floodplains. Ideally, a majority of compensatory plantation or transplantation should be done near the project site. There is a need to reduce the amount of compensatory plantation as it will become difficult to undertake development projects in the future. A solution has to be found,” said Das.Dhasmana says that there is a need to rework the compensatory plantation policy but for a different reason. “There is a need to review the policy, as compensatory plantation done in the city is a complete eyewash. The idea is flawed as just planting trees anywhere is not good enough; we have to create habitats. Unfortunately, we are seeing even land rich in wilderness being used for compensatory plantation. This is not how it should be,” Dhasmana said.The Delhi government refused to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-requests-delhi-govt-to-revise-compensatory-plantation-policy/story-uSZzLnhYOQaquhvkWSmvnL.html

21-12-2020||Pune||Bhama Askhed water project to be inaugurated on Jan 1||From January 1, the residents of eastern parts of the city will avail drinking water facility of Bhama Askhed dam project. The plan saw many delays, including farmer protests, since it was kick-started 10 years ago. Rescheduled many times, the project will be officially operational on January 1, said Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol. The project, which saw a six-year delay since its 2014 official deadline, has been commissioned for testing. “We had scheduled the inauguration of the project on December 20. However, both the leaders – former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar – were busy on that day. So, we have decided to launch the project on the first day of new year,” said Mohol. Earlier, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) wanted the project to be inaugurated by Sharad Pawar, though the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has majority in PMC, decided to also invite Fadnavis in whose tenure the plan was expedited. PMC planned the project in 2011 to bring 2.64 TMC (thousand million litres cubic feet) water from Bhama-Askhed, 42 km from Pune, through a closed pipeline to supply water to the eastern part of the city, including Kharadi, Yerawada, Dhanori, Wadgaonsheri, Vishrantwadi, Kalas and Vidyanagar. The facility will supply water to around 14 lakh residents. PMC had sent a project proposal to the Centre to get funds under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNRUM). The Centre sanctioned the project in 2013 while accepting to pay 50 per cent amount of the total cost estimated to be Rs 350 crore. PMC added 30 per cent and the state gave shares of 20 per cent to complete the project. The project was divided into six stages. The work started in January 2014 with deadline slated for March 2017. However, due to agitation of Bhama-Askhed Project affected persons (PAP), work was halted more than 10 times. Finally, the corporation gave Rs 135 crore to PAP and the project completed by the end of 2020. Prashant Waghmare, PMC city engineer said, “This is the first project of a corporation in which more than 70 per cent of work was done outside the corporation limit. It is the civic body’s achievement. PMC hasn’t done any such big project of water work till date.” With project being commissioned, Pune will be getting water from five dams including Khadakwasla, Panshet, Warasgaon, Temghar and Bhama Askhed. Anirudha Pawaskar, chief superintendent engineer of the water supply department said, “It is true that the project has been delayed. But, it was not the fault of the civic body. There is little escalation of project cost due to delay.” Sanjay Kadu, executive engineer of PMC water supply department who is part of the project said, “We have started water testing. We will soon start regular water supply to the eastern part of the city.” Ashish Adsul, IT professional and resident of Vishrantwadi area said, “We have been getting reports of villagers halting Bhama-Askhed water work project since the past five years. We even thought that the plan will not see the light of day due to villagers’ agitation and political interference. We are happy that we will get regular water supply in 2021. It is good news. Though the project has been delayed, we are happy now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bhama-askhed-water-project-to-be-inaugurated-on-jan-1/story-PgfoxAbUiYbfsK91pYdwGM.html

21-12-2020||Pune||Many migratory birds miss Bhigwan winter date||The water body at Bhigwan near Pune is a winter destination for migratory flamingos, but this year, the turnout has been sparse. Girish Jathar, assistant director, Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), says that there are 77 species of migratory birds that visit Bhigwan during the winter, but the flamingos are the major attraction. “There are 43 species of water land birds and 34 species of migratory land birds, which is a total of 77 species of migratory birds. Flamingos are the most popular ones. A fairly good number of these birds can be seen,” said Jathar. Talking about the flamingos, Jathar said that these birds breed in the Rann of Kutch. “From there they migrate locally to all parts of the country. Bhigwan is one of them. Flamingos can be seen in other parts of the country like the Chilka lake in Odisha,” said Jathar. Speaking about the decline in flamingo population this season, Dharmaraj Patil, a city-based ornithologist, said “It seems the birds are late. Bhigwan is a popular spot for bird watchers as the maximum number of birds are flamingos. Due to ecotourism, a lot of young youth from the small town are working as local guides. They have informed us that this year, the numbers of flamingos are low.” He added that aside from the wetlands, there are the grasslands where a lot of raptors can be seen. “The number of raptors, like eagles and harriers are also few in number. Wolves are also seen in the area, but the number this time is less,” said Patil. Talking about the reason, he said that the erratic climate is one of the major reasons. “Due to erratic weather, this year as well as the last year, we have seen that the mud habitat has been affected. As it is a wetland, the land fills up quickly. Last year, the rain was heavy. This year, relatively, the rains were normal, but there is a possibility that the groundwater table was high. This could be one of the reasons,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/low-turnout-of-migratory-birds-at-bhigwan/story-ig1KahEbF1JmkT8MFxHA9L.html
21-12-2020||Mumbai||Special students, schools in Maharashtra find a way in new normal||After the state went into its Covid-19-enforced lockdown in March, 12-year-old Sara Malshe, a child with special needs, found it hard to cope with the new normal as schools were shut. “We send her to a special school where she has friends and teachers who encourage her every day. But when all social interactions stopped, she was really not able to cope. She would not sit for online classes and often had difficulty in getting instructions,” says Divya, Sarah’s mother. For children with special needs, adapting to the new normal of online classes is a tough battle as physical interaction with friends and teachers is vital. However, schools, parents and the children themselves are putting their best efforts to combat the situation. “Nine months into the lockdown, children with special needs have faced a lot of challenges. Initially, there were issues with getting them to attend online classes. But now with the help of parents and through the right use of technology, these children are trying to cope,” says Sunil Satpute, founder of Gharkul, a special school in Santacruz. The school was started for students with special needs from low-income backgrounds. Satpute says the school manages to get parents involved in supporting their children to learn, but in many poor households, where parents have to go out for work, children are still not able to attend classes. “We do a lot of sessions with them which are interactive in nature. But there are still about 50% students who do not attend them. When we ask their parents, they give us reasons like unavailability of network, compulsions of going out to work, among others. We are still trying our best to bring each and every child into the current learning mode, but the challenge is definitely big,” adds Satpute. Geetha Sequeira, a special educator and a former teacher at Childreach, a special school, says, an online-only mode has turned out to be difficult for children with special needs. “It is a nightmarish experience for them as they cannot eat lunch with their friends and have no outdoor sessions for physical education as they had in school. While this affects all kids, special kids are more affected as they already have learning challenges and need the support system at school,” she says. Manjushree Patil, founder-director at Aatman Academy, an inclusive school in Thane, says the school has been able to get students acquainted with the new normal gradually.“We need to first understand that children with special needs are a broad spectrum and the challenges vary depending on what category you are referring to,” says Patil. For these students, online learning has been made an enjoyable experience by integrating everything from art to music into their classes. “Of course, there are times when children face difficulties in paying attention to online sessions, but then we rope in parents and ask them to support from home,” Patil adds. Parents, however, say they prefer sending children to school once they reopen. “At least for a few activities it would be nice to send the children [to school] if all precautions are taken care of. Children with learning difficulties also need to see their teachers once in a while, “says Kshama Mhatre, whose son Rian studies in a south Mumbai-based special school. ,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/special-students-schools-in-maharashtra-find-a-way-in-new-normal/story-sIjtCl1aEma2k4P3xBVwvO.html
21-12-2020||Indore||Indore: Study finds gradual rise in resistance to Covid-19||Indore, the worst-hit district by Covid-19 in Madhya Pradesh, has recorded a gradual increase in resistance to the infection among common people over the past three months, a study has revealed.The study was conducted by the blood bank of the Government Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital (MYH).Talking to PTI quoting the survey, Dr Ashok Yadav, the head of MYH’s blood bank, said, “We tested antibodies of 1,323, 1,128 and 1,590 blood samples during September, October and November respectively. Of these, IgG antibodies against Covid-19 have been detected in 197, 367 and 615 samples respectively.” An analysis of the data showed that out of a total of 4,041 samples of new blood deposited in the MYH blood bank in the last three months, IgG antibodies were found in 29 per cent (1,179) samples.Yadav said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved ELISA kit was used for the antibody tests.The blood samples of people in the age group of 18 to 60 years were randomly selected for the tests. However, samples from individuals, who recovered from Covid-19, were not included.“Our study also shows that there was a month-on-month increase in immunity against Covid-19 in the city between September and November,” Yadav said.Officials said that in a sero-survey conducted between August 11 and 23 in the city, antibodies against coronavirus were found only in 7.72 per cent of the participants.During this survey, the blood samples of 7,103 people were collected with the help of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) of the central government.According to the official information, a total of 46,971 Covid-19 patients have been found in Indore district from 24 March to 8 December. Of these, 796 have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/indore/indore-study-finds-gradual-rise-in-resistance-to-covid-19/story-OzjfNslJV5L5po7dhE9ZEI.html
21-12-2020||World||2 found guilty of manslaughter for deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants in England||Two members of an international people-smuggling gang were convicted of manslaughter on Monday over the deaths of 39 people from Vietnam whose bodies were found in the back of a container truck in southeastern England.A jury at London’s Central Criminal Court found Romanian mechanic Gheorghe Nica, 43, and Northern Irish truck driver Eamonn Harrison, 24, guilty of the deaths of the Vietnamese nationals, who were discovered dead in the English town of Grays.The victims, aged between 15 and 44, were found on October 23, 2019, inside a refrigerated container that had arrived by ferry from Belgium. The migrants came from impoverished villages and had paid people-smugglers thousands of dollars to take them on risky journeys to what they hoped would be better lives abroad.Prosecutors said Harrison drove the container to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge for transport to the UK Nica was described as the smuggling gang’s ringleader.Two other suspects, Christopher Kennedy and Valentin Calota, were also convicted of people-smuggling on Monday at the end of a 10-week trial.Several others have pleaded guilty in the case, including hauling company boss Ronan Hughes, 41, and truck driver Maurice Robinson, 26, who picked up the container in England and has admitted 39 counts of manslaughter.Prosecutors said all the suspects were part of a gang that charged about 13,000 pounds ($17,000) per person to transport migrants in trailers through the Channel Tunnel or by boat.Jurors heard harrowing evidence about the final hours of the victims, who tried to call Vietnam’s emergency number to summon help as air in the container ran out. When they could not get a mobile phone signal, some recorded goodbye messages to their families.The trapped migrants — who included a bricklayer, a restaurant worker, a nail bar technician, a budding beautician and a university graduate — used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof of the refrigerated container, but only managed to dent it.“There was no way out, and no-one to hear them, no-one to help them,” prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones said during the trial.The judge said the defendants would be sentenced in January. The maximum sentence for people-smuggling is 14 years in prison, while manslaughter carries a maximum life sentence.Kelly Matthews of Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service said that “nothing can bring back the lives lost on that day or the loss caused by the horrible, unlawful and dangerous actions of these defendants.“But we hope these convictions bring some measure of solace to the families in the knowledge that justice has been done,” Matthews said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-found-guilty-of-manslaughter-for-deaths-of-39-vietnamese-migrants-in-england/story-XeMcDJhpDBlXiUlv6y21KP.html

21-12-2020||World||Joe Biden names additional members to National Economic Council||U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden on Monday named additional members of the National Economic Council, rounding out his economic policymaking team with people his transition office said would help lift Americans out of the economic crisis caused by COVID-19.David Kamin, an official in former President Barack Obama’s White House, will be the NEC deputy director, and Bharat Ramamurti, a former top economic adviser to Senator Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign, will serve as NEC deputy director for Financial Reform and Consumer Protection, Biden’s team said in a statement.Joelle Gamble will be Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, it added.“This is no time to build back the way things were before — this is the moment to build a new American economy that works for all,” Biden said in the statement.The appointments would help “lift all Americans out of the current economic crisis — and build a strong, inclusive, and more resilient economy for the future,” the statement said.Earlier in December, Biden named Brian Deese, who helped lead Obama’s efforts to bail out the automotive industry and negotiate the Paris climate agreement, to lead the council, which coordinates the country’s economic policymaking.Biden, a Democrat, beat Republican President Donald Trump in November’s election, in part by running on a platform to ease U.S. economic inequality and reduce the country’s reliance on fossil fuels.U.S. congressional leaders reached agreement on Sunday on a $900 billion package to provide the first new aid in months to an economy and individuals battered by the surging coronavirus pandemic, the largest crisis facing Biden after his Jan. 20 inauguration.Outgoing U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview on Monday that he had spoken several times with Biden’s nominee to replace him, former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen.“We are cooperating with the transition team, and I’ve had several direct sessions with her to tell her about many of the Treasury priorities and what needs to be done,” said Mnuchin, who overlapped with Yellen during her last year on the Fed before Trump replaced her.

21-12-2020||World||Vatican permits use of Covid-19 vaccines made using aborted foetal tissue||The Vatican told Roman Catholics on Monday that it was morally acceptable to use Covid-19 vaccines even if their production employed cell lines drawn from tissues of aborted foetuses.A note from the Vatican’s doctrinal congregation, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, said the use of such vaccines was permitted as long as there were no alternatives.Both the Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc vaccines have some connection to cell lines that originated with tissue from abortions in the last century, according to the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), which issued a separate note to American Catholics last week.The Vatican note said the granting of moral legitimacy was related to the principle “differing degrees of responsibility of cooperation in evil.”This meant that because the pandemic is such a grave danger, such vaccines “can be used in good conscience with the certain knowledge that (it) does not constitute formal cooperation with the abortion from which the cells used in production of the vaccines derive,” the note said.In the absence of safe vaccines made from other sources, “it is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted foetuses in their research and production process.”The American bishops said the vaccines employed cell lines drawn from tissue obtained from two abortions that took place in the 1960s and 1970s and that often have been replicated since.The Vatican note said use of such vaccines “does not in itself constitute a legitimation, even indirect, of the practice of abortion”.It urged the pharmaceutical industry to develop completely ethical vaccines and governments and international organisations to make them accessible to poorer nations.The Vatican note said that while the use of vaccines was voluntary, “the common good may recommend vaccination, especially to protect the weakest and most exposed”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vatican-permits-use-of-covid-19-vaccines-made-using-aborted-foetal-tissue/story-VHLFFDlXvQdiMzUnjrsBSN.html
21-12-2020||World||First batch of coronavirus vaccines arrive in Singapore||The first batch of coronavirus vaccines arrived in Singapore on Monday on a flight from Brussels, according to a statement from Deutsche Post AG-owned DHL that didn’t specify which pharmaceutical company made the jabs.Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said earlier this month that the nation has approved the use of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s vaccine and expects the first shipments by the end of December. Advance purchase agreements have also been made with other promising candidates, including those from Moderna Inc. and Sinovac Biotech Ltd., he said.“The cargo arrived at Singapore’s Changi International Airport on Dec. 21 where DHL handled the customs clearance and final delivery to a designated location in Singapore,” the logistics company said. DHL will also “handle the return of these special shipper boxes to Europe.”Temperature trackers equipped with GPS were packed within each thermal shipping box to provide visibility throughout the vaccine’s journey, according to DHL’s statement.Singapore-based ground handling operator SATS Ltd. has increased daily production of dry ice to around 4.5 tons in anticipation of the vaccines, which must be stored at ultra-low temperatures.To provide global coverage over the next two years, DHL has estimated that about 15 million cooling boxes will be required across various supply chains.Singapore has set aside more than S$1 billion ($750 million) for vaccines and should have enough for its around 5.5 million-strong population by the third quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-batch-of-coronavirus-vaccines-arrive-in-singapore/story-zsqTpAS1wUjnLIdkN57tII.html

Until December 31, flights will be suspended while the passengers from all transit flights arriving from the UK scheduled to reach India by December 22 will be subjected to mandatory RT-PCR tests on arrival.The new variant of coronavirus is believed to spread faster than its previous strains. On Sunday, the authorities admitted that a more infectious new coronavirus strain was spreading “out of control” as they imposed strictest of measures to check the spread.The list of countries also includes Russia, Hong Kong, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Canada, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia etc. With this international airports of the UK are going to suffer a major drop in air traffic which was already suffering due to the pandemic. Here is the list of international airports to be impacted by the temporary suspension: London HeathrowBritain’s biggest and Europe’s one of the busiest by international passenger traffic, London Heathrow airport will see a significant drop in air traffic. It is the major international airport of London. Until 2019, the airport was handling a record 80.8 million passengers, as per a report.Gatwick AirportGatwick Airport is one of the six major international airports in the UK. It is the second-busiest airport by total passenger traffic in the UK, after Heathrow Airport and is tenth-busiest airport in Europe.Manchester airportIn 2019, the Manchester airport was the third busiest airport of the UK in terms of passenger number. It is the only airport after Heathrow to have two runways over 2,999 metre in length.London Stansted AirportLocated in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex, London Stansted Airport serves over 160 destinations across Europe, Asia and Africa. In 2015, it was the fourth busiest airport.London Luton AirportPreviously called Luton international airport, it is located in the east of Luton town of Bedfordshire. Edinburgh AirportThe sixth busiest airport of UK, Edinburgh airport handled over 14.7 million passengers in 2019. The airport has one runway and one passenger terminal, and employs about 2,500 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-countries-suspend-flights-to-and-from-uk-list-of-international-airports-to-feel-the-most-impact/story-gMsKSUZIxiL9pmPKQDzv5K.html
21-12-2020||World||Switzerland impose entry ban on travellers from UK, South Africa||Swiss officials who banned travel from Britain and South Africa on Monday on fear of mutant coronavirus variants that are spreading rapidly in those countries believe a new strain is likely already in Switzerland, despite not having detected it.The Swiss government, among nations to levy travel restrictions, ordered people who have entered the country from the United Kingdom and South Africa since December 14 to undergo a 10-day quarantine and imposed a general entry ban for foreign nationals from the countries.The Swiss cabinet joined several countries in suspending travel for Britons after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the mutated variant, up to 70% more transmissible, had been identified.Though a mutant virus has yet to be found in Switzerland, officials said travel between the two countries in recent days and weeks means such a new strain is here but has likely simply not shown up in testing or on Swiss scientists’ radar.“The virus, unfortunately, is one step ahead of us again,” Patrick Mathys, assistant head of communicable diseases at the Federal Ministry of Health, told a news conference two days after Swiss regulators approved Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine against Covid-19.Asked if Switzerland was overreacting, Mathys said there was already growing evidence that the mutant form of the virus could spread from person to person quickly, necessitating quick action to prevent an explosion of new cases.“We know too little about the coronavirus, and we know even less about this mutant form,” he said. “But there are reliable signs emerging that it is more infectious.”Swiss officials said there were no plans to organise evacuation charter flights for Swiss stranded abroad, and that they were considering mass testing for thousands of Britons in hotspots like Verbier, a ski area popular with British tourists.Goods transport to and from Britain was still allowed, though the closure of the Channel Tunnel has exacerbated trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-impose-entry-ban-on-travellers-from-uk-south-africa/story-T0QmiXMHKoaypiRMMOMywI.html
21-12-2020||World||London Mayor urges UK govt to seek extension to Brexit transition period||Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has urged the UK government to seek an extension to the Brexit transition period, which is due to expire on December 31, following the French government’s decision to temporarily ban all travel from the UK as a new strain of Covid-19 spreads through southeast England.The French government announced an initial 48-hour ban on all road, sea, rail, and air travel from the United Kingdom on Sunday following the emergence of a new strain of the coronavirus disease in England.Following the announcement, Kent Police launched Operation Stack, which uses the county’s roads to accommodate trucks unable to enter the Port of Dover.“With major disruption at Kent now inevitable, I’m urging the Government to officially seek an extension to the Brexit transition period. Securing our key supply chains and fighting the coronavirus pandemic requires the full and undivided efforts of ministers more than ever before,” Khan said in a statement that was posted on Twitter.On Sunday, the UK Department of Health and Social Care reported 35,928 new positive tests for Covid-19, a new single-day record for the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-mayor-urges-uk-govt-to-seek-extension-to-brexit-transition-period/story-oKHVGVAVuEqrvKUDLBp7NJ.html
21-12-2020||World||Iran urged not to squander chance to salvage nuclear deal||Countries trying to keep alive the 2015 deal on Iran’s nuclear program agreed Monday to “positively address” the possibility of a US return to the accord under the Biden administration. Germany’s foreign minister urged Iran not to waste what he called a final window of opportunity.Monday’s virtual meeting of parties to the agreement — the first at the level of foreign ministers in over a year — came as the deal is in what German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called a “downward spiral” caused by a mixture of strong US pressure on Iran and Tehran’s violations of the accord.The remaining countries that signed the agreement with Iran — Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia — have been trying to keep it from collapsing after the unilateral withdrawal of the United States in 2018.The three European powers have expressed hope that with the change of administrations in Washington, the US could be brought back into the deal, whose goal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb — something Tehran insists it doesn’t want to do.President-elect Joe Biden has said he hopes to return the US to the deal, which was negotiated while he was vice president.Complicating that, Iran is now in violation of most major restrictions set out in the agreement, including the amount of enriched uranium it is allowed to stockpile and the purity to which it is allowed to enrich uranium.A joint statement released after Monday’s meeting said participants in the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA, “re-emphasised their commitment to preserve the agreement” and discussed the fact that “full and effective implementation of the JCPOA by all remains crucial.”“Ministers acknowledged the prospect of a return of the US to the JCPOA and underlined their readiness to positively address this in a joint effort,” the statement said.“We are standing at a crossroads today,” Germany’s Maas told reporters in Berlin, adding that the deal’s survival or otherwise will be determined in the coming weeks and months.The European powers stressed Monday that “just a commitment” to the accord on everyone’s part is not enough, Maas said.“To make possible a rapprochement under Biden, there must be no more technical maneuvers of the kind we have seen plenty in recent times — they would do nothing but further undermine the agreement,” he added.“The opportunity that is now being offered — this last window of opportunity — must not be squandered,” Maas said. “We made that very clear today to Iran in particular.”The deal promises Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, but with the reinstatement of American sanctions, the other nations have been struggling to provide Iran the assistance it seeks.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who also attended the meeting, tweeted that “I made it absolutely clear Iran must not implement the recently announced expansions to its nuclear programme. To do so would undermine the opportunities for progress we hope to see in 2021.”Despite Iran’s violations, the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that Tehran continues to give inspectors full access to its nuclear sites — a key reason the JCPOA member nations say it is worth preserving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-urged-not-to-squander-chance-to-salvage-nuclear-deal/story-a9egX42mMzTp1mF4n0H08J.html

21-12-2020||World||UK confronts threat of food crisis as coronavirus surge blocks trade||The UK confronted threats of food insecurity and panicked shopping days before Christmas as European nations restricted trade and travel to guard against a resurgent coronavirus, offering Britain a preview of the border chaos to come in the absence of a Brexit deal.Fearing a fast-spreading new strain of the virus that forced a strict lockdown across England, France on Sunday suspended travel from the UK for 48 hours and Germany halted arriving flights from Britain. The crisis gave renewed urgency to negotiations for a trade deal with the European Union (EU) that remained at a critical stage after weekend talks.The Port of Dover late Sunday halted freight moved by truck into France while allowing unaccompanied cargo to keep moving. Though traffic into the UK is unaffected, truckers often run supplies in both directions and the latest outbreak in the heart of the country may discourage them from entering the UKThe disruptions are exposing Britain’s trade vulnerabilities just as a 4 1/2-year odyssey to leave the EU moves from political rhetoric to economic reality. Business groups facing catastrophic losses urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government to act soon, with the 18,000-member Logistics UK calling for rapid Covid-19 testing of truckers departing the country as the quickest way of protecting supply chains.“This is the nightmare before Christmas,” said James Withers, chief executive officer at the Scotland Food & Drink industry group.Scottish SeafoodHe said there are more than 100 trucks laden with seafood due to cross the border into the EU, bound for Christmas wholesale markets in France and Spain that would normally be held on Wednesday. Fears are growing that live shellfish will spoil if they’re held up at the border, and the government needs to act today to ensure that the freight can keep moving, Withers said.Container ports and ferry terminals were already congested because of stockpiling ahead of the December 31 deadline marking a final break from the European single market.The border chaos comes at the tail end of a year that’s seen Johnson nearly die from the virus and come under heavy criticism over his response to the pandemic -- which has seen the UK suffer the worst hit to output of any major economy as well as a death toll second only to Italy in Europe.Grocers ScramblingBritish supermarket chain J Sainsbury Plc said it is considering using air freight for products sourced from Europe. If the situation doesn’t change, Sainsbury will start to see “gaps” in the coming days sourcing some fruits and vegetables, said Victoria Durman, head of corporate communications.Outside Dover, trucks began lining up on the M20 motorway as the “Operation Stack” emergency plan was triggered with drivers unable to board ferries. The Department for Transport was also preparing Manston airport in Kent, which is being overhauled to accommodate as many as 4,000 vehicles as part of Britain’s no-deal planning, according to the kent.gov.uk website.Richard Ballantyne, chief executive officer of the British Ports Association, urged travelers to follow the advice of their carriers. “There could be a period of disruption at some of the UK’s ferry ports for the next 48 hours,” he said. “We are confident that the UK will continue to be supplied.”UK travel, leisure, and retail shares slumped on Monday, while stay-at-home stocks, like Ocado Group Plc, got a boost. Airlines that were expecting a lift around the festive period were among the worst hit, with British Airways parent IAG SA falling as much as 20% and Easyjet Plc down as much as 18%.Weaker GrowthEconomists at Berenberg cut their 2021 growth forecast for the UK just last week to 7.3% from 8% because of new lockdowns. On Monday, chief economist Holger Schmieding said the news over the weekend “adds to the near-term downside risks” but that he expects “a rapid snapback of activity once restrictions can be eased again meaningfully by spring at the latest.”Transport Secretary Grant Shapps sought to downplay the urgency of the situation, telling Sky News the short straits between Dover and Calais account for about 20% of goods to and from the country.“It’s not the mainstay. Most goods actually come in and out by unaccompanied containers, and those will continue to flow,” he said. “We obviously don’t want these links to be closed for too long, but it’s not unusual for them to be closed and disrupted.”Asked about the vaccine, he said “virtually all” of it comes across via containers and is unaffected by the stoppage at Dover. Shapps said the French have told UK authorities they want to restart haulers crossing the channel “as quickly as possible.”Still, the economic drag of tougher lockdown and trade turmoil will only deepen the hole the country is in, unleashing more damage stretching from mom-and-pop retailers to already struggling European airlines. The UK was the busiest in the region on Saturday with more than 2,200 flights, according to Eurocontrol, with London Heathrow airport having one of its busiest weeks since the first UK lockdown.Grounded FlightsIreland banned flights with the British mainland at least until Tuesday. Germany did too, and the Transportation Ministry in Berlin cited an EU directive that could keep the suspension in place until December 31. Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium suspended air, train or ferry links.Eurostar International Ltd., which operates passenger trains through the Channel Tunnel, will scrap services from London to Brussels Monday. Even before the new curbs, Eurostar had been operating a minimal service of one train a day in each direction on most routes to allow for emergency travel. Anyone leaving London faced quarantining on their return as well as possible restrictions at their destination.Johnson abruptly cancelled plans to allow families to mix over the holiday period as the government warned over the weekend that the new strain of the virus is “out of control.” There were scenes of panic at train stations, with people defying social-distancing rules to get out of the capital.More than 16 million Britons are now required to stay at home, mainly in London and southeast England.The measures ban household mixing in the capital and the southeast, and restrict socializing to just Christmas Day across the rest of England.Until Friday, Johnson was adamant that close households would be able to mix over Christmas. It was the latest U-turn from a government that has been reluctant to impose limits to movement, unless forced. There is some unease among his Conservative rank-and-file lawmakers.Transmission RateThe Covid-19 virus strain said to have triggered the tighter curbs on London may be as much as 70% more transmissible than others currently circulating, preliminary analysis in the UK shows.The World Health Organization is working to understand the extent to which the virus may spread more easily, along with other human behavioural factors that may be driving transmission, Maria van Kerkhove, the body’s technical lead on Covid-19, told the BBC Sunday. She said that current information suggests that the new variant doesn’t have any impact on the vaccines being rolled out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-confronts-threat-of-food-crisis-as-coronavirus-surge-blocks-trade/story-x5DOYzvknXb0D1kztSAo2K.html
21-12-2020||World||China signals it won’t stop crackdown in Xinjiang despite international backlash||A Chinese Communist Party (CCP) official signaled Monday that there would likely be no let-up in its crackdown in the Xinjiang region, but said the government’s focus is shifting more to addressing the roots of extremism.“We cannot be complacent at this moment, because the threats are still out there,” Xu Guixiang, the deputy director-general of the Xinjiang Communist Party publicity department, said in an interview with The Associated Press in Beijing.China’s policies in the remote Xinjiang region, home to the Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, have become a major point of division with the US and other Western nations over alleged human rights violations.Analysts say China has detained more than a million people, forcing many to give up at least elements of their faith and traditions. Chinese officials tout the success of their effort to de-radicalize the population and provide job training, saying the region hasn’t had a terrorist attack in four years.Xu did not directly answer whether or not security measures would be relaxed, but said that “four years free of terrorism does not mean there is no threat or danger at all.”He said the party is exploring ways to achieve sustained stability in multi-ethnic, border areas such as Xinjiang, a far west region about 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) from Beijing.“We need to think more about the deep-seated issues, including the social foundation and the soil that give rise to extremism and terrorism,” he said.Xu repeated the government’s vehement denials of forced labour, in which vocational training graduates are allegedly pressured to work in factories both in Xinjiang and elsewhere in China.He said that 117,000 people have gone to work in other parts of China since 2014 through programs that have enabled them to develop skills and leave farms for higher-paying factory work.The US customs agency has blocked imports of clothing and other goods from Xinjiang this year over the forced labour issue, and UK politicians are demanding that British companies ensure their supply chains are free of forced labor.The US restrictions have driven some of the region’s firms to seek other markets, Xu said, both at home and abroad.“One can’t assume that Xinjiang companies can’t live without the US market or some US companies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-signals-it-won-t-stop-crackdown-in-xinjiang-despite-international-backlash/story-135MHSrl9T9ufiWZJ0MszH.html
21-12-2020||World||South Africa identifies another new coronavirus strain causing surge in cases||South Africa has announced that a new variant of the Covid-19 virus is driving the country’s current resurgence of the disease, which is seeing higher numbers of confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths.The new variant, known as 501.V2, is dominant among new confirmed infections in South Africa, according to health officials and scientists leading the country’s virus strategy.“It is still very early but at this stage, the preliminary data suggests the virus that is now dominating in the second wave is spreading faster than the first wave,” Professor Salim Abdool Karim, chairman of the government’s Ministerial Advisory Committee, said in a briefing to journalists.South Africa may see “many more cases” in the new wave than it experienced in the first surge of the disease, said Abdool Karim.South Africa currently has more than 8,500 people hospitalized with Covid-19, surpassing the previous high of 8,300 recorded in August.“We are seeing a much earlier and much sharper rise in the second wave or resurgence than we anticipated,” Prof. Ian Sanne, a member of the advisory committee, told South Africa’s News24.The new strain, different from the one in Britain, appears to be more infectious than the original virus. South African scientists are studying if the vaccines against Covid-19 will also offer protection against the new strain.Some of the vaccines, including the one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, are undergoing clinical tests in South Africa.The scientists studying the new variant emphasized that preventive measures like wearing masks and social distancing are vital.In response to the resurgence of Covid-19, the South African government has introduced tougher lockdown restrictions which include limited days and hours for the trade of alcohol and the closure of beaches in areas identified as hotspots.South Africa’s 7-day rolling average of daily new cases has more than doubled over the past two weeks, from 6.47 new cases per 100,000 people on Dec. 6 to 14.68 new cases per 100,000 people on December 20. The number of deaths has also increased with the 7-day rolling average of daily deaths in South Africa rising from 0.18 deaths per 100,000 people on December 6 to 0.34 deaths per 100,000 people on December 20.The country has recorded a total of 912, 477 cases, including 24,539 deaths.Abdool Karim and other experts have expressed concerns that more people may be infected over the holiday season, as many people travel and visit family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-identifies-another-new-coronavirus-strain-causing-surge-in-cases/story-P4ZdU3oY9ZM4yJMXQD0JmI.html
21-12-2020||World||Australia detects new Covid-19 strain, Hong Kong cancels Britain flights||Australia said on Monday it had detected cases of the new virulent coronavirus strain identified in the United Kingdom, while Hong Kong said it would suspend Britain flights.Two travellers from the United Kingdom to Australia’s New South Wales state were found carrying the mutated variant of the virus that Britain has said could be up to 70% more infectious. Both are in quarantine, and the recent spike in infections in Sydney are not linked to this, authorities said.The new strain has prompted Britain’s European neighbours and several others including Canada and Iran to close their doors to travellers from the country.Much is unknown about the strain, but experts said current vaccines should still be effective against it. Asian nations including Japan and South Korea said they were monitoring the new strain even as they battle a spike in infections at home.Hong Kong became the first city in the region to ban flights from Britain in a bid to curb already rising case numbers in the dense financial hub. The Chinese special administrative region said on Monday that people arriving from Britain before Dec. 22 would have to quarantine for three weeks instead of two.South Korea, which imposes a 14-day quarantine on everyone entering the country, said it was reviewing new measures for flights from Britain, and would test twice those coming in from there before they were released from quarantine.New cases climbed to over 1,000 a day in South Korea several times last week. It reported on Sunday an outbreak in a Seoul prison where 188 inmates and staff were infected. The country said on Monday Seoul will ban gatherings of more than four people later this week and double hospital beds for critical Covid-19 cases by year end. Taiwan, which also has a 14-day quarantine, said on Sunday there were no plans at present to stop flights from Britain. An Indian government committee tasked with monitoring the pandemic met on Monday to discuss the new strain, but did not offer clarity on whether flights to Britain would be halted. Britain is one of 23 countries that India shares an “air bubble” with. India’s health minister said the country was prepared to deal with the new strain and that there was no need to panic.Japan, where entry from Britain is already banned in principle, said it would keep in close touch with other countries as well as the World Health Organization to see how the new type of virus was spreading.AUSTRALIA, THAILAND BATTLE OUTBREAKSThe new strain in Britain comes as cases have surged recently in several Asian countries that successfully contained the pandemic earlier. The spikes have prompted localised lockdowns in some countries and more aggressive testing.Thailand said on Sunday it was testing tens of thousands of people, and extended curbs on movement, following its worst outbreak yet that began at a shrimp market in a province that is a centre of the seafood industry and home to thousands of migrant workers.Thailand, the first country outside China to report Covid-19 cases, has so far reported just 60 deaths from the virus among its 70 million population. On Monday, the country confirmed 382 new infections, mostly migrant workers. Thousands of workers in South East Asian countries such as Singapore and Malaysia have been infected in dormitories and factories, revealing often unsanitary living and working conditions even as overall numbers in these places have largely been contained.Australia, where cases in Sydney have flared in recent days, on Monday cancelled dozens of domestic flights.New South Wales, which reported 86 new local cases since Thursday, ordered more than a 250,000 people in Sydney’s northern beaches area into a lockdown, and urged people who had visited venues where confirmed cases were found to get tested and self-isolate. These cases are not part of the UK strain. Australian health authorities said a virus strain in northeastern Sydney matched a traveller from the United States, but how it got from the airport to the community was puzzling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-detects-new-covid-19-strain-hong-kong-cancels-britain-flights/story-skj9qprDHhFxeoCKR4YA0K.html
21-12-2020||World||China calls Trump’s cyberattack claims ‘a farce’||China on Monday said tweets by President Donald Trump suggesting Beijing was involved in a massive cyberattack on the US government were “a farce” concocted for political motives.A large-scale hack of US government agencies including the Treasury was “under control” as of Saturday, according to the outgoing US President. But in a tweet thread he undercut his own administration’s assessment that Russia was behind the cyberattack, instead saying China “may” also have been involved, without providing any evidence.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin stopped short of directly denying Beijing’s involvement, but called US accusations of cyberattacks “not serious, and self-contradictory.”“The accusations made by the US against China have always been a farce, out of political motives,” Wang told a press briefing.“The US has politicised cybersecurity issues, continuously spread false information without conclusive evidence... in an attempt to destroy China’s image and mislead the international community,” he added.In July, two Chinese nationals were indicted by the US for seeking to steal coronavirus vaccine research and hacking hundreds of companies -- prompting Beijing to accuse Washington of “slander”.Trump’s tweets on Saturday contradicted comments just a day earlier from his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the source and the severity of the cyberattack, leaving administration spokespeople scrambling to reconcile the conflicting takes.Pompeo earlier said the breach was “pretty clearly” Russia’s work, adding there had been a significant effort to use third-party software to “essentially embed code inside of US government systems”.Cyber experts said the attack could have far-reaching impact and take months to unravel.Several US officials had previously pointed the finger at Moscow, but none at Beijing.Russia has denied involvement in the latest attack. Trump as president has frequently played down apparent threats from Russia -- including his refusal to recognise interference by Moscow in the 2016 election despite the findings of US intelligence agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-calls-trump-s-cyberattack-claims-a-farce/story-eTsq32snHlOrrXZYoGuXDJ.html
21-12-2020||World||EU agreed 15.50 euros per dose for Pfizer vaccine, says document||The European Union has agreed to pay 15.50 euros ($18.90) per dose for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, an internal EU document reviewed by Reuters shows.The price, which is confidential and was negotiated for a total of 300 million doses, is slightly lower than the $19.50 per shot the United States agreed to pay for a first shipment of 100 million doses of the same vaccine, in line with what Reuters reported in November.The EU document dated Nov. 18 was circulated internally after the EU announced its supply deal with Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech on Nov. 11.The EU drug regulator is expected to decide on Monday on approval for the Pfizer vaccine after the shot was authorised in several countries, including Britain and the United States.On Thursday Belgian state secretary for the budget Eva De Bleeker published on Twitter a table with prices Belgium would pay pharmaceutical companies for their Covid-19 vaccines. She retracted the post shortly after publishing.In that table the Pfizer vaccine was indicated as costing Belgium 12 euros ($14.6) per dose, leading many to believe that was the full price agreed by the EU.Other vaccines in the table were also shown with prices lower than prices disclosed by EU sources.“There is always a total price and a price upon delivery,” an EU official involved in talks with vaccine makers told Reuters when asked to clarify the difference between the EU and Belgian prices.A spokesman for De Bleeker declined to comment on Monday, citing confidentiality requirements, but pointed to what De Bleeker told the Belgian parliament last week. In that public hearing, De Beeker said Belgium’s budgeted prices were still partial.Under EU advance purchase deals for Covid-19 vaccines, the bloc agrees upfront payments with companies to secure doses before they are approved. After approvals, EU governments can pay the remainder to buy reserved doses.The EU has not revealed the upfront payment agreed with Pfizer.However, it said in October that it paid about 1 billion euros in downpayments to AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson for their shots, with a further 1.45 billion euros budgeted for upfront payments to Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and CureVac .It has since agreed supply deals with all six companies and is negotiating a seventh agreement with Novavax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-agreed-15-50-euros-per-dose-for-pfizer-vaccine-internal-document/story-2DkfsWDq6s2WRUmmfdU2II.html
21-12-2020||World||‘Sick man of Europe’: UK cut off over fears about new Covid-19 strain||The United Kingdom stood shut off from the rest of Europe on Monday after allies cut transport ties over fears of a new coronavirus strain, sowing chaos for families, truckers and supermarkets just days before the Brexit cliff edge.France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Belgium, Israel and Canada were among those that shut off travel ties after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that a highly infectious new strain of the virus was a danger to the country.Johnson will chair an emergency response meeting on Monday to discuss international travel, in particular the flow of freight in and out of Britain. EU officials are due to hold a meeting at 1000 GMT on coordinating their response.France shut its border to arrivals of people and trucks from the United Kingdom, closing off one of the most important trade arteries with mainland Europe, a step Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said was surprising.“We’re doing everything we can to get that restarted,” Shapps told Sky. “They’ve said to us they want to restart the hauliers as quickly as possible.”As families and truck drivers tried to navigate the travel bans to get back home in time for Christmas, Britain’s second-largest supermarket chain, Sainsbury’s, said gaps will start to appear on shelves within days if transport ties are not quickly restored with mainland Europe.“If nothing changes, we will start to see gaps over the coming days on lettuce, some salad leaves, cauliflowers, broccoli and citrus fruit – all of which are imported from the continent at this time of year,” Sainsbury’s said.Shellfish producers in Scotland said they had tonnes of perishable products stranded on roads as the French border was closed. Disruption in Britain will also snarl supplies to Ireland.Hong Kong is also due to ban all flights arriving from the United Kingdom from midnight, becoming the first city in Asia to do so. Asian nations including Japan and South Korea said they were closely monitoring the new strain.The pound fell more than 2 cents to $1.3279 and the FTSE 100 fell 2% at the open, with travel companies such as British Airways-owner IAG tumbling 15%. The yield on 2-year UK gilts hit a record low.TRANSPORT CHAOSBritain’s Shapps said getting the bans lifted as swiftly as possible was his priority but that given British preparations for the end of the Brexit transition period, the country was well positioned for disruption.Johnson on Saturday cancelled Christmas plans for millions of British people due to what he said was a more infectious strain of the coronavirus, though he said there was no evidence that it was either more lethal or caused a more severe illness.The new variant contains 23 different changes, many of them associated with how it binds to cells and enters them. Shapps said Britain had done some of the best global analysis of the mutations of the virus so it was simply seeing what was already at large in other countries.The British government triggered plans it had for stacking up trucks in the southeast county of Kent - part of its plans for potential disruption when the United Kingdom exits the EU’s orbit with - or without - a trade deal at 2300 GMT on Dec. 31.Talks on a Brexit trade deal were due to continue on Monday.‘SICK MAN OF EUROPE’Trucks are being stacked on the M20 motorway through Kent, heading towards the ports, which is closed to normal traffic. A nearby airport will also be used to hold freight.“Sick Man of Europe”, the Daily Mirror newspaper said on its front page beside a picture of Johnson while the Sun newspaper said “French show no merci”.The closure of the Channel Tunnel and ports for onward travel to France will affect the export of goods such as fish and shell fish from Scotland to Europe, and the import of food for British supermarkets if, as expected, European drivers refuse to travel.Trucks have been told to avoid Kent to prevent any further build up of trucks.Jon Swallow, a director of the British logistics group Jordon Freight, said the move by France would deter European drivers from coming to Britain both now and after the end of the year for fear they will get stuck.“This is a serious situation as the stockpiled goods expected here are for Christmas and to help stabilise January,” he told Reuters. “This shows how fragile the cross channel route is.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sick-man-of-europe-uk-cut-off-over-fears-about-new-covid-19-strain/story-z0JRuS4ZWYXreBg8DiMEXP.html
21-12-2020||World||Japan to looking to reduce emissions beyond 2030 target||Japan will look at reducing greenhouse gas emissions beyond its current target for 2030 and lay out details next year on a carbon pricing scheme that won’t rule out a carbon tax, the environment ministry’s top bureaucrat said on Monday.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Monday instructed his environment and industry ministers to work on a plan next year to create a carbon pricing scheme, which will be part of efforts to meet his pledge to make Japan carbon-neutral by 2050.Suga’s instruction will have “huge implications” as it makes the idea official government policy, Vice Environment Minister Tokutaro Nakai told Reuters in an interview.“Both ideas will be on the table for debate next year,” he said, when asked whether the scheme would include a carbon tax and creation of an emissions-trading system.“Carbon pricing must be designed in a way so it serves as a tool of Japan’s growth strategy,” Nakai said. Even if a carbon tax were to be introduced, it should be timed in a way that does not hurt the economy, he added.Suga’s pledge to make Japan carbon neutral by 2050 brings it into line with the European Union. But Tokyo remains under pressure to take stronger steps towards a carbon-free society.Japan stuck to its 2030 target of cutting emissions by 26% from 2013 levels in an updated plan submitted to the United Nations in March, drawing criticism from investors for being too weak in its resolve to combat climate change.Nakai said Japan is discussing the possibility of setting a more ambitious target next year, as it succeeded in trimming emissions for six straight years.“We don’t have a specific number yet, but the direction is toward a reduction” in emissions beyond the 26% goal, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-looking-to-reduce-emissions-beyond-2030-target/story-EQlUN91Uwo7xdnhOADrHmM.html
21-12-2020||World||EU regulator meets to discuss approval of Covid-19 vaccine||The European Medicines Agency is meeting Monday to consider approving a coronavirus vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer that would be the first to be authorized for use in the European Union.The closed-doors meeting comes weeks after the shot was granted permission under emergency provisions by regulators in Britain and the United States.If EMA scientists conclude that the vaccine is safe, officials at the Amsterdam-based agency are expected to give conditional approval for it to be used across the 27-nation bloc. The European Commission must still rubber-stamp the decision before the vaccine can be rolled out, a process German officials say could begin Dec. 27. The pharmaceutical companies will also need to submit follow-up data on their vaccine for the next year.The European regulator came under heavy pressure last week from countries calling for the vaccine to be granted approval for use as quickly as possible. EMA had originally set Dec. 29 as the date for its evaluation of the vaccine made by Germany-based BioNTech, but moved the meeting forward after calls from Berlin and others to move quicker.The vaccine has already been given some form of regulatory OK in more than a dozen countries.Britain, Canada and the US authorized the vaccine to be used according to emergency provisions, meaning the shot is an unlicensed product whose temporary use is justified by the pandemic that has killed almost 1.7 million people worldwide to date, according to Johns Hopkins University.The EMA approval, however, is largely similar to the normal licensing procedure that would be granted to any new vaccine, only on an accelerated schedule.In a statement last week, the agency stressed that the vaccine would only be approved after a scientific assessment showed its overall benefits outweighed the risks.“A vaccine’s benefits in protecting people against Covid-19 must be far greater than any side effect or potential risks,” it said.So far, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says they have seen six cases of severe allergic reaction out of more than a quarter-million shots of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine given, including in one person with a history of vaccination reactions.BioNTech and Pfizer offered the EU 400 million doses of the vaccine, but the bloc’s executive Commission chose to buy only 200 million doses, with an option for 100 million more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-regulator-meets-to-discuss-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-dpZvp8chWhES7CCDz09EWJ.html
21-12-2020||World||After new Covid-19 strain, these countries have banned travel from UK||The new strain of the coronavirus that was discovered in the UK has forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce another lockdown despite plans to ease restrictions during the Christmas period. The new strain can reportedly be transmitted from one person to another much faster than the previous one and it might even compromise vaccines if they are not effective against it.The UK currently has 2,046,161 confirmed coronavirus infections and the death toll is 67,503, as per Johns Hopkins University.Since the discovery, several countries have suspended flights, trains and other modes of transport from the United Kingdom in fear of another widespread crisis from the virus.Here are the countries that have done so:1. Poland: A spokesperson for the Polish government announced via Twitter that flights from the UK were to be suspended from Monday over virus fears.2. France: France announced on Sunday that it will suspend all travel from Britain for 48 hours from midnight. This includes goods transport via road, air, sea or rail. Only unaccompanied freight would be allowed inside French borders.3. Germany: German Health Minister Jens Spahn said that the country was suspending all flights from the UK for 48 hours from midnight on Sunday. Only cargo flights would be exempt from this measure.4. Italy: Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza said that he had signed a decree that will block flights from England and will prohibit anyone who has stayed there during the last 14 days from entering Italy. One person has already been infected with the new strain.5. Ireland: Ireland said in a statement that all flights arriving from Britain from midnight Sunday would be banned for at least 48 hours.6. The Netherlands: The Dutch government has said that all passenger flights from Britain to the Netherlands would be banned until January 1. The country has reported one person with the new strain.7. Canada: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that all flights from the UK would be suspended for 72 hours and he instructed those recently returned from the country to take advanced safety measures.8. Iran: Iran’s health ministry has ordered flights from Britain suspended for two weeks, as per state news agency IRNA.9. Israel: A joint statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office and the Health Ministry said that Israel was suspending all flights from the UK, Denmark and South Africa.10. Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia announced on Sunday that it was halting all flights and suspending entry through its land and seaports for at least a week, with the option to extend for a further week. The ones who have arrived from Europe or anywhere where the strain was detected have been instructed to self-isolate for two weeks and undergo testing.11. Kuwait: Kuwait has added Britain to a list of “high-risk” nations and banned flights.12. El Salvador: President Nayib Bukele announced via Twitter that anyone who had been in Britain or South Africa in the past 30 days would not be allowed to enter the country.13. Argentina: Argentina suspended all flights from the UK, the government said in a statement on Sunday. The last flight would arrive on Monday.14.

21-12-2020||World||From UK to Australia: Countries that have reported new strain of Covid-19||Coronavirus is mutating and its latest strain said to transmit faster has spread fear across several countries ahead of Christmas. British prime minister Boris Johnson immediately responded to the new strain by imposing the strictest lockdown in London. The mutant virus that the UK officials say has 70 per cent transmissibility was found in southeastern England in September and has been moving around the world, as per an official of the World Health Organization (WHO), reported AP.Also Read | New coronavirus strain ‘out of control’ as England faces lengthy lockdownSeveral European nations and other countries have also tried to distance itself from the United Kingdom after the news of the super spreading virus strain trickled in. Many have imposed travel bans to tackle the crisis.Researchers in Sweden had found a new mutation in the virus as early as April. They observed two changes in the genetic material of the virus that seemed to make it two times more powerful in transmission, AP cited Dr Ravi Gupta, a virologist at the University of Cambridge in England, as saying. Gupta said that around 6,000 cases of the new virus worldwide were reported, mostly in Denmark and England.Many more variations in the genome have been discovered since then, it was also reported that people in Denmark got the new strain from mink farms. News about the new strain that is driving the second wave in South Africa was also reported on Friday. South African health officials believed that the newly found strain of coronavirus seems to spread faster but the severity of the disease due to the mutations are still unknown.Italy is another such country where the new strain of the virus discovered in the UK has been found. Italy on Sunday reported that it has found the new strain of coronavirus in a person who has recently returned from the United Kingdom.France on Monday also reported there is a possibility that the new strain of coronavirus is also spreading in the country. “It is entirely possible that the virus is circulating in France,” French health minister Olivier Veran was quoted as saying by Reuters. However, the recent tests have not detected the mutant yet.Australia too on Monday reported the mutant strain of coronavirus detected in the United Kingdom. Two returnees from the UK in Australia’s South Wales were identified carrying the new strain of the deadly virus, both are now in quarantine, reported Reuters. Viruses evolve through minor changes in a letter or two in their genetic database. The new modifications can become a major strain in a region because of its evolution there or due to any event that helped it spread. The pathogens mutate to survive in order to defeat the evolving human immune system as well as the vaccines that endanger its survival. These mutations determine the severity of the disease, the communicability of the virus as well as the relation of the virus with the human cell that can lead to infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-uk-to-italy-countries-that-have-reported-new-covid-19-strains/story-ubGHzK3IcRH8ZIXt8fHa2H.html
21-12-2020||World||Thailand considers more lockdowns as seafood workers hit by virus||Thailand said it may expand a lockdown, as health authorities search for more than 10,000 people with ties to a record cluster of coronavirus cases found in a coastal province near Bangkok.The country reported 382 Covid-19 new infections today, taking total cases linked to a seafood market in Samut Sakhon to about 1,000 in the last week since the first case was found December 17. Several cases were also found in nearby provinces of Bangkok, Nakhon Pathom and Samut Prakan. Thailand’s largest single outbreak brings to 5,289 the total of confirmed infections, based on Health Ministry data.A lockdown imposed in Samut Sakhon may be extended to other districts, Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said today. Officials will meet with Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha and a Covid-19 task force to consider steps to curb the contagion, he added.Thailand’s benchmark equities index sank as much as 3.7%. Thai Union Group Pcl, one of the world’s biggest tuna processors, dropped as much as 11%, while agro-industrial conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Foods Pcl, lost as much as 5.5%. Both firms have plants in Samut Sakhon Province.While a lockdown hasn’t been imposed in Bangkok, the capital’s chief administrator said residents with businesses in the neighboring province should work from home and ordered more stringent screening of migrant workers. The Health Ministry, meanwhile, advised the nation’s 1,580 fresh-food markets to enforce strict measures to prevent the virus from spreading.Migrant workers from Myanmar comprise about 90% of the infections found in the new cluster, with most employed at food-processing factories. The outbreak was tracked after a 67-year-old local fish merchant was confirmed to have the virus on December 17.“Migrant workers in the area live in crowded apartment, with about six people sharing a three-by-six room where they take turns using the room based on their morning or night shifts,” said Adisorn Keadmongkol, an official from Migrant Working Group Thailand. With the lockdown in place, they will be confined to their rooms and “the virus could spread further among people living in the communities,” he said.The lockdown will spark economic losses of about 1 billion baht ($33.3 million) a day, and cause a rise in seafood prices, Maria Lapiz, managing director of Maybank Kim Eng Thailand, said in a report on Monday. Samut Sakhon is home to about 6,000 factories and is the nation’s sixth-largest provincial economy, contributing about 2.5% of Thailand’s gross domestic product, the report said.Thailand was the first nation to report Covid-19 infections outside of China. It has been relatively successful in containing the virus -- the government has reported a total of 4,907 infections -- and was betting on a tourism industry revival to pull the economy out of recession.Thai Union Group, which owns Chicken of the Sea and John West brands, said in a statement on Monday that one of its workers tested positive for the virus, but all its domestic plants were still open.“Should the unlikely worst-case scenario happen involving the total shutdown of all Thai Union Samut Sakhon plants for two weeks, this would have an impact of less than 2% of total revenue,” said Thiraphong Chansiri, chief executive officer Thai Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-considers-more-lockdowns-as-seafood-workers-hit-by-virus/story-8QDChXOdWHahyUegiyILIP.html
21-12-2020||World||UAE top diplomat acknowledges visa restrictions on Pakistan||The United Arab Emirates’ top diplomat has publicly acknowledged a so-far unexplained ban on visitors from Pakistan, which travel agents say also targets tourists and laborers from a dozen Muslim-majority countries amid the pandemic and the UAE’s normalization of ties with Israel.Following a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart, Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan stressed “the temporary nature of recent restrictions imposed on the issuance of visas due to the outbreak of Covid-19,” the UAE’s state-run WAM news agency reported Sunday.He did not elaborate on the visa suspension, which has blindsided expats seeking entry to the federation of seven sheikhdoms, where foreigners outnumber locals nearly nine to one.The reported visa restrictions targeting countries such as Lebanon, Kenya, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen came just as tourists began arriving in the Persian Gulf country on Israeli passports following the normalization agreement. The Emirati and Israeli governments are hammering out a mutual visa waiver agreement to grant Israeli tourists visas on arrival.Saeed Mohammed, a travel agent at Arabian Nights Tours in Dubai, said Monday that the visa approval rate for families from Pakistan and a few other Mideast nations has increased over the past few weeks. But young, single men from the countries are denied entry, fueling speculation that the ban may be tied to security or visa overstay concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-top-diplomat-acknowledges-visa-restrictions-on-pakistan/story-mHkYIHmZXBpY1KbRqZBvKL.html
21-12-2020||World||New coronavirus strain ‘out of control’ as England faces lengthy lockdown||Britain’s health minister warned Sunday that a strict lockdown imposed on London and southeast England may last for months because a new strain of the coronavirus was “out of control”.Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Saturday that millions must cancel Christmas plans and stay at home from Sunday morning because the new strain was spreading far more quickly. Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that the strict measures that affect almost a third of England’s population could stay in place until the virus vaccine is fully rolled out.“We acted very quickly and decisively,” Hancock told Sky News, justifying the “stay at home” order, ban on family gatherings over Christmas and closure of non-essential shops.“Unfortunately the new strain was out of control. We have got to get it under control.”Around 16.4 million people entered the strictest “tier four” measures from Sunday, or 31% of England’s population. They are not allowed to hold family gatherings for Christmas, while in the rest of the country a limited number of households are allowed to mix on Christmas Day only, rather than the five days originally proposed. Hancock said the situation was “deadly serious”.“It’s going to be very difficult to keep it under control until we have the vaccine rolled out,” he said, adding: “This is what we face over the next couple of months.”The UK hopes to reach a figure of half a million vaccinations over the weekend, the health minister said.London’s Metropolitan Police said it would take action against those who “make reckless decisions that risk lives”.Other UK regions also tightened their anti-virus measures in response.Wales introduced a strict lockdown from Sunday, while Scotland banned travel to and from other UK regions for Christmas and announced it will double its police presence along the English border. Both Scotland and Northern Ireland are to enter fresh lockdowns on December 26. Northern Ireland was to introduce additional measures on Sunday.Scientists first discovered the new variant in a patient in September, Susan Hopkins of Public Health England told Sky News.She said that scientists in November found the new strain was behind a cluster of cases in Kent which spread into London and Essex and informed the government on December 11.Public Health England then again notified the government on Friday when modelling revealed the full seriousness of the new strain, she said.She confirmed the figure given by Johnson that the new virus strain could be 70 percent more transmissible while saying this was an initial figure.“I think 70% looks like a good number to land on at the moment,” she said.The virus has been found in all regions of England but in small numbers, Hopkins said.Hancock said cases had also been identified in Australia and Europe.Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said on Saturday that the new strain contained 23 differences, including to the way the virus binds to human cells and enters cells.Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading, told AFP that the mutations affect the “spike protein” that studs the virus and is targeted by vaccines.“If we look at the changes that those mutations make to the spike protein, which is target for the vaccine, then we don’t think they are sufficient enough to change the effectiveness of the vaccine,” he said.London Mayor Sadiq Khan told Sky News that London now has the same number of hospital patients with the virus as during the peak of the first wave in April. Cases have also grown rapidly among those aged 10 to 19, he said.The grave situation prompted widespread criticism of the Prime Minister for promising last week not to “cancel Christmas.”“Not much was understood about this mutant virus. But that uncertainty should have been enough for the PM to see that then was the time to call off Christmas,” wrote The Sunday Mirror weekly.Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer accused Johnson of being scared of taking unpopular decisions.London’s Oxford Street is usually packed with Christmas shoppers but was almost deserted on Sunday.Some passers-by said they backed the measures.“It was necessary to do it before and making wild promises hasn’t helped the situation at all,” said David, a 59-year-old working in insurance.But Richard Charles, a 32-year-old service industry worker, called the move overly rushed.“It shouldn’t be some sort of diktat that happens overnight,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coronavirus-strain-out-of-control-as-england-faces-lengthy-lockdown/story-osiyqPjSZOMU5btVmb8mfL.html
21-12-2020||World||Saudi, UAE govt spyware targets phones of Al-Jazeera journalists: Report||Dozens of journalists at Al-Jazeera, the Qatari state-owned media company, have been targeted by advanced spyware in an attack likely linked to the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a cybersecurity watchdog said Sunday.Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said it traced malware that infected the personal phones of 36 journalists, producers, anchors and executives at Al-Jazeera back to the Israel-based NSO Group, which has been widely condemned for selling spyware to repressive governments.Most unnerving to the investigators was that iMessages were infecting targeted cellphones without the users taking any action — what’s known as a zero-click vulnerability. Through push notifications alone, the malware instructed the phones to upload their content to servers linked to the NSO Group, Citizen Lab said, turning journalists’ iPhones into powerful surveillance tools without even luring users to click on suspicious links or threatening texts.The coordinated attacks on Qatari-funded Al-Jazeera, which Citizen Lab described as the largest concentration of phone hacks targeting a single organization, occurred in July, just weeks before the Trump administration announced the normalization of ties between Israel and the UAE, the archival to Qatar. The breakthrough deal took public what had been a long-secret alliance. Analysts say normalization likely will lead to stronger cooperation in digital surveillance between Israel and Persian Gulf sheikhdoms.Apple said it was aware of the Citizen Lab report and said the latest version of its mobile operating system, iOS 14, “delivered new protections against these kinds of attacks.” It sought to reassure users that NSO doesn’t target the average iPhone owner, but rather sells its software to foreign governments to target a limited group. Apple said it has not been able to independently verify Citizen Lab’s analysis.Citizen Lab, which has been tracking NSO spyware for four years, tied the attacks “with medium confidence” to the Emirati and Saudi governments, based on their past targeting of dissidents at home and abroad with the same spyware. The two countries are embroiled in a bitter geopolitical dispute with Qatar in which hacking and cyber surveillance have increasingly become favored tools.In 2017, the two Gulf nations and their allies imposed a blockade on Qatar over its alleged support for extremist groups, a charge Doha denies. The UAE and Saudi Arabia served the tiny country with a list of demands, among them shutting down its influential Arabic-language TV network, which the UAE and Saudi Arabia see as promoting a political agenda at odds with their own. The feud continues to fester, although officials recently have indicated a resolution may be within reach.Emirati and Saudi authorities did not respond to requests for comment.The NSO Group cast doubt on Citizen Lab’s accusations in a statement but said it was “unable to comment on a report that we have not yet seen.” The firm said it provides technology for the sole purpose of enabling “governmental law enforcement agencies to tackle serious organized crime and counterterrorism.” Nevertheless, it added, “when we receive credible evidence of misuse … we take all necessary steps in accordance with our product misuse investigation procedure in order to review the allegations.” NSO does not identify its customers.Prior to Sunday’s report, NSO’s spyware has repeatedly been found deployed to hack journalists, lawyers, human rights defenders and dissidents. Most notably, the spyware was implicated in the gruesome killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 and whose body has never been found. Several alleged targets of the spyware, including a close friend of Khashoggi and several Mexican civil society figures, sued NSO in an Israeli court over the hacking.The NSO Group’s surveillance software, known as Pegasus, is designed to bypass detection and mask its activity. The malware infiltrates phones to vacuum up personal and location data and surreptitiously control the smartphone’s microphones and cameras, allowing hackers to spy on reporters’ face-to-face meetings with sources.“It’s not only very scary, but it’s the holy grail of phone hacking,” said Bill Marczak, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab. “You can be using your phone normally, completely unaware that someone else is looking at everything you’re doing.”The Citizen Lab researchers connected the hacks to previously identified Pegasus operators in attacks attributed to Saudi Arabia and the UAE over the last four years.Rania Dridi, a newscaster at the London-based satellite channel Al Araby, never noticed anything amiss. Although she said she’s accustomed to Emirati and Saudi criticism over her reporting on human rights and the UAE’s role in wars in Libya and Yemen, she was shocked to learn her phone had been infected with invasive spyware on several occasions starting October 2019.“It’s a horrible feeling to be so insecure, to know my private life wasn’t private this whole time,” she said.The zero-click vulnerability is increasingly being used to hack cellphones without a trace, said Marczak. Last year, WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook filed an unprecedented lawsuit against the NSO Group, accusing the Israeli firm of targeting some 1,400 users of its encrypted messaging service with highly sophisticated spyware through missed calls. Earlier this month, an Al-Jazeera anchor filed another lawsuit in the US, alleging that the NSO Group hacked her phone through WhatsApp over her reporting on Saudi Arabia’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.With the UAE and Bahrain normalizing ties with Israel, the use of Israeli spyware in the region may accelerate, Marczak added, encompassing a “much wider range of government agencies and customers across the Gulf.”The Al-Jazeera attack represents the tip of the iceberg, said Yaniv Balmas, head of cyber research at Check Point, an Israeli security company.“These hacks are not supposed to be public,” he said. “We should assume they’re happening all the time, everywhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-uae-govt-spyware-targets-phones-of-al-jazeera-journalists-report/story-cWmAGTFMg1TSW3SHrsB4tM.html
21-12-2020||World||Can vaccines defeat the ever-mutating coronavirus?||London has gone into a complete lockdown this holiday season after a new variant of the Covid-19 virus was discovered in the United Kingdom. Prime minister Boris Johnson immediately imposed Tier 4 restrictions to suspend the rapid spread of the virus.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Scientists are not surprised by this new discovery. Researchers have observed thousands of changes in the genetic data of Sars-CoV-2 that causes the coronavirus disease and has been there all around the world since its spread in 2019. The mutations can affect how the virus infects the human cells, how severe the disease can get, how easily the virus spreads and its response to the immune system including to the vaccines.They believe due to vaccination and response of the human immune system, the survival of the pathogen becomes difficult causing it to evolve that can make it spread easily or go undetected by the immune system. “This thing’s transmitting, it’s acquiring, it’s adapting all the time. But people don’t want to hear what we say, which is: This virus will mutate,” Dr Ravindra Gupta, a University of Cambridge virologist told the New York Times.Muge Cevik, a scientific advisor to the British government and expert in infectious disease at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, told NYT that the new variant discovered in Britain has around 20 mutations, including some that can impact how the virus restrains the cells in the human body and infect. These modifications can enable the virus to spread efficiently and proliferate faster. He also said British officials believe that the variant is as much as 70 per cent more communicable, though this has not been confirmed in lab experiments yet.Responding to the greater concerns of the virus mutating to a level where it can get immune to the vaccine being developed around the world, scientists have said that it will take more than years for the virus to mutate to such extent. “We pay most attention to mutations in the gene that encodes the Spike protein, which is associated with viral entry into cells and it is relevant in the context of immunity and vaccine efficacy,” researchers of Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) said in a report.Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary biologist in Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in the US, told NYT that the new vaccines developed by Pfizer BioTech and Moderna are being made in a way that can be updated easily in comparison to the traditional vaccines. He said the new vaccines are capable of generating a great immune response to the virus so the coronavirus needs years of mutation for the vaccines to be modified.Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium collects, sequence, analyze the genomes of the coronavirus samples in the UK to add to the wealth of knowledge required to combat the disease. “As vaccines are rolled out, it will be important to sequence SARS-CoV-2 virus from infected people who have been vaccinated or have had a second episode of Covid-19. The aim is to detect variants that are evading the immune system elicited by past infection or vaccination,” the COG-UK report on the mutations said.The fears of the new variant have spread all across the globe that has isolated the UK. Many European nations, as well as countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Canada and others, have suspended their international flights. The new variant was found in the UK, South Africa and in Danish minks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-vaccines-defeat-the-ever-mutating-coronavirus/story-WhtG7sMxRw0t6lNeRMAvaO.html
21-12-2020||World||Donald Trump’s legacy: He changed the presidency, but will it last?||The most improbable of presidents, Donald Trump reshaped the office and shattered its centuries-old norms and traditions while dominating the national discourse like no one before.Trump, governing by whim and tweet, deepened the nation’s racial and cultural divides and undermined faith in its institutions. His legacy: a tumultuous four years that were marked by his impeachment, failures during the worst pandemic in a century and his refusal to accept defeat.He smashed conceptions about how presidents behave and communicate, offering unvarnished thoughts and policy declarations alike, pulling back the curtain for the American people while enthralling supporters and unnerving foes — and sometimes allies — both at home and abroad.While the nation would be hardpressed to elect another figure as disruptive as Trump, it remains to be seen how much of his imprint on the office itself, occupied by only 44 other men, will be indelible. Already it shadows the work of his successor, President-elect Joe Biden, who framed his candidacy as a repudiation of Trump, offering himself as an antidote to the chaos and dissent of the past four years while vowing to restore dignity to the Oval Office.“For all four years, this is someone who at every opportunity tried to stretch presidential power beyond the limits of the law,” said presidential historian Michael Beschloss. “He altered the presidency in many ways, but many of them can be changed back almost overnight by a president who wants to make the point that there is a change.”Trump’s most enduring legacy may be his use of the trappings of the presidency to erode Americans’ views of the institutions of their own government.From his first moments in office, Trump waged an assault on the federal bureaucracy, casting a suspicious eye on career officials he deemed the “Deep State” and shaking Americans’ confidence in civil servants and the levers of government. Believing that the investigation into Russian election interference was a crusade to undermine him, Trump went after the intelligence agencies and Justice Department — calling out leaders by name — and later unleashed broadsides against the man running the probe, respected special counsel Robert Mueller.His other targets were legion: the Supreme Court for insufficient loyalty; the post office for its handling of mail-in ballots; even the integrity of the vote itself with his baseless claims of election fraud.“In the past, presidents who lost were always willing to turn the office over to the next person. They were willing to accept the vote of the American public,” said Richard Waterman, who studies the presidency at the University of Kentucky. “What we’re seeing right now is really an assault on the institutions of democracy.”Current polling suggests that many Americans, and a majority of Republicans, feel that Biden was illegitimately elected, damaging his credibility as he takes office during a crisis and also creating a template of deep suspicion for future elections.“That’s a cancer,” Waterman said. “I don’t know if the cancer can be removed from the presidency without doing damage to the office itself. I think he’s done tremendous damage in the last several weeks.”Jeopardizing the peaceful transfer of power was hardly Trump’s first assault on the traditions of the presidency.He didn’t release his tax returns or divest himself from his businesses. He doled out government resources on a partisan basis and undermined his own scientists. He rage tweeted at members of his own party and used government property for political purposes, including the White House as the backdrop for his renomination acceptance speech.Trump used National Guard troops to clear a largely peaceful protest across from the White House for a photo-op. He named a secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, who needed a congressional waiver to serve because the retired general had not been out of uniform for the seven years required by law. In that one example, Biden has followed Trump’s lead, nominating for Pentagon chief retired Gen. Lloyd Austin, who also will need a waiver.Trump’s disruption extended to the global stage as well, where he cast doubt on once-inviolable alliances like NATO and bilateral partnerships with a host of allies. His “America First” foreign policy emanated more from preconceived notions of past slights than current facts on the ground. He unilaterally pulled troops from Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq and Syria, each time drawing bipartisan fire for undermining the very purpose of the American deployment.He pulled out of multinational environmental agreements, an action that scientists warn may have accelerated climate change. He stepped away from accords that kept Iran’s nuclear ambitions, if not its regional malevolence, in check.And his presidency may be remembered for altering, perhaps permanently, the nature of the U.S.-China relationship, dimming hopes for a peaceful emergence of China as a world power and laying the foundation for a new generation of economic and strategic rivalry.While historians agree that Trump was a singular figure in the office, it will be decades before the consequences of his tenure are fully known. But some pieces of his legacy already are in place.He named three Supreme Court justices and more than 220 federal judges, giving the judiciary an enduring conservative bent. He rolled back regulations and oversaw an economy that boomed until the pandemic hit. His presence increased voter turnout — both for and against him — to record levels. He received unwavering loyalty from his own party but was quick to cast aside any who displeased him.“President Trump has been the person who has returned power to the American people, not the Washington elite, and preserved our history and institutions, while others have tried to tear them down,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. “The American people elected a successful businessman who promised to go to Washington, not to tear it down, but to put them first.”At times, Trump acted like a bystander to his own presidency, opting to tweet along with a cable news segment rather than dive into an effort to change policy. And that was one of the many ways Trump changed the way that presidents communicate.Carefully crafted policy statements took a back seat, replaced by tweets and off-the-cuff remarks to reporters over the whir of helicopter blades. The discourse hardened, with swear words, personal insults and violent imagery infiltrating the presidential lexicon. And there were the untruths — more than 23,000, according to a count by The Washington Post — that Trump tossed out with little regard for their impact.It was that lack of honesty that played a role in his defeat in an election that became a referendum on how he had managed the Covid-19 pandemic, which has now killed more than 300,000 Americans.Day after day during his reelection campaign, Trump defied health guidelines and addressed packed, largely mask-less crowds, promising the nation was “rounding the corner” on the virus. He admitted that from the beginning, he set out to play down the seriousness of the virus.He held superspreader events at the White House and contracted the virus himself. And while his administration spearheaded Operation Warp Speed, which helped to produce coronavirus vaccines in record time, Trump also undermined his pubic health officials by refusing to embrace mask-wearing and suggesting unproven treatments, including the injection of disinfectant.“We have seen that Donald Trump’s style was one of the contributing factors to his failure as a president,” said Mark K. Updegrove, presidential historian and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. “His successor can look at his presidency as a cautionary tale.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-legacy-he-changed-the-presidency-but-will-it-last/story-g4KQfWF3FNz5UwkXjZZc0N.html
21-12-2020||World||Tesla’s rise made 2020 the year US auto industry went electric||Tesla Inc and Wall Street made 2020 the year that the US auto industry decided to go electric.Tesla’s market capitalization surged above $600 billion, making the once wobbly startup founded by billionaire Elon Musk worth more than the five top-selling global vehicle making groups combined. The exclamation point came on Friday when Tesla rose to a record high in frantic trading ahead of the stock’s much anticipated entrance into the benchmark S&P 500 index..For 2021, all signs point toward the industry accelerating its shift toward electrification, a turning point as historically momentous as the launch of Ford Motor Co’s moving assembly line for the Model T or General Motors ‘ 2009 bankruptcy.Tesla’s ascent came the same year that activist hedge funds and other investors ratcheted up pressure on corporations to fight climate change. Evidence is growing that more investors have concluded the century-long dominance of internal combustion engines - “ICE” in industry slang - is headed toward a close within a decade.From London to Beijing to California, political leaders also embraced plans to start phasing out internal combustion engine-only vehicles as early as 2030. Pressure to cut greenhouse gas emissions undermines the logic for significant new investments in ICE engines. Thousands of manufacturing jobs are currently tied to internal combustion in the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Japan and other countries.Other powerful forces also shook the auto industry’s status quo this year. The Covid-19 pandemic stripped away the sales and profits that incumbent automakers had counted on to fund methodical transitions to electric vehicles. China’s rapid recovery from the pandemic exerted an even more powerful gravitational pull on industry investment.This was the year GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and other top industry executives began to echo Tesla’s Musk, saying electric vehicle battery costs could soon achieve parity with internal combustion technology. Still, it remained to be seen whether consumers, particularly in the United States, are ready to say goodbye to petroleum-fueled pickup trucks and SUVs.The best-selling vehicles in the United States remain large, petroleum-burning pickup trucks. Demand for these vehicles powered a recovery for Detroit automakers after the pandemic forced factories to shut down in the spring.The best electric vehicle and battery makers could field models that match internal combustion upfront cost as soon as 2023, brokerage Bernstein wrote in a report.“ICE game over with BEV ~ 2030,” Bernstein’s auto analysts wrote, using the industry’s acronyms for internal combustion engine and Battery Electric Vehicle.The shift toward electric vehicles is speeding a parallel transformation of vehicles into largely digital machines that get much of their value from software that powers rich visual displays and features such as automated driving systems.Across the industry, century-old manufacturers such as Daimler AG are scrambling to hire programmers and artificial intelligence experts.The capability of software to manage autonomous driving systems, electricity flows from batteries and data streaming to and from vehicles is replacing horsepower as a measure of automotive engineering achievement.Tesla’s use of smartphone-style over-the-air software upgrades was once a unique feature of the Silicon Valley brand. In 2020, the best-selling model line in the United States, the Ford F-150 pickup, was redesigned to offer over-the-air software updates, making the technology as mainstream as it gets.In the best of times, traditional internal-combustion vehicles would have faced huge costs and disruptions to their workforces to evolve to electric, software-intensive vehicles. But the shock delivered by the coronavirus pandemic gave manufacturers much less money and time to adapt.Consultancy IHS Markit forecasts that global vehicle production will not match 2019 levels again until 2023. Automakers will have produced 20 million fewer vehicles by 2023 than they could have built had output stayed at 2019 levels.“Only the most agile with a Darwinian spirit will survive,” said Carlos Tavares, the Peugeot SA chief who will lead the combined Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler when that merger is completed.The pandemic also elevated the importance of China to the industry’s future. That country’s swift recovery from the pandemic amplified the gravitational pull of its huge market on automotive investment, despite anti-China rhetoric from US and European politicians.China’s drive to reduce dependence on petroleum is compelling automakers to shift investment toward battery electric and hybrid vehicles, and re-center design and engineering activities to Chinese cities from traditional hubs in Nagoya, Wolfsburg and Detroit. Tesla said it will establish a design and research center in China.Daimler AG Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius put it bluntly in October: “We need to look at our production footprint and where it makes sense, shift our production,” he said during a video call. “Last year we sold around 700,000 passenger cars in China. The next biggest market is the US with between 320,000 and 330,000 cars.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-s-rise-made-2020-the-year-us-auto-industry-went-electric/story-hjedpILktZ5mx7AJAkNRXN.html
21-12-2020||World||Japan’s $1 trillion budget highlights Covid-19 challenge to growth, debt||Japan’s cabinet approved on Monday a record $1.03 trillion budget draft for the next fiscal year starting in April 2021, the Ministry of Finance said, as the coronavirus and stimulus spending puts pressure on already dire public finances.The 106.6 trillion yen ($1.03 trillion) annual budget also got a boost from record military and welfare outlays. It marked a 4% rise from this year’s initial level, rising for nine years in a row, with new debt making up more than a third of revenue.From Europe to America, policymakers globally have unleashed a torrent of monetary and fiscal stimulus to prevent a deep and prolonged recession as the pandemic shut international borders and sent many out of work.In Japan, fiscal reform has been shelved as Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga prioritised efforts to contain the pandemic and boost growth, despite public debt at more than twice the size of Japan’s $5 trillion economy.“How to balance the coronavirus response with fiscal reform has hardly been debated in Japan,” said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research. “Ultra-low interest rates under the Bank of Japan’s prolonged monetary easing may have caused fiscal discipline to be paralysed.”The spending plan, which was in line with a Reuters report out last week, must be approved by parliament early next year.It will be rolled out along with a third extra budget for this fiscal year as a combined 15-month budget aimed for seamless spending to ease the virus pain and back Suga’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality and digital transformation.“We had to strike a right balance between the needs to prevent the spread of infections, revive the economy and achieve fiscal reform,” Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters after a cabinet meeting.“That was the most difficult task in compiling this budget.” The government’s fiscal 2021 primary budget deficit - excluding new bond sales and debt servicing - is seen at 20.4 trillion yen, more than double this year’s initial estimates, making the budget-balancing goal further elusive.Rating agency Fitch in July cut its outlook on Japan’s debt rating to negative from stable, warning of the Covid-19 impact on rising public debt.“The massive stimulus spending rolled out this fiscal year may raise worry about ‘fiscal cliff’, which could justify calls for more spending in the coming fiscal year,” said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-1-trillion-budget-highlights-covid-19-challenge-to-growth-debt/story-6VaM9tZXBVlBafq15XHCfL.html
21-12-2020||World||Google, Facebook laws critical for media future: Australia regulator chief||Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman (ACCC) Rod Sims said proposed laws that will make Australia the first country in the world to force Google and Facebook to pay for news were fair and critical for the survival of the media industry.Sims said he was surprised to hear criticisms from Google about the draft legislation unveiled by the Australian government earlier this month.Google last week declared the code unworkable, citing in particular a requirement to provide publishers with two weeks’ notice of certain changes to algorithms and internal practice. “We thought they were comfortable with that ... so we were very surprised that they’re still complaining about that,” Sims said in an interview on Monday for Reuters Next. Some media organisations, meanwhile, are unhappy that the code includes a “two-way value exchange” when deciding commercial agreements, which requires media companies to consider the value they receive from Facebook and Google users viewing their content. “To be honest, we never thought that value was very large, because if the platforms weren’t there, our judgment is people would go straight to the news media businesses website anyway,” Sims said, noting the first draft of the code employed a one-way value exchange. “But we do understand that there is some value in that, so it was only fair to recognise that, after all, we want a bargaining code that is seen to be fair and I think two-way value achieves that.”The ACCC has increasingly focused on the rapidly growing market power of Google and Facebook. It has two inquiries open into advertising technology and mobile app stores, with reports due in January and March, respectively. Sims, who expressed concern about excessive pricing and self-preferencing by the app stores, said the reports would put a spotlight on the state-of-play and added the regulator would continue to focus on data concerns in 2021. “I’m hopeful that not just Australia, but companies overseas will benefit from what we find,” Sims said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-facebook-laws-critical-for-media-future-australia-regulator-chief/story-6RqtRfkH8IB2d9cdQmZkCN.html
21-12-2020||World||What’s in the $900 billion US Covid-19 aid package||US congressional leaders reached an agreement on a $900 billion package on Sunday which will provide the first new aid in months to an economy hammered by the coronavirus pandemic. The US Congress was working under a deadline of midnight Sunday -- needing to reach consensus both on assistance to hard-pressed American households and companies and on the 2021 federal budget in order to avoid a government shutdown.“We have agreed to a package of nearly $900 billion. It is packed with targeted policies to help struggling Americans who have already waited too long,” Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement.Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer confirmed an agreement had been reached with Republicans and the White House on a deal that “delivers urgently needed funds to save the lives and livelihoods of the American people as the virus accelerates.”According to a summary released by Democratic house speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, here are the details of the package: Checks in the mail: The bill includes $166 billion in new direct payments of up to $600 per adult and child, for individuals making up to $75,000 a year and $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000 a year. The bill expands direct payments to mixed-status households.More unemployment benefits: An additional $300 per week for some unemployment recipients.US postal service grant: Congress agrees to convert a $10 billion loan approved in March into direct funding for USPS without requiring repayment.Payroll loans: $284 billion for government payroll loans, including expanded eligibility for nonprofits and newspaper and TV and radio broadcasters, $15 billion for live venues, independent movie theatres, and cultural institutions and $20 billion for targeted disaster grantsBack-to-school funding: $82 billion for colleges and schools, including for heating-and-cooling system upgrades to mitigate virus transmission and reopen classrooms, and $10 billion for childcare assistance. Includes $54.3 billion for K-12 schools and $22.7 billion for higher educationBusiness meal write-offs: A new tax break for business meal expenses, nicknamed the “three-martini” deduction.Ending surprise medical billing: Insured patients only need to pay in-network costs when an emergency or other issue forces them to use a medical provider who isn’t covered by their network.Transport industry help: $45 billion for transportation aid, including $15 billion to U.S. passenger airlines for payroll assistance, $14 billion for transit systems, $10 billion for state highway funding, $2 billion for airports, $1 billion for airline contractors and $1 billion for passenger railroad Amtrak.Rent and eviction aid: $25 billion for rent and utility payment assistance for people struggling to stay in their homes, and an extension of the eviction moratorium until Jan. 31. States will receive a minimum of $200 million in assistance.Vaccine distribution aid: $30 billion to support procurement and distribution of the vaccine, “ensuring it’s free and rapidly distributed to everyone,” as Schumer said.More to fight hunger: $13 billion for food assistance, including additional funding for food banks and senior nutrition programs, college student access to the federal government’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.Farm aid: Another $13 billion for direct payments, purchases and loans to farmers and ranchers.Expanded Pell Grants: New grants for college tuition, which would reach 500,000 new recipients.Internet access: $7 billion to give more Americans broadband internet access, including $1.9 billion to replace telecom network equipment that poses national security risks and $3.2 billion for a new temporary benefit program to help low-income Americans get access to broadband serviceGlobal virus alliances: $4 billion for an international vaccine allianceTax credits: Enhanced tax credits to encourage low-income housing construction, businesses to keep employees on the payroll, employers to provide paid sick leave, and for low-income workers.Minority-owned businesses: $12 billion for minority-owned and very small businesses that struggled to access earlier Payroll Protection Program financing.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-s-in-the-900-billion-us-covid-19-aid-package/story-ZnEWPPmGWElJiVSVf1nV5K.html
21-12-2020||World||US asked to prioritize frontline essential workers as distribution of Moderna shots begins||An advisory panel on Sunday recommended US frontline essential workers and people 75 and older should be next in line to get inoculated as the distribution of Moderna Inc’s vaccine, the second approved coronavirus vaccine, began across the country.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 13 to 1 to recommend 30 million frontline essential workers, which include first responders, teachers, food and agriculture, manufacturing, US Postal Service, public transit, and grocery store workers, have the next priority for the vaccines. In all, the move would make 51 million people eligible to get inoculated in the next round. It was not immediately clear when the next round would begin.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAbout 200 million people including non-frontline workers such as those in media, finance, energy and IT and communication industries, persons in the 65-74 age group, and those aged 16-64 years with high-risk conditions should be in the ensuing round, the panel recommended.States, which are the ones distributing shots to their residents, will use the advisory panel’s guidelines to decide on how to allocate the vaccines while supplies are scarce.Inoculation against the disease is key to safely reopening large parts of the economy and reducing the risks of illness at crowded meatpacking plants, factories and warehouses. However, confusion has broken out over who exactly is considered essential during a pandemic. Ahead of the vote, many companies and industry groups had been lobbying to get their US workers in line to receive the vaccines immediately after healthcare professionals and long-term care facility residents.Meanwhile, trucks of FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc started picking up the doses from warehouses for deliveries to hospitals and other sites.Vials of Moderna’s vaccine were filled in pharmaceutical services provider Catalent Inc’s facility in Bloomington, Indiana. Distributor McKesson Corp is shipping doses from facilities in places including Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis, Tennessee - close to air hubs for UPS and FedEx.Both FedEx and UPS said the shipments were running smoothly and everything was going exactly as planned.Separately, US health officials are monitoring the new strain of Covid-19 emerging in the United Kingdom, US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on Sunday, adding that any mutation shows people must keep protecting themselves from the novel coronavirus while awaiting vaccination.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and scientists announced on Saturday that the new virus strain had led to spiraling infection numbers, tightening the Covid-19 restrictions for London and nearby areas and disrupting the Christmas holiday plans of millions of people.Also Read: Health ministry meeting today after spread of mutant coronavirus strain in UKThe variant, which officials say is up to 70% more transmissible than the original, has prompted concerns about a wider spread. Several European countries, including Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, said they were taking measures to prevent people arriving from Britain, including bans on flights and trains.The distribution of Moderna’s vaccine to more than 3,700 locations in the United States will vastly widen the rollout started last week by Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE. US Covid-19 vaccine program head Moncef Slaoui said it was most likely the first Moderna vaccine shot, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Friday, would be given on Monday morning.“We look forward to the vaccine. It’s going to be slightly easier to distribute because it doesn’t require as low (a) temperature as Pfizer,” Slaoui said on CNN. The US government plans to deliver 5.9 million Moderna shots and 2 million Pfizer shots this week.Data from CDC shows 2.84 million doses have been distributed and 556,208 shots administered thus far.The start of delivery for the Moderna vaccine will significantly widen availability of Covid-19 vaccines as US deaths caused by the respiratory disease have reached more than 316,000 in the 11 months since the first documented US cases. Some states are choosing to use Moderna’s shots for harder-to-reach rural areas because they can be stored for 30 days in standard-temperature refrigerators. Pfizer’s must be shipped and stored at minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) and can be held for only five days at standard refrigerator temperatures. Initial doses were given to health professionals. Programs by pharmacies Walgreens and CVS to distribute the Pfizer vaccine to long-term care facilities are expected to start on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-asked-to-prioritize-frontline-essential-workers-as-distribution-of-moderna-shots-begins/story-inV8Krq38fNXpdN8PPpYWL.html

21-12-2020||World||What do we know about coronavirus’ latest strain found in UK||The United Kingdom announced a surprise lockdown on Saturday in London and parts of the country amid a surge in the cases of the coronavirus disease after the discovery of a new strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. According to experts, the new strain is 70% more infectious than other strains of the virus. It is believed that most of the new cases in the country are driven by this variant, with up to 60% of the cases in London being caused by it.Here’s everything you need to know about the latest strain of coronavirus in the UK:Why is the variant causing concern?There has been concern about the latest variant as it is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus and according to experts, this would result in its spread more easily. Although, nothing can be said with certainty but as a precautionary measure the country has been put into a fresh lockdown. “It is really too early to tell… but from what we see so far it is growing very quickly, it is growing faster than (a previous variant) ever grew, but it is important to keep an eye on this,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during a press conference.How new is the variant?The variant is not new. In fact, it was first detected in September. In November, around a quarter of cases in London were from the new variant. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December, according to a report in the BBC. Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, said, “The amount of evidence in the public domain is woefully inadequate to draw strong or firm opinions on whether the virus has truly increased transmission.”How far is the spread in the UK and the world?The variant has been found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, the South East and eastern England. Cases elsewhere in the country do not seem to have taken off. Data from Nextstrain, which has been monitoring the genetic codes of the viral samples around the world, suggest cases in Denmark and Australia have come from the UK. The Netherlands has also reported cases. A similar variant that has emerged in South Africa shares some of the same mutations, but appears to be unrelated to this one.Will the mutation be more deadly?There is no evidence to suggest the same, although this is being monitored. However, just increasing transmission would be enough to cause problems for hospitals. If the new variant means more people are infected more quickly, that would, in turn, lead to more people needing hospital treatment.Will the vaccines work against the new variant?Almost certainly yes, or at least for now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-do-we-know-about-coronavirus-latest-strain-found-in-uk/story-NXtJHgkY7v8HGknO5jyItK.html
21-12-2020||World||Vaccines effective against new virus strain: German health minister||European Union experts believe existing vaccines against coronavirus are effective against the new fast-spreading strain identified in Britain, Germany’s health minister said Sunday.“According to everything we know so far” the new strain “has no impact on the vaccines”, which remain “just as effective”, Jens Spahn told public broadcaster ZDF, citing “talks among experts of European authorities”.Spahn was referring especially to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is already being administered in countries including the US and UK and which is on the brink of receiving approval from the European Medicines Agency.A health ministry spokesman said the EU experts’ meeting had taken place on Sunday and included representatives of Berlin’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health.A number of EU nations have banned air travel from Britain in response to the new strain, while France said it would block people arriving from the UK and all freight unless it is unaccompanied.Within Britain, London has announced tougher infection control measures affecting some parts of the country.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Saturday the variant could be up to 70 percent more infectious than the main strain, based on preliminary data.The World Health Organization said that nine cases have been detected in Denmark and one each in the Netherlands and Australia, while Italy said late Sunday it too had detected a single case in a person returning from Britain.Germany, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, has organised a Monday meeting of experts to discuss the bloc’s response to the new threat, the health ministry spokesman said.The meeting will be held under the European Council’s IPCR crisis response scheme, which can be invoked for health, environmental or terrorist emergencies among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-effective-against-new-virus-strain-german-health-minister/story-XIpozhQMtoBSRPjYqyGblO.html
21-12-2020||World||Surprise elections in Nepal next year||A little less than three years after he was sworn in as prime minister for the second time, Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli on Sunday morning dropped a bombshell on his rivals in the ruling Nepal Communist Party. PM Oli’s cabinet recommended dissolution of the 275-member House of Representatives that was elected in 2017, when the opposition Nepali Congress suffered a defeat by a landslide in the polls.PM Oli’s surprise move on Sunday sent his rivals within the ruling Nepal Communist Party running for cover, arguing that Nepal’s constitution did not have a provision for dissolution of Parliament by a Prime Minister at the head of a majority government.Bishnu Rijal, a central committee member of the ruling party, said that instead of seeking a compromise with his rivals in the party, PM Oli had chosen to dissolve Parliament. “The prime minister has lost the majority in the parliamentary party, central committee and the secretariat of the party,” a Reuters report quoted him as saying.President Bidya Devi Bhandari accepted the recommendation and announced national elections in two phases to be held on April 30 and May 10.People familiar with the matter said PM Oli’s move to dissolve Parliament would give him a free hand to run the government and split the party formed in 2018 by the merger of his Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal- Maoist Centre.For months, Prachanda had been trying to pin PM Oli down and had led several revolts against the prime minister, demanding a greater say in running the government. PM Oli, who had led them to victory on the basis of a nationalist agenda had refused to cede any space and dropped enough hints that he was prepared to split the Nepal Communist Party if he was pushed to the wall.This is an eventuality that the Chinese Communist Party had been struggling to avoid for months.Beijing had deputed its envoy to Nepal Hou Yanqi to hold a series of meetings in late April and early May — around the same time that China’s soldiers were crossing the line in eastern Ladakh — to hold consultations with Nepal’s communist leaders to get them to stay united.Ambassador Hou continued her interventions to keep the NCP united over the next few months. But PM Oli’s camp soon enough figured out that China was okay with the ruling NCP giving PM Oli the pink slip if this is what it would take to avoid a split in the party.PM Oli, who had spent 14 years in jail for opposing the now-abolished monarchy in the 1970s and 1980s, wasn’t ready to fade into oblivion yet.Nepal watchers said China, which initially seemed to back 68-year-old Oli, had changed tack earlier this year and was willing to sacrifice him if it would help keep the NCP united.Ambassador Hou was working on this pitch when last month, PM Oli is believed to have told her off, suggesting that he was capable of handling challenges within his party without any assistance from other countries.The Chinese envoy didn’t exactly back off but her subsequent interventions were done quietly. When meeting politicians from the ruling party, she would move around in unmarked cars or taxis in Kathmandu, said a Nepal watcher.“There were two other formulas that the Chinese envoy continued to work on,” a person who tracks developments in Nepal politics said on condition of anonymity. Apart from negotiating a format where the NCP’s former prime minister Dahal and Madhav Nepal hold the strings of power minus PM Oli, ambassador Hou also explored the possibility of the NCP shunting out PM Oli and promoting Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam instead.Since Gautam comes from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) that PM Oli headed before the 2018 merger, it was expected that this would minimise the damage that PM Oli could wreak on the party in case of a split. The fourth option that the Chinese envoy did explore was the possibility that the senior leadership of the NCP let the next generation leaders of the party who would be more amenable to a negotiated settlement take charge, the Nepal watcher said.PM Oli’s Sunday surprise, however, upended the Chinese efforts as well.Oli aide Rajan Bhattarai said the prime minister had made the move because of the backlash against him by his party, which had also asked him to consider quitting as its president.“So he decided to face the people in an election,” Bhattarai told Reuters. “This is the best way in a democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/surprise-elections-in-nepal-next-year/story-yVIPZsuXZDH5g3YFgPEh5L.html
21-12-2020||World||Biden unveils team to deal with climate crisis||President-elect Joe Biden on Saturday introduced key members of his environmental team and said his administration would make the fight against the climate crisis a pillar of his drive to rebuild the pandemic-hit US economy.Biden said these nominees will lead his administration’s “ambitious plan to address an existential threat of our time - climate change”.“Folks, we’re in a crisis,” Biden said at the event in Wilmington, Delaware. “Just like we need to be a unified nation to respond to Covid-19, we need a unified national response to climate change.”The nominees introduced on Saturday include Representative Deb Haaland as the new interior secretary. Biden also said he wants to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations and 1.5 million energy-efficient homes and public housing units.He said his administration will create a quarter million jobs “right away” by hiring people to plug millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that are deemed a health and safety risk.Biden repeated that he will rejoin the Paris climate accord, which President Donald Trump abandoned, and restore a slew of Obama-era environmental regulations that Trump eliminated.For other jobs, Biden said he has picked Gina McCarthy, Obama’s environmental protection agency administrator, to lead a new White House office of climate policy.Biden has also tapped Michael Regan, North Carolina’s top environmental regulator, to run the environmental protection agency and Brenda Mallory, an environmental attorney, to direct the council on environmental ouality. Regan and Mallory are Black. Biden said that with Saturday’s announcements, his Cabinet will feature six African-Americans.Cyberattack under control, says Trump Trump on Saturday downplayed a massive cyberattack on US government agencies, declaring it “under control” and undercutting the assessment by his own administration that Russia was to blame.“I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,” Trump tweeted in his first public comments on the hack, adding that “Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens” and suggesting without offering evidence that China “may” also be involved.“There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA,” he added, in his latest allegation of mass fraud in the November 3 election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-unveils-team-to-deal-with-climate-crisis/story-l5cFedaP8CUsdGjJ8pQq3O.html
21-12-2020||World||New UK coronavirus strain triggers alarm, curbs||Concerns over a new strain of the coronavirus that is feared to be more contagious forced at least five countries on Sunday to ban travel from the United Kingdom, with several others, including India, considering similar restrictions. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday that a new variant of the Sars-Cov-2 has spread rapidly in parts of the country, and was estimated by scientists to be 70% more transmissible. The announcement was made when the PM unveiled a new fourth tier of restrictions to come into force in UK’s capital and parts of the country’s south-east.Less than 24 hours following that announcement, Netherlands – which too has detected some cases of the new variant – suspended flights from the UK. Later in the day, Germany, Belgium, Austria and Italy announced they too will restrict travel.A similar decision could also be taken in India, where the government convened an emergency meeting on Monday morning. “We are watching the situation closely and do not rule out a travel restriction. A decision will be taken at the meeting,” said a senior government official, asking not to be named.Health ministry officials too said that they will hold a meeting to assess the threat from the new variant, news agency PTI reported. “The Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) chaired by the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) will hold a meeting on Monday morning to discuss the issue of the mutated variant of the coronavirus reported from the UK. WHO’s India representative Dr Roderico H Ofrin, who is also a member of the JMG, is likely to participate in the meeting,” PTI quoted an unnamed official as saying.The development came days after London confirmed that Johnson had accepted India’s invite to be the chief guest the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi on January 26. The travel curbs also compound problems for the United Kingdom as it finally exits the European Union on December 31 after a transition period this year. London and Brussels have so far failed to reach a post-Brext trade deal, raising the prospect of chaos in goods traffic. While Johnson and British scientists said it was too early to determine if the new variant was more deadly, other UK officials in London said on Sunday that it was “out of control”. Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show whether the virus is under control, Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock replied: “It is out of control and we need to bring it under control… The cases in the Tier 4 areas have absolutely rocketed in the last few days – the last two weeks or so. I am really worried about the NHS (National Health Service). “That is only just below the number there were at the first peak. It is another reason why everybody needs to follow the new rules and take that personal responsibility,” he added, describing the situation as “incredibly difficult”. Viruses mutate often as the biological process of replication within hosts they infect is not always a perfect process. The Sars-Cov-2 has also been mutating, but none of these changes have been seen as worrying as yet. One variant, however, overtook a previous variant of the virus early this summer.According to experts from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, the new variant is significant because it now “accounts for an increasing proportion of cases in parts of England”, “has an unusually large number of genetic changes, particularly in the spike protein”, and the mutations have “have potential biological effects”. Hancock said it was on Friday that scientists showed ministers evidence of the “causality” between the new fast-transmitting variant and the spike in new cases in London and south-east England, which prompted the measures outlined by Johnson on Saturday.London and south-east England have been placed in the new Tier 4 of the alert system, which has varying curbs, from Tier 1 (lowest) to Tier 4 (toughest; equivalent to full lockdown). People are prohibited from travelling to and out of Tier 4.Hancock indicated in Sunday media interviews that London’s lockdown could last months, until a vaccine is rolled out across the population. So far, 350,000 people have received the first of their two-dose vaccine delivered by Pfizer/BioNTech. “There are no easy answers or easy options. I think the mistake would be to ignore new scientific evidence”, he added.London’s airports, train stations and roads were clogged on Saturday night as thousands tried to escape the new lockdown restrictions that came into effect early on Sunday. Scotland Yard said the police would enforce Tier 4 rules from Sunday.People’s fury at Christmas plans being cancelled was reflected in screaming newspaper headlines on Sunday and veteran Conservative MP Charles Walker calling on Hancock to resign, amidst growing criticism in the ruling over party over handling of the virus situation.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-coronavirus-strain-triggers-alarm-curbs/story-oS9ZpGYFlyF1VokTHzxO7N.html
21-12-2020||World||Trump again turns to top court, challenging Pennsylvania loss||President Donald Trump’s campaign said it turned to the US Supreme Court to challenge the election results in Pennsylvania, filing yet another long-shot appeal despite weeks of courtroom defeats and an Electoral College vote last week that formalized Joe Biden’s victory.The latest filing, announced on Sunday, takes the unorthodox step of trying to overturn three separate Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions with a single appeal. Although all three decisions are weeks old, the campaign asked the court to put the cases on an ultra-expedited track with the goal of a ruling before Congress meets Jan. 6 to count the electoral votes.The Supreme Court has already rejected two efforts to overturn Biden’s victory in pivotal states, each time without any justice publicly dissenting. On Dec. 8, the court turned away a bid by Republican lawmakers to reverse Biden’s win in Pennsylvania. Three days later the court refused to let Texas sue to challenge the results in four states.The new Trump appeal centers on the 2.6 million mail-in ballots cast in Pennsylvania. The campaign is challenging an Oct. 23 ruling that said election officials shouldn’t try to verify that the signature on the ballot envelope matches the one on file. The appeal also seeks to overturn a Nov. 23 ruling that said officials shouldn’t reject ballots because they lack a name, address or date on the envelope.In addition, the appeal challenges a Nov. 17 ruling that said Trump campaign representatives had adequate access to observe the vote-counting process in Philadelphia. The campaign says the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unconstitutionally changed the election rules established by the state legislature.Overturning the Pennsylvania results wouldn’t be nearly enough for Trump to reverse Biden’s overall victory. Even if Biden somehow lost the state’s 20 electoral votes, he would still have 286 votes, comfortably above the 270 needed for victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-again-turns-to-top-court-challenging-pennsylvania-loss/story-lzj6y7cxGmTXmUESj2S69H.html
21-12-2020||World||Japan sets record $52 billion military budget with stealth jets, long-range missiles||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s government approved a ninth consecutive rise in military spending on Monday, funding the development of an advanced stealth fighter and longer-range anti-ship missile to counter China’s growing military power.The Ministry of Defense will get a record 5.34 trillion yen ($51.7 billion) for the year starting in April, up 1.1% from this year. With Suga’s large majority in parliament, enactment of the budget is all but certain.Suga is continuing the controversial military expansion pursued by his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, to give Japan’s forces new planes, missiles and aircraft carriers with greater range and potency against potential foes including neighbouring China.China plans to raise its military spending 6.6% this year, the smallest increase in three decades.Japan is buying longer-range missiles and considering arming and training its military to strike distant land targets in China, North Korea and other parts of Asia.A planned jet fighter, the first in three decades, is expected to cost around $40 billion and be ready in the 2030s. That project, which will be led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd with help from Lockheed Martin Corp, gets $706 million in the new budget.Japan will spend $323 million to begin development of a long-range anti-ship missile to defend its southwestern Okinawan island chain.Other big purchases include $628 million for six Lockheed F-35 stealth fighters, including two short-takeoff and vertical-landing (STOVL) B variants that will operate off a converted helicopter carrier.The military will also get $912 million to build two compact warships that can operate with fewer sailors than conventional destroyers, easing pressure on a navy struggling to find recruits in an ageing population.Japan also wants two new warships to carry powerful new Aegis air and ballistic missile defence radars that have much as three times the range of older models. The government has not yet estimated the cost of the plan, which replaces a project cancelled in June to construct two ground Aegis Ashore stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-sets-record-52-billion-military-budget-with-stealth-jets-long-range-missiles/story-tTdEkRJ4altHqqRrpGXryN.html
21-12-2020||World||US congress reaches deal on $900 billion pandemic relief plan||Congressional leaders reached a deal on a roughly $900 billion spending package to bolster the US economy amid the continued coronavirus pandemic giving lawmakers a short timetable to review and pass the second largest economic-rescue measure in the nation’s history.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced the accord Sunday. The legislative text was still being written, but the House was expected to vote on it Monday, followed by the Senate.The plan would provide direct payments of $600 to most Americans and $300-per-week in enhanced unemployment benefits through March, according to lawmakers and aides. Expiring programs for gig workers and the long-term unemployed also would continue.There would be $284 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program that provides forgivable loans to small businesses. The package includes money for transportation -- including for airlines -- vaccine distribution, schools and universities, and food aid.Negotiators couldn’t bridge partisan differences over a liability shield for companies wanted by some Republicans, and aid for state and local governments that Democrats had demanded, and left those out. A last-minute dispute over the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending authority threatened to derail an agreement until a compromise late Saturday cleared the way for the broader deal.The agreement came together after multiple rounds of negotiations over the past week among Pelosi, Schumer, McConnell and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also took part in the talks.The relief plan will be attached to a $1.4 trillion bill that would fund the federal government through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2021. The haggling over the relief package forced Congress to twice pass temporary funding for government operations. The current stopgap expires at midnight Sunday. The House passed another one-day extension to give time for votes on Monday; the Senate was expected to take it up Sunday night.“At long last we have the bipartisan breakthrough the country has needed,” McConnell said on the Senate floor.Pelosi and Schumer lauded the agreement, though they expressed disappointment that the package wasn’t bigger.“While this bill is far from perfect, nor is it the bill that we would pass if Democrats had a majority in the Senate. It is a strong shot in the arm to help American families weather the storm,” Schumer said at a news conference with Pelosi. “We will do more, we must do more.”The White House said President Donald Trump supports the deal.“President Trump has pushed hard for months to send Americans badly needed financial relief,” spokesman Ben Williamson said in an email. “We look forward to Congress sending a bill to his desk imminently for signature.”The deal came about after a months-long standoff that followed passage in March of the largest in a series of pandemic relief packages: a $1.8 trillion mix of spending and tax breaks that represented the biggest such measure in US history. Since then, the economy has struggled to fully recover and another round of lockdowns is threatening to put millions of jobs at risk as deaths from the novel coronavirus rise above 300,000.Pelosi and the Trump administration were close to a $2 trillion deal before the Nov. 3 election -- which Senate Republicans never fully embraced -- and the final agreement is less than half that.While the deal would represent a substantial infusion of aid, it also will put immediate pressure on the incoming Biden administration to spell out the next steps and then wrangle it through Congress.President-elect Joe Biden last week called the emerging deal an “important down payment on what’s going to have to be done at the end of January, the beginning of February.”McConnell has said he expects another relief proposal from Biden, but he hasn’t backed away from his opposition to direct aid to states and localities, or his insistence that employers be protected from Covid-19-related lawsuits. That signals the fight over any new round won’t be any less contentious.The accord comes as the economy is showing signs of deterioration.Some 7.8 million Americans have fallen into poverty since June as benefits from the previous covid relief package lapsed, according to an analysis of ongoing Census data by economists at the University of Chicago and University of Notre Dame.The 2.4 percentage point rise in the estimated US poverty rate through November is nearly double the largest annual increase since the 1960s, the economists said. The increase in poverty has been sharpest in states with more limited unemployment insurance benefits.Separately, a government report last week showed US retail sales tumbled much more than expected in November, while the latest weekly jobless claims figure jumped to the highest level in three months. Payrolls might even contract in December, said Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. The relief package “should be very helpful for the economy,” he said on Bloomberg TV.“Nine hundred billion is a large number,” Feroli said. “You’re talking about a 2% to 3% boost to GDP” over time, he estimated.The package also has implications for the still-unsettled contest for control of the Senate. McConnell told GOP senators on a private call Wednesday that passage will help Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who face Jan. 5 runoffs, according to a person familiar with the conversation.Democrats would gain control of the Senate if both lose. McConnell specifically mentioned that their Democratic opponents, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, were using the delay in getting a deal and additional stimulus payments as attack lines in their campaigns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-reaches-deal-on-900-billion-pandemic-relief-plan/story-5Bb9AIeekKyM6snL9WNevL.html

21-12-2020||World||Italy detects new mutated Covid-19 strain in UK returnee||Italy on Sunday said it has detected a new coronavirus strain with mutations in a person who recently returned from the United Kingdom.On Saturday, the United Kingdom government locked down parts of the country including London after admitting that more than half of all new Covid-19 cases had been caused by a mutated, more infectious coronavirus strain.“The patient and their partner returned from the United Kingdom several days ago, landing in Rome’s Fiumicino airport. They are now isolated and have observed, together with family and close contacts, all procedures proscribed by the health authorities,” Sputnik quoted the ministry’s statement.According to the communication, the genome of the UK coronavirus strain has been established by experts of the Celio military hospital in Rome.The new strain of Covid-19 is “out of control”, said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Sunday.“The only way you can do that is by restricting social contacts and essentially, especially in Tier 4 areas, everybody needs to behave as if they may well have the virus and that is the way that we can get it under control and keep people safe,” he added.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday announced new tier-4 Covid-19 restrictions in parts of England, including London, due to the rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus, limiting the celebrations.A growing number of countries on Sunday halted flights from the UK following the discovery of a new variant of Covid-19, which is said to spread faster than other versions of the virus.According to CNN, Italy Foreign Affairs Minister Luigi Di Malo on Sunday informed that the country will also suspend flights to and from the UK citing the new strain of the coronavirus, although he did not provide more details.CNN reported that the Netherlands government is banning all passenger flights coming from the UK from Sunday morning until the New Year in order to minimise the risk of the new strain from spreading in the country as much as possible, according to a press release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-detects-new-mutated-covid-19-strain-in-uk-returnee/story-Fz9jEM8BftuhfSKAcqgzbI.html
21-12-2020||World||Our investment plans on track, Indian economy has strength to bounce back: Saudi||Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, on Sunday said its investment plans in India are on track, noting that the Indian economy has the strength to recover from the adverse impact of the coronavirus crisis.In February last year, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced that Saudi Arabia would invest over USD 100 billion in India in petrochemicals, refining, infrastructure, mining and manufacturing, agriculture and several other sectors.“Our plans to invest in India are on track and we are in discussion to prioritise investment opportunities in several sectors in both countries,” Saudi Ambassador Dr Saud bin Mohammed Al Sati told PTI in an interview. Stating that Saudi Arabia values India as a strategic partner and a close friend, Al Sati identified ongoing cooperation in areas of training, knowledge sharing and combating terrorism as key elements of the partnership in defence and security sphere. Also Read: The Indian economy is bouncing back | OpinionAl Sati complimented India’s measures to revive its economy in view of the impact of the pandemic and said the economic recovery of both countries will help elevate other economies in the region as well.“The economic relief package provided by India for its most prominent sectors is commendable. As the fifth-largest global economy and the largest economy in South Asia, the Indian economy has the impetus to recover from the impact of the ongoing pandemic,” he said. Without commenting on Army Chief Gen MM Naravane’s visit to Saudi Arabia last week, the Ambassador said the setting up of the Strategic Partnership Council by the two countries opened new avenues of cooperation in several sectors including defence and security and counter-terrorism.“The Strategic (Partnership) Council set up by the two countries in 2019 has opened new avenues on partnership in strategic areas like defence, security counter-terrorism, energy security and renewable energy,” he said.Gen Naravane on Sunday held extensive talks with Commander of Royal Saudi land forces Gen Fahd Bin Abdullah Mohammed Al-Mutir as he began a two-day rare visit to the Gulf country to lay the ground for deeper military ties.In the first-ever visit by a head of the Indian Army, Gen Naravane travelled to Saudi capital city Riyadh last week where he held talks with top military brass.The two sides set up the Strategic Partnership Council during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Riyadh in October last year. The council is mandated to monitor the progress of strategic relationships in a whole range of key areas.  “The current decade has witnessed a remarkable stride in the relations between Saudi Arabia and India. What was once viewed as ties between two friendly countries is now a strong strategic partnership between two formidable economies,” Al Sati said.  “From energy cooperation, security and defense, burgeoning trade relations to health cooperation, the nature of this relationship has diversified immensely allowing for expanded growth. The leadership on both sides have heralded this transformation for Saudi – India ties,” he said.Also Read: India’s economy to struggle with effects of Covid-19 through 2025On trade partnership, the envoy referred to the decision by Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) to invest approximately USD 1.3 billion in Reliance Retail and USD 1.5 billion in Reliance’s Jio platforms “Saudi Aramco is committed to investing in India’s energy sector. Aramco’s decision to buy a stake in Reliance Industries Oil to Chemical business and Aramco’s commitment to invest in the West Coast refinery petrochemical project signifies the interest Saudi Arabia places in the development of India’s energy sector,” he said. Apart from this, Al Sati said Saudi Arabia is continuing to explore new investment opportunities in India. The envoy also highlighted Saudi Arabia’s recent Labor Reform Initiative (LRI), saying they will further help Saudi Arabia and India to cement their economic relationship. “It will enhance the contractual relationship between workers and employers, and will support the Kingdom’s vision of establishing an attractive job market, empowering and developing labour competencies and developing the work environment,” he said. “The initiative is a welcome step in improving the efficiency of the work environment in Saudi Arabia and will complement similar initiatives launched in this regard,” he said. Al Sati said the measures will also contribute towards reducing the disparity between Saudi workers and expatriates. “The positive economic benefits expected from LRI include the development of the local market and the flexibility of work, increase in productivity within the private sector attracting highly skilled talent, and will ultimately help in achieving the goals of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 through the national transformation programme,” he said.Asked about political developments in Yemen, the Saudi Ambassador said the forming of the new government in that country is an important step in the context of implementing the Riyadh agreement. “We hope that this step will help in realising peace and stability in Yemen and in achieving the aspirations of the Yemeni people for a political solution that ends the crisis in Yemen,” he said.The Riyadh agreement was pushed by Saudi Arabia in an effort to end hostilities between Yemen’s internationally recognised government and southern separatists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/our-investment-plans-on-track-indian-economy-has-strength-to-bounce-back-saudi-arabia/story-c8xKJfQppxh26CscfkcawI.html
21-12-2020||World||Europe isolates UK as Covid-19 cases touch new high||Several European countries banned flights and freight links with the UK on Sunday as the new Covid-19 variant sent the number of new cases to a record day-high of 35,928 and the lack of a deal with the EU added new uncertainty and urgency to the post-Brexit phase in 10 days from January 1.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minster, demanded that the Brexit transition period that ends on December 31 be extended, a demand Prime Minister Boris Johnson has so far resisted. She said: “It’s now imperative that PM seeks an agreement to extend the Brexit transition period. The new Covid strain - & the various implications of it - means we face a profoundly serious situation, & it demands our 100% attention. It would be unconscionable to compound it with Brexit”.France banned freight traffic through Eurotunnel for 48 hours from Sunday night over concerns over the spread of the new Covid-19 variant, leading to the closure of the Dover port, which could result in what industry called a “devastating effect”. It also suspended air traffic with the UK for 48 hours.Also Read: Unclear If US has UK Covid-19 mutation, says chief scientific adviser SlaouiRod McKenzie of the Road Haulage Association said: “It’s only 48 hours, but the French ban will have a devastating effect on the supply chain. We have seen in recent days the queues on both sides of the channel because of Brexit stockpiling and the Christmas rush and now border closures will mean everything including perishable food supplies will be impacted”.“We depend on the short straits for our daily supplies. What we are talking about is everything: factory parts, fresh and frozen vegetables, and all the Christmas deliveries,” he added.Other European countries such as Ireland, Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands also banned flights to and from the UK, while others were considering doing so. The Eurostar trains to Belgium are not operating, while Eurotunnel suspended access to the Folkestone terminal for traffic and freight heading to Calais.Johnson is scheduled to hold an COBRA emergency meeting on Monday morning, as the virus-related crisis is likely to be accentuated by uncertainty over trading and other arrangements when the Brexit transition period ends on December 31. Talks in Brussels are yet to reach a conclusion.The developments were triggered following the imposition of a new lockdown on London and south-east England from Sunday morning, and within hours of Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock stating that the new variant of the virus is “out of control”.The Port of Dover – one of the major access points with Europe for trade and road traffic – said in a statement: “Due to border restrictions in France access to the Ferry Terminal at the Port of Dover remains suspended to all accompanied traffic leaving the UK until further notice”.The developments led to concerns over potential disruption to food supplies, since the UK imports much of its food from Europe under smooth, tariff-free trade arrangements in place for decades during its membership of the European Union – which ends on December 31.Food and Drink Federation chief executive Ian Wright warned on Sunday: “Tonight’s suspension of accompanied freight traffic from the UK to France has the potential to cause serious disruption to UK Christmas fresh food supplies - and exports of UK food and drink.”Also Read: Israelis returning from UK to be sent to quarantine hotels“Continental truckers will not want to travel here if they have a real fear of getting marooned. The government must very urgently persuade the French government to exempt accompanied freight from its ban,” he added.Freight industry lobby group Logistics UK appealed for calm from shoppers, stating that it is “maintaining close contact with UK government to ensure that supplies of fresh produce are available throughout Christmas and the New Year.”The British Retail Consortium also appealed to the government to find a solution, but added that there should be no immediate shortages, since “retailers have stocked up on goods ahead of Christmas which should prevent immediate problems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-isolates-uk-as-covid-19-cases-touch-new-high/story-zcejuwRseKj3wRpIYBXnxI.html
21-12-2020||World||Longtime Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Abrahamson dies||Shirley Abrahamson, the longest-serving Wisconsin Supreme Court justice in state history and the first woman to serve on the high court, has died. She was 87.Abrahamson, who also served as chief justice for a record 19 years, died Saturday after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, her son Dan Abrahamson told The Associated Press on Sunday.Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement that Abrahamson had a “larger-than-life impact” on the state’s legal profession and her legacy is defined “not just by being a first, but her life’s work of ensuring she would not be the last, paving and lighting the way for the many women and others who would come after her.”Long recognized as a top legal scholar nationally and a leader among state judges, Abrahamson wrote more than 450 majority opinions and participated in more than 3,500 written decisions during her more than four decades on Wisconsin’s highest court. She retired in 2019 and moved to California to be closer with her family.In 1993, then-President Bill Clinton considered putting her on the US Supreme Court, and she was later profiled in the book, “Great American Judges: An Encyclopedia.”She told the Wisconsin State Journal in 2006 that she enjoyed being on the court.“It has a mix of sitting, reading and writing and thinking, which I enjoy doing. And it’s quiet. On the other hand, all of the problems I work on are real problems of real people, and it matters to them, and it matters to the state of Wisconsin. So that gives an edge to it, and a stress,” she said.The New York City native, with the accent to prove it, graduated first in her class from Indiana University Law School in 1956, three years after her marriage to Seymour Abrahamson. The couple moved to Madison and her husband, a world-renowned geneticist, joined the University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty in 1961. He died in 2016.She earned a law degree from UW-Madison in 1962, then worked as a professor and joined a Madison law firm, hired by the father of future Gov. Jim Doyle.Appointed to the state’s high court by then-Gov. Patrick Lucey in 1976, Abrahamson won reelection four times to 10-year terms, starting in 1979. She broke the record for longest-serving in justice in 2013, her 36th year on the court.Abrahamson was in the majority when the court in 2005 allowed a boy to sue over lead paint injuries even though he could not prove which company made the product that sickened him — undoing decades of precedent and opening paint companies to lawsuits seeking damages.But Abrahamson found herself in the minority on several high-profile cases later in her career, including in 2011, when the court upheld the law championed by Republican then-Gov. Scott Walker effectively ending public employee union rights, and again in 2015, when the court ended a politically charged investigation into Walker and conservative groups.Abrahamson’s health began to fail in 2018, and she frequently missed court hearings. That May, she announced she wouldn’t run again in 2019, and in August, she revealed she has cancer.Doyle, a former Wisconsin attorney general and two-term governor, called Abrahamson a pioneer and said he sought her advice when he first ran for Dane County district attorney in the 1970s. Doyle’s father, who was a federal judge, gave Abrahamson her first job out of law school, Doyle said Sunday.“She was just the warmest, funniest, dearest friend anyone could have,” Doyle said.Doyle has credited Abrahamson with working to demystify the court by holding hearings around the state and meeting with school groups and others to discuss its work.In addition to breaking barriers for women, Doyle has said Abrahamson was a champion of civil rights and civil liberties, a protector of basic constitutional rights, and a strong advocate for open government and public records.Dan Abrahamson, who practices law in California, said his mom kept her work and personal life separate.“She was always there for meals,” he said. “She was always there with me for homework. ... As a mother, all of the energy and all of the attention to deal and all the care she brought to her professional life she brought to her family as well.”Abrahamson wasn’t without her enemies, both on the court and among Republican lawmakers who pushed a constitutional amendment in 2015 that led to her ouster as chief justice. The voter-approved amendment enabled members of the court to choose the chief justice — who oversees the state court system — instead of requiring the title go to the most senior justice.Abrahamson, who became chief in 1996, was quickly voted out by conservative justices who held a majority on the court when the new law took effect in 2015. Justice Patience Roggensack has served as chief justice since then.Although she often clashed with more conservative members of the court, and drew support from liberals and Democrats, Abrahamson steadfastly maintained she was independent.“When I joined the court, I was given a voice — a voice that I have not hesitated to use,” Abrahamson said in May 2018. “The best expression of appreciation I can give the people who have elected and repeatedly reelected me is to continue to speak with the clarity, forthrightness and compassion that come from a life I have tried to devote to service and to justice for all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/longtime-wisconsin-supreme-court-justice-abrahamson-dies/story-mizBijUxqmmkNFgCINhc0O.html
21-12-2020||World||US lawmakers demand response to massive cyberattack||US lawmakers on Sunday called for a “strong response” to a huge cyberattack on government agencies and criticized President Donald Trump’s unwillingness to point the finger at Russia, which has been widely blamed for the hack.The comments -- from Republican as well as Democratic lawmakers -- came after Trump one day earlier downplayed the attack and undercut the assessment by his own administration that Moscow was to blame.“Russia acts with impunity,” Republican Senator Mitt Romney, a frequent Trump critic, told CNN’s “State of the Union,” saying the hack was worthy of a “wartime setting.”Calling it “extraordinarily dangerous” he said it will “have to be met with a very strong response.”Also Read| ‘It may be China’: Trump undercuts Pompeo’s assertion on cyberattackRomney spoke after Trump, in his first public comments on the attack, tweeted Saturday that he had been fully briefed “and everything is well under control.”“Russia Russia Russia is the priority chant when anything happens,” Trump continued, suggesting without offering evidence that China “may” also be involved.Romney said he was “disappointed” with the comment, but that it was expected, saying: “The president has a blind spot when it comes to Russia.”But the president “is not making our country safer” with such comments, warned the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner.Warner, speaking on ABC’s “This Week,” said he agreed with an earlier assessment by Trump’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that “all indications point to Russia” as being behind the attack.It was far from the first time the president has played down apparent threats from Russia, which has denied involvement in the hack.The attackers managed to breach computer networks using enterprise management network software made by the Texas-based IT company SolarWinds.Also Read: Biden’s options for Russian hacking punishment: sanctions, cyber retaliationUS government agencies including the Treasury were among those reportedly hit, but it also hit targets worldwide with the list of victims still emerging, researchers have said.Dramatic details about the extraordinarily wide attack have emerged even as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office next month amid already high tensions with Moscow.“Those who are responsible are going to face consequences for it,” Biden’s incoming chief of staff Ron Klain told CBS’s “Face the Nation,” vowing the Democrat would “take steps as president to degrade the capacity of foreign actors to launch these kinds of attacks on our country.”Warner said there was no indication classified networks were breached in the hack, and downplayed Romney’s wartime comparison.Still, he stressed, to let such an attack go unanswered “would be very bad American policy and, frankly, simply invite Russians or others to continue these kind of malicious activities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-demand-response-to-massive-cyberattack/story-MbYgrGEp9YxTv0vgmShDWO.html
21-12-2020||World||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The UK announced a surprise lockdown on Saturday in London and parts of the country. The decision was forced on the Boris Johnson government by a surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. The UK is now seeing its third wave of infections — or, a second wave which appeared to be waning till it suddenly gathered momentum — with the country recording around 35,000 new infections on December 17, the highest in one day.The UK’s sudden decision can be attributed to the discovery of a new strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes the coronavirus disease, and which, Johnson said while imposing the lockdown, was 70% more infectious than other strains of the virus. It is believed that most of the new cases in the country are driven by this variant, with up to 60% of the cases in London being caused by it.The London lockdown, which upends the Christmas and holiday plans of many of the city’s residents, was announced late Saturday afternoon, but came into effect only at midnight — resulting in a large-scale exodus from the city to the countryside, the kind of scramble avoided at any time, but especially when a viral pandemic is raging through the city and the country. Days before he announced the lockdown, Johnson said that it might be necessary to impose one after Christmas — but clearly, his hand was forced by fears of a mutant strain.Also Read: New variant makes Covid-19 ‘out of control’ in UK, flights bannedIt isn’t just the UK; South Africa announced on Friday that a new strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus has been detected in the country, and that this could be driving the second wave of infections in the country. The country has seen a spike in cases since mid-November, and the seven-day average of new cases is around 70% of the peak seen in the first wave, and rising.There are some interesting similarities between the new strains in the UK and South Africa. Both, health authorities in the two countries claim, appear to be spreading faster. The two strains appear to share a mutation, one that alters the structure of the spike protein of the virus. Health officials in both countries believe this could actually be helping the virus spread faster — after all, the spike protein is how the virus binds to receptors in human cells. In South Africa, scientists studying the variant claim that the new strain results in higher viral loads in patients — based on studies of swab samples.Here’s what we know: both new strains (the South African one would appear to be older and more widespread, based on what the country’s health authorities say) show a significant number of mutations, including a shared one (N501Y is what scientists are calling it) that affects the spike protein. And both strains appear to be more infective.Also Read: Unclear If US has UK Covid-19 mutation, says chief scientific adviser SlaouiViruses mutate, so the fact that Sars-CoV-2 is showing mutations is neither strange nor cause for alarm. But these mutations could have a bearing on its virulence as well as the effectiveness of vaccines and that is definitely something that merits further study.Here’s what we do not know: we do not know for sure if the new strain is more infective; we do not know for sure if the new strain results in higher viral loads in patients (which, in turn, makes it more infective); we do not know for sure if the new strain causes more severe forms of Covid-19 (initial evidence would seem to suggest it doesn’t, but we do not know for sure) and results in more deaths; and we do not know if the vaccines that have so far proved successful against the virus are effective against the new strain as well.That’s a lot of we-do-not-know-for-sures , but that is exactly the way science works. It will be interesting to see if the current strain(s) of Sars-CoV-2 being detected in India show any of the mutations seen in the new strain in the UK and South Africa, especially the N501Y one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-wJ26oKDKvCJzZ8vBMkgF0I.html
21-12-2020||World||3 rockets target US Embassy in Baghdad: Report||At least three rockets targeted the US Embassy in Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone on Sunday, Iraqi security officials said, sparking fears of renewed unrest as next month’s anniversary of the slaying of an Iranian general draws near.The embassy’s C-RAM defense system was used to destroy the rockets mid-air, three Iraqi security officials said, with damage caused to property and parked cars. It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.The C-RAM system was installed by the US over the summer as armed groups stepped up rocket attacks targeting the embassy and its premises.The US withdrew some staff from its embassy in Baghdad earlier this month, temporarily reducing personnel ahead of the first anniversary of the Washington-directed killing of Iranian General Qassim Soleimani outside Baghdad’s airport on Jan. 3. US officials said the decision stemmed from concerns about a possible retaliatory strike.Soleimani’s killing sparked outrage and led Iraq’s parliament to pass a non-binding resolution days later calling for the expulsion of all foreign troops from Iraq.The frequency of rocket attacks have frustrated the Trump administration. Iran-backed militia groups have been blamed for orchestrating the attacks.In September, Washington warned Iraq that it will close its embassy in Baghdad if the government fails to take decisive action to end rocket and other attacks by Iranian-backed militias on American and allied interests in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-rockets-target-us-embassy-in-baghdad-report/story-4t6MoIVCqUSk2OX6N0naPJ.html
21-12-2020||World||Nirav Modi’s brother Nehal charged with diamond fraud in New York||US prosecutors have charged Nehal Modi, the younger brother of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, with defrauding a New York wholesale supplier of diamonds worth $2.6 million. He has been charged with Grand Larceny in the first degree, which is theft of property worth more than $1 million, and it can land him in jail if convicted.The younger Modi is accused of procuring diamonds from LLD Diamonds USA, a wholesale company, between March 2015 and August 2015, for purported sale to Costco, a wholesale grocery retail chain, against deferred payment. He is alleged to have pawned off the diamonds instead, or sold them, and pocketed most of the proceeds for personal use or other businesses.LLD finally reported him to the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, in August.“As alleged, Mr. Modi conned a Manhattan diamond wholesaler into fronting him millions worth of diamonds for a purported deal with Costco that never existed,” Vance said on Friday, announcing the indictment (charges) filed in a New York Supreme Court. “While diamonds may be forever, this flawed scheme was not, and now Mr. Modi will face the clarity of a New York Supreme Court indictment. My office will not allow individuals who have the privilege of soliciting business in Manhattan’s iconic diamond industry to defraud our businesses or consumers.”Vance’s office has jurisdiction over New York City’s prime business area of Manhattan, where elder brother Nirav Modi launched his flagship jewellery boutique store in September 2015 with much fanfare, just the month after his younger brother was reported by LLD to Vance’s office. The elder Modi had then announced plans to open 100 more stores around the world.In February 2018, Indian authorities filed charges against the elder Modi for defrauding banks of millions of dollars and sought his arrest, as part of an expanding investigation. He has since fled to the UK, where he has sought political asylum and is fighting extradition to India.Nehal Modi was released without posting bail on Friday. His attorney Roger Bernstein told New York Post, “This is a commercial dispute” and his client is “not guilty”.According to the indictment announced by district attorney Vance, Nehal Modi first approached LLD in March 2015. His family connections - coming from a “well-known family in the diamond business” - helped, the district attorney’s office said in a statement. He is alleged to have asked the wholesaler for $800,000 worth of diamonds to show to Costco for a potential deal.He got back and is charged with falsely telling LLD that Costco had agreed. LLD allowed Modi to buy the diamonds on credit, to be paid fully within 90 days. “Modi then pawned the diamonds at Modell Collateral Loans, Inc. (‘Modell’) to secure a short-term loan,” the district attorney’s office said.Over April and May, Modi is alleged to have returned to the company three times and picked up diamonds worth more than $1 million for sale to Costco. Modi did make a “series of payments” to LLD, but is alleged to have “used the majority of the proceeds for personal use and other business expenses”.“To cover his fraud, Modi falsely claimed that he was encountering payment issues due to a ‘Costco fulfillment error’ and made repeated promises to satisfy the balance,” said the district attorney’s office.Modi returned to LLD again in August, and asked for more diamonds for sale to Costco. This time, in view of Modi’s spotty payment record, the wholesaler gave him the diamonds with the condition that they could not be sold with their authorisation. Modi was already in touch with Modell then and, the statement said, “after picking up the diamonds from LLD, Modi pawned the majority of the diamonds at Modell to secure two separate loans and sold the remainder of the diamonds to various retailers at a steep discount”.LLD reported the case to the district attorney after failing to get Modi to either return the diamonds or pay the outstanding balance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirav-modi-s-brother-nehal-charged-with-diamond-fraud-in-new-york/story-OB5uoMRyWTYnau5D4eJsgI.html
21-12-2020||India||Human right to compute: CERN scientist to students||Computing is a human right for students and India must ensure internet connectivity in every part of the country, train students in logical thinking and put teachers through a higher level of computer education, said Dr Archana Sharma, principal scientist at the physics department of CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva. She was speaking to the 400 finalists of the first edition of Hindustan Times Code-A-Thon, India’s biggest coding Olympiad. The event provided a virtual platform for students from grade VI through IX to learn coding languages such as HTML, CSS and Python. “Computing is a human right that will be needed for all students of the future. Again, the disparities will increase if there are computer literate and non-computer literate students who are coming up in careers. So, we have to make sure that they are not left behind. First of all, the infrastructure has to be improved; the fibre optics has to get there (to the villages). And, this is not easy. We just about have power everywhere,” she said. There are many organisations in the country working towards ensuring connectivity. She suggested that they need to all work together in tandem with the local governments to reach the goal. “It is extremely important to inculcate the scientific temperament in our children, it is our duty to do that. We have made big strides in the schools in terms of introducing computing and computer resources in schools. But there is a big disparity. Teachers themselves need the pedagogic tools for teaching high-level computing to students in schools. But, teachers are not ready yet,” she said. There are schools where the standards meet international levels and there are schools that struggle to stay connected, she said. Sharma was one of the first Indian scientists to work at the European organisation that looks for answers to the big questions like “where did we come from? How did the universe begin? What is matter? What is anti-matter? And, why at all are we here? Matter and anti-matter must have been created in equal proportions and if yes, then it should have been annihilated and we should not have been here,” she said. It was the large hadron collider at CERN that found evidence of the Higgs Boson, also known as the God Particle, in 2012. Sharma was a part of the team. Sharma explained that while looking for answers to the big questions, the scientists were able to create spin-off technologies that are now in use throughout the world in areas like medical diagnostics and therapy, computing, simulations, and much more. An education in computing will allow students to take up varied STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, including participating in mega-science experiments like the ones ongoing at CERN. These includes projects like the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) that use gravitational waves to study astronomical phenomenon that will have one observatory in India, one of the largest radio-telescope called the 30 meter telescope that will also have an observatory in India, among others. “There is a huge room for us to use these international programmes where India is already participating as training grounds for young scientists to catapult them into the frontline,” said Sharma. However, Sharma said that it was tenacity that was most needed for become a successful scientist. “The perception of job security in India is very important, which is changing very slowly. A permanent job now is not the end-all of everything, we need to look for career opportunities and not just a job. You need to build tenacity in yourself and it doesn’t come overnight. When you are young, you are rearing to go and show results. We must realise that every single day is a challenge and you have problems in front of you. And, if you can focus on delivering your best to what you are doing today, you will gently build up,” she said. The other important point she raised was on how to wake up the sleeping potential of 50% of the population – how to get more women in STEM fields. “In India, it’s not simple. The society must remember that a girl and a boy represent an equal opportunity. We do not see women as able to do something better; people have a stereotype, they do not associate women with excellence. We need to create role models. As for the women, they should take charge and acknowledge that yes I can also do this,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/human-right-to-compute-cern-scientist-to-students/story-dVJEf3rnosPmeXdNNGGslO.html
21-12-2020||India||Recently launched communication satellite CMS-01 placed in final orbit||The communication satellite CMS-01 launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) last Thursday has been placed in its final circular orbit of about 36,000 kilometres after a few orbit raising manoeuvres. CMS-01 is India’s 42nd communication satellite that will replace the functions of GSAT-12 launched in 2011. It will remain in orbit for over seven years providing connectivity for e-learning, tele-health, and disaster management services. The satellite was placed in an elliptical Geostationary Transfer Orbit by India’s workhorse PSLV-C50 on December 20 after 20 minutes 11 seconds of a launch from India’s only spaceport at Sriharikota. This was the second launch of the space agency this year when most of the planned launches were delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Also read: India suspends UK flights till December 31 over new variant of Covid-19Four days after the launch, the onboard liquid apogee motor was fired a few times to increase the orbit to the final geosynchronous one. A geosynchronous orbit matches the Earth’s rotation and is used by satellites for weather monitoring, communications, and surveillance. “After the injection of CMS-01 communication satellite into an elliptical sub-Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit on December 17, 2020, all orbit raising manoeuvers have been completed successfully. The satellite reflector has been deployed. All the intended launch and early phase operations are completed successfully,” said ISRO in a statement.After in-orbit testing, the satellite will be handed over to the users of communication services in the first week of January 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recently-launched-communication-satellite-cms-01-placed-in-final-orbit/story-PQdjJhz0WBrqSnAS03FmSK.html
21-12-2020||India||Moti Lal Vora: Uttar Pradesh governor who made political history||Moti Lal Vora, as the Governor of Uttar Pradesh, dismissed the Mulayam Singh Yadav government and instated BSP leader Mayawati as the first Dalit chief minister on June 3, 1995, following the incidents of the state guest house where Samajwadi Party leaders allegedly made a bid on her life and ‘kidnapped’ her party’s MLAs on June 2, 1995. Vora, a senior Congress leader, passed away at a Delhi hospital due to post-Covid-19 complications on Monday. He was 93. Vora remained UP’s governor from May 26, 1993, to May 3, 1996. Though Vora’s move of June 3, 1995, came in the backdrop of the BSP pulling out of the SP-BSP coalition and building a tacit understanding with the BJP, the decision changed the course of political history not only of Uttar Pradesh but India as well. A political controversy of sorts was created as an elected government was dismissed without being given a chance to prove majority on the floor of the state assembly. The governor’s decision was, however, not challenged despite being against the principles laid down in the SR Bommai case often quoted on issues concerning arbitrary dismissals of state governments by the Centre under Article 356 of the Constitution of India. Governor Vora will be remembered for his governance during President’s rule and later for working as a Congress leader in the state where he served as governor. “Vora’s decision to dismiss the Mulayam Singh Yadav government without a floor test was not challenged anywhere despite being against the principles of SR Bammai case. Vora will be remembered for governance during President’s rule. Uttar Pradesh saw President’s rule twice during his tenure as governor. As governor, he continued to hold ‘Janta Darbar’ that even chief ministers stop holding a month or two after holding office. He also introduced the ‘mahila thanas’ (women police stations) during his term as the state’s governor,” said CB Pandey, who worked with him in Raj Bhawan as legal advisor. The Indira Gandhi Pratisthan is his great contribution as he was the one who approved it when he was governor. “The BSP government, however, decided to do away with the project. I decided to file a public interest litigation and we won,” said Pandey. Vora continued to visit the state and meet people even when he was not the governor.“He contributed a lot for governance and politics. He is revered by all for his work,” said Congress legislature party leader Aradhna Mishra while paying tributes to Vora.Governor Anandiben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and speaker Hridaya Narain Dikshit also paid tributes to Vora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/moti-lal-vora-uttar-pradesh-governor-who-made-political-history/story-0S2Qu4wdhBgKoy7Bahc5FO.html
21-12-2020||India||Karnataka HC stays government order dropping 61 cases against ministers, legislators||In a significant decision, the Karnataka High Court on Monday directed the state government not to take any steps on its move to withdraw cases-- several of them involving ministers and BJP leaders. The BS Yediyurappa led BJP government in the state had decided to withdraw cases registered primarily against several party leaders in an order dated August 31, 2020.These included a case against the CM himself for violating the electoral model code of conduct when in November 2019 he had appealed to the Veerashiva Lingayat community to support only the BJP candidate. A case under Section 123(3) of the People’s Representation Act 1951 and Section 171 (F) of the IPC had been registered against him.Other cases included one against former tourism minister and current BJP National General Secretary C T Ravi as well as Law Minister J C Madhuswamy for alleged various offences under IPC Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting with dangerous weapons) and 339 (wrongful restraint) during a protest.The decision to withdraw the cases was taken by the state cabinet in August after a subcommittee headed by Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai had recommended the same. However, the DG & IGP, the director of prosecution and government litigation as well as the law department itself had recommended against the withdrawal of the cases.But, the cabinet had accepted the recommendation of the sub-committee and had gone ahead with the proposal. The government had then justified the move to withdraw cases saying, that only cases related to protests in the public interest are being withdrawn and not personal cases. The state government had also pointed out that the previous Congress government too when it was in power had similarly exercised powers.This decision of the cabinet though was challenged by the People’s Union for Civil Liberties and a city-based advocate activist Sudha Katwa who had filed PIL’s. A division bench of the High Court headed by the Chief Justice Abhay Oka which heard the petition granted interim relief to the petitioners and ruled that the cases should not be withdrawn. “We direct that no further steps will be taken on the basis of the order dated August 31, 2020.”In a previous hearing, the bench had asked the state government to submit a compliance report for which the state had sought time. The court has directed the government to file its objection to the latest order by 22 January.While the state government was yet to officially react to the HC’s order, a senior administration official in the state who did not want to be identified - as he is not authorised to speak to media – said, “We are yet to get a copy of the full order. We will examine the same and then we will decide on our next course of action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-hc-stays-government-order-dropping-61-cases-against-ministers-legislators/story-oqhk7lEhrQTmtKtcuO04WI.html
21-12-2020||India||Banned Naxal outfit leader Jidan Guriya killed in encounter in Jharkhand||A prominent area commander of banned Naxal outfit People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI), Jidan Guriya, carrying a cash reward of Rs 15 lakh on his head, was gunned down by district police and a CRPF Batallion-94 in an early morning encounter at Koengsar village under Murhu police station (PS) in Khunti district on Monday morning, police said. “PLFI top commander Jidan Guriya was killed in an encounter at Koengsar village under Murhu PS in Khunti district with district police and CRPF Batallin-94 around 9.30 am this morning. An AK-47 automatic assault rifle has been recovered from near his body. The operation is still on and further details are awaited,” Ashutosh Shekhar, Khunti superintendent of police (SP), said, confirming the major blow to PLFI.The encounter happened after the joint team of police and CRPF had gone on a search operation on a tip-off that PLFI supremo Dinesh Gope, carrying a cash reward of Rs 25 lakh, and another top PLFI ultra Martin Kerketta were moving in the jungles around Koengsar village on the Khunti-West Singhbhum district borders, police officials said. The ultras opened fire seeing the advancing forces and Jidan died in the retaliatory fire while the other extremists managed to escape into the dense forests.This was the fourth time that PLFI supremo Dinesh Gope managed to give police the slip during the past 30 days or so. Dinesh, Jidan and Martin had managed to escape during another encounter four days ago when West Singhbhum police and CRPF Batallions 60 and 94 had succeeded in killing PLFI extremist Sonu Kumar from Nalanda district of Bihar and arrested Phoolchand Munda from Lapung in Ranchi district in the Bandu jungles in Porahat forest range in West Singhbhum district on Thursday night.According to West Singhbhum SP Ajay Linda, three pistols, seven magazines, 49 live cartridges, four motorcycles, 27 mobile phones, 5 walkie-talkies, bags, blankets and daily usage materials have been seized from the Bandu encounter site.Earlier, district police and CRPF had two more encounters with PLFI squads led by Dinesh Gope and Jeedan Guriya under Bandgon and Sonua PS during the last 30 days. “Dinesh Gope, Jeedan Guriya and Martin Kerketta have been moving together in Bandu jungle and other jungles in Porahat range. At least, 15-25 ultras were there in the squad when police had the encounter with them yesterday,” police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banned-naxal-outfit-leader-jidan-guriya-killed-in-encounter-in-jharkhand/story-MuYvDMSyoHB91H0FigRTBM.html

21-12-2020||India||Here are the quarantine rules for people travelling to Maharashtra from abroad||The authorities in Maharashtra decided to impose mandatory quarantine rules for people travelling to India from abroad after a new coronavirus strain was found in Britain. The government also decided to impose a seven-hour night curfew in cities across Maharashtra from Tuesday for the next 15 days as a precautionary measure. The decision was taken in a high-level meeting called by the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday. Thackeray said the government and people had to be vigilant for the next 15 days.The new strain of the coronavirus discovered in the UK has forced British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce another lockdown despite plans to ease restrictions during the Christmas period. The new strain can reportedly be transmitted from one person to another much faster than the previous one and it might even compromise vaccines if they are not effective against it.Here is what you need to know about the quarantine guidelines:- All passengers coming from the UK are asked to compulsorily quarantine after their arrival in the country. Symptomatic passengers from UK will be sent to Seven Hills hospital at Andheri for further investigation and checkup.- The rest of the passengers will be sent to institutional quarantine for five to seven days.- All passengers coming from other European countries and Middle Eastern countries will be required to spend seven days in an institutional quarantine facility. The symptomatic ones will be sent to GT hospital.- Passengers travelling from the rest of the countries like Southeast Asia region or the United States will not be sent to institutional quarantine. - However, these passengers will now be stamped on their hands to be home quarantined by the airport authorities as a precautionary measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/here-are-the-quarantine-rules-for-people-travelling-to-maharashtra-from-abroad/story-suOMO6K6HuHDaIDVj4xtkK.html

The Tamil Nadu government on Monday released a statement banning gatherings at beaches, resorts, hotels, pubs as well as roads to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Hotels can function and remain open but cannot host events and celebrations. Entry to beaches will be closed on New Year’s Eve and the following day, the statement said. These are places where a large number of people usually gather to ring in the New Year and are seen cutting cakes on beaches in coastal districts including Chennai. As of December 21, the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in Tamil Nadu reached 8,07,962 and has claimed 11,995 lives. As many as 7,86,472 people have recovered and been discharged. The state is conducting testing in the range of 65,000-75,000 every day using RT-PCR kits.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot too asked people to celebrate the New Year with their families inside their houses, just like the festival of Diwali, to prevent the infection of Covid-19 from spreading. He said that the Supreme Court has recently issued guidelines asking states to take stricter measures such as stopping crowds at markets and public places, not allowing religious-social events as much as possible. Gehlot said that in view of New Year, during the next few weeks there will be a complete ban on crowd gathering, mass events and fireworks across the state. The night curfew will continue and police patrolling and action will be more stringent. According to a government statement, secretary medical and health, Siddharth Mahajan, said at a meeting that the number of positive cases is continuously decreasing in the state. The recovery rate of Covid-19 infected people in Rajasthan is around 95% and the death rate is only 0.88%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-rajasthan-restrict-new-year-celebrations-amid-covid-19/story-qFodjWNJbL9Whc2TYzkndP.html
21-12-2020||India||CBI to finish majority of its corruption probes in nine months||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has decided to complete the majority of its probes under Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act within a maximum of nine months, according to the latest Crime Manual of the agency, updated after 15 years. The existing one year deadline in corruption cases will apply only in those cases where a high ranking government official like a Joint Secretary or Secretary is accused and the probe is being supervised by an additional director or above rank officer in the CBI, people familiar with the development said. For the cases against lower rung government officers, like clerks or section officers etc, CBI’s investigating officers (IOs) will have to complete probes within six months. CBI’s latest Crime Manual, which has been prepared by a task force led by Additional Director Praveen Sinha after consulting legal experts, retired officers of the agency and other experts , has for the first time given a provision to form “investigation teams” in complex cases rather than depending on one Investigating Officer (IO). The manual, which is referred to by the CBI officers while initiating a preliminary enquiry (PE) or First Information Report (FIR) and conducting investigation, had become outdated as courts had struck down several criminal laws and there have been amendment in various laws as well. The Prevention of Corruption Act, the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) have also been since amended, and Supreme Court has passed several judgements, which have now been updated in the new manual for the benefit of IOs, said the officer. The manual also gives special thrust on investigations abroad. Officials cited above said a special chapter has been dedicated in the manual explaining how to conduct investigations abroad as well as procedures and functioning of Interpol. “We have comprehensively revised our SOPs (standard operating procedures) so as to enhance the speed and quality of investigation and in consonance with global best practices,” said an officer who didn’t want to be named. The new manual will explain to the IOs the procedure to collect the digital evidence as a large number of cases related to child pornography, phishing, and bitcoins etc having international ramifications are being reported. It also has information about preventive vigilance functioning of CBI so that field units can use the same, officers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-to-finish-majority-of-its-corruption-probes-in-nine-months/story-qhmjgzg0vi1pS6YK5unUkK.html

A total of 2,178 candidates were in the fray for 280 DDC seats in these elections.Also Read | Polling underway for last phase of DDC polls in Jammu and KashmirThe DDC polls were the first electoral exercise in the region post the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5 last year, which led to the scrapping of the special status of the then unified state of Jammu and Kashmir. The state was further divided into two separate Union territories (UTs) of Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh. Several political leaders of the Valley, including three former chief ministers-Farooq and Omar Abdullah, and Mehbooba Mufti-were put under house arrest to prevent law and order situation from spiralling out of control. While the Abdullahs were released in March this year, Mufti was freed only in October.The polls were contested primarily between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), an umbrella of six political parties-including the Abdullahs’ National Conference (NC) and Mufti’s Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP)-whose one common agenda is restoration of Article 370.During campaigning, allegations were levelled by the PAGD leaders that while the BJP candidates could campaign freely, their candidates were being “restrained” from doing so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ddc-election-results-on-tuesday-counting-to-begin-at-9-am-says-election-commissioner/story-qjvFRWn4yODqXK3uBv867M.html

21-12-2020||India||Ahead of first phase of panchayat polls, BJP and JD(S) deny plans of merger again||Even as political parties geared up for the first phase of voting on Tuesday for 3019 Gram Panchayats (GP) across 117 taluks to elect 48,048 members, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the regional Janata Dal (Secular) again reiterated that there were no plans to merge. GP polls are being held in two phases with voting on December 22 and 27 with results being declared on the 30th of this month.While GP polls are held on a party less basis, Capt Ganesh Karnik, spokesperson for BJP Karnataka said that his party was confident of winning 80% of the seats on offer. This even as he dismissed continued speculation that JD(S) was merging into the saffron party saying “the (merger) news is baseless, malicious and misleading with a sinister design. We reject the false news with the contempt it deserves”.The speculation had started ever since several senior leaders of JD(S) including its sitting legislators and council members had said that the party was exploring going along with the ruling BJP. The JD(S) had also crucially helped the government pass some important farm bills apart from joining hands with the saffron party to oust the Council Chairman who belongs to Congress.Former CM and JD(S) supremo HD Kumaraswamy had on Sunday said that his party was only extending issue-based support and it was “not stupid to commit suicide by merging with BJP”. On Monday too, Kumaraswamy reiterated the stance and said any contrary views expressed by party leaders were their personal opinion and does not reflect the views of the party. He expressed confidence of the JD(S) doing well in the ongoing GP polls.The EC has made elaborate administrative and security arrangements including reserving an hour in the evening for those affected with Covid-19 to vote with all precautions being taken. Congress backed candidates had won the bulk of the GP’s in the poll held in 2015 and the party too has expressed confidence of doing a repeat performance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-first-phase-of-panchayat-polls-bjp-and-jd-s-deny-plans-of-merger-again/story-i3rjenjf87FGZLiQVJbqnJ.html
21-12-2020||India||To release a film is tougher than making one, says Vipul K Rawal||Writer-director Vipul K Rawal’s next script for a film will be set in Lucknow. The man, behind the hit scripts of ‘Rustom’ and ‘Iqbal’, is writing an original story of a boy from the state capital. “I was here to meet the boy and research about the story that I am writing. The film will go on the floor in mid-2021. Since I am bound by a contract, I can’t divulge more details about the story,” says the original story creator of ‘Batti Gul Meter Chalu’. Rawal, who ventured into direction with ‘Tony’, a thriller movie, says, “Initially I tried to release Tony in theatres but no one was ready to support this small-budget film. I managed to release it in some screens, but when I tried to launch it on OTT platform; I faced stiff resistance from the syndicate that was not ready to pay a film with newcomers. Then I realised that to release a film is tougher than making one!” He released it on YouTube and has now over 2 million views. “I released the film with a message that audience should first watch our film and if they like our effort they can pay us whatever donation they can. Trust me; we are on a path of recovery and still receiving donations from all over the country,” he says. Elated with the response, Rawal is now working on his next as director with fresh talents on the same model. Rawal, who spent his childhood in Balawali village of Bijnor district says, “My father was a manager of a glass factory and our house was on banks of the Ganga. I remember the train did not stopped there so the hawker used to throw the newspaper from the moving train and my duty was to collect it. Before I went to boarding school in Dehradun, my studies happened at home itself. Even for basic needs, we used to go to Najibabad. After many years, I went there to relive my childhood memories.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/to-release-a-film-is-tougher-than-making-one-says-vipul-k-rawal/story-EU5eLwQRjBcQ5MxwbJyWvM.html
21-12-2020||India||The spectrum is widening now, says Gopal Datt||‘Tera Naam’ and ‘Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hai’ fame actor Gopal Datt has done a lot of memorable comic roles so far, and it took him nearly two decades to come of that genre. The felicitous change happened with the Emmy Award-winning OTT series ‘Delhi Crime’ where he played the role of a cop. Currently shooting in Lucknow, the actor said, “Unfortunately, there is a ‘bhed-chaal’ (herd mentality) in the industry that you get roles only in the genre that give you popularity. You are not offered work of your choice. ‘Delhi Crime’ changed that perception. Working with Richie Mehta (director), it has been one of my finest works and experiences so far.”He had been doing varied roles in the theatre but he was not getting that opportunity in films and TV. “That is why theatre is considered a lab where we can experiment. Earlier, the roles I was getting were on similar lines as everyone wants to play safe. To run your house and deposit EMI’s we need to work so cannot deny work and roles in the long run. As an actor, you do not have many options and have to choose from what you are offered,” Gopal said.The actor is now in a happy space. “Thankfully, like theatre, on OTT too, people have started experimenting, which is benefitting actors like us who were seen in a particular image. I am making an extra effort to explore different genres, and I am getting interesting roles too. Now, the spectrum is widening!”His versatile act in ‘A Simple Murder’ was hugely appreciated, describing which he said, “I will give credit to my director Sachin Pathak’s vision. There is a very thin line when comedy can do wrong, especially when you are playing a cop. I am glad that it all came out well, and the audience appreciated it. In this (current) series, Sachin has carved another interesting role for me.” His next work is set in his hometown Nainital. On coming to Lucknow once again, he said, “I have been regular to the city for work. I did a cameo here in ‘Jabaria Jodi’. Besides, I have done a couple of stage performances, including Repertwahr Festival and attended Sanatkada Festival twice. Since I have landed here, my diet has gone for a toss, and I am just relishing tasty Awadhi cuisines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/the-spectrum-is-widening-now-says-gopal-datt/story-gIeWBlKXRfIIhSqiWM8erO.html

21-12-2020||India||BJP says Palaniswami is NDA’s CM candidate for poll-bound Tamil Nadu||After weeks of uncertainty, the dust seems to have settled over the chief ministerial (CM) candidate issue between alliance partners Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in Tamil Nadu. Responding to reporters on Monday, BJP state president L Murugan said ‘no more questions’ on this issue adding that the National Democratic Alliance will continue.The matter had escalated a day ago and Murguan clarified on Sunday night that, “Annan (brother in Tamil) Palaniswami is the chief minister of NDA in Tamil Nadu”.He, however, reiterated his earlier statements that it was for his party’s national leadership to make a formal announcement. “We have never said that we did not accept AIADMK’s decision,” Murugan told reporters in Thanjavur. BJP national president JP Nadda was expected to review the poll situation in Tamil Nadu at the end of the month and was likely to make official announcements but he had tested Covid-19 positive last week. “His visit has been postponed to mid-January,” a BJP functionary said.Backing him, former police officer turned BJP state vice-president, K Annamalai, told reporters in Coimbatore that as a national party it is the parliamentary committee that would make decisions. Annamalai who had criticised parties bribing voters with Rs 2,000 also clarified that media reports misinterpreted his comment as an attack on Palaniswami who issued a Pongal festival dole of Rs 2,500 to ration card holders.The AIADMK had in October announced chief minister and co-coordinator of the party Edappadi Palaniswami as its chief ministerial candidate for the upcoming 2021 polls. Palaniswami kicked off his party’s campaign on Saturday and a few hours later Murugan had told reporters that the national leadership will decide on the CM candidate and the leader of the alliance.This irked AIADMK leaders had rallied behind Palaniswami saying that only those who accepted his leadership can remain in the alliance. Party spokesperson Pugalendhi told reporters on Sunday that if such remarks continue, the BJP would have to replace Murugan.Palaniswami and deputy chief minister and party coordinator O Paneerselvam had announced that the AIADMK-BJP alliance will continue in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah. Since then there has been unease in the AIADMK camp as the BJP had previously not acknowledged Palaniswami as the chief ministerial candidate nor made any formal announcement on the alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-says-palaniswami-is-nda-s-cm-candidate-for-poll-bound-tamil-nadu/story-MQ93AlfSWmnbns2is3cXCL.html

The new restaurant has also been named ‘Baba ka Dhaba’.  “We have opened a restaurant today which is near my small eatery. We will serve Indian and Chinese cuisines and have hired two chefs for the same. I will keep running my old eatery also,” Prasad said.

They have hired two chefs and the rest of their family members are helping in the restaurant,” Adlakha said. Prasad had shot to fame after a video of him tearfully talking about the financial distress he faced in the months since the lockdown was shot by a man and shared widely across social media platforms.Nearly a month after his video went viral, Prasad had filed a complaint against the YouTuber for alleged misappropriation of funds. In his complaint to police, Prasad had alleged that the man who shot and published the video “intentionally and deliberately shared only his and his family/friends bank details and mobile numbers with the donors and collected huge amount of donation... without providing any information to the complainant”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/owner-of-popular-eatery-baba-ka-dhaba-opens-new-restaurant-in-delhi/story-IapoVaEvbGHMY0XJjJD9cM.html

India, it said, has one of the largest vaccine manufacturing capacities in the world (including the largest vaccine producer – Serum Institute India, SII) and has secured authorisation to mass-produce the AstraZeneca, Novavax and Gamaleya Research Institute vaccines. With a population of 130 crore (and 9.4 crore over 65-year-olds), the domestic vaccination drive will be the largest in the world. “The country has a good track record of such drives with masses of the population regularly gaining inoculation for various diseases such as polio and cholera,” it said. India’s vaccine rollout will begin in first quarter of 2021 (January to March), with frontline healthcare workers and individuals over the age of 50 years gaining priority. Fitch said the government aims to vaccinate some 25 crore people over six-to-eight months, which is “a lofty goal”. “However, if India can quickly ramp up vaccinations to roughly the same level as the 1 million (10 lakh) Covid-19 tests it conducts each day, then we expect coverage across priority groups can be achieved by June 2021,” it said. Risks to this outlook include the sheer scale of the project and with relatively weak institutions and healthcare infrastructure, these challenges could result in a slower rollout than expected, it added. Access to Covid-19 vaccines is set to vary significantly across Asia depending on the advance purchase agreements a given country has reached with vaccine developers. Developed markets have generally purchased access to vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, smaller countries with strong healthcare systems will have an advantage in rolling out vaccines. “Vaccine access for emerging markets is likely to be more varied with a larger role for supply from China and Russia and their state-developed vaccine candidates. We note that some markets have already begun mass vaccinations with limited Phase III trial data available,” Fitch said. It said multiple Covid-19 vaccines are expected by the end of first quarter of 2021. The first Covid-19 vaccine approval (based on Phase III data) was announced on December 2, 2020 by the UK’s medicine regulator MHRA. “We expect further approvals from various national regulators and for different vaccines over late 2020 and throughout 2021 as candidates reach clinical endpoints,” it said adding many of the vaccines use the same approach of targeting the spike protein of the virus structure - an approach that has shown to be successful so far. The initial distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, it said, is likely to be skewed towards wealthier nations in line with advance purchase agreements (APAs). “We believe this is largely due to the ability to pay and the commercially focussed approach adopted by the vaccine developers which will be the first to gain approval,” it said. “This theme also applies to Asia where some countries have secured access to vaccines while others have not.” For countries with confirmed supply, vaccinations are set to begin with priority populations made up of frontline healthcare workers, populations over 65 years of age, and those with underlying health conditions. Epidemiological data show that these groups (along with 50-65-year-olds) make up around 99 per cent of the preventable mortality from Covid-19 and a large proportion of hospitalisations. “We expect that, as these populations gradually reach protection, governments eager to return to economic normality will look to begin easing restrictions,” Fitch said. “Different countries will enact this easing at different paces depending on the progress of vaccine rollout.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-can-inoculate-priority-groups-against-covid-by-june-2021-fitch-solutions/story-ksBZS7IzJoDMa6uw4eugkI.html

Participating in a virtual summit with his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Vietnam as “an important pillar of India’s Act East policy and an important ally of our Indo-Pacific vision”. “We see our relationship with Vietnam from a long-term and strategic view. Peace, stability and prosperity are our common objectives in the Indo-Pacific region. Our partnership can contribute significantly to maintain stability and peace in the region,” Modi said. Nyugen Xuan Phuc said the upgrading of bilateral ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2016 had bolstered trust and bolstered understanding of other’s vision and interests on international issues. He said the Vietnamese side had aso agreed on India’s proposals for a further defence line of credit. Modi said the seven agreements signed by the two countries cover diverse issues such as defence, nuclear power, petrochemicals, renewable energy and treatment of cancer. “We are also taking new initiatives in the area of ​​our development cooperation and cultural conservation. All this shows the expansion and potential of our growing mutual cooperation,” he added. The meeting was held at a time when both countries are grappling with China’s aggressive actions in the region. India is locked in a military standoff with China in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) while Vietnam has major differences over Chinese claims within its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. The two leaders released a joint vision document and a plan of action for bilateral engagements during 2021-23. “This joint vision for peace, prosperity and people will send a strong message to the world about the depth of our relationship,” Modi said. India’s is currently implementing a $100-million defence line of credit for 12 high speed patrol boats for Vietnam. The boats being built for the Vietnam Border Guard are meant to enhance coastal security and prevent illegal activities. Five vessels are being built at Larsen & Toubro’s shipyard in Chennai, and the rest will be made at Hong Ha shipyard in the Vietnamese port city of Hai Phong under the Indian firm’s supervision. Both countries also have stakes in the Indo-Pacific region and significant maritime interests, and the summit enabled them to look at potential cooperation on India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and Asean’s Indo-Pacific outlook. India and Vietnam will also concurrently serve as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council from 2021, and this has opened up new opportunities for cooperation and coordination on regional and international issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-vietnam-sign-seven-agreements-during-virtual-summit/story-O9TBrm7JWzAyxK4pwGz7fP.html
21-12-2020||India||Uttarakhand seeks approval for riverbed mining in forest area||The Uttarakhand Forest Development Corporation ( UFDC) has sought clearance of forest area measuring 628.8 hectare (ha) for the renewal of sand and boulder mining in the state’s Song and Jakhan rivers in Dehradun district.In 2009, the union environment ministry had granted forest clearance to UFDC to mine over 1,325 ha of forest land in Dehradun district for ten years, which includes the area being proposed for mining again. According to UFDC’s proposal on the environment ministry’s Parivesh website, during monsoon, riverbed material got collected in the rivers which led to flooding. By extracting this material from the riverbed, flooding can be prevented.Also Read: Elephant dies after getting electrocuted in UttarakhandEnvironmental experts, however, said without a replenishment and carrying capacity study, continuous mining for decades could lead to erosion, degradation of ecology, change in river course, etc. “There is no replenishment study for these rivers where mining has been going on for decades. There is no district survey or mining plan either. The Uttarakhand government keeps saying that mining should be done to remove excess riverbed material and to prevent flooding but where is the study showing that mining can prevent flooding? It’s particularly worrying because this is forest land and there is very little monitoring of whether mining is carried out only in the area approved for mining and at the depth mentioned,” said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, a Delhi-based advocacy organisation.The environment ministry’s Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) and National Board for Wildlife had earlier sought cumulative impact assessment studies of impact on Uttarakhand’s rivers. “The state government shall conduct a study to ascertain the impact of mining upstream and downstream. The study shall come out with clear recommendations as to how such mining is useful in maintaining the natural flow of the river and health of adjoining forests. It should cover the impact of mining in the area for the last ten years. The study may correlate satellite imagery of the last ten years,” FAC had observed in April. It had added the government should also quantify how much sand and boulder can be mined annually.Uttarakhand’s application will be considered by the Forest Advisory Committee on Tuesday. The FAC will also consider the Ujh Multipurpose Hydel project in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kathua district, involving submergence of 680 ha of forest land and 3,669.9 ha of non-forest land. According to Jammu and Kashmir State Power Development Corporation, the project has been planned to utilise the water resource potential of Ujh, a tributary of Ravi. The project has been declared a national project as it allows India to utilise its share of the Indus River system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-seeks-approval-for-riverbed-mining-in-forest-area/story-ZbBylxD9MpXaATZqS6GmnI.html

If relevant decisions to start works related to Ka-226 helicopters and AK-203 rifles production are expedited, soon we will see good progress, which is especially important due to a deep interests expressed by the Indian armed forces.”On the interregional cooperation involving the vast potential of the Far East and the Arctic, he said that it is a “solid background to launch the bilateral forum of the regions of the two countries”. “Together we work to extend the use of national currencies in trade, to ensure an early conclusion of the India - Eurasian Economic Union FTA and reach USD 30 billion in mutual trade by 2025. Such areas as alternative payment systems and information security would certainly support expanding economic partnership.

21-12-2020||India||Russia committed to develop ties with Pakistan, India shouldn’t have any concerns||Russia on Monday said it is committed to developing its relationship with Pakistan, though India should have no concern about such moves as they are within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and aimed at ensuring regional stability. Moscow’s efforts to develop relations with Islamabad fit in with the basic values of the strategic partnership between India and Russia, Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev told a news briefing. His deputy, Roman Babushkin, said Russia’s ties with Pakistan are “independent in nature” and the two sides have a trade and economic agenda. “If you take a look at the substance of our ties with Pakistan and the priorities we are committed to, you could easily see they would correspond to the basic values of Russia and India, especially the privileged and strategic partnership – issues like regional stability, transparency, fighting terror, drugs and crime first and foremost,” Kudashev said in response to a question on a perceived uptick in ties between Moscow and Islamabad. Also Read: Russia understands India’s vision of Indo-Pacific, has concerns about Quad: Russian diplomatsEconomic cooperation between Russia and Pakistan, Kudashev said, is a key to progress and predictability. “Our ties with Pakistan are naturally no exception to the values of our ties with India,” he added. Babushkin said India should not be worried about Russia’s commitment to respect the sensitivities of any other country. “Russia is very cautious when it comes to respect of sensitivities but at the same time we regard our relations with Pakistan are independent in nature and we also have a bilateral trade and economic agenda. We are quite committed to developing this relationship further, including from the point of view of Pakistan being a partner country in the framework of the SCO,” he said. “The basic principle of Russian foreign policy is to have bilateral relations not aimed against any other country. This is the very important principle we are following when it comes to cooperation with every country in the world, including Pakistan,” he added. Babushkin said a recent exercise between the Russian and Pakistani armies focused on counter-terrorism. “Such kind of collaboration, including experience sharing and capacity-building, is quite natural for all SCO member states. We have reached an advanced level of exercises with India including the three services...All of that is important from the point of view of how we proceed to ensure regional stability. Promoting dialogue and a unified agenda are also instrumental for the same reasons,” he said. India has in the past expressed concerns about possible arms deals between Russia, the supplier of a majority of weapon systems used by Indian armed forces, and Pakistan. In response to an another question, Babushkin said Russia and India closely consult each other on the situation in Afghanistan. The current negotiations between the Taliban and the US are being done on the basis of agreements between the two sides. Russia wants these negotiations to be successful and lead to a “forward-looking solution in Afghanistan” so that the war-torn country can have a “maximum possible representative government” takes care of the interests of all national and ethnic groups, Babushkin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-committed-to-develop-ties-with-pakistan-india-shouldn-t-have-any-concerns-russian-diplomat/story-LMJKupW1yAHzGGoV6bhllO.html

No fresh case has been reported in the last 24 hours,” said district medical officer V Jayashree adding the alert will continue in the district for some more time. She said most of the suspected cases have been discharged and now only two children are in the hospital. Health experts said contaminated water sources triggered the infection and a clear picture will emerge by next week after several rounds of lab tests. At least 54 people with mild symptoms were identified during a medical camp on Saturday. The department of community medicine at Kozhikode medical college hospital has also started an inquiry.Medical experts said the shigella bacteria triggers an infection called shigellosis and it can cause serious trouble to patients suffering from co-morbid conditions. Usually diarrhoea, often containing blood or mucus in stool, stomach pain, cramps, fever and vomiting are the main symptoms of shigellosis. An infected person shows minor symptoms in a day to two but it may take a week or so to show acute symptoms. Children below 10 years are prone to contract the infection, though elderly can also get infected, experts said adding patients with underlying medical conditions may require heavy dose of antibiotics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shigella-bacterial-infection-contained-in-kozhikode-says-kerala-health-department/story-E6gbfHuqlcsAaZI6afyEWL.html

Modi had released the first tranche in 2019 and will do so again at a time when thousands of farmers, largely from Punjab, are protesting three agricultural laws they say will hurt their livelihoods. The government says the reforms will give farmers more market access and boost investment in the farm sector. “It will be a freewheeling conversation. The Prime Minister is likely to talk about the new farm laws and how they will benefit farmers,” an official said, requesting anonymity. Under PM-Kisan, the government provides income support of Rs6,000 a year to farmers with valid enrolment, paid in three equal cash transfers of Rs2,000, once every four months. It was launched on February 24 2019, when the first instalment was paid. Also Read: Maharashtra farmers to start their vehicle march to Delhi from Nashik todayThe Prime Minister will most likely ask them impromptu questions on how they have benefited from the scheme and “take a briefing from them on what they are growing and what else they want to see done for them ahead of the budget”, the official said. Farmers from all over the country will be connected online for the interaction, according to the official. The Prime Minister also intends to receive feedback on the ground realities of farming, he said. The Modi government has ramped up its outreach to stanch a massive ongoing agitation by thousands of farmers who have encircled Delhi, calling for scrapping a set of farm reform laws. PM Modi has frequently been explaining the benefits of the farm reforms and assuring farmers that the existing government support mechanism, including minimum support price and agriculture mandis, will continue. “Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has expressed his feelings by writing a letter to the farmer brothers and sisters, attempting to have a polite dialogue. I request all the farmers to read it,” PM Modi had tweeted on Thursday.

A journalist by profession, he worked with Navbharat Times as its correspondent in Bombay (now Mumbai), then served with Navbharat in Nagpur and Raipur and later with Nagpur Times in Nagpur. Having held one of the most important organisational post of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) treasurer for nearly two decades, Vora was appointed as the general secretary in charge of administration in 2018. Watch l Motilal Vora passes away at 93; President, PM Modi & others pay tribute This is when another senior leader Ahmed Patel took over as the AICC treasurer and held the post till his death on November 25 this year. He died of post-Covid complications in a Gurugram hospital. In a party reshuffle carried out by Congress president Sonia Gandhi in September this year, Vora was not given any party responsibility in view of his advancing age. A former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh and a former governor of Uttar Pradesh, Vora, a Gandhi family loyalist, was known for his relations across political spectrum. He would often recall his “bumpy” car journey that led to greater familiarity with former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee while on a tour from Lucknow to a remote village in the state during his term as the Uttar Pradesh governor from 1993-1996. Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati made it a point to greet the veteran Congress leader whenever she saw him in the Rajya Sabha. It was Vora who had recommended removal of Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav from the chief minister’s post on June 3, 1995, a day after the infamous “Guest House” episode. Armed SP leaders and workers tried to assault Mayawati who locked herself in a room in a bid to escape the attack. On the same day, Mayawati took oath as the chief minister with the outside support of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Janata Dal. A two-term Madhya Pradesh chief minister – first from 1985 to 1988 and later in 1989, Vora also served as the union health minister in the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s cabinet in 1988-89. He retired as a Rajya Sabha member from Chhattisgarh in April this year. During his four terms in the Rajya Sabha, Vora was appreciated for his attendance and participation. Congress leaders would often quote Vora’s tips for discretion which made him ideal for the AICC treasurer’s post. “No one should be able to find any piece of paper in your office when you leave for the day,” he once told a young Congress functionary. As AICC treasurer, Vora apart from managing the finances of the grand old party would also decide on allocating the rooms at the party headquarters at Delhi’s 24, Akbar Road. It was well-known in party circles that Vora kept a strict vigil on the party functionaries at the Congress office. Political leaders cutting across party lines condoled his death., Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was saddened by his death and remembered him as a leader with vast administrative and organisational experience. “Shri Motilal Vora Ji was among the senior-most Congress leaders, who had vast administrative and organisational experience in a political career that spanned decades. Saddened by his demise. Condolences to his family and well-wishers. Om Shanti,” he tweeted. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said he was a true congressman and a wonderful human being. “Vora ji was a true congressman and a wonderful human being. We will miss him very much. My love & condolences to his family and friends,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/veteran-congress-leader-motilal-vora-passes-away/story-dbu1jnSqVz5kbkpehlolWM.html

Further, on medical scrutiny, only 277 were declared fit causing more heartburn for the women officers who fought a long-drawn legal battle for 15 years till the Supreme Court on February 17, 2020 directed the Army to treat women SSC officers at par with their male counterparts for getting permanent commission (PC) and command roles in Army’s non-combat streams.Also Read: Military Literature Festival: ‘Armed forces are true reflection of unity in diversity’Close to 60 women SSC officers had approached the Supreme Court against the criteria adopted by the Selection Board in arriving at its decision. The officers demanded stay on any action to be taken by Army pursuant to the decision of the SB-5. Moving an application on their behalf, advocate Archana Pathak Dave said, “The non-grant of PC is on the ground that they are not falling in ‘merit’. The term merit is not defined and the parameters assessing/yardstick applicable on such merit are vague and unknown in absence of a policy for granting PC to women officers.”On December 18, the bench of justices DY Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee took up their application and asked the Army and Ministry of Defence whether any action was intended before it takes up the matter in January. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain said, “We are not going to precipitate the matter.” Jain informed the court that the process of relieving a SSC officer takes two or three months and nothing will happen in the meantime. On this understanding, the bench posted the matter for hearing on January 18.While the order of the court has come as a temporary relief for the aggrieved women SSC officers, they must prepare for a long legal battle as the Army is adamant that no review of the SB-5 decision or relaxation in medical criteria for women SSC officers not found to be in top shape (SHAPE-1 category) is possible. The Army filed an affidavit in Supreme Court on December 14 stating that medical criterion of an Army officer is an “intrinsic and inseparable” part of the process for grant of PC.“The medical standards in the Army are a direct derivative of the job requirements of an Army personnel. To accept any dilution of these standards amounts to accepting a lowering of the operational capabilities of the Army, which may lead to catastrophic results for the security and sovereignty of the nation,” stated the affidavit dated December 14 filed by Colonel Sachidananda Prabhu working as Colonel Military Secretary (Legal) at Army Headquarters.The affidavit has further stated that the February 2020 decision of the apex court required the Army to treat women SSC officers at par with male SSC officers. “Same criteria of medical fitness as applicable to all male officers is being applied to women officers. Petitioners on one hand seek to be treated at par with male counterparts. However, on the other hand, seek special and unjustified treatment in the eligibility conditions.”Among the 422 found eligible by the selection board, 57 officers opted out of PC, leaving only 365 women SSC officers to be scrutinised on medical criteria. One-third of the women who applied for PC were aged above 40.Responding to the petitioners’ demand to relax medical criteria, the Army said, “Any disease arising out of physiological changes due to childbirth such as obesity are age and gender independent….The Army can perform its mandated task if the officers at the helm of affairs and the troops who execute the tasks are in good medical condition, so that their medical, cognitive and physical faculties are undiminished.” Due to this reason, women SSC officers joining in the non-combat arm of the Army Medical Corps (AMC) till the age of 45 years are put through the same rigor requiring them to be in top medical category of Shape-1, the affidavit added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-s-women-officers-denied-permanent-commission-get-sc-breather-as-centre-refuses-to-relax-medical-criteria/story-f2NY8vgsbsfFbxP8o2OtdM.html

This suspension will start from 11.59pm, December 22, 2020,” the ministry announced.“As a measure of precaution, passengers arriving from UK in all transit flights (flights that have taken off or flights which are reaching India before December 22) should be subject to mandatory RT-PCR test on arrival at the airports concerned,” it added.Watch l New Covid strain: India bans flights from UK; govt says ‘no need to panic’ Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri said that passengers who test positive will be sent for institutional quarantine.“Those found positive on arrival should be sent for institutional quarantine set up by state/UT govts, in collaboration with the states/UTs concerned. Those found negative should be advised to isolate at home for 7 days & will be medically monitored by the States/UTs,” he tweeted.We have decided to take all necessary precautions as a result of the situation arising out of the spread of a new strain of coronavirus in some countries. All flights originating from U.K into India will be suspended temporarily from 22 Dec to 31 Dec 2020. @PMOIndia @HMOIndia https://t.co/Pn6mxKL1zMThe decision has been taken amid concerns over a new strain of the coronavirus that is feared to be more contagious, which forced at least five countries on Sunday to ban travel from the United Kingdom, with several others considering similar restrictions.The new coronavirus variant has prompted the UK government to impose a tier 4 lockdown across the country and tighten restrictions across England, especially during the festival season.India’s announcement on Monday came after a meeting called by the Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) chaired by the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) to assess the threat from the new variant.The government may review the suspension period after December.“ We have imposed a 10-day suspension on flights to and from the UK after a thorough review by the government. We will reassess the suspension period as per the situation prevailing in the country later,” an aviation ministry official said. The development came days after London confirmed that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had accepted India’s invite to be the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi on January 26. The travel curbs also compound problems for the UK as it is finally set to exit the European Union on December 31.India has been operating international flights through established transport bubbles with 23 countries, including the UK thus far, and the Vande Bharat Mission since May while regular operations remain suspended since March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-suspends-flights-to-and-from-uk-till-december-31-over-new-variant-of-covid-19/story-lP48ePZNSvNpCQh4XOOYMI.html

So, Pawar may also take up the issue with the Centre, seeking resolution,” the source added.The Bombay High Court last week stayed the order passed by Mumbai suburban district collector allotting 102 acres of salt pan land in Kanjurmarg area here for the construction of an integrated Metro car shed.The HC also restrained the authorities from carrying out any construction work at the said land.The Centre and the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government are locked in a tussle over ownership of the land earmarked by the state for constructing the Metro car shed which was earlier planned at Aarey Colony, a green belt in suburban Goregaon.The previous Fadnavis-led government in the state had decided to construct the car shed for the Mumbai Metro line 3 at the Aarey Colony, despite opposition from environmentalists and activists to the vast tree-cutting for the project.The present Thackeray-led MVA government, comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, recently took a decision to shift the car shed from the Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-metro-land-row-pawar-speaks-to-cm-thackeray-fadnavis/story-qde4chxPZEqPyjAhtsJsRJ.html

There can be “good progress” if decisions related to the procurement of Ka-226 helicopters and production of AK-203 assault rifles are expedited, and Russia is prepared to share the most advanced technologies with India in line with the “Make in India” and “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” initiatives, Kudashev told a news briefing. His remarks came against the backdrop of the US imposing sanctions last on Turkey over its $2.5-billion deal with Russia for the S-400 air defence system under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). US officials have warned that India’s acquisition of hi-tech Russian systems could attract similar sanctions. “As far as current deals [are] concerned, we are advancing well, including with S-400 supplies. If relevant decisions to start works related to Ka-226 helicopters and AK-203 rifles production are expedited, soon we will see good progress, which is especially important due to deep interests expressed by the Indian armed forces,” Kudashev said. Also Read: Russia understands India’s vision of Indo-Pacific, has concerns about Quad: Russian diplomatsIndia and Russia signed a $5.4-billion deal for five S-400 systems in October 2018, and the first batch is expected to be delivered by the end of 2021. All deliveries will be completed in a five-year period. Asked specifically about the threat of US secondary sanctions against India under CAATSA, Kudashev said Russia, like India, doesn’t recognise sanctions other than those imposed by the UN Security Council. Roman Babushkin, chargé d’affaires at the Russian embassy, described US secondary sanctions on arms purchases from Russia as “illegal tools of unfair competition and pressure”. Kudashev said both Russia and India are disciplined members of international arms control regimes and their bilateral military-technical cooperation will not introduce “any threat to the regional balance”. “As far as sanctions are concerned, it’s hard to predict and let the Biden administration first announce publicly its plans and foreign policy vision. We do not recognise or welcome unilateral sanctions as a tool...of interstate or international relations, sanctions other than those applied by the UN Security Council, this is also the case of Turkey,” he said. “As far as India is concerned, we share the same platform. India’s position is crystal clear – no sanctions are acknowledged other than those applied by the UN Security Council. Whatever the future is, we believe that our ties will stand the coming challenges,” he added. Kudashev said the “unparalleled defence cooperation” between India and Russia is based on “real exchange of technologies and joint ventures helps India to advance local production and expand its military export potential”. The two sides are working on co-development and co-production of equipment, components and spare parts, improving the after sales service system and deepening localisation programmes. Russia is also looking forward to participating in Aero-India 2021, where it will showcase the Su-57, Su-35 and MiG-35 combat jets, Ka-52, Ka-226, Mi-17B-5 and Mi-26 helicopters, and the S-400 and Buk missile systems. “We are ready to share almost everything we have, doubly so since the Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiatives and the emergence of the military-technical economic corridors in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh create especially favourable conditions. There are no obstacles to our cooperation,” Kudashev said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/s-400-deal-advancing-well-despite-us-threat-of-sanctions-russian-ambassador/story-7QtNiyHXkZIAVpqIhJK8MI.html

21-12-2020||India||After wait of 28 years, verdict in Sister Abhaya murder case tomorrow||After a wait of 28 years, the verdict in the suspicious death of 19-year-old sister Abhaya in a convent in Kottayam in 1992 will be pronounced by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday.A day before the crucial verdict in nun murder case, main witness in the case K Rajau, alias Adakka Raju, told a Malayalam news channel Asianet that he was tortured for days together to own up to the crime by police officers. Raju, a small-time robber, was present on the convent premises when the incident took place. Later, he reportedly told CBI officials that he saw two priests and a nun at the convent under mysterious circumstances. “I suffered a lot. I got big promises to own up to the crime, but I refused to budge. I want truth to come out,” he told the news channel. The CBI had charge-sheeted Catholic priest Thomas Kottoor and Sister Sefi in the case. They were charged with murder, destruction of evidence, criminal conspiracy and other charges. Another accused Father Jose Poothrukayil was let off by the court last year after it found there was no evidence against him. Sister Abhaya, a plus-two student, was found dead in the well of the Pious X Convent in Kottayam. It was initially ruled as case of suicide by the state police and crime branch, but the CBI later concluded that it was a murder. Many witnesses had turned hostile during the trial and a flurry of petitions in various courts delayed case proceedings.According to the CBI charge-sheet, on the day of the incident Abhaya got up early for her studies and went to the kitchen to wash her face. There she reportedly witnessed some alleged two priests and a nun in a compromising position. She was killed fearing that she might tell others, said the CBI. She was first attacked with an axe, the CBI added, and later dumped in the well. Despite the heat that the case generated, the church stood with the accused saying “they were innocent”.At first, Kerala police investigated the case and ruled it a suicide. Later, the crime branch also shared the same view. Following a huge uproar, the case was then handed over to the CBI.The premier investigation agency filed three three reports in the case. It called it a case of “homicidal suicide” in the first report, which was rejected by the court and a fresh investigation was ordered. In the second report, it said the agency could not establish beyond doubt whether it was a suicide or murder. In the last report it filed in 2008, it said it was a murder and arrested three persons: two priests and a nun. Later a priest, Jose Poothrukayil, was absolved of all charges before the final trial.The case was delayed inordinately as it meandered through various levels of the judiciary. Besides the murder case, the court will also deliver its verdict on some of the witnesses who turned hostile.Last month the Union government had extended the service of CBI SP Nandakumar Nair, who investigated this case, including many others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-wait-of-28-years-verdict-in-sister-abhaya-murder-case-tomorrow/story-KxWplcqgKM14NJtOjCjrcK.html

The Speaker had asked Adhikari to appear before him today.“Assembly speaker had called me regarding my resignation as MLA of the House. Today, I met him... I was told my resignation has been accepted,” said Adhikari, newly-inducted Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader.“Suvendu Adhikari appeared before me today & told me that he resigned without being under anyone else’s influence. I am satisfied that his resignation is voluntary & genuine. I accept his resignation with immediate effect,” said the Speaker.Adhikari, a former TMC minister and MLA, quit all posts and had switched over to the saffron camp last week. He had submitted his resignation as MLA at the Assembly secretariat on December 16. The speaker was not present in the House at that time.TMC minister Subrata Mukherjee on Sunday said that there was no need to raise a hue and cry over the recent defections from the party, as “traitors and backstabbers have existed since time immemorial”.Addressing a press meet, Mukherjee, the state panchayat minister, said his party is neither shocked nor crestfallen, as such desertions “wouldn’t have any impact” on assembly polls, likely to be held in April-May.Union home minister Amit Shah, who was in Bengal on a two-day visit, said on Sunday that the Trinamool Congress’ ‘Ma, Mati aur Manush’ slogan is non-existent now and it is limited to being a family party today.“Mamata Banerjee started with ‘Ma, Mati aur Manush’ slogan. But this slogan is not to be seen anywhere today because of appeasement policy and dictatorship. TMC is limited to being a family party today,” Shah said at a press conference here.“Instead of being concerned about the 10 crore people of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee is concerned about making her nephew (Abhishek Banerjee) the chief minister of West Bengal,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suvendu-adhikari-meets-bengal-speaker-says-resignation-as-mla-accepted/story-vSDGc9UaDbV6F3megOWXeJ.html
21-12-2020||India||Prashant Kishor spotlights BJP’s ‘struggle’ in Bengal polls, party reacts||Election strategist Prashant Kishor on Monday threw a challenge at the BJP after its acquisition of Trinamool leaders during Amit Shah’s two-day visit to the state over the weekend. Kishor, roped in last year by Mamata Banerjee for her Bengal campaign, said the BJP will “struggle to cross double digits” and promised to quit this “space” if the party did better than he predicted. Speculation on what he meant by “space” has been building. “For all the hype AMPLIFIED by a section of supportive media, in reality BJP will struggle to CROSS DOUBLE DIGITS in #WestBengal. PS: Please save this tweet and if BJP does any better I must quit this space!” Kishor tweeted. BJP leaders scoffed at the tweet, saying it was ambiguous as Kishor did not clarify what he meant by “space.” Watch l BJP mocks Prashant Kishor over ‘can’t cross double digits in Bengal’ remark A top executive of I-Pac, Kishor’s company, told HT that he meant leaving his job as election strategist. “What he meant is quite obvious. He will leave his work if the BJP wins more than 99 seats in Bengal. Those in the BJP, who counter this, should be asked whether they will quit politics if he is proved right,” the executive, who is known to be close to Kishor, said on condition of anonymity. The statement was significant because Union home minister and the BJP’s former national president Amit Shah has declared that his party will oust the Trinamool government by winning more than 200 seats. Shah returned to Delhi on Sunday evening after a two-day trip, the highlight of which was the defection of seven TMC legislators, including former minister and heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari, three MLAs from the Left and Congress, a TMC Lok Sabha member and a host of district leaders from the ruling party. The BJP countered Kishor, calling him a hired soldier. “He wrote the tweet not to target the BJP but to appease his employer. He wrote this to counter the doubts being raised about his professional capability since he is paid handsomely,” BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar told HT. Asked whether he would accept I-Pac’s challenge and quit politics if his party fails to win more than 99 seats, Majumdar said, “No political party makes such commitments. We are not taking this seriously.”This was the first such statement from Kishor, who avoids the media and does not comment on the work done by him and his company, that has been targeted not only by dissidents in the Trinamool but BJP leaders as well. Countering the Trinamool’s strategy of branding BJP’s national leaders, such as Shah, as “outsiders,” the saffron camp targeted the chief minister, saying she needs a man from Bihar, Kishor, to win elections. Kishor had earlier helped the BJP, Aam Aadmi Party and the YSR Congress Party win elections. He had also worked with the Congress but could not help them win at the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-kishor-spotlights-bjp-s-struggle-in-bengal-polls-party-reacts/story-KVs145TMHT0QG4waz5zzYK.html
21-12-2020||India||Bengal BJP youth front chief’s wife joins TMC, husband wants divorce||Sujata Mondal Khan, wife of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Bengal youth front president Saumitra Khan, joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Monday, saying the state’s main opposition party was filling its ranks with corrupt and ambitious leaders from other parties by promising them high posts. She alleged that she was not shown any respect in the BJP although she worked hard for it when the party was struggling. The 32-year-old woman did not hold any important post in the BJP. Her sudden move unfolded an unprecedented family drama in Bengal politics with Khan, 39, quickly calling a media conference and declaring that he will send her divorce papers within 24 hours. “I am heartbroken to see 10 years of companionship coming to an end in this manner. The Lakshmi (the Hindu goddess of prosperity) of my home has been stolen,” said Khan as tears rolled down his cheeks. “Sujata, I will send you papers for mutual divorce. Please sign them and do not use Khan, my surname, from today,” he said. “We had some differences during the past few months. She wanted an important position in the BJP but I had no inkling that she was drifting away from me,” said the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) state president and Lok Sabha member. Saumitra Khan is a former TMC leader who joined the BJP in January 2019. He was the TMC’s Lok Sabha member from Bishnupur in Bankura district. He retained the seat by contesting for the BJP and was made president of the state BJYM about three months ago. “I observed with pain that people who are corrupt and over-ambitious, those who can be called rotten apples, are being herded into the BJP. There is no place for hardworking people who fight for their principles,” Sujata Khan said at the TMC headquarters in Kolkata about two hours before her husband reacted. “I married him going against the wishes of my family. I love him and will always do so. I still have the red sindoor (vermilion) on my forehead,” she told the media an hour after her husband talked of divorce. “Can a personal relationship end in divorce because of politics. No TMC leader told me that I have to divorce him to join the ruling party,” she added. Sujata Khan was welcomed into the TMC by Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy and spokesperson Kunal Ghosh. “Sujata is like my daughter. We are happy to have her in the party,” said Roy. When she was asked about her husband at the TMC office, Sujata Khan said, “Who knows whether he, too, will not join the TMC in future.” Her husband ruled out such a possibility. “I am a die-hard soldier of the BJP. In the coming polls I will present all seven segments in my Lok Sabha constituency to Narendra Modi Ji,” he quipped. Without naming Suvendu Adhikari, the former TMC minister who joined the BJP in presence of Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday along with six other TMC MLAs and three more from the Left and Congress, Sujata Khan said, “Some people are joining the BJP with the hope of becoming the next chief minister or deputy chief minister. Dozens of people have been promised these posts. Imagine having a dozen deputy chief ministers.” Her husband, however, refuted this. “This is baseless. Everybody has a role allotted to him or her. Nobody is big or small in the BJP,” he said. “I am happy to see the TMC going through a cleansing process as the greedy and the bad apples are flocking to the BJP,” said the BJYM state president’s estranged wife. “Only those who realized that they are not going to be fielded by the TMC in the assembly polls in 2021 are leaving,” she said at the TMC headquarters. Jay Prakash Majumdar, state vice-president of the BJP, said, “Unlike Saumitra Khan, his wife does not have a history in politics. This does not have any political significance for us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-blow-to-bengal-bjp-party-state-youth-front-chief-s-wife-joins-tmc/story-wsMAqrWp4JkPS79QyEliaI.html

The country stood in the face of this crisis,” he said.India made a comeback in the second quarter after the first quarter was the worst for the economy as the GDP was adversely hit, he said. “We hope that in the remaining two quarters as well, the balance of recovery will be maintained,” he added.The Indian economy had contracted by 23.9% in the April to June quarter (Q1 FY21), while it contracted only 7.5% in the quarter ending September. Congress leaders including Rahul Gandhi have taken frequent jibes at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the state of the economy.“Under PM Modi, India’s economy is officially in a recession for the first time ever,” Gandhi had said on Twitter. “More importantly, 3 crore people are still looking for work under MNREGA. Economy cannot be ordered to grow by diktats. PM needs to first understand this basic idea,” he added.Also Read: Sonia Gandhi meets section of Congress dissenters, looks to end crisisSharma was a part of the group of 23 dissenters who wrote to party president Sonia Gandhi earlier this year, seeking a complete overhaul of the organisation within Congress.

She wants all the leaders to work in close coordination with Rahul Gandhi in strengthening the party,” a Congress functionary told Hindustan Times, requesting anonymity.Last month, Sharma had to issue a clarification and amend his tweet when it was construed as praise for PM Narendra Modi. “Prime minister Shri Narendra Modi visit to Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadilla was a recognition of Indian scientists and their work to produce the vaccine for COVID-19 That alone will lift morale of frontline warriors and reassure the nation,’ Sharma had tweeted after the PM’s visit to vaccine centres. Regretting the error in our earlier tweet where the lines got misplaced, resulting in some avoidable confusion.

21-12-2020||India||PM Modi proposes creation of library to gather Buddhist literature from around the world||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday proposed the creation of a library that will bring together Buddhist literature and philosophy found in monasteries around the world and serve as a platform for research and dialogue. Modi made the proposal during his virtual address to the sixth India-Japan Samvad Conference that was also addressed by his Japanese counterpart Yoshihide Suga. The conference was launched in line with a joint proposal from the leaders of Japan and India in 2014, and has since been held in New Delhi, Tokyo, Yangon and Ulaanbaatar. Noting that examples of Buddhist literature and philosophy can be found in monasteries in many countries and in different languages, Modi said this body of works is a treasure of humankind. “Today, I would like to propose the creation of a library of all such traditional Buddhist literature and scriptures. We will be happy to create such a facility in India and will provide appropriate resources for it,” he said. Also Read: Tokyo Olympics Q&A: Costs, IOC, COVID-19, and vaccinationsThe library will collect digital copies of Buddhist literature from different countries and aim to translate them and make them freely available for all monks and scholars. “The library will not only be a depository of literature. It will also be a platform for research and dialogue - a true ‘Samvad’ between human beings, between societies, and between man and nature,” Modi said. The library’s research mandate will include examining how Buddha’s message can guide the modern world in tackling contemporary challenges such as poverty, racism, extremism, gender discrimination and climate change, he added. Pointing to his recent visit to Sarnath, where Lord Buddha spoke in detail about his ideal of Dhamma, Modi said this was about more than prayer and rituals. “At the centre of Dhamma are humans, and their relation with fellow humans. Thus, it is most important to be a positive force in the lives of others,” he added. Modi also said the time had come to change the paradigm on what is seen as growth. “Discussions on global growth cannot happen only between a few. The table must be bigger. The agenda must be broader. Growth patterns must follow a human-centric approach,” he said. Suga, in his address, said diverse values have been nurtured across Asia since ancient times. “Buddhism and Hinduism teach compassion. Confucianism teaches ‘Ren’ or benevolence. Islam teaches tolerance. And in Japan, we have the spirit of ‘Wa’ or harmony,” he said. “These values have one thing in common: an attitude to cherish and respect diversity and tolerance. We can say that democracy in Asia have taken root, deeply and widely, and evolved based on such traditional thoughts and beliefs,” he added. Suga also said the experiences of Asian countries have show that there are different historical and cultural backgrounds behind the consolidation of democracy. “Japan will continue to stand side by side with each country and work together to further develop democracy in Asia,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-proposes-creation-of-library-to-gather-buddhist-literature-from-around-the-world/story-fK8gcOa5cNAgGJLvhRCrgN.html
21-12-2020||India||Russia understands India’s vision of Indo-Pacific, has concerns about Quad: Russian diplomats||Russia understands and supports India’s inclusive vision of the Indo-Pacific based on international law but has concerns about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad that could jeopardise regional cooperation, the two top Russian diplomats in New Delhi said on Monday. Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev also called for “enhanced dialogue” between India and China against the backdrop of the military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), saying this is the key for taking forward relations between the two countries and for regional stability and security. India had recently pushed back against Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov’s contention that the West’s Indo-Pacific policies were aimed at enmeshing India in “anti-China games” and said New Delhi has an independent foreign policy based on its national interests. Roman Babushkin, the chargé d’affaires at the Russian embassy, said his country understands the Indian concept for the Indo-Pacific but there is currently no unified vision for the vast region because many countries were promoting their “own Indo-Pacific visions”. This has led to the creation of mechanisms that are “non-inclusive as compared to the Indian approach to the Indo-Pacific, which we understand very well and support the inclusiveness and its reliance on international law”, he added. Also Read: Military Literature Festival: ‘India should shed hesitation and embrace QUAD to tame China’Russia also has apprehensions about the intentions behind such mechanisms. “We are facing attempts by some countries to create containment in the region that threaten to jeopardise basic principles for regional cooperation, for example Asean centrality and Asean unity. That means Quad would be detrimental to inclusive dialogue in the region,” Babushkin said. Kudashev too said Russia has no problems with India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative but backed greater engagement within existing multilateral mechanisms such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), Russia-India-China (RIC) and Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics). Responding to a question on the India-China standoff, Kudashev said he hoped New Delhi’s relations with Beijing would reach the same level as the specially privileged and trusted strategic partnership with Moscow. “We would naturally, in our capacity as a friend to both India and China, welcome enhanced dialogue between New Delhi and Beijing...We believe that this is the key for the future progress of your ties with China and regional stability and security,” he said. Referring to India-China relations, Kudashev said it is “not the habit of the Russian government to interfere with bilateral ties between other countries”. He added, “But if you would question me what would be our preference, our vision, our goal and our message to the region, it is that we offer a unifying agenda, the concept of the larger Eurasian partnership which should bring the two ends together, which could bring together Russia’s vision, the Chinese vision, the Indian vision.” Kudashev also referred to Russia’s role in facilitating talks between India and China this year, saying defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar had “profound negotiations” with their Chinese counterparts on the margins of SCO meetings in Moscow in September. “It was very significant in the context of constructive engagement of both sides to maintain peace and tranquillity at the Line of Actual Control. Russia is a trusted partner for India and China, and we feel it is vital to ensure a positive atmosphere for cooperation between the two neighbouring Asian giants,” he said. Lavrov’s comments on the Indo-Pacific and India falling prey to moves by the West to entangle it in “anti-China games” were criticised by Indian experts and commentators. The external affairs ministry also said India’s relations with each country are independent of its ties with third countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-understands-india-s-vision-of-indo-pacific-has-concerns-about-quad-russian-diplomats/story-ngJamb9wWTfA6aP2SFM7NK.html
21-12-2020||India||PM Modi proposes setting up of library of Buddhist literature in India||Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed to create a library dedicated to traditional Buddhist literature and scriptures, adding that India would be happy to host the facility and provide appropriate resources for it. The library will collect digital copies of all such Buddhist literature from different countries, it will aim to translate them, and make them freely available for all monks and scholars of Buddhism, he said.Addressing the 6th Indo-Japan Samwad Conference virtually, the PM said that the forum, which was launched five years ago, has done great work in promoting the ideas and ideals of Lord Buddha, especially among the youth.  “The forum has remained true to its fundamental values of democracy, humanism, non-violence, freedom and tolerance and carries forward our ancient tradition of spiritual and scholarly exchanges,” he said. Addressing the conference, he said it is time to draw upon our ancient values and keep humanism at the core of our policies. “Discussions on global growth cannot happen only between a few. The table must be bigger. The agenda must be broader. Growth patterns must follow a human-centric approach. And, be in harmony with our surroundings,” PM Modi said.“In the past, humanity often took the path of confrontation instead of collaboration. From Imperialism to the World Wars. From the arms race to the space race. We had dialogues but they were aimed at pulling others down. Now, let us rise together... We must keep humanism at the core of our policies. We must make harmonious co-existence with nature as the central pillar of our existence,” he added.Earlier in the day, the PM had tweeted that he would be addressing the conference. “At 9:30 AM, will be speaking at the 6th Indo-Japan Samwad Conference. This forum has grown immensely over the years, contributing to discourses around furthering global peace, harmony and brotherhood,” he had tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-proposes-setting-up-of-library-of-buddhist-literature-in-india/story-KlgprP71HQhADs4TMRPodO.html

RP Joshi, range officer of Gaula range in Terai east forest division, said, “We rushed to the spot after villagers said that an elephant had been electrocuted. We informed the higher authorities so that veterinarians could conduct a post-mortem examination.” On Monday morning, villagers of Bachachi Dharma spotted an elephant lying in a field. When they approached it, they noticed there was no movement in the pachyderm, while a high tension line was passing through the spot where the elephant was found. Rukmani Negi, village head of Bachachi Dharma village, said, “The forest officials were told about the incident and they took the elephant’s body into possession. We have requested the electricity department several times to tighten the lines but it has not been done. The elephant’s death is direct dereliction of duties by electricity officials.” On November 24, a 35-year-old male elephant that was successfully radio-collared in Haridwar forest division in October died due to electrocution. In the second week of November, a female elephant had died in the Lachhiwala forest range of Dehradun due to electrocution. In July, the carcass of a 25-year-old wild tusker was spotted in the forests of Almora forest division, a day after it was radio-collared. The Uttarakhand government had earlier this year reported that elephant numbers crossed the 2,000 mark in the state after a recently concluded elephant estimation process. The state reported a 29.9% increase since 2015, and reported a total of 2,026 elephants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elephant-dies-after-getting-electrocuted-in-uttarakhand/story-yF2Bx6jjjrS4fmr6z0OO8O.html

The two UN observers in the vehicle escaped unharmed.“I am making absolutely clear to the (international) community that if India was to be reckless enough to conduct a false flag operation against Pakistan, it would confront a strong national Pakistani resolve & be given a befitting response at all levels of the threat. Make no mistake,” Prime Minister Imran Khan tweeted Sunday.Pakistan says the attack on the UN vehicle was deliberate, as such vehicles are clearly marked and “recognizable even from long distances.”The UN confirmed the attack and said it was being investigated.India has not commented on the attack or responded to Khan’s tweets.The two nuclear-armed nations are bitter rivals which have fought three wars since gaining independence from British rule in 1947, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir. The territory is split between Indian and Pakistani control, and both claim it in its entirety.The two sides often exchange fire across the heavily-guarded Line of Control in Kashmir.

The party will struggle to cross even the double digit-mark in the polls, Kishor said.   “For all the hype AMPLIFIED by a section of supportive media, in reality BJP will struggle to CROSS DOUBLE DIGITS in West Bengal,” he tweeted, adding that he would “quit this space” if proven wrong.   Also Read: Bengal’s next CM won’t be an ‘outsider’, says Amit Shah For all the hype AMPLIFIED by a section of supportive media, in reality BJP will struggle to CROSS DOUBLE DIGITS in #WestBengal PS: Please save this tweet and if BJP does any better I must quit this space!Kishor’s tweet comes after several leaders, including Trinamool Congress (TMC) heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari, defecting to the BJP during Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit to the state on December 19. Leaders from the ruling TMC, Left parties, and the Congress joined the BJP ahead of the assembly elections slated for 2021.In the upcoming assembly elections scheduled to be held next year, the BJP seeks to put an end to the nearly decade-long rule of the TMC in the state. In the 2019 general elections, even though West Bengal was one of the few states where the BJP was not able to make deep inroads, it had won 18 of the 42 seats, emerging as a clear opposition to the TMC government.Also Read: ‘Never seen a roadshow like this, people of Bengal want change’: Amit ShahKishor, who heads the Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC), is behind several campaigns that led to significant victories for several parties.

21-12-2020||India||Shots fired at Pak drone near Punjab border. 11 Pak-made grenades seized||Security forces have seized 11 hand grenades suspected to have been dropped by a drone flying in from across the Pakistan border into Punjab’s Gurdaspur district, a senior police officer said on Monday. The grenades are suspected to have been made by an ordnance factory in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi.The consignment of Arges Type HG-84 series grenades, packed in a plastic box, is the eight instance of seizure of firearms and grenades smuggled into the country for terrorists from across the border in the last 15 months, a senior Punjab Police officer said.The Arges HG-84 is an anti-personnel fragmentation grenade designed to inflict massive damage against soft targets within its blast radius, spraying shrapnel out to a distance of 30 meters at speed. The Arges grenade, manufactured by an Austrian firm, have been used in major attacks in India – including the 2008 Mumbai strike, the 1993 Mumbai blasts and the 2001 Parliament attack. The Wah Cantonment Ordnance factory in Rawalpindi earlier had a franchise to manufacture the high-explosive grenades.The seizure comes weeks after an alert by intelligence agencies that cautioned security personnel about Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence’s moves to acquire upgraded versions of drones from China that can carry large quantities of firearms in every sortie.The first instance of ISI-backed terror groups using drones to smuggle weapons in Punjab was on 19 August 2019 when security personnel spotted a large quadcopter dropping a weapon consignment of 10 kg including AK 47 rifles, MP9 rifle, pistols and fake Indian currency. This drone, however, ran out of battery on its way back and fell within Indian territory.Counter-terror officials in Delhi said Pakistani terror groups and the ISI could have been using drones for arms trafficking for much longer.“Lately, the drones have been getting bigger and more powerful, triggering concerns that these could not only be used to carry larger quantities of arms but also rain explosives at security camps in border areas,” an official said.This improves the capacity of the ISI to supply weapons for Khalistani terror groups as well as its groups in Jammu and Kashmir.Police teams found the packet with 11 grenades during a search on Sunday morning.Border Security Force personnel at the Chakri border outpost in Gurdaspur sector had spotted a drone entering Indian territory shortly before Saturday midnight. The soldiers, and later Punjab police officers also, fired at the drone but couldn’t bring it down. They also alerted Punjab Police who also tried to bring down the drone.The packet was found near Dhussi bandh in Salach village of Gurdaspur’s Dorangla area. A senior police officer said the box of grenades had been attached with a wooden frame and lowered from the drone to the ground from a nylon rope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shots-fired-at-pak-drone-near-punjab-border-11-pak-made-grenades-seized/story-dvnqrMuarrlFlBDgr89UTK.html

This is the second incident this month.East Coast Railway officials said the Puri-Surat Express hit the tusker at Bhabanipali village between Hatibari and Maneswar Railway stations under Sambalpur division at around 2 am. The collision derailed the engine. However, passengers on-board and the railway crew members, including the loco pilots, were safe. Sources said the train was moving at a speed of around 50 km/hr when the accident took place. Sambalpur Divisional Railway Manager Pradeep Kumar said following the accident, railway communication on the route was disrupted. “An Accident Relief Train rushed to the spot and pulled all coaches of the Puri-Surat Express train to Hatibari station. At least two trains on that route were stopped midway,” he said.Divisional Forest Officer of Sambalpur, Sanjeet Kumar said the train appeared to be moving at a higher speed than what was advised. “The railway authorities had been cautioned regarding the elephant movement. Sign boards mentioning elephant movement areas have also been put up near the railway track. The accident is being investigated,” he said.On December 5, a 12-year-old tusker in Sambalpur district was killed after getting hit by an express train. In the last 10 years, 28 elephants have been killed in Odisha after getting hit by trains.Wildlife activist Biswajit Mohanty said elephants continued to be killed by trains due to the forest department’s failure in fixing responsibility. “If a train hits an elephant at 50 km/hr speed there’s no chance the elephant will survive. From initial assessment, it seems the train driver was violating the speed protocol. The forest department needs to fix responsibility and recommend action against the erring railway officials.” Since April 1 this year, 47 elephants have died in the state due to reasons such as electrocution, poaching and after getting hit by running trains and trucks. Similarly, 70 people have died in human-elephant conflict while 76 have been injured in 122 encounters. Wildlife activists fear the casualties may increase in the next few months as paddy harvest season has begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elephant-dies-after-being-hit-by-train-in-odisha-s-sambalpur/story-618lVbkBHjpN6Va2nYuPHO.html

The farmers will also be given training in organic cultivation,” said a state government spokesperson.“The government is embarking on organic farming, considering the large market and demand for organic products in the country, as well as abroad. The Yogi government is working on three major goals simultaneously through an organic farming promotion scheme. The first goal is cleanliness and protection of the Ganga. The second is boosting farmers’ income and the third is the production of large quantities of organic crops in the state,” the spokesperson said.“Farmers will be provided with the necessary equipment at concessional prices, along with training and information for this. The departments are in the process of identifying organic crops, products and provide special markets for the scheme,” said the spokesperson for the Jal Shakti ministry.To free the Ganga from pollution, the Yogi government has decided to take strict steps to stop the use of chemical fertilizers. The state government is preparing to completely ban the use of chemical fertilizers in the districts through which the Ganga passes, the spokesperson added.“By promoting organic farming, natural farming and horticulture in the Gangetic plains, the government is going to give a new and diversified income platform to the farmers,” said an officer of the agriculture department.In addition to proper management of solid waste, disposal of garbage, polythene will be banned completely in villages along the Ganga. A senior official of the Namami Gange department said the use of chemical fertilizers was a major cause of pollution in the Ganga and the idea now is to stop it completely.Cabinet minister and UP government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said the Yogi government was committed to the betterment and progress of the farmers of the state along with the ‘Nirmal and Aviral Ganga (clean and free-flowing Ganga)’.Trees and plants like peepal (sacred fig), pakad (white fig), mango, jamun (black plum) and banyan will be planted along the river to protect its banks from erosion and degradation.Ganga nurseries will be developed in every district and geo-tagging of all the plants along the river will be done to prevent their theft. For this, help from the forest department will also be taken.A campaign will also be launched to free land along the Ganga from encroachment so that these places become attractive for tourists.Ganga stadiums will also be built in villages along the river for promotion of sports. Renovation and beautification of ponds along the river are also part of the plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/organic-farming-belt-to-come-up-on-either-side-of-ganga-in-uttar-pradesh/story-S9c6rNnmCx9GfB6YxYM7eO.html

21-12-2020||India||Rules for amended Citizenship law to be framed after Covid crisis ends: Amit Shah||Criticising West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the recent attack on BJP chief JP Nadda’s convoy, Home Minister Shah on Sunday said the centre has the right to summon state police officers responsible for providing him security for central deputation, and asked the Trinamool Congress (TMC) to go through the rules before pointing fingers at the union government.He also said that rules for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are yet to be framed because of the pandemic and the matter will be considered once Covid-19 vaccination starts.Addressing a press conference in Bolpur, Shah said Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress raked up the “outsider-insider” issue to divert public attention from the failures of the state government and said that a “son of the soil” would lead the state if the BJP is voted to power.“The rules of the CAA are yet to be framed as such a massive process could not be carried out because of coronavirus. As soon as (Covid-19) vaccination starts and coronavirus infection cycle breaks, we will consider it,” Shah said.On the summoning of Indian Police Service officers of West Bengal cadre by the Home Ministry, Shah said the centre has sent the letter to state government as per the Constitution and the law.“It is according to the federal structure (of the country). They (TMC government) should first go through the rules and then talk to the centre and the public,” Shah said.The centre had on Thursday shot off a fresh letter to the West Bengal government to immediately relieve its three IPS officers for central deputation, following which the Chief Minister called the move “unconstitutional and unacceptable”.On the attack on Nadda’s convoy during his visit to Diamond Harbour on December 10, Shah alleged political violence and corruption are at peak in the state.“The BJP condemns it, and I too condemn it. The BJP believes that in a democracy, everyone should have the right to voice their views. And it is the responsibility of the ruling party to ensure that all parties can have their voice heard,” Shah said.“The attack on the BJP chief is not only an attack on him. It is an attack on democracy in West Bengal and the Trinamool Congress is completely responsible for this,” Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rules-for-amended-citizenship-law-to-be-framed-after-covid-crisis-ends-amit-shah/story-NtecRN0tQSrMqGj07GIROJ.html

The specially designed park is located not far from Siliguri, north Bengal’s biggest town. There is another leopard who is named after former Indian cricket captain Sourav Ganguly. Park authorities said it appears Sachin died of heart attack. Samples from his body were sent to Kolkata to ascertain the exact cause of death. Badal Debnath, the park director, said, “Sachin was ill for the past seven days. Veterinary experts were looking after him.” Sachin jumped out of his enclosure on January 1, 2019, forcing the authorities to close the park. However, he surprised everyone by returning to the enclosure after a few days. He has been kept under surveillance since then. Sachin’s escape created panic among people in the local villages. Drones were used to trace the big cat and four elephants were deployed to comb the park and the jungles. Six camera traps were also set up. Sachin and Sourav were both brought to the park from the Khayerbari tiger and leopard rescue centre in Alipurduar district. The park is now left with four leopards: Sourav, Kajal, Shital and Nayan. The main park is spread across 297 hectares. The Bengal Safari is among the most popular tourist spots in north Bengal. It was inaugurated by chief minister Mamata Banerjee on January 21, 2016. Tigers, leopards and black bears are the main attractions for visitors who have to travel in specially designed buses. The leopard safari, where Sachin lived, is spread across 20 hectares.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leopard-sachin-dies-of-heart-attack-at-safari-park-in-bengal/story-cSsEyFZ1cIZ24N2x9vzZ8O.html

Singh appeared before the high court and filed an affidavit stating that the applicant was released from prison on December 8, 2020. While keeping the affidavit of compliance on record, Justice JJ Munir said, “This court has perused the affidavit filed by the jail superintendent. The explanation furnished for non-compliance with this court’s order, and, in consequence, delaying release of the applicant is reluctantly accepted. The personal presence of the jail superintendent is exempted. He is warned to remain careful in future.”The applicant’s name in bail order was shown as ‘Vinod Baruaar’. His bail application was earlier rejected by the additional sessions judge, Siddharth nagar on September 4, 2019. Hence, he filed an application for bail before the high court. The high court on April 9, 2020 directed his release on bail. But he was not released from jail, as the jail authorities refused to comply with the release order because the name mentioned in the release order was ‘Vinod Baruaar’, whereas in the remand sheet his name was ‘Vinod Kumar Baruaar’. Earlier, while hearing a name correction plea moved by the applicant, the court took serious note of his non-release over a small technicality and directed release of applicant.The court summoned the jail superintendent/jailer of Siddharthnagar district jail while observing, “It is on that small technicality that the jail superintendent/jailer has flouted the bail order of high court by refusing to release the applicant”. The court directed that the jail superintendent/jailer, after complying with the order, shall appear before this court and explain why appropriate departmental inquiry may not be recommended against him.

He has been charged with Grand Larceny in the first degree, which is theft of property worth more than $1 million and can land him in jail, if convicted.Nehal Modi is accused of procuring diamonds from LLD Diamonds USA, LLC, a wholesale company, between March 2015 and August 15, for purported sale to Costco, a wholesale grocery retail chain, against deferred payment. He is alleged to have pawned off the diamonds instead, or sold them, and pocketed most of the proceeds for personal use or other businesses. LLD reported him to the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, Cy Vance in August that year.“As alleged, Mr Modi conned a Manhattan diamond wholesaler into fronting him millions worth of diamonds for a purported deal with Costco that never existed,” Vance said Friday, announcing the indictment (charges) filed in the New York Supreme Court. “While diamonds may be forever, this flawed scheme was not, and now Mr Modi will face the clarity of a New York Supreme Court indictment. My Office will not allow individuals who have the privilege of soliciting business in Manhattan’s iconic diamond industry to defraud our businesses or consumers.”Vance’s office has jurisdiction over New York city’s prime business area of Manhattan, where Nehal’s elder brother Nirav Modi launched his flagship jewellery boutique store in September 2015 with much fanfare, just a month after his younger brother was reported by LLD to Vance’s office.In February 2018, Indian authorities filed charges against Nirav Modi for defrauding banks of millions of dollars and sought his arrest, as part of an expanding investigation. He has since fled to the United Kingdom, where he has sought political asylum and is fighting extradition to India.Nehal Modi was released without posting bail on Friday. His attorney Roger Bernstein told New York Post: “This is a commercial dispute” and his client is “not guilty”.According to the indictment announced by the District Attorney Vance, Nehal Modi first approached LLD in March 2015. His family connections — coming from a “well-known family in the diamond business” — helped, the district attorney’s office said in a statement. He is alleged to have asked the wholesaler for $800,000 worth of diamonds to show to Costco for a potential deal.He is charged with falsely telling LLD Costco had agreed. LLD allowed Modi to buy the diamonds on credit, to be paid fully within 90 days. “Modi then pawned the diamonds at Modell Collateral Loans, Inc. (“Modell”) to secure a short-term loan,” the district attorney’s office said.Over April and May, Modi is alleged to have returned to the company three times and picked up diamonds worth more than $1 million for sale to Costco. Modi did make a “series of payments” to LLD, but is alleged to have “used the majority of the proceeds for personal use and other business expenses”.“To cover his fraud, Modi falsely claimed that he was encountering payment issues due to a ‘Costco fulfillment error’ and made repeated promises to satisfy the balance,” said the district attorney’s office.Modi returned to LLD again in August, and asked for more diamonds for sale to Costco. This time, in view of Modi’s spotty payment record, the wholesaler gave him the diamonds with the condition that they could not be sold without their authorisation. Modi was already in touch with Modell then and, the statement said, “after picking up the diamonds from LLD, Modi pawned the majority of the diamonds at Modell to secure two separate loans and sold the remainder of the diamonds to various retailers at a steep discount”.LLD reported the case to the district attorney after failing to get Modi to either return the diamonds or pay the outstanding balance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-s-younger-brother-nehal-booked-for-2-6mn-fraud/story-fIDaNMN6g0PktbHUK5BA9M.html
21-12-2020||India||Govt to explore railways’ infra for Covid19 vaccine transportation||India Railways’ vast network may be pressed into service for large-scale transport of a Covid-19 vaccine that’s eventually approved by the Centre. The national carrier is considering the possibility of deploying its specially designed refrigerated vans for the purpose and is in talks with several ministries to finalize a plan.Special refrigerated vans may be set aside for transporting the vaccine or luggage compartments may be modified into temperature-controlled units. Refrigerated vans have the capacity to carry 17 tonnes of cargo, with a deep freezer capable of handling temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius.The vans have a capacity to carry 5 tonnes of frozen items and an additional capacity of 12 tonnes to carry perishable cargo like fruit and vegetables at 40°C temperature.“We are discussing possibilities, no final decision has been taken but we are continuously in touch with the concerned ministries for the same and wherever the need arises, railways will come forward and help the country. We are having continuous discussion over this,” railway board chairman and CEO VK Yadav said.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe national carrier also uses modified refrigerated luggage compartments with a temperature-controlled chamber of 2/4 tonnes capacity for carrying perishable items.At present, Indian Railways operates refrigerated parcel vans on selected mail express trains for carrying perishable cargo like fruits, vegetables, dairy products, fish and meat. In August, the transporter also began setting up a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables lie milk, meat and fish on Kisan Rail trains.According to the railway ministry, refrigerated parcel vans with a capacity of carrying 17 tonnes of highly perishable freight have been designed,developed and procured through Rail Coach Factory, Kapurthala. At present, Indian Railway has a fleet of nine such vans. These vans are booked on a round-trip basis, and cost 1.5 times the normal freight carriers.“There has been internal discussion in production units on how to transport the vaccine as it seems logical for large- scale transportation. We have the necessary infrastructure, we have 10 {refrigerated parcel vans}at the moment that have two compartments including one for ultra-low temperatures, but it can easily be scaled by modifying our existing coaches. We are ready to do it once we are approached by the government and the final nod is given,” a senior ministry official said, requesting anonymity.“Railway coaches can be modified either to directly implant boxed cold storage vans inside them, by keeping constant power supply etc, or the entire coach can be redesigned to have one. The Linke-Hofmann-Busch coaches in Rajdhani trains, used in pantry cars etc, have already had some modifications for cold storage. Railways has lot of coach repair and design production units and workshops. It is not difficult to redesign the thermodynamics of a rail coach and insulate it to colder temperatures. It is efficient and can be supplied to any part of the country,” a second official explained.Indian Railways also uses Reefer (ventilated, insulated) rail containers. At present railways has 98 ventilated and insulated containers with a capacity of 12 tonnes per container and a rake composition of 80 containers that have been procured through its subsidiary Container Corporation of India (CONCOR).Also Read: Eight promising Covid-19 vaccines end year in hopeReefers facilitate the movement of cargo that requires a strict temperature-controlled environment. At present, CONCOR provides reefer services. According to the ministry, Indian Railways has “temperature controlled perishable cargo centres” for cold storage Ghazipur Ghat (UP), New Azadpur (Adarsh Nagar, Delhi) and Raja ka Talab (UP) under CONCOR’s Kisan Vision Project. Another project is under construction at Lasalgaon, Nashik (Maharashtra). Approval has also been granted to Central Railside Warehousing Corporation to develop temperature controlled storages at Fatuha in Bihar and Mancheswar in Odisha.The Centre is making preparations for setting up a cold storage chain for the Covid-19 vaccine that will eventually be approved for use in India, and is finalising transport arrangements with top airlines to deliver the antidote to the viral disease, HT reported on December 7. The aviation ministry has also held a round of meetings with airlines on transport logistics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-explore-railways-infra-for-covid19-vaccine-transportation/story-uXajRjNILZY7JLm1NOmbYI.html
21-12-2020||India||Bengal wants to get rid of corruption, says Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah attacked the Mamata Banerjee-led government in West Bengal on Sunday, saying people in the state were looking to get rid of corruption, extortion, Bangladeshi infiltration and political violence, a remark that came a day after seven sitting legislators of the Trinamool Congress joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in his presence at a rally in Midnapore.Assembly polls in the state are due in five months and the defections could prove to be a challenge for Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress.On Sunday, Shah’s convoy drove through Bolpur, the town associated with Rabindranath Tagore. Addressing people during the roadshow, Shah said his party will restore West Bengal’s old glory when it was called “sonar Bangla”.On the second and last day of his Bengal tour, Shah flew from Kolkata to Bolpur and held the political roadshow, which was attended by a big crowd.Also Read: To counter Amit Shah, TMC releases its ‘fact sheet’“People are talking of parivartan (change). The change is needed to stop infiltration from Bangladesh, end political violence and extortion,” Shah said. “I have come to promise you that the BJP will take Bengal ahead on the path of development. We will make Bengal realise the dreams of Subhas Chandra Bose,” he told the crowd at the end of the roadshow.“The TMC can never stop infiltration as it believes in appeasement politics. Only BJP can stop it... Mamata Banerjee supports farmers protest but doesn’t allow cultivators of Bengal to get the benefits of central schemes. Is this the way to honour the federal structure?” he said.Shah also attacked the Bengal government over the recent attack on BJP chief JP Nadda’s convoy, and asserted that the Centre had the right to summon state IPS officers responsible for providing him security for central deputation. He alleged that Banerjee failed to control the law and order situation in the state, which was rapidly falling on all development indices.Responding to a question, the home minister said the rules for implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act will be formulated after the Covid-19 pandemic is brought under control. “Because of the corona, such a massive process can’t be carried out. As soon as Covid vaccination starts, we will discuss it,” he said.Also Read| ‘No more ‘Ma, Mati, Manush’, TMC is a family party now’: Amit Shah“I have attended and organised several roadshows in my life but have never seen one like this. This roadshow is a reflection of people’s anger against the Mamata Banerjee government. This crowd reflects people’s faith in the agenda of development of Narendra Modi Ji,” Shah told the gathering.Anubrata Mondal, the TMC’s district unit president, alleged that people were brought by the BJP from as far as Jharkhand to make the roadshow appear like a success. “Let Shah come to Birbhum three times a week. I would want that because it will inspire our workers to work more,” Mondal said.

21-12-2020||India||To counter Amit Shah, TMC releases its ‘fact sheet’||A day after Union home minister Amit Shah welcomed seven Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislators, including Suvendu Adhikari, and three from other parties to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at a rally in Midnapore, where he attacked Bengal’s ruling party and government, the TMC on Sunday hit back with what it called a “fact sheet” on the second day of Shah’s visit to the state. The TMC and the party’s leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien, put out data on social media to counter Shah’s claims. Shah’s Sunday visit to Visva Bharati, Bengal’s only Central university, which was set up by Rabindranath Tagore, was also criticised by the TMC and Left student unions. “Shah claimed on Saturday that 300 BJP workers have been killed in Bengal in one-and-a-half years. This is a lie. Many BJP workers are being killed in faction feuds. Even suicides are being passed off as political killings. Fact is that since 1998, 1,027 TMC workers have been killed,” said senior TMC leader Subrata Mukherjee. On Saturday, Shah defended Adhikari, who was branded by the TMC as a traitor. “Didi (Mamata Banerjee), didn’t you leave the Congress and came to the TMC? Wasn’t it changing allegiance,” Shah said. “Mamata Banerjee did not leave the Congress to join another party. If a Union minister tried to sell off the history of our country one needs to protest. Banerjee was not a defector. She set up the TMC, a new party, in 1998,” said Mukherjee. Also Read: West Bengal polls and the possible role of defections“Shah also claimed that people in Bengal do not get benefits under the Centre’s Ayushmann Bharat healthcare scheme. He does not know the facts. Banerjee started the Swasthya Sathi programme two years before Ayushmann Bharat was launched. Under this scheme, 1.4 crore families have been provided health insurance that covers expenses up to ₹5 lakh per annum,” said Mukherjee. “Shah claimed that farmers in Bengal are deprived of ₹6,000 per annum under the Prime Minister’s central scheme. Reality is that Bengal provides farmers annual assistance of ₹5,000 per acre under the Krishak Bandhu programme. The central scheme provides only ₹1,214 per acre,” said Mukherjee. “Shah had food at a villager’s home on Saturday and said the house was provided under the Prime Minster Awas Yojna scheme,” said Mukherjee. “The Centre pays 60% of the money under this scheme while the state pays the rest. Between 2011-2020, the state has built 33,87,000 houses costing ₹39,993 crore. Under the state’s own Geetanjali Prakalpa, 3,90,000 houses were built at an expense of ₹3,550 crore. Under the Housing for All scheme, 4,30,000 houses were built. This cost the state exchequer another ₹7,000 crore,” said Mukherjee. During the day, chief minister Mamata Banerjee condemned the Centre’s move to send three Indian Police Service officers to other states. These officers were in charge of the security of BJP national chief JP Nadda’s convoy that was stoned in South 24 Parganas district on December 10. TMC leaders said chief ministers from non-BJP-ruled states had called up Banerjee and expressed their solidarity with her on this issue. Also Read| ‘No more ‘Ma, Mati, Manush’, TMC is a family party now’: Amit Shah“Centre is brazenly interfering with State Govt functioning by transferring police officers. My gratitude to @bhupeshbaghel @ArvindKejriwal @capt_amarinder @ashokgehlot51 & @mkstalin for showing solidarity to people of Bengal & reaffirming their commitment to federalism. Thank you!” tweeted Mamata Banerjee on Sunday. On Sunday, Shah’s visit to Visva Bharati was also criticised by the TMC. TMC leaders in Kolkata staged a protest by against placards with images of Shah placed above those of Tagore that were found all over Bolpur town on Friday. This triggered a strong reaction among local residents. Claiming that the TMC had put up the placards to sabotage Shah’s visit, BJP workers quickly removed them. The Students Federation of India, the students’ wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), alleged that students who opposed Shah’s visit to Visva Bharati were pressured by the university authorities to withdraw protest. “When the students refused to comply, the police put two student leaders under house arrest...,” said SFI national general secretary Mayukh Biswas. A police official at said no such action was taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-counter-amit-shah-tmc-releases-its-fact-sheet/story-bOlRLPuMedqhs5vf4SEo2J.html
21-12-2020||India||Xi replaces PLA commander who started Ladakh standoff; fingers crossed in Delhi||Chinese President Xi Jinping has moved out General Zhao Zongqi, the People’s Liberation Army’s powerful Western Theatre Commander, seen as the man responsible for the seven-month long military standoff with India in eastern Ladakh, and replaced him with General Zhang Xudong, who has never served along the Indian border.The change of guard in the leadership of the Western Theatre Command has sparked hope in New Delhi that General Zhao’s replacement may not be as vitriolically anti-India. Gen Zhao, who had also engineered the 2017 Doklam conflict with India, has been seen as a hardliner against India and Bhutan.This is the first time that an officer appointed to lead the Western Theatre Command does not have experience of serving on the Indian border. General Zhang is 58, much younger to Zhao, who reached the retirement age of 65 in the summer this year “The tone and demeanour of the PLA commander during the next military commanders’ meeting would throw some light on the complex undercurrents in the PLA,” an Indian military commander said, requesting anonymity.Also Read: Pushed over the edge, PM Oli drops a bombshell on rivals that also hurts China“We are keeping our fingers crossed,” said the officer cited above, adding that the Indian side expected some clarity when army commanders from the two countries hold the next round of talks over the standoff in the eastern Ladakh sector.China watchers said there was no information to indicate that General Zhang, unlike his predecessor, had any political ambitions and was expected to take decisions on professional merits. In Indian military circles, Gen Zhao, who was a member of the communist party’s central committee, was perceived to be angling for a seat on the Central Military Commission that would have allowed him to serve till he turns 72.Gen Zhao, who took over the Western Theatre Command in 2016, was already on an extended term. He had reached the retirement age of 65 this summer but had been allowed to continue in the post by President Xi.New Delhi’s assessment is that Gen Zhao had the approval of the Xi-led Central Military Commission when PLA troops carried out the initial incursion in the Finger area near Pangong Tso in late April and early May. But there was some discomfort over the misadventure after the bloody Galwan Valley clash in June, the deadliest clash between soldiers of the two countries since 1975, in which 20 Indian troops and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers were killed.Over the next few weeks and months, the initial tactical success met with a stiff Indian response, including consolidation of the heights on the south bank of the salt-water lake resulting in a strategic loss to China.Also Read: China’s new road cuts travel time to Karakoram Pass, raises red flags in DelhiIndian officials said there has been no confirmation if General Zhao was still resisting possible directions from the communist party leadership to soften his position, disengage and de-escalate. But there have been gaps, an official said, in the line adopted by China during the diplomatic talks and the military negotiations.Born in the coastal province of Liaoning, Gen Zhang is a Han and has served in the erstwhile Shenyang Military Region in northeast China. He was the Chief of Staff of the 39th Army of the PLA. From March 2017 to January 2018, Zhang was the deputy commander of the Central Theatre Command (CTC) which is responsible for the security of the Chinese capital Beijing.At the military parade to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of China in 2019, Zhang acted as deputy commander of the Joint Military Parade, which was widely appreciated within the central military commission. Zhang, who has been transferred to Chengdu as Western Theatre Commander, is not a member of the central committee or the National People’s Congress. He does not have any ‘political’ exposure’ unlike his predecessor and no known political ambitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/xi-replaces-pla-commander-who-started-ladakh-standoff-fingers-crossed-in-delhi/story-p1T4Dsj13J5yBf3SnWkKvI.html
21-12-2020||India||India, Vietnam likely to sign key pacts at summit today||New Delhi India and Vietnam are expected to sign agreements in defence, energy and development projects and take forward an arrangement to supply high speed patrol vessels to the Southeast Asian nation during a virtual summit on Monday. The virtual meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc will cap a string of high-level exchanges between the two sides this year.The meeting is being held at a time when countries are grappling with China’s aggressive actions in the region. India is locked in a military standoff with China in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) while Vietnam has major differences over Chinese claims within its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. The two leaders will discuss bilateral, regional and global issues and are expected to issue a “joint vision” to guide the development of the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. “A number of agreements and announcements are likely, covering areas such as defence, energy, development partnership and healthcare,” one of the people cited above said.The implementation of India’s $100-million defence line of credit for 12 high speed patrol boats for Vietnam will be further progressed, and new opportunities in renewable energy cooperation will be explored, the person said.The patrol boats being built for the Vietnam Border Guard are meant to enhance coastal security and prevent illegal activities. Five vessels are being built at Larsen & Toubro’s shipyard in Chennai, and the rest will be made at Hong Ha shipyard in the Vietnamese port city of Hai Phong under the Indian firm’s supervision.India has offered another defence line of credit of $500 million to Vietnam. The two countries upgraded their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership four years ago. India is one of the few countries with which Vietnam has such a partnership.There were several high-level visits from the Vietnamese side despite the Covid-19 pandemic and the country’s vice president travelled to India in February. The two prime ministers met online during the Asean-India Summit last month.The bilateral summit on Monday is also expected to focus on India’s development and capacity building assistance through initiatives such as the quick impact projects, Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) initiatives, projects in water resource management in Vietnam’s Mekong delta, digital connectivity and heritage conservation. The two sides will exchange views on the global pandemic and their respective strategies to deal with Covid-19 and post-pandemic economic recovery. “The existing economic and trade linkages between the two sides provide a useful platform to explore new and resilient supply chains,” the person cited above said.Both countries also have stakes in the Indo-Pacific region and significant maritime interests, and the summit will enable them to look at potential cooperation on India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and Asean’s Indo-Pacific outlook.India and Vietnam will also concurrently serve as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council from 2021, and this opens up new opportunities for cooperation and coordination on regional and international issues, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-vietnam-likely-to-sign-key-pacts-at-summit-today/story-KWsJ8RS7Mso82Qi9n4FFlN.html

World Health Organization’s (WHO) India representative Dr Roderico H Ofrin, who is also a member of the JMG, is likely to participate in the meeting, according to news agency PTI.Over 16 million Britons will be required to stay home for Christmas after Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was adamant until Friday that close households would be able to mix over the festive period, made a U-turn and cancelled plans to allow families to see each other. As new restrictions came into force in London after the government warned of the new strain, several European Union nations banned flights from the UK on Sunday.While the Netherlands announced a ban on all UK passenger flights, Belgium issued a flight ban for 24 hours and also halted train links to Britain.France suspended all travel links with the UK for 48 hours from midnight on Sunday and all flights coming from the country were banned in Ireland for a period of 48 hours. According to BBC, Italy blocked all flights from the UK till January 6. Germany, Kuwait, Israel and Austria have also imposed similar restrictions.Meanwhile, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that the preventive measures could stay in place until the virus vaccine is fully rolled out. “We acted very quickly and decisively,” he said. “All of the different measures we have in place, we need more of them to control the spread of the new variant than we did to control the spread of the old variant,” he added.The JMG, which was formed by the government to review the global and Indian situation after the outbreak of the virus, and provide recommendations on technical matters to the health ministry, will discuss the issue of the mutated variant of the coronavirus reported from the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-meeting-today-after-spread-of-mutant-coronavirus-strain-in-uk/story-02g2HCuHPTyirUnVr536yK.html
21-12-2020||India||Shaktisinh Gohil wants Cong to relieve him of duties in Bihar, Delhi||All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of Bihar and Delhi Shaktisinh Gohil has requested the party leadership to relieve him of all organisational responsibilities on health grounds, people familiar with the development said. Gohil, 60, had tested positive for Covid-19 on November 6 in the midst of Bihar assembly elections. On December 3, the senior Congress leader announced on social media that he was being treated for post-Covid complications. He tweeted: “I was #COVID19 positive & now under strict medical supervision for post Covid complications. Due to lung infection, I have been medically advised not to talk or meet visitors. Recovery may take time. Thank you for your good wishes & concern. See you all once I’m fine!” A Congress functionary said Gohil, also a Rajya Sabha member, has requested the party high command to relieve him of organisational responsibilities until his health condition improves. Gohil, along with Gujarat in-charge Rajeev Satav, had on November 17 offered his resignations to a special panel formed in August o assist Congress president Sonia Gandhi on organisational matters. They offered their resignations, taking responsibility for the party’s poll debacle in their respective states. While the Congress won just 19 of the 70 seats it contested in Bihar, hurting the chances of the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led ‘mahagathbandhan’ (grand alliance) ousting the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, the party failed to win any of the by-elections in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Manipur, Nagaland, Odisha and Telangana. The losses triggered a war of words within the Congress with senior leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Kapil Sibal, two of the 23 signatories to a letter to the Congress president in August seeking internal elections and an organisational overhaul, questioning the leadership on the poll debacle. While Sibal asked if the poll setbacks were “business as usual”, Azad claimed that a “five-star culture” had gripped the Congress and its structure had collapsed. The two were confronted by Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Other leaders claimed that their remarks had “hurt the sentiments” of Congress workers and reminded them that the party had been through a crises several times in the past. In the November 17 meeting, the special committee members told both Gohil and Satav that the panel was not the right forum to offer their resignations and that they do not have the mandate to accept or reject their offers to give up their posts. Instead, the committee told them that they should identify the reasons for the party’s poor show in their respective states and submit a detailed report. A second Congress functionary said Gohil had been completely sidelined in the Bihar elections after the party leadership handed over the election management to a new central team, led by general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala. Soon after its list of candidates was released, the Congress had deployed a central team to quell a rebellion triggered by the selection of “tainted” leaders and also to oversee the party’s poll preparations and campaign. This was perhaps the first time that the AICC, the party’s central unit, had taken complete charge of the poll management and preparations during any state election. The second functionary quoted above claimed Gohil’s request to the Congress high command seemed to be in response to him being sidelined in the Bihar elections. When contacted, Gohil said it was an internal matter between him and the party. “I hope you will appreciate it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shaktisinh-gohil-wants-cong-to-relieve-him-of-duties-in-bihar-delhi/story-J9dVup6AViJf3PEh1am7MK.html
21-12-2020||India||Call on NDA, RLP break-up on Dec 26, says Hanuman Beniwal||After quitting all Lok Sabha panels in support of protesting farmers, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) chief Hanuman Beniwal, whose party is a part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will decide on December 26 whether to remain in the ruling coalition. At the same time, he will lead a march towards Delhi in protest against the three farm laws that were enacted by the NDA in September to open up agricultural trade. “I have never supported the farm bills…show me if there is any video. When the bills were introduced and passed in Parliament, I wasn’t there. I was not allowed because of a false Covid-19 report,” Beniwal, a poplar Jat leader, said on Sunday.On his resignation from three parliamentary committees, the MP from Nagaur said: “I have resigned in support of the farmers’ protest. I was part of the committee related to industries, had raised many issues -- from unemployment to industries sitting on land banks -- but no action was taken. “ He said he and Bharaqtiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Kailash Choudhary were attacked in Barmer over a year ago, but not even a first information report ( FIR) was lodged over the incident.“But when {the motorcade of } BJP national chief JP Nadda was attacked in West Bengal {on December 10}, Indian Police Service officers were immediately changed. People’s issues were not addressed in the committees. We were not going there to have tea-biscuit.’ The laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called “mandi system”, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, which earlier only government-approved agents could, and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers, however, are protesting against the reforms, saying they would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, under which the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed prices.On reconsidering ties with the NDA, Beniwal said: “I have resigned from three committees and will march to Delhi with over 100,000 farmers on December 26. At a meeting, which will be held on NH-8 in Shahjahanpur, the decision on the alliance with NDA will be taken. We have no issues with the Prime Minister, but with the three farm laws. Inflation is on the rise and people are suffering.” Hitting out at the Ashok Gehlot led government of Rajasthan, he said the bureaucracy was dominating decision-making in the state and the chief minister was busy in keeping Congress MLAs happy. After the farmers’ movement, RLP will organise a gherao of the state government to press its demands for free electricity and employment generation, he said. On his allegations of collusion between Gehlot and former CM and BJP leader Vasundhara Raje, he said: “It has been 22 years...No action has been taken by any of the governments on scams raised by Gehlot or Raje, but a challan has been issued in the cases against me. Gehlot didn’t take Raje’s bungalow and she supported him during the political crisis in July . Around a dozen officials have been running the government.” On Beniwal reconsidering ties with the NDA, BJP MLA and spokesperson Ram Lal Sharma said: “He can do whatever he likes.”He said Beniwal’s allegations of collusion between Gehlot and Raje were baseless: “He does politics looking to the situation and his thoughts have no stability. Earlier, he called the farm laws in public interest and now for political mileage is opposing them,” Sharma said. Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma also said Beniwal’s allegations of Gehlot and Raje colluding were baseless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/call-on-nda-rlp-break-up-on-dec-26-says-hanuman-beniwal/story-ruh9PWLIfV7a5W4FVgOXvO.html

According to a government official, the prime minister decided to pay a visit to the historic gurdwara, with no special security arrangements in place and no prior information to the Sikh shrine about his visit.“Today morning, in a sudden visit, Prime Minister Modi went and bowed his head at Gurdwara Rakab Ganj. He paid his tributes to Guru Teg Bahadur for his supreme sacrifice,” said the official, who didn’t want to be identified.Normally, a visit by the Prime Minister to any part of the Capital or the country entails a detailed security protocol.

21-12-2020||India||Bhartiya Kisan Union’s foreign funds under FCRA lens||The Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), the largest independent organisation behind the ongoing protests against the new farm legislation, said it has been asked by a central agency to submit its registration details which allow it to receive foreign funds. “BKU is being targeted by the central authorities for evoking a massive response from Indians and NRIs. What wrong is there if our supporters working as truck drivers or pursing other labour works send donations from overseas,” said union president Joginder Singh Ugrahan.BKU leadership said it has received an estimated Rs 8 lakh over the last two months but the donations from Indians and the diaspora have not been calculated separately. On December 6, BKU had issued a public appeal demanding financial resources ‘to pursue agitation’. The union wants donations to be transferred in the personal bank account of its general secretary of Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan. He confirmed that his bank account is not registered as per FCRA, and the forex department of Punjab and Sindh Bank has raised the objection over raising forex. The last date to get the bank account registered expired on Saturday.Experts say as the Ugrahan faction of BKU is, prima facie, not following the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, funds received by it from outside India are likely to be reverted to the respective account holders. Banking sector officials said, as per rules, an individual or an organisation cannot accept forex without prior registration with the Ministry of Home Affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhartiya-kisan-union-s-foreign-funds-under-fcra-lens/story-51LoCNO1647ADl0ax7WXPN.html
21-12-2020||India||Govt asks farmers to come for talks, spell out objections||Farm minister Narendra Singh Tomar has urged protesting farm unions to spell out their “apprehensions” about a set of agricultural laws in greater detail so that discussions could focus on specific objections, saying farmers’ grievances lacked “clarity”.The minister also said the farmers should give up a “yes or no answer” demand on scrapping the farm laws and only a discussion on specific issues can press the talks forward and end the agitation. Thousands of farmers have hunkered down at the Capital’s borders for nearly a month to protest the laws that they say will benefit only corporates. The minister urged farmers to specify a date soon for talks, but farm unions have shown no signs yet to resume negotiations with the government.Union home minister Amit Shah said that Tomar was likely to hold talks with the protesting groups in a day or two to discuss their demands. “I am not exactly aware of the timing but Tomar is likely to meet the representatives of farmers tomorrow or the day after to discuss their demands,” Shah told a press conference in West Bengal.Farmer unions have announced a day-long relay hunger strike on Monday at all protest sites to press for the repeal of the new laws.Also Read: Farmers to start relay hunger strike from today to mount pressure on govtOn Sunday, a senior bureaucrat of the agriculture ministry wrote a letter on behalf of the farm minister to Darshan Pal, a top leader of the farm unions. Pal had sent an email on December 16 to the agriculture minister, rejecting a set of “written proposals” of the government to solve the crisis.The government responded to Pal’s email on Sunday in which it said it wasn’t clear what the farmers were trying to say. “The reply sent by you through your email to us is very brief. It is unclear whether the views expressed in that mail are your personal opinion or the collective view of all the farm organisations,” the government’s letter, signed by joint secretary Vivek Agarwal, said. HT has reviewed a copy of the letter.The bureaucrat stated that the email “lacked clarity” on the grounds on which the farm unions had rejected the government’s written proposals. The letter to the farm leader said farm unions had repeatedly spurned conciliatory gestures of the government, including concrete offers.Thousands of farmers are protesting the three laws pushed by the government in September that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules. The agitation has thrown a political challenge to the Narendra Modi-led government.Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices.Also Read: A wall of requirements set up at Chilla protest siteThe farmers decided to call off further negotiations on December 8, after a meeting with Shah.The government on December 9 sent a set of written proposals to amend some provisions of the laws for greater oversight on deregulated markets, sparing farmers penalties for stubble burning, which causes pollution, and promising to keep providing farmers subsidised power instead of direct cash transfer.Pal, who heads the Krantikari Kisan Sangathan and is a key negotiator with the government, had summarily rejected the proposals, saying the unions won’t call off their agitation until the laws are fully repealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asks-farmers-to-come-for-talks-spell-out-objections/story-Oo4FXqtfEOhOJ2WpibvOVO.html
21-12-2020||India||West Bengal polls and the possible role of defections||On December 19, home minister Amit Shah inducted a host of political leaders from the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), the left parties and the Congress in West Bengal into the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The most prominent among them is Suvendu Adhikari, who used to be a minister in the current West Bengal government and comes from a politically influential family in the East Midnapore district. Adhikari, who has been a Lok Sabha MP in the past was elected as the AITC MLA of Nandigram – a place which is associated with the anti-land acquisition struggle which ultimately brought the end of the 34-year-old Left Front government in 2011 -- in the 2016 elections. In states where it is a challenger, the BJP has traditionally leveraged defections to its advantage. Here are four charts which explain this strategy and the possible churn it will bring to the state’s politics. To capture West Bengal, the BJP must win South Bengal Among the largest states, and most populated in the country, West Bengal has a very diverse landscape. The state can broadly be divided into five parts. The hill and foothill region comprising of Darjeeling, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri districts is a separate sub-region. Then there are the northern districts of Maldah, and North and South Dinajpur. Murshidabad and Birbhum, which are situated in the central region of the state, make up the third. The three districts of WestMidnapore, Purulia and Bankura are an extension of the Chotanagpur plateau and referred to as Jangalmahal. However, the biggest sub-region in the state is what is popularly referred to as south Bengal. This includes the greater Kolkata region. Because South Bengal is also the most densely populated region in the state, it holds the key to power. An HT analysis using Trivedi Centre for Political Data (TCPD) shows that the eight south Bengal districts out of the total 19 in this region, account for 57% of assembly constituencies (ACs) in the entire state.   !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Even in 2019, the BJP could not crack South-Bengal The BJP shocked the AITC by winning 18 out of the 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the 2019 elections in West Bengal. An AC-wise breakup puts the BJP and AITC tally at 121 and 164 respectively. The halfway mark in the West Bengal assembly is 147. While the BJP’s gains in the state between 2014 and 2019 have been stellar, the AITC has been able to hold it back in south and central Bengal, traditionally, strongholds of the latter. 67 of the 121 AC segments the BJP won in the 2019 Lok Sabha came from the 94 ACs in hills, north Bengal and the Jangalmahal sub-regions. Of the 33 and 167 ACs in central and south Bengal, the BJP could win only 6 and 48. The AITC, on the other hand won 119 out of the 167 ACs in South Bengal even in the 2019 elections. Just holding on to south Bengal will increase the AITC’s chances of remaining in power.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Tailwinds to the BJP from usurping the left’s support-base are perhaps exhausted West Bengal’s polity since 2014 has been a story of growing polarisation. With the Communist Party of India (Marxist) led Left Front continuously losing ground against the AITC in election after election, the BJP started positioning itself as the principal opposition party in the state. This was evident even before the 2019 Lok Sabha election results (https://bit.ly/3nCLHRs)The BJP’s rise in West Bengal can be divided into two phases. In the 2014 elections, it significantly increased its vote share, primarily at the cost of the left. In 2019, it consolidated these gains and made inroads into the AITC’s vote bank as well. Even though the AITC had a lead in terms of overall vote-share, it was significantly behind the BJP in the hills, north-Bengal and the Jangalmahal sub-regions. If one were to assume that what is left of the left in West Bengal is its ideologically committed core voter base, which will not do business with the BJP, then the only way for the BJP to improve its performance, especially in south Bengal is to break away a section of the AITC’s Hindu voters. Leaders such as Suvendu Adhikari are the best way to achieve this task.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();This strategy could trigger a huge communal polarisation in the state West Bengal has the largest share of Muslim population in India after Jammu and Kashmir and Assam. According to the 2011 census, Muslims accounted for 27% in the state’s population. The Muslim population is not uniformly distributed in the state. While there are very few Muslims in the hills and Jangalmahal regions, they are present in large numbers in north, south and central Bengal. The two Muslim majority districts – Murshidabad (66% Muslim population) and Maldah (51%) – are in the central and north Bengal regions, respectively. Nearly half (49.9%) of the population in Uttar Dinajpur in North Bengal also Muslim. The maximum Muslim population in any other district of the state is only 37%.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();This also means that the AITC’s current dominance in south and central Bengal is based on support from both Muslim and Hindus. As the BJP tries to wean away the Hindu faction of the AITC’s support base, even as Muslims gravitate towards the AITC in greater numbers – data from the CSDS-Lokniti post-poll survey shows that this process was already underway in West Bengal – the state could experience unprecedented communal polarisation, even violence. While political violence is a characteristic feature of the state, it has not taken a communal colour in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-polls-and-the-possible-role-of-defections/story-2NDBwrGLc4udHx5MIPoXjI.html
21-12-2020||India||Facebook restores Kisan Ekta Morcha page after massive outrage||Social networking website Facebook took down the page of Kisan Ekta Morcha for several hours on Sunday, sparking widespread criticism over what farmers said was an attempt to muzzle their voices.Kisan Ekta Morcha is a farmers’ collective and its Facebook page, less than five days old, had notched up 75,000 followers. The group collects and collates information from different farmers’ unions and posts them across social media. Its page was restored roughly three hours later, reports said. “Now this is #TooMuchDemocracy.

Subsequently, we started a live broadcast with {Swaraj India’s} Yogendra Yadav and in the middle of the broadcast, the page was taken down. ”According to Bhupendra Choudhary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, Haryana, the taking down of the Facebook page was “shameful”. “This is not the first time Facebook has done something that explicitly favours the government,” he said. After massive outrage, Facebook later restored the page. “As per our review, our automated systems found an increased activity on the Facebook page www.facebook.com/kisanektamorcha and flagged it as spam, which violates our Community Standards. We restored the page in less than 3 hours when we became aware of the context.

21-12-2020||India||Tablighi Jamaat: Supreme Court asks Centre to help 36 foreigners return home||The Supreme Court has asked the Central government to assist 36 foreigners in going back to their countries after they were exonerated of all charges of flouting Covid-19-related guidelines by participating in the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area. A bench, led by Justice AM Khanwilkar, took note of applications made by the foreigners during a hearing on Friday and asked a government-appointed nodal officer to facilitate their return. Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, appearing for the 36 foreign nationals from 14 countries, had put forth their pleas, pointing out that all these applicants were grateful to the top court for expediting their trial before a subordinate court. When Guruswamy sought the intervention of the bench for the smooth departure of these foreigners, the court said that it would implore the nodal officer to process this request. Also Read: Mumbai court acquits 20 foreign Tablighi Jamaat members, says prosecution had no evidence“They may make representation to the nodal officer for facilitating their return to home country which may be processed appropriately and in accordance with law,” said the bench, which also included Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari. The court, however, added that the direction to the nodal officer was independent of any decision to be taken by Delhi Police to challenge the acquittal. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta assured the bench that in case any foreign national who has been exonerated has any difficulty in travelling back, their lawyers may get in touch with his office for assistance.

The two slow-moving planets will be 0.1 degrees apart. Here is all you need to know about it:1. According to Nasa, the timing of the conjunction will be such that everyone will be able to view it.2. They will appear so close that a pinkie finger at arm’s length will easily cover both the planets in the sky.3. If one views through a telescope, Jupiter’s four large moons orbiting the planet can also be seen.4. It will be visible nearly an hour after sunset in the southwestern sky.5. In India, the conjunction is likely to be visible between 6.30pm and 7.30pm.Jupiter, Saturn merging in night sky, closest in centuries6. Nehru Planetarium in Delhi (https://nehruplanetarium.org/) has also opened registration for the viewing of the conjunction. Adhering to Covid-19 guidelines, it has started the skywatch from December 20 to avoid crowding, its website said. This will go on till December 22. In addition, there will be webcasting.Bengaluru’s Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium has said it will live stream the viewing of the great conjunction on YouTube and Facebook channel (https://www.taralaya.org/) if weather permits.7. Why is the conjunction being called Christmas star? Though the planets will be apart, they will appear as one big star, like what is believed to be Christmas star or the Star of Bethlehem, which appeared in the eastern sky when Jesus Christ was born. The Book of Matthew mentions this star which according to the Bible led the three wise men to Jerusalem. 8. The conjunction will also coincide with the December solstice, the shortest day of the year in the northern hemisphere and longest in the southern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jupiter-saturn-great-conjunction-on-december-21-how-to-watch-in-india/story-mNvFUT3vGLgUxs37V9MwkL.html
21-12-2020||Editorials||Nepal’s unconstitutional turn||To understand the scale of what has just happened in Nepal, and how unconsti-tutionally and undemocratically Prime Minister KP Oli has behaved, think of a hypothetical scenario from the India of 1950s. Imagine a new Constitution has just been promulgated with no provision for the prime minister to dissolve the Parliament at will; Sardar Patel is still alive and challenging Jawaharlal Nehru; Rajendra Prasad is the president but follows Nehru’s diktats; Nehru decides to dissolve Parliament soon after the first elections held under the Constitution after being reduced to a minority in his own party; the President accepts the decision; the Congress splits; all other political forces decide to wage a movement against Nehru; and elections cannot be held. India’s constitutional democracy, just years after its conception, falters. This is what has happened in Nepal. Mr Oli — facing an intense challenge from his own party — has decided to dissolve the Parliament in violation of constitutional provisions. President Bidya Devi Bhandari, a close associate of Mr Oli, has given her green signal. The State apparatus is under Mr Oli. But the entire political spectrum, civil society, and media is against this action. Mr Oli’s own Nepal Communist Party has decided to take disciplinary action against the PM and is on the verge of a formal split. There is a big difference in announcing and holding elections — and Nepali political history is replete with instances when the failure to hold polls has led to further instability — and it is unlikely that polls will indeed be held. Mr Oli thus is in control of the State, there is no Parliament, and the Opposition is preparing to go on the streets. All eyes are now on the Supreme Court which should, ideally, rule against Mr Oli’s decision since it lacks constitutional sanction. With this move, Mr Oli has destroyed his credentials and legacy — and even those who may have supported his belligerent nationalism against India have turned against him. It is a lesson that a chauvinist leader, who believes in ethnic supremacist politics and ultra nationalism, is also often undemocratic. Much against Chinese hopes, the Nepali communists will split — and this, frankly, is good for Nepali democracy. For India, it is important to read the situation right. It must not be seen as interventionist and let the domestic debate play out. But, at the same time, it must not be seen as backing Mr Oli — the recent rapprochement with him has led to doubts on the Nepali street — and stand up strongly for democratic principles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/nepal-s-unconstitutional-turn/story-adUZULN34lYJgnZNoeUWbI.html
21-12-2020||Editorials||The virus throws up a new challenge||Announcements from London over the weekend that a new significant mutation of the coronavirus had taken hold in some parts of the country led to a reaction similar to the one in the early days of the pandemic. This new variant had more mutations than seen in any one variant before, scientists said, and had spread rapidly in the country’s south-east as well as the capital. Some of the mutations were previously linked to stronger infectivity. These three factors were enough to force the Conservative party government of Boris Johnson to announce a new lockdown in many parts of the country.Within hours, thousands of people rushed to train stations to leave these regions before the restrictions came into force. Soon, several European countries, one by one, said they will not allow people who had been to the United Kingdom to enter. In many ways, this mirrored what happened in Wuhan at first, then China as a whole. Eventually, the virus spread over the world, which makes the reactions on Sunday by Denmark, Germany, Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria -- and on Monday by India -- understandable.But what happened at the beginning of the pandemic — the lockdowns, the travel bans and the inevitable outbreaks — is also a good reminder of the need to be pragmatic about any threat that there may be from the new mutation.For now, it is not know if this variant causes a more serious disease, or if it can elude the immunity built by vaccines. What has been seen, however, that it is hard to stop the Sars-Cov-2 with travel bans, especially one imposed weeks since a virus has been in circulation (as this new variant has). The need at present is to improve surveillance, understand the new threat better, and quickly make any clinical, behavioural or scientific research adjustments we need to make without panicking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-virus-throws-up-a-new-challenge/story-o6XdWkxzKiB8HHepZhZvNP.html
