31-12-2020||News||Pakistan’s relations with India remain stationary; with China it has consolidated; there is an uptick with the US||The cocktail that was mixed in Pakistan in 2020 has ingredients that have remained largely unchanged in recent history. Internally, the issues that predominated were, firstly civil military frictions which were reflected in increased inter-party feuding; second, extremism and terrorism; and finally, a gloomy economic forecast. Externally the areas of most significance included relations with Afghanistan, India, China, the United States (US), and the Gulf states. Interestingly, the pandemic, which has impacted Pakistan as it has other countries, was not a factor in this cocktail. Standing out among the numerous events that jostled for precedence domestically is former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s defiant roar against the military from his exile in London to a combined opposition conference in September. Referring to a “State above the State”, the Sharif crossed the invisible red line of Pakistan: That mainstream political leaders not criticise the military publicly. Nevertheless, Sharif’s charged rhetoric has given their new front, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), its cutting edge.It may well turn out that the PDM will pose a more formidable challenge for the military, the ruling party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and the others. The ruling party appears stable enough with the military firmly behind it, but clearly the opposition strategy is to continue to mount pressure. In many ways, it is ironic that the opposition is using much the same tactics that Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan used against Sharif’s government from 2014 onwards. The difference is, of course, the role of the military — it was then supportive of Khan in opposition; it now finds itself supporting his government against an opposition. Pakistan’s ongoing review in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) process meant its efforts to remove itself from the grey list or at least not get blacklisted saw greater urgency during the year. A number of United Nations-listed terrorists were thus convicted, including some high-profile names wanted for carrying out attacks in India. The list includes Hafiz Sayeed and Abdul Rahman Makki. The convictions were on account of terrorist financing rather than for actual involvement in acts of terrorism. In any case, the action taken possibly appeared too little and too late to have much impact — at least on opinion in India.Relations with India remained at their familiar same low plateau over the year interspersed by firefights on the Line of Control (LoC) in violation of the ceasefire, acrimonious exchanges bilaterally and in international platforms, and a frequently-charged rhetoric on Jammu and Kashmir from Pakistan’s military and political leadership. Missing, however, were the dramas of the super-charged military tensions of 2019. Missing also was any unusual step forward towards de-securitisation such as the opening of the Kartarpur Saheb corridor in November 2019.If relations with India then remained largely stationary, there was considerable change in other relationships. With China there appeared to be an even greater cementing and consolidation. A cluster of explanations arise here — the India-China tensions on account of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) stand-off in Ladakh and an emerging gulf in Pakistan’s relations with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates makes Pakistan’s fragile economy even more dependent on Chinese loans and aid. Possibly this change in equations with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states is the cause of greater worry for Pakistan. While there have been ups and downs in this relationship in the past, nevertheless during Nawaz Sharif’s tenure there was never much doubt about the basic texture and strength of the relationship. On the other hand, what has significantly changed for the better is the Pakistan-US relationship. The US Taliban Agreement of April 2020, the direct dialogue between the Taliban and the Afghan government all were the platforms on which the repair of US-Pakistan relations took place. In brief, the US rediscovered Pakistan’s utility in Afghanistan. That this happened within the tenure of the Trump presidency gave to many in Pakistan the hope that things will begin with the new Biden administration on a more stable note and move quickly in a positive direction.

The author, a deputy director in a think-tank linked to the Chinese intelligence, virtually endorsed Pakistan’s position on Kashmir and Article 370, by calling the Indian move “unilateral.”To their credit, Chinese embassy officials have no qualms in contradicting either the Indian media or the Indian government by ferociously defending political positions of Beijing, be it Tibet, Xinjiang, Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh or Ladakh. It was not so long ago that a Chinese diplomat publicly contradicted the then defence minister of India Pranab Mukherjee on the 1962 war at a Mumbai conference.In her statement on Wednesday, the Chinese Embassy official has quoted a 2003 bilateral document to remind Indian media that New Delhi had recognised the Tibet Autonomous Region as part of Chinese territory and decided not to allow Tibetans to engage in political activities against China. The quoted document is “Declaration on Principles for Relations and Comprehensive Cooperation between the Republic of India and the People’s Republic of China” signed on June 23, 2003.What the official missed was that just two paragraphs before the bilateral commitment on Tibet, the 2003 document refers to the boundary question. It said: The two agreed that pending an ultimate solution, they should work together to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas, reiterated their commitment to continue implementation of the agreements for this purpose, including clarification of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).” The pacts referred to in the text are the 1993 and 1996 agreements to maintain peace and tranquility and not unilaterally change the status of the LAC.The official had not just cherry-picked agreements, but also portions from the pact that she decided to quote. Because, as India has said on several occasions, the actions of China’s People’s Liberation Army in the East Ladakh sector starting from April-May this year have violated every agreement and commitment on border peace that the two countries have signed.This unilateral action has led to a military stand-off between the world’s largest, and second-largest army. Beijing has already admitted that it wants to impose the 1959 line on the 1597-kilometre long Ladakh border. This means that China will hold its ground on McMahon Line in Arunachal Pradesh.Apart from lecturing the Indian media on Tibet, the Chinese narrative spread through its social media influencers is that the Indian government has been taught a lesson in Ladakh for tilting towards the US in the context of Indo-Pacific and the QUAD security dialogue. Clearly Beijing wants India to be part of the group of south-east Asian countries that have fallen in line and come close to becoming a tributary state to the Middle Kingdom, which is rapidly trying to move towards its ambition to be centre of the globe.The fact is that since the establishment of PRC on October 1, 1949, the Chinese positions have been etched in stone vis-a-vis India and Beijing has not moved an inch to accommodate the Indian concerns. It expects India to be neutral, while Beijing runs roughshod over New Delhi in South Asia and beyond. The present communist regime wants India to continue with economic ties with China as usual even as it tries to push back the Indian Army along the LAC. Honouring written commitments is not a one-way street as the same 2003 document talks says “neither side shall use or threaten to use force against each other.”While a section of the Indian establishment is in favour of an early resolution of the Ladakh stand-off with even the Germany-led European Union recognising the rise of China, Beijing clearly wants a leg up on the LAC as this will be showcased as an achievement in the 2021 report card of the 100 years of Chinese Communist Party rule. Any Indian eagerness towards unjust resolution will be only interpreted as a sign of weakness in Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-china-s-advice-to-india-on-tibet-a-proclivity-to-cherry-pick-agreements-analysis/story-ivWZZOxt7OWe5YNsFcy1aL.html
31-12-2020||News||Women must be centre-stage in water and sanitation||In May 2014, India was shaken by the rapes of two adolescent girls in rural northwest India, when they were out in the evening to defecate in an open field. In a recent study in the Indian Journal of Gender Studies on Women’s Experiences of Defecating in the Open, one respondent said: Some men would hide and watch us defecating and then talk about it. This often put my husband to shame and even led to quarrels, with my husband scolding me for not remaining hidden. Fortunately, sanitation continues to be central to the government’s agenda. With the Covid-19 pandemic, it is recognised that by addressing sanitation and water issues, we improve hygiene, health, gender, and livelihoods. The Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0 (SBM) aims, among other things, to find solutions for sustained behaviour change, addressing women and their personal hygiene needs. There is a growing consensus now that whereas the statutory framework relating to sanitation is gender neutral in its approach, the policy framework does recognise gender-related issues. However, when it comes to implementation, it is evident that sanitation-related needs and vulnerabilities of women need to be better addressed. Examples such as women not being consulted in decisions taken on sanitation-related matters such as the building and use of toilets and failing to take into account the prevalent socio-cultural norms, which for generations have defined the status of women as one that needs to be protected from all forms of exposure, while, at the same time, forcing them to defecate in the open even if this is in groups, substantiate this contention. Nor should communication only focus on women, as if men could do whatever they liked; 100% open defecation free, cannot be achieved without men also being engaged.The famous promotional videos of SBM casting its celebrity ambassador, Vidya Balan portrayed a scene, where the protagonist asked a man on his wedding day whether he had a toilet at home, to which the answer was negative. This prompted the person to ask the bride to remove her veil explicitly giving a message that a man who lets his wife defecate in the open has no right to let his wife observe purdah. In other words, the man has to build a toilet to be able to enforce the purdah system. Later, the video was amended to “clean” the message — all communication needs to be re-checked through a gender lens. Several research studies have indicated that girls drop out of schools due to inadequate sanitary facilities being provided especially during their menstruation periods. Facilities need to be provided — and their awkwardness needs to be addressed too. Much work has been done to alter some of these norms and beliefs, with women clearly coming to the forefront to take charge of addressing their own needs, supported by various government schemes and non-governmental organisations. In Odisha, women and transgender Self-Help Groups (SHGs) have been engaged in the operation and maintenance of treatment facilities in eight cities; in Jharkhand, trained women masons built over 15 lakh toilets in one year, and the state was declared open defecation free (rural) much ahead of the national cut-off date of October 2, 2019. These examples are rapidly increasing throughout the country, with women being able to push through reforms that better their overall wellbeing either through the help of support groups or through community-led efforts. Water management, sanitary complexes that answer their needs, and a host of other requirements to help them in their daily lives are now being driven by them. The livelihood creation opportunities are immense whether from building the infrastructure, maintaining and operating the facilities or the communication programmes in communities — and women can play a part in all of these .The India Sanitation Coalition is committed to looking at these reforms through a gender lens to ensure unintended biases do not creep in. Policies on water and sanitation need to keep the needs of women centre-stage — indeed enable them to be agents of change.

31-12-2020||News||Mutant strains emphasise the need for strict controls||The Sars-CoV2 that causes Covid-19 in humans is a positive single-strand RNA virus that jumped species to humans in 2019. Mutations within RNA viruses, including those in coronaviruses, occur frequently because of the need for adaptation to the new host and for survivability. While a large majority of such mutations are generally neutral, others may either be advantageous or deleterious to the virus. Mutations that are highly deleterious get deleted rapidly from the population, while those that are only slightly deleterious may be retained, albeit transiently. The 21st century has already seen three coronaviruses, of which the Sars-CoV2 has shown higher transmissibility and infectivity due to an important mutation at position 614 of its genome whereby an amino acid (AA) aspartic acid changes to glycine at this position of the Spike protein of the virus (D614G). Amino acids are the structural units that combine to form proteins. The latter are recognised as antigens by the host, evoking specific immune responses. Recently, another mutation, namely N501Y, has been recorded in the United Kingdom (UK), leading to a change of AA asparagine to tyrosine at position 501 and linking it to further increased transmissibility. This has caused immense concern, especially at a time when the emergence of vaccines had brought cheer and hope for the humanity. The new UK strain designated as VUI2020/12/01 (variant under investigation, year 2020, month 12, variant type 01) has recorded over 20 mutations, mostly silent, causing no change in the protein. Biologically, mutations represent steps in virus evolution under selection pressure of the host immunity. Experts in evolutionary biology view these as a system evolved by the virus to escape immunity or to enhance transmissibility. As the virus replicates, mutations happen in its genes continually through a process called “antigenic drift”, causing minor changes in the surface protein. However, these small changes could accumulate over time, and result in newer viruses that could become antigenically different such that the existing antibodies mounted by the host immune system to the original virus fail to recognise and neutralise them. As of date, there is little information on the pathogenicity (ability to cause disease) and immunogenicity (ability to provoke immune response) of the new UK variant. The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) in UK has reviewed the new strain and found four interesting features. One, its growth rate is ~71% higher than other variants, and two, the R-value shows an absolute increase between 0.39 and 0.93. The R value represents reproduction number and indicates an average number of secondary infections caused by an infected case. Value >1 suggests transmission to a number of individuals and higher spread of the disease. Three, the cycle threshold or CT value in the RT-PCR test suggests a decrease of about 2 and, four, the viral load suggests 0.5 increase in median log10 in new 501Y strain as compared to the original 501N. However, despite higher transmissibility, the new strain has not shown severe complications. It is also unlikely that it won’t be responsive to the already developed coronavirus vaccines, although relevant data needs to be generated on that front. The important question is why and how do these mutations occur and whether there is a role for host immunity in driving them? More importantly, could antibody treatment or other therapies have an influence in the process? The preprint of a recently submitted paper to medRxiv portal by the group in Cambridge, UK, led by Dr Ravinder Gupta, has focused exactly on these issues. The study is based on a single case report of an immune-compromised individual with chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection, lasting over 100 days and treated with three units of convalescent plasma, two on day 65 and one on day 95 in an effort to neutralise the virus and treat the chronic infection. The virus was detectable in the patient in all nasal swab samples collected at least 23 times over a period of 101 days, despite the plasma therapy. The authors investigated the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and found important changes in its genome caused by two new mutations in the spike protein, one a deletion of AA Histidine and Valine at positions 69 and 70 and, two, one AA replacement at position 796 (D796H). The authors state that while the two mutations did not increase infectivity of the virus, these might have been responsible for decreased sensitivity of the patient to convalescent therapy. Being a single case report, the results of the study cannot be generalised. However, it raises the important issue of generation of “escape mutants” of the virus in patients with persistent infection. The virus escaped attack by neutralising antibodies present in the convalescent plasma. The important lesson is to perform careful monitoring of such newer strains both for their transmissibility and potential to evade vaccine-mediated immunity. The emergence of new mutants of the coronavirus further emphasises the need for observing infection-control practices even more strictly and until such time that herd immunity develops.

31-12-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal opposes proposed hike in power tariff||The Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal has opposed the 8% power tariff hike proposed by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). The members said that the hike in this time of crisis will bring industry and trade on the brink of closure. The members slammed the state government for not paying heed to the problems being faced by traders and demanded that this should not be allowed to happen. PSPCL has sought an 8% hike in tariff for the next fiscal in its annual revenue requirement (ARR) petition filed with the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC).State general secretary of the beopar mandal, Sunil Mehra, said, “PSPCL had sought a hike of 53 paisa per unit. From Rs 6.51 per unit, the cost will rise to Rs 7.04. The power tariff in Punjab is already high compared to its neighbouring states, and if the tariff is increased, it will not only affect trade but will also adversely affect the common man.” State secretary Mohinder Aggarwal and district president Arvinder Makkar said the state government had promised to provide power at a rate of Rs 5 per unit to the industry. But, rather than fulfilling the promise, the tariff is being increased almost every year, they said. The government has already increased the rates for six times in the past and over 30,000 industrial units have shifted to other states due to the wrong policies of the state government, they added. The members said that free power worth Rs 9,000 crore is being supplied to farmers and those with more than 10 acres of land should not benefit from this. They added that the matter will be discussed during the meeting of beopar mandal scheduled which will be held in Ludhiana on January 10. Earlier, industrial associations including Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO), United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) and Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association had also opposed the proposed hike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-pradesh-beopar-mandal-opposes-proposed-hike-in-power-tariff/story-UOz6bEAO9m7UIDMfN84mxN.html

31-12-2020||Chandigarh||Outgoing Ludhiana civil surgeon gears up for new innings||Dr Rajesh Bagga, whose term as civil surgeon ended on Thursday, is all geared up to begin the new chapter of his life. Instead of settling down in the big city after retirement, he has decided to work for the welfare of society in the small town of Dasuya.He said that the town has limited health care services, and being a paediatrician, he can contribute towards providing affordable medical services there.He was given a warm sendoff by police chief Rakesh Agrawal and deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma during a function held at the civil surgeon’s office here on Thursday.Dr Bagga’s tenure was scheduled to end in July, but was extended amid the Covid outbreak. Reflecting on 2020, he says the year will remain etched in his memory forever. “I am satisfied that I am leaving at a time when the vaccination process has begun,” he said.“No one had ever witnessed an emergency of this magnitude. Initially, nobody was equipped to handle such a situation. Every section of society was looking up at us. In fact, the situation in the district became so dire that Ludhiana was termed the Covid capital of the state.The most shocking situation we faced was when some private hospitals were closed down due to shortage of ventilators. I am indebted to doctors and the staff who came forward in the trying times for the safety people,” Dr Bagga added.It was during his tenure that the Ludhiana health department received a commendation letter from the state government for exceptional service in the time of the pandemic. He lauded the doctors, paramedical staff and Class- four employees for bravely fighting against the virus.“Naming anyone in particular will be unfair. For me, everyone is a hero. Right from the sweeper who mopped floors to maintain hygiene, to the nurses, epidemiologist and doctors who remain deployed in Covid wards and even got infected themselves. Even the mass media wing and the people attached to the sampling team have done a commendable job,” says Dr Bagga.While sharing his experience, Bagga said, “My biggest take away from the 32 years service is that we should stay disciplined, positive and keep working and not let negativity bother us.” “During my tenure, I have seen how the poor end up losing all their savings to get health care. Actually, quality health care does not reach these towns which results in rising child mortality. I believe that people like us can bring the change. I can use my experience and expertise to serve the poor and needy. I have already got through to a few NGOs and I hope we can contribute towards the welfare of society,” says Dr Bagga, after finishing his day in office, and bidding adieu to the industrial city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/outgoing-ludhiana-civil-surgeon-gears-up-for-new-innings/story-gYdKJkUJLFK9DhIdBrKDpM.html
31-12-2020||Gurugram||Union ministry extends deadline for complete digital switch of toll payments till February 15||In a major relief for commuters, the National Highways Authority of India(NHAI) has extended the deadline for complete digital transformation of toll payments till February 15. Earlier, the NHAI had mandated that all commuters will have to pay toll fees only through Fastags from January 1. Millennium City Expressway Private Limited(MCEPL), the concessionaire of Kherki Daula toll plaza, had started making preparations for the digital switch earlier this week. But it was soon observed that there are some technical issues that need to be resolved. Further, nearly 15 to 20 percent of commuters are still paying through cash at the toll plaza. As per the directions issued by union ministry of road transport and highways on Thursday, fee payments can be made via both Fastags and cash on the hybrid lanes of NHAI toll plazas till February 15.However, in Fastag lanes, no cash payments will be allowed, stated the order. Shashi Bhushan, project director, NHAI, confirmed that the deadline for digital payments has been extended but said that they are prepared for the switch as 80 to 85 percent of commuters on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway already pay via digital mode.“We were ready to go digital buy it is likely that some of the plazas in other parts of the country have still need to work in this regard,” he said. Bhushan also said that the “myFastag” mobile application can be used by commuters to.get real-time information about their cash balance. Meanwhile, the commuters heaved a sigh of relief on the extension of this deadline. They said that there are frequent traffic jams on the toll plaza when cash lanes are closed. “The earlier deadline would have led to chaos as almost 30 to 40 percent users still pay via cash. A lot of work still needs to be done before payments get fully digital,” said Imran Khan, a commuter, who regularly visits the Manesar industrial area crossing the Kherki Daula toll plaza. The toll plaza witnesses around 65,000 to 70,000 vehicles daily, said an official. It has 24 Fastag lanes and two cash lanes for the payment of toll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/union-ministry-extends-deadline-for-complete-digital-switch-of-toll-payments-till-february-15/story-u04GlHFrvMqRAPF47X8RSL.html
31-12-2020||Gurugram||Farmers to usher in New Year by holding a torch vigil||A group of young farmers camping at the Haryana-Rajasthan border at Jaisinghpur Khera in protest of the new farm laws said that they would usher in the New Year by holding a torch vigil on the night of December 31. Earlier in the day, some of the protesting farmers broke through the police barricades and entered Haryana even though the police attempted to stop them by force. Farmer leaders said that the agitation was continuing peacefully at the site and that protestors would ring in the New Year by holding a torch vigil at night. They have also requested the common people to join the farmers’ protests at various sites on January 1. “We will be conducting a torch vigil at night to welcome the New Year. Our resistance will continue in next year as well,” said Sanjay Madhav, a member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan. “Around 20-22 trolleys led by youngsters crossed the barricades today. There are five organisations at the Haryana-Rajasthan border, including us. We had requested them to join us in proceeding ahead but other organisations said that they would sit here for now. We will be holding a meeting with other members of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha to decide our next course of action,” said Ranjit Singh Raju, coordinator of Grameen Kisan Mazdoor Samiti — one of the farmers’ body under the Samyukta Kisan Morcha. He added that while their ultimate goal was to reach Delhi. However, a formal decision on any movement would be taken by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha. “We understand that our youngsters are driven by passion, and we recognise their efforts. We will discuss and take a decision on our next course of action tomorrow morning,” said Raju. He added that the police had placed the barricades back in place and one trolley was subjected to lathi (cane) charge. “There was no cane charge initially. However, later, one trolley got stuck and two or three people sitting on it were injured due to the use of force by the police. We condemn the use of force by the police,” said Raju. Amra Ram, the national vice president of All India Kisan Sabha and former CPI(M) MLA, said that the movement would continue under in the new year with new vigour. He said that with support pouring in from different quarters, the farmer’s movement had become countrywide. “We will celebrate the New Year here. We invite residents to join our protests. We will feed them whatever we eat. This is a historic and unprecedented movement,” said Ram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-to-usher-in-new-year-by-holding-a-torch-vigil/story-IXrqpZZ4MTBp6wZcvt45PO.html
31-12-2020||Gurugram||Cop, family booked for daughter-in-law’s death||A head constable of Gurugram Police, his wife and their son have been booked for allegedly murdering their daughter-in-law. The woman was poisoned to death in Palam Vihar, the police said.The family member of the woman who died alleged that the policeman had been sexually exploiting her and was threatened to withdraw a complaint she had filed. The woman was harassed and subjected to physical torture for several months, alleged her family members.The deceased was a native of Sirsa and had been staying with her husband and in-laws in Palam Vihar since 2013. On Wednesday, the family members of the woman received a call from her husband saying she was unwell and asking them to reach Gurugram.“Later, we received a call from a neighbour who told us about the torture she had faced. They heard her cries on Tuesday night, it seems she was beaten and suddenly, there was silence,” said the maternal uncle of the woman, who lodged a police complainant.He said when they reached the hospital, his niece’s in-laws told them that she had consumed poison and died.Indu Rajput, an activist of Raksha Saviour, said she received a call from the woman’s brother and when she reached the mortuary, the woman’s family had been forced leave the city with the body. “The police forced the family to leave the city with a body and till now, the police has not arrested anyone in this case,” said Rajput.Rajput said that according to the woman’s family, she was sexually assaulted by her father-in-law and forced to remain silent. Six months ago, the policeman had tried to rape her, when she raised the alarm and was rescued by her neighbours. “At that time, a case was filed at a women’s police station. The father-in-law (cop) had then apologised to everyone and pleaded to take back the case,” said Rajput, adding that family has given an application to the police seeking the addition of sections 325, 339, 354, 376, 304B, 506, 509, 34, 120B of the Indian Penal Code to the FIR. The family is demanding registration of an FIR under sections of rape and dowry death as well.On the basis of the complaint of the woman’s maternal uncle, the police have registered a case at Palam Vihar police station under sections 302 (murder), 328 (poisoning) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code against the woman’s husband and in-laws. “The family has levelled some allegations but till now, we have not received any evidence to support those allegations,” said Vikas Bhola, station house office (SHO) of Palam Vihar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cop-family-booked-for-daughter-in-law-s-death/story-4lMvmFsoyW77q99x3yVUaI.html
31-12-2020||Gurugram||Employee of finance agency booked for using offensive language over delayed repayment||The Gurugram Police have registered a case against an employee of a private finance company for allegedly using offensive language while speaking to a credit card defaulter.The police are yet to identify the suspect and are tracing his call detail records to establish if he had made similar calls to others.According to the police, Dr Vinita Singh, a resident of Sector 46, alleged that she received a call on December 10 from a man who introduced himself as an executive of a private loan company. Singh alleged that the caller threatened her for not paying her loan instalment, abused her and threatened her with dire consequences, said police.The police said that the employee of the company used offensive language while speaking on the phone to a customer, who, according to him, had defaulted on loan dues, a police officer said.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that surprisingly, the woman had not taken any loan from the company and even if she had, the company executives are not supposed to use foul language. “We have registered a case against the suspect and are verifying his credentials. We are conducting an inquiry in this case and appropriate action will be taken against him,” he said.A case under sections 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 506 (Criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the caller at Sector 50 police station on Wednesday, said police.Rao said many loan app companies have come under the scanner over allegations of harassment. In one instance, a man had committed suicide in Hyderabad a few days ago. These companies issue micro loans and ask for limited documentation, due to which people find it easier to access.“Now, people have started complaining against them as they start reaching out to contact numbers and inform them that the person has not repaid the loan and instalments,” he said.The Hyderabad Police had received similar complaints too and their investigation revealed there were around 30 such apps owned by four companies operating from Gurugram and Hyderabad, but registered in Jakarta, Indonesia. The police investigation revealed that often, users would unwittingly provide these companies access to contacts, pictures, location and the device memory, established as pre-conditions to use the app.Unfortunately, while installing the app, borrowers are not asked for their consent to access their contacts, which, some aggressive lenders, are now tapping to publicly humiliate borrowers, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/employee-of-finance-agency-booked-for-using-offensive-language-over-delayed-repayment/story-SWIunVjKche3zzH9fJaH7L.html
31-12-2020||Gurugram||Little progress by Haryana in reducing Yamuna pollution: NGT committee||The Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC), appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), in its recently submitted fifth report to the NGT, has described Haryana’s progress in reducing pollutants entering the Yamuna river as “negligible”. The Haryana government had, in September last year, set December 2020 as the deadline for upgrading sewage treatment infrastructure, in fulfilment of long-pending instructions from the NGT.However, random inspections of 24 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Panipat, Sonepat, Rohtak, Bahadurgarh, Gurugram, Faridabad, Yamunanagar and Palwal over the past three months have revealed operational deficiencies in at least 16 of them. These 16 plants have an operational capacity of 452 million litres a day (MLD), against Haryana’s total sewage generation of 1,164MLD. “The SOP prepared for operation and maintenance of STPs are not being followed... the compliance status given by the line departments were incorrect and the officers of HSPCB being the regulatory authority are not performing their duty assigned under the Provision of Water Act, 1974/EPA 1986,” the YMC committee report notes.The YMC also randomly inspected 12 common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) in these same districts and found none of them to be complying with pollution control norms. “Contrary to the claims of complying status by the Line Department, all these 12 Nos. of CETPs is found non-complying. The HSIIDC is constructing the CETPs without considering the effluent characteristics of the industries operating in the Industrial Estate,” the YMC has noted.“Our last review of the matter was in January 2020. Since then, only an additional 1.2 percent of Haryana’s total sewage per day is being diverted to treatment plants. So any benefit, if at all, is negligible,” said a member of the YMC, requesting anonymity.The official also pointed out that though STPs are being constructed in key areas, laying of sewer lines (particularly in Palwal, Rohtak, Karnal, Panipat and Faridabad) is progressing slowly. “This means that even if an STP is built, the sewage cannot reach the plant and is instead discharged into one of 11 major drains in Haryana that lead to the Yamuna. The BOD levels in all these drains were found to be in excess of permitted limits, and the latest available results were submitted to the NGT in June 2020,” the official added.Faridabad remains the biggest polluter of all monitored locations, as per the YMC’s findings, with not a single functional STP in place. In all, Faridabad was found to be discharging 210MLD of untreated sewage in the Guanchi and Budhia drains, which lead to the Yamuna. Of the 1,164MLD of sewage produced in Haryana, at least 500MLD is untreated, while a significant chunk of the remains is only partly treated due to operational deficiencies with STPs.While S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, could not be reached for comment on Thursday, a senior district-level official said that a detailed reply to the YMC’s report would be filed soon before the NGT.“As far as monitoring is concerned, we have already received orders from the head office to ensure stricter monitoring. It is up to various urban local bodies to ensure that their infrastructure — including STPs — are working. In all, Haryana remains a much smaller polluter than Delhi, which discharges nearly 3,000 MLD of untreated or partially treated sewage to the Yamuna directly,” the district official cited above said.Officials of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/little-progress-by-haryana-in-reducing-yamuna-pollution-ngt-committee/story-icTygwubhcZ0U9967pG7zM.html
31-12-2020||Gurugram||At least 32 returnees remain untraceable, police rope in cybercrime cell to trace locations||At least 32 returnees from the United Kingdom continue to remain untraceable as the health department increased its surveillance to identify cases infected with the new mutant strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus that appeared in the UK. The Gurugram police have deployed its cybercrime team to look into the matter. The police said that a three-member team from 40 police stations are conducting investigations based on technical surveillance to trace them. The missing travellers had shared phone numbers and addresses in the form during their arrival and in most of the cases, the mobile numbers are switched off, said police. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, Gurugram, said that untraceable contacts are being identified through their mobile phone records. “The cyber crime cell looks into the call records. Based on the maximum calls made to a particular number, we contact the person concerned and gathered details about the untraceable contacts,” said Rao. The police said that they have managed to trace 16 such returnees, who had gone missing after reaching India last week.The district has stepped up its efforts to trace returnees since December 7 and has made coronavirus test mandatory due to the new variant. Rao said the health department has provided all information to them, including phone numbers and addresses of people who are untraceable. “We are locating them and have assigned tasks to the team to do it within two days,” he said. The police are tracing all UK returnees who had landed at the Delhi international airport in the last three weeks and those who have travelled to Delhi from Bengaluru, Mumbai and Kolkata.Till now, the district health department has received a list of 722 travellers who arrived in Gurugram since December 8. Of these, 690 UK returnees have been traced, while 164 have moved to other countries or states, said officials. At least 370 who were subjected to a mandatory Covid-19 test have tested negative, except one 22-year-old man, who tested positive and the test results of genomic sequencing are awaited. The man returned to India on December 19 and tested positive on December 29. He has been isolating at a designated government facility. On Wednesday, two more Gurugram residents who tested Covid-19 positive at New Delhi airport on December 23 were confirmed positive for the new mutant strain. They are being treated at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital in New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/at-least-32-returnees-remain-untraceable-police-rope-in-cybercrime-cell-to-trace-locations/story-oLdQkb63abKSFdq2kjUAON.html
31-12-2020||Gurugram||Govt advises people to stay indoors, wear warm clothes as cold wave persists||Due to the prevailing cold wave conditions, the state government on Thursday issued an advisory, recommending people to stay indoors as much as possible and wear adequate clothing to prevent heat loss.The revenue and disaster management department issued the advisory, as Gurugram’s minimum temperature dipped to 4 degrees Celsius on Thursday, and the maximum temperature being recorded at 14.6 degrees Celsius. Both the readings were taken from the Palam observatory as the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) automatic weather station did not record the temperatures.Residents have been advised to eat healthy foods and drink non-alcoholic beverages to avoid dehydration. They have also been asked to ensure that they have access to emergency supplies in the likelihood of a power outage, track weather-related information via media and social media channels, and check on elderly neighbours who might be living alone.The Palam observatory, according to the MeT department officials, gives a fairly accurate reading of the city’s weather.Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely in isolated pockets of the city and parts of Haryana over the next 24 hours, after which the cold wave conditions are likely to abate from the region, the IMD said on Thursday.As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, light rain and thundershowers are likely on Friday. The maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 18 degrees Celsius and four degrees Celsius respectively, as per the IMD’s weekly forecast.Air quality in the city entered the very poor category of the air quality index (AQI) on Thursday, with an AQI value of 317 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin. This was up from 227 (indicating poor air) the previous day. Deterioration in pollution levels was witnessed across Delhi-NCR due to a continuing dip in temperature, with wind speeds falling and subsequently, allowing pollutants, especially particulate matter, to accumulate close to the surface.Manesar remained the least polluted among major NCR cities, and the only one to record poor air on Thursday, with an AQI of 252. Meanwhile, Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Greater Noida all recorded AQIs in the upper-end of the very poor category.As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality is likely to deteriorate but remain in the very poor category on 31.12.2020 and reach in the upper-end of very poor category on 01.01.2021 owing to extremely unfavourable ventilation conditions for dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to improve significantly on 02.01.2021 and reach the lower end of very poor category.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/govt-advises-people-to-stay-indoors-wear-warm-clothes-as-cold-wave-persists/story-GqNubAk07F2ROnMKiM3rFI.html
31-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra extends lockdown till January 31; 57 UK returnees test positive||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday extended the ongoing lockdown imposed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic till January 31. The state recorded 3,537 new cases, pushing the count to 1,928,603, while the toll reached 49,463 with 70 new casualties.As of Wednesday, 57 United Kingdom (UK) returnees tested positive for Covid-19, however, it is yet to be confirmed if any of them carry the new, more transmissible strain of Covid-19. Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar issued the notification extending the lockdown by a month. Although almost all restrictions imposed in the state under lockdown, which began from the third week of March this year, have been lifted, curbs on the reopening of private and government offices, swimming pools, and interstate activities are still in place. Local trains in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) are yet to begin operations for all commuters.The state government is yet to allow schools and colleges to reopen, while the ban on social, religious and political congregations continues with the extension.Maharashtra has been witnessing fewer than 5,000 Covid-19 cases for the past 26 consecutive days. During December 1-30, the state reported 117,155 cases, as against 139,425 and 286,566 reported in November and October in the corresponding period.“4,474 UK returnees who had landed between November 15 and December 23 have been traced till date. RT-PCR tests have been conducted on 2,917 of them to find 57 positive sample. Of them, 23 are from Mumbai, Pune (11), Thane (7), Nagpur (6) , 2 each from Nashik, Aurangabad, Raigad, Buldhana and one each from Nanded and Washim,” said state surveillance office Dr Pradip Awate.He said that 52 samples have been referred to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune to ascertain if they are infected with the new variant. The state has also traced 356 people who have come in contact with the UK returnees and 13 of them have tested positive for Covid-19, he added.State health minister Rajesh Tope said tracing international passengers coming from the specified countries was a challenge before the machinery. “Our department is writing to the police to trace such passengers who have given wrong addresses or not traceable. The exercise has been undertaken in public interest and all returnees will be traced for their swabs at any cost,” he said.Tope said of the positive reports of the international passenger, no one has found with the new variant. Health experts have cautioned people to be cautious against the backdrop of the emergence of new variant. Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health expert said, “Though the new variant is yet to make its entry in the state, mutants of coronavirus will keep coming and eventually it will turn into another influenza-like disease. Whatever reports about the new variant are coming are observational and not based on proper studies. Here, it will take a month to prove its virulence.”He said that the situation in the state is looking similar to what has happened before Diwali. “People are venturing out in big numbers to celebrate the New Year. The government has sensitised everyone and now it is the responsibility of each and every individual to save themselves and save others as well by bringing back self-discipline and following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. If we don’t follow the rules, the situation may change once again,” Dr Pattiwar said.Mumbai has clocked 714 cases on Wednesday, taking the count to 292,722. Of them, active cases are 9,049. There were 13 deaths reported and the toll in the city has reached 11,107.The government had imposed a seven-hour night curfew from December 22 till January 5 and urged citizens to stay at home while welcoming the new year on December 31. It has also advised people to avoid crowding in public places, especially on seashores, in gardens and on roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-extends-lockdown-till-january-31-57-uk-returnees-test-positive/story-OjWHu1DxORwCbirJXIWn8K.html
31-12-2020||City||ED being weaponised by BJP to hound political opponents: Mehbooba Mufti||People’s Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti on Thursday accused the Union government of misusing the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for hounding “political opponents”.Mufti shared her letter to the ED director after she said that several people from Kashmir who are related to her have been summoned by the investigating agency.“The only common thread connecting these persons appears to be that they are all acquainted with me, my family, or my politics in one way or another. The questioning of these persons is also focused on myself, my personal, political and financial affairs, my late father’s grave and memorial, my sister’s finances, home constructions, my brother’s finances and personal affairs, etc,” the letter said.She stated that PDP leader Waheed Para was arrested by the NIA in what she said was a “non-existent case” around the dates of elections.She said that she was ready to face any questioning but demanded fairness of the process.“The use of the ED against political opponents is not an unknown device for a party in power at the Centre. I wish to notify you that as a responsible citizen and politician…I am ready and willing to face any questioning by any agency. But I will insist upon the legitimacy of the process,” she said.She demanded that any questioning of her or her family members or their devices should be done under an impartial judicial authority.“If there is any breach of what I consider to be norms of law, good conduct, and constitutionalism, I shall not hesitate to take the matter up legally and politically,” she added in the letter to the ED director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ed-being-weaponised-by-bjp-to-hound-political-opponents-mehbooba-mufti/story-EM3IVcYq7AwN5KcxISW95I.html
31-12-2020||City||Pulwama shuts down in protest against Srinagar encounter||Normal life was crippled in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district as shops were closed in protest against the killings of three youth in an encounter with security forces in Srinagar on Wednesday.The authorities suspended mobile internet in the two districts to prevent any law and order situation.Three youths identified as Zubair Ahmad of Turkawangam in Shopian, Ajaz Maqbool and Athar Mushtaq, of Putrigam in Pulwama were killed in Srinagar in the early hours of Wednesday in an “encounter”, with the Army and police claiming that they were terrorists planning a big strike along the Srinagar-Baramulla highway.However, their families have rebutted the claim of security forces and said that they were civilians.A letter by Aijaz’s family seeking his body and an inquiry into his death written to lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha was shared by People’s Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti on Twitter.“The deceased was not remotely connected with any anti-national activities and the question of joining militancy does not arise. The killing is very brutal and calculated one which is against the law of land and also hits the democracy and Indian Constitution,” the letter said.The police have said that the trio was not mentioned in their list of terrorists, yet two of them are “hardcore associates of terrorists (OGWs)”.“Pertinently, one of the two killed youths is a relative of top HM commander Rayees Kachroo who was killed in 2017. Reportedly, the third might have joined militancy very recently. Generally, parents don’t have an idea about the activities of their wards. Several overground workers after committing terror crimes don’t disclose it to their family,” police said in a statement.Residents of Pulwama said that the shops were closed in the main town against the killings while the internet was suspended in both Pulwama and Shopian districts.PDP president meets families of youth killed in encounterMainstream political parties and leaders of Kashmir have also raised questions over the encounter.“Met families of the young men killed in the Lawaypora encounter. Forget justice, even their bodies are not being returned to them for the last rites. They have lost their beloved sons forever and in the midst of grief have to plead even for closure,” she said on Twitter.Her party said that the allegations of fake encounters are returning in the Valley and wanted a time-bound inquiry. “Once again the allegations of a dark era of staged encounters like the ‘90s are back in vogue. An unprecedented level of insecurity has gripped the people of Kashmir. The administration should take serious cognizance of allegations and swiftly order a time-bound inquiry,” the party said in a statement.CPI(M) leader MY Tarigami wanted a probe by a sitting judge. “There are unverified reports that they were killed in a fake encounter. If true, this is shocking and must be probed by a sitting high court judge. The circumstances in which the killings happened need to be thoroughly probed,” he said.Apni Party president Syed Altaf Bukhari also expressed concern stating that the claims by families have created misgivings about the veracity of the Srinagar encounter.“The version of families of the slain trio is contradictory to what the army and the police claim about the Hokersar encounter. So, the government must clear the air and remove the misgivings about the same,” he told a local news agency.Separatist Hurriyat Conference led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said that such killings are heart-wrenching ad demanded a probe into the killings. “Such incidents warrant a fair and impartial probe be held, as the families of the killed youth are demanding, to get to the truth but in Kashmir, this basic right to justice and redressal is a distant dream,” the party said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pulwama-shuts-down-in-protest-against-srinagar-encounter/story-mjcbsRmUVsC5ATSqQBkyxM.html

31-12-2020||Pune||As Covid cases drop, more beds lie vacant in Pune hospitals||Pune: Hospitals are seeing more vacant beds with the city reporting less number of Covid-19 critical patients. Many city doctors have observed that the second wave is highly unlikely with vaccination around the corner and the positivity rate less than 10 per cent for coronavirus.According to Pune Municipal Corporation’s updated data, total beds available in are 5,314 of which occupied are 1,529 and vacant 3,785, as on December 15.Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant chief of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, “Covid critical patients have significantly reduced. Hence, jumbo hospitals and Covid care centres (CCC) are not taking any more patients. If the need arises, the administration will reconsider jumbo hospitals.” On Wednesday, PMC decided not to admit new patients in the jumbo facility at College of Engineering, Pune. The civic body decided to divert fresh patients to Sassoon General Hospital and another facility in Baner while a decision on temporarily closing down the jumbo hospital will be taken once the existing patients here are recovered, according to PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agrawal. HT had reported that PMC was asked by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to assess the utility of jumbo facility, which originally had capacity of 800 beds. The facility came up in August by spending over Rs 100 crores though it was embroiled in controversies. Dr Prachee Sathe, director, intensive care unit (ICU), Ruby Hall Clinic said that there are less critical patients for Covid these days.“One of the primary reasons is that many patients seek early medical treatment and recover. Early treatment helps patients to not go into critical mode. We have observed that patients from outside Pune are on the rise. Earlier, we had patients from Pune,” said Sathe.Speaking about the decrease in patients, Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said that there are only 120 patients in their hospital as compared to 440 Covid patients in September.“Of 120, only 11 are in ICU whereas in September, during the peak of Covid, there were 43 patients in ICU. There has been a 25 per cent reduction in critical patients in the hospital,” said Dr Kelkar.He said that there may be an increase in Covid patients in July again. “We are hopeful that by that time vaccines will be out and those who are at high risk will be safe,” said Dr Kelkar.Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA) Maharashtra state, said that as the cases have reduced, the government should part with the acquired beds at certain hospitals for Covid patients.“The chances of the second wave are low and vaccinations are just around the corner. In this case, a lot of non-Covid patients cannot be referred to good hospitals as the number of beds for non-Covid patients is limited. Hence, the government should let go of these acquired beds which will give a relief to patients and small hospitals not just in Pune but across Maharashtra,” Bhondwe said.

The staff from education department had released salaries to 18 retired primary teachers of municipal-run schools in June 2020, a senior PMC officer said.

31-12-2020||Pune||Taste of life: Cookbooks, the recipes for cultural revolution||A nine-year-old girl was married off to a 20-year-old man in Madurai. A day after the girl set foot in her new home, her father-in-law asked her to take care of the lunch. The poor girl did not know how to cook. Do you know, why? She was busy attending school. The father-in-law beat the girl. So, if you don’t want your daughter to get beaten, make sure she reads and learns how to cook with the help of this book”. Kasiviswanath Mudliar wrote this in the preface of his Tamil cookbook ‘Pakasastram’ in 1867. Most Indian cookery writers in the late 19th and early 20th century expressed similar sentiments while introducing their cookbooks. Women started stepping out to go to school and college. They were working as teachers or clerks. And that made them forget how to cook, according to the authors. The men were unhappy and hungry, and to salvage their marriages and help their country prosper, they had to cook with the help of cookbooks, they wrote. Cookbooks are more than a combination of recipes; they are cultural and socio-political documents in which authors imprint their identity and ideology. They reflect how their authors understood society and culture as well as individual identity. They transmit knowledge, and a recipe functions as part of a permanent record rather than as oral tradition passed from chef to apprentice. A cookbook can be viewed as autobiographical, that is, the recipes can be examined for insights into food preference. It can be seen as prescriptive of their ideals and aspirations. The historical value of a cookbook lies also in the prefaces, acknowledgements, other notices and notes that accompany recipes. These supplementary notations offer more than glimpses of meal planning and recipes. They inform us of processes in which dishes were hybridised and emerged as part and parcel of the cuisine. Indian, British and Anglo-Indian authors used their cookbooks to depict India in a way they might understand it, often encoding nationalist and revivalist agenda in the process. They mostly based their cookbooks around Domesticity, a Victorian construct, where the wife was supposed to cook and look after the house, while the husband earned a living. The gruhini (ideal housewife) was responsible for creating a pure and pristine (and nationalist) household, both for display and to help the men serve the nation. Cookbooks and household manuals provided instructions on how to manage the household, how to maintain cleanliness in the home, and above all, how to feed a family, and visiting guests. Mrs. Parvatibai, the author of the first Marathi non-vegetarian cookbook ‘Mamsapakanishpatti athava maams matsyadik prakar tayar karane’ (How to cook non vegetarian dishes) published in September 1883, too recommended her book to educated women, because she felt they did not know how to cook. But, her approach was more progressive than other cookbook writers. She was enthusiastic about women going to schools and learning how to read, write and knit. Parvatibai was the first Maharashtrian woman to write a cookbook. That she penned non-vegetarian recipes is fascinating, given the taboo around eating meat in nineteenth century Pune. She lived in Pune. The book does not mention her surname or address. Shripatrao Kondajirao Yelwande published the book. He was a commission agent with his office near Belbaug chowk. In his short introduction, he stressed the need for more cookbooks written by women and blamed their laziness for not investing time in intellectual endeavors. He assured readers that Parvatibai belonged to a “noble, Hindu family”. The cookbook was printed on a lithographic press and was priced at six annas. It had 42 recipes and was divided into three parts. The first part described recipes using mutton, poultry and eggs; the second part had fish, while the last part had recipes with mutton and fish in Musalmani paddhati. The recipes were simple and rustic. At the beginning of each recipe, Parvatibai listed spices and condiments used. She did not use coconut, peanuts and sesame, but instead, used gram flour to thicken the gravy. The dishes mentioned in the book were served in upper-class, non-Brahmin households of 19th century Pune. They included mutton curry, meat rice, fried liver, prawns curry, fried crabs, egg saguti, seeg kebab, bakarkhani, shami kebab, kheema and egg curry. Some dishes like bombay duck curry and meat gravy (Parvatibai terms it as ras) had two alternate recipes. There were three recipes of Pulao – one without using mutton stock. Eating chicken was frowned upon in many Hindu households till the middle of 20th century. So, it’s not surprising that there were only two recipes which used chicken. The book ended with a list of almost 200 donors from all over Maharashtra (and Indore and Baroda) who pre-booked their copies and thus funded the publication. Some of them were students studying in a missionary school and some, sex-workers. Parvatibai’s instructions were precise. She did not tell her readers to rely on their own judgement while adding salt and coriander, and gave exact measurements (1 tola salt in most of the recipes). Her use of words like chakolya, guldhava (pink), nazar indicate she might have had some connection with the erstwhile Marathwadas. Parvatibai was humble. “The recipes I have included in my book are simple and not uncommon. I have not written this book to flaunt my writing ability. Nor do I want to earn money. I simply want to help women who do not know how to cook”, she wrote. Publishing a non-vegetarian cookbook in 19th century orthodox Pune was no mean feat. But, Parvatibai’s greater contribution is her short introduction where she applauded women who were learning something new. She did not look down upon women who could read and write. And this is a far greater achievement!Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast. He writes here on Pune’s food culture.

The state forest department in November deployed four teams on elephants to search the missing tigress.Puneet Tomar, the reserve’s deputy director, said the western part had two adult tigresses before a four-year-old radio-collared tigress was shifted there last week from the Corbett National Park. The radio-collared tigress’s locations can be traced. Tomar said the forest department is yet to confirm the location of one of the older tigresses.Also Read: Sariska Tiger Reserve revival: As villagers relocate, conditions improveTomar said they are working with nearby forest divisions of Dehradun and Haridwar as well as combing the Rajaji Tiger Reserve to trace the tigress. “We have fresh pug marks and scats samples.

We have already placed camera traps, and are conducting search operations to find the missing tigress.”The Rajaji reserve has 34 resident tigers, including 32 in its eastern part, as per the recent estimation. The reserve’s eastern and western parts are divided by a busy traffic corridor that makes it difficult for the tigers to move between the two parts.

31-12-2020||Pune||2020: Number of cybercrimes double in Pune, surpass criminal offences||The number of cybercrimes committed this year in Pune has doubled to 13,793 crimes from 7,795 in 2019, even surpassing criminal offences. And, with only a single police station to handle the cases, it’s a heavy strain on the city police. Also, the delay in response from social media companies affects investigations giving some leeway to the accused. The rising number of cases have been reported during the Covid-19 lockdown and post lockdown period during the last 11 months. Among the rising number of cybercrimes, online cybercrimes reported the largest number of incidents while crimes happening through social media platforms also formed a major chunk of crimes after online fraud. The statistics reveal that the serious crimes like murder, fights, armed thefts and house break-in incident were more in number, the previous year but cybercrimes have taken over in 2020. The serious crime incidents were at 5,265 incidents during 2020 when compared with 8,677 which show over a 20 per cent decline in the number of serious crimes in the city. The lone cybercrime police station at Shivajinagar has 60 staffers and finding it difficult to cater to the rising number of cybercrimes. The cyber police station investigates difficult nature of cybercrimes while other crimes are lodged at the police station and then forwarded to the police stations for further action. Currently, the cyber police station officials seem to be overburdened with the rising number of applications. Meanwhile, the Pune police have decided to add five additional cybercrime cells to probe different types of cybercrimes. One unit of the cell will deal with hacking cum data theft, including source code theft, credential theft, identify theft, “man in middle” scams, hacking of websites, hacking WhatApp and threatening and extortion. The second unit will handle online business frauds and cryptocurrency frauds. The third one will focus on cheating cases involving online job frauds, lottery frauds and mobile tower installation frauds while the fourth unit will probe cybercrime cases related to social media while the fifth unit will probe ATM card frauds like money transfer frauds using cloned cards, OTP share frauds, illegal online money transfer by hacking ATM card information and other monetary frauds. Additional commissioner Ashok Morale said, “The necessary steps are being taken to lodge and investigate all types of cybercrimes. We have been successful in refunding money to a large number of victims and citizens have reposed their confidence in the functioning of the cyber cell.” The cybercrime returned Rs 8 crore to as many as 551 victims of cyber-crime during the past six months. The victims who lost their money in different types of online cybercrimes had approached the cybercrime cell after which action was initiated and the money was returned. A senior official said, “Social media is highly abused as a platform where crimes are committed and delay in receiving a response from the internet and social media companies was a cause of concern as extended delay results in more time for the accused to misuse the social media platforms. The companies sometimes take two months to respond.” After sending repeated reminders to the service providers, the cyber sleuths either write to the nodal officers of the respective service providers or to the Computer Emergency Response Team, India (CERTI) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. However, their responses are not always met with. Noted criminal lawyer advocate Milind Pawar said, “There are different technical challenges before the cybercrime officials while dealing with service providers as their server locations are outside the country. The details sent by police must clearly define the sections and be precise about the data sought as data sharing laws are quite strict abroad and subject to a number of verifications.” Requests to service providerThe cybercrime cell had made 1,175 requests to 11 service providers in 2019 and of them 301 were rejected and 419 were provided while the rest remained unanswered till date. In 2020, 1,694 requests had been made. Of these 1,694 requests, 465 have been declined while 905 have been accepted and the rest remained unanswered till date. The most commonly targeted websites or apps for creating ‘fake profiles’ are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Preventive measures to secure from cyberattacks Block profiles from public searches and restrict who can find via online search; Limit what people can learn about you through searching on the internet, Log out after each session, Don’t share social media credentials, Don’t accept friend requests from unknown persons, Don’t click suspicious links, Keep privacy settings of your profile at the most restricted levels, Common crimes committed on social media, Online threats, Stalking, cyber bullying, hacking, fraud, buying Illegal Things and Vacation Robberies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/2020-number-of-cybercrimes-double-in-pune-surpass-criminal-offences/story-dalRzCTJ05eV90jNEPD9uL.html
31-12-2020||Environment||Delhi recorded second-lowest average minimum temperature in 15 years in December : IMD||The average minimum temperature in Delhi in December was the second-lowest in 15 years, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Data released by the IMD on Thursday showed that the mean minimum temperature (MMT) this December was 7.1 degrees Celsius. It was 7.6 degrees Celsius last year.The MMT for December in Delhi dipped below 7 degrees Celsius only once in the last 15 years, in 2018 when it was 6.7 degrees Celsius, it stated.The average MMT for December was 6 degrees Celsius in 2005 and 5.9 degrees Celsius in 1996, according to the IMD data.Delhi also recorded eight cold wave days this December. It had recorded an equal number of cold wave days in December 2018.The city had recorded nine cold wave days in 1965, the maximum so far, the IMD said.In the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave if the minimum temperature dips to 4 degrees Celsius.A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or lower and at least 4.5 notches below normal.According to Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, clear skies over Delhi-NCR, multiple western disturbances affecting the Himalayan region and the global impact of La Nina were the major reasons behind such low minimum temperatures.Delhi recorded “near-normal” minimum temperatures till December 12 as a result of clouds and rainfall in the plains under the influence of western disturbances affecting the region, he said.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.“After December 12, western disturbances mostly affected the western Himalayan region, leading to significant snowfall and rain over Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh,” Srivastava said.After the wind system withdraws, cold north-westerly winds blow from Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh to Delhi-NCR, bringing the minimum temperature down, he said.“Uplifted fog” over Punjab and Haryana made the winds even colder, he added.“Besides, the sky over Delhi-NCR remained clear on most days. The global factor of La Nina further contributed to the fall in temperatures,” Srivastava said.La Niña is characterised by below-normal sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near the equator, a result of shifting wind patterns in the atmosphere.It means colder-than-normal winter across the Northern Hemisphere and warmer-than-average temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/delhi-recorded-second-lowest-average-minimum-temperature-in-15-years-in-december-imd/story-i11xCmIS2giZr3n5R3ZqiJ.html
31-12-2020||Bangalore||Yediyurappa rubbishes leadership change rumors, says will complete his term as CM||Ruling out leadership change, Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Thursday asserted he will remain in the post for the remaining over two year period and complete the term, and there was no confusion regarding this within the ruling BJP.Suggesting that the last one year had been like a “trial by fire” for his administration with natural disasters and COVID pandemic, he said his government’s desire was to take Karnataka to the first place on the development map of the country, as he also referred to financial constraints faced by the state.“In the last one-and-half years of my administration even for a day I did not bother about it, I was focused on my work and development. These things have in no way impacted,” Yediyurappa said in response to a question on talks about leadership change and its impact on administration.Speaking to reporters here, he said, after BJP General Secretary in-charge of the state Arun Singh made it clear that there are no issues for the next two-and-half years and Yediyurappa will continue as Chief Minister, such questions do not arise at all.“There is no confusion among our ministers or legislators, also people. If there is confusion, it is among media friends. If you cooperate everything will be fine,” he said.There has been intense speculation in some quarters that the BJP high command is mulling leadership change in Karnataka in the days to come considering Yediyurappa’s age (77 years).Though the state BJP has rejected outright such speculation, it refuses to die down, with some within the party like senior MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal giving credence to it with their statements.Asked about BJP legislators making open statements and writing letters expressing disgruntlement, Yediyurappa said out of so many legislators one or two of them might have given certain statements.“..to address their concerns, I will be holding a division wise meeting with all our legislators,” he said.Referring to the impact of Covid on the state and its economy, the Chief Minister, who also handles the finance portfolio said, “we may face a fiscal setback of Rs 25,000 to 30,000 crore and we may have to face this problem in the next budget as well.” Despite this, efforts will be on placing emphasis on development of the state including the welfare of farmers, farm labourers, SC/ST community and backward communities, among others, he said.Noticing that his desire and dream was to take Karnataka to the first place in the development map of the country, Yediyurappa said all his cabinet collogues were collectively working towards achieving the goal.“It was a kind of trial by fire with drought, floods, Covid and all of this led to fiscal setback, but despite all this all efforts are on to fulfill promises made in the budget and I’m confident we will be successful in this,” he said.Stating that BJP is strengthening its base across the country including Karnataka, the Chief Minister claimed in the recent Gram Panchayat polls, for which counting took place on Wednesday, more than 60 per cent of BJP candidates won and created history.According to information, of 5,728 Gram Panchayats, BJP backed candidates have won in majority in around 3,800 panchayats, he said, as he gave credit to collective leadership for the achievement, while acknowledging efforts of district in-charge ministers, MLAs and party workers.Though the Gram Panchayat polls don’t take place on party symbols, all political parties had put in efforts to ensure that the candidate supported by them wins, so as to have their hold on grassroot level politics, which may prove advantageous for them in taluk or zilla panchayat and even assembly polls whenever it happens.Also citing BJP winning 12 out of 15 assembly seats that went for bypolls in December 2019 and the win in the Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Sira segments earlier this year, Yediyurappa said these results show that the party has made inroads to the stronghold of opposition parties.Highlighting his government’s management of Covid crisis while also supporting distressed communities, he said, it also ensured that development works continued despite the pandemic.“Our government has topped in attracting FDI even during Covid pandemic.As many as 95 proposals worth Rs 1.54 lakh crore have been received,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/yediyurappa-rubbishes-leadership-change-rumors-says-will-complete-his-term-as-cm/story-IcDTIJo2aiau2h86F1dD2I.html

31-12-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand Police book interfaith couple, cleric for conversion||Police in Dehradun have booked a Muslim man, his Hindu wife, a relative, and a cleric under the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act on the high court’s directions. The man’s uncle and a cleric are accused of helping the woman convert to Islam to marry the man without permission of the district authorities under the law that was passed in 2018. The law mandates a one-month notice in advance for interfaith marriages.The police booked the four on Tuesday following a probe into the matter as per the court orders. No arrest has been made so far in the case.Also Read: Madhya Pradesh okays ordinance on conversion, adulterationAnuj Kumar, the investigating officer, said he was ordered to investigate the matter about two weeks back. He said they found the couple first met during tuition classes in Rudraprayag district and later decided to get married in Dehradun. “...[the man] took her [the woman] to a cleric Mufti Salim Qazi for it in September. The Qazi, before carrying the Nikah [marriage] converted...[the woman] without any documents and gave her a Muslim name... [The couple] got married later with the help of his uncle, the another accused...,” said Kumar.Kumar said they found neither the couple nor the cleric informed the district magistrate one month prior to the inter-religious marriage with conversion as per the law.“Not only it was a violation of the Act, but the matter also seemed to be suspicious. Hence the four were booked under sections 3,8 and 12 of the Act which prohibits conversion from one religion to another religion by misrepresentation, force, fraud, undue influence, coercion, allurement, or marriage...”The couple moved the high court seeking police protection after getting married in September. The court heard the matter on October 1 and said the state counsel has pointed out the marriage was in violation of the law. “...prior to such conversion, an application has to be moved before the concerned District Magistrate, which has presently not been done.” The court directed police to provide necessary protection to the couple and ordered an inquiry into the matter. “...in the State of Uttarakhand, there is an Act known as Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018, under which it is the duty of the concerned Priest under sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018 to give prior intimation to the concerned District Magistrate, before this conversion or the marriage. Evidently this has not been done.”The court on December 17 cited the inquiry and added it has been apprised that there has “been a violation of the provisions of the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act”. It will hear the matter next on January 11.Inter-religious marriages have been in the news as other Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have enacted similar legislation to regulate them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-police-book-interfaith-couple-cleric-for-conversion/story-yPfzAP01pkxy2oNmLPHRdJ.html

31-12-2020||Mumbai||Alarm raised over systematic destruction of mangroves in Maharashtra for land grab||Environmentalists have raised concerns over the massive destruction of mangroves at Ulwe and Kharghar in Raigad district and Vashi in Thane district of Maharashtra. They have appealed to the Bombay high court appointed mangrove protection and conservation committee to intervene before the sea forests vanish. The development comes before the mangroves’ land gets transferred to the forest department.Navi Mumbai based environment protection organisation NatConnect Foundation alleged that the attempt to destroy the mangroves’ land appears to be systemic.“This appears to be a methodical, systematic conspiracy by the land grabbers to destroy the mangroves, dry up the area before the forest department steps in,” said B N Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation.“The act of destruction of mangroves appears to be picking up momentum as the Mangrove committee has given a final deadline to Mumbai, Thane and Raigad district collectors and CIDCO to transfer unreserved mangroves under their respective jurisdiction to the forest department, following NatConnect’s complaints,” Kumar said.While the Maharashtra government has notified 15,312 hectare (ha) as reserved forest under the Indian Forest Act (IFA), 1,500 ha is yet to be transferred by the revenue department to the forest department for better protection as per the directives of the Bombay high court in September 2018.Also Read: Green panel asks Maharashtra government to expedite transfer of mangrove landAdditionally, state agencies need to hand over approximately 2,000 ha of green land in their possession. With an idea to get undeclared mangroves under protection, agencies such as the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) have to demarcate, identify and transfer mangrove areas under their jurisdiction, first to the revenue department, which will then verify their submissions and transfer the areas to the forest department.Indicating illegal activities like dumping debris on mangroves’ land at a few other places of Navi Mumbai, like Ulwe sector 8, environment lover Rajini V said, “It is shocking as it is happening in (the) public view and no authority appears to bother.”Complaints of a large scale destruction of mangroves in a one kilometre stretch at Gavan and another in Kharkopar village have also been made by environment enthusiasts.Also Read: Mumbai’s Aarey flooded for the 1st time, walls blamed for choking floodplains“This demonstrates that there is no respect for either the law or the high court order as mangroves are being destroyed in village after village across Raigad district, environmentalist Nandakumar Pawar said.Activist Nareshchandra Singh urged Kharghar residents not to remain silent spectators to the destruction of mangroves in the area. CIDCO and Panvel Municipal Corporation have turned a blind eye to the land grab, alleged Singh.“We have made several complaints to all the concerned authorities who are sadly appearing to be unconcerned,” said another Kharghar activist Tarang Sarin.Belapur-based activists also alleged that intermittently, mangroves are being killed with the help of dry grass in the periphery of the under construction Navi Mumbai International Airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/alarm-raised-over-systematic-destruction-of-mangroves-in-maharashtra-for-land-grab/story-ADtbBsqEY8aHcUjyruEpML.html

31-12-2020||Lucknow||Cow commission wants research on cows in varsities, AU takes the lead||The Uttar Pradesh Gau Seva Aayog or the Cow Commission has appealed to the vice chancellors of universities in the State to establish a Kamdhenu Chair on their campuses to promote research and higher studies on indigenous cows. This appeal was issued after Allahabad university vice chancellor, professor Sangita Srivastava, recently proposed to establish the said Chair on the AU campus. “This will help increase awareness about the indigenous cow breeds among the students in rural areas. The move is also aimed at increasing income of farmers with help of products made of milk sourced from cows,” said Amit Kumar Gupta, additional statistical officer, UP Gau Seva Aayog. Shiv Om Gangwar, officer on special duty (OSD) with the commission, confirmed the development. The Aayog is headed by UP BJP veteran Shyam Nandan Singh. “This Chair would serve as a bridge between urban technological enhancements and proper care of our national treasure by disseminating the know-how to our rural folks, who really need the information and skills,” said Gangwar.Apart from the students, the initiative will help farmers develop new skills and technology-aided methods for rearing cows, resulting in greater production, said the Aayog official. “There is a need to educate the youth about the agricultural, health, social and environmental importance of indigenous breeds of cows”, he added. Allahabad university (AU) has sent a proposal for establishing the Kamdhenu Chair on its campus to the Union ministry of education for approval. The idea was mooted by AU vice-chancellor, professor Sangita Srivastava, after she attended a national webinar addressed by national Kamdhenu Commission Chairman Vallabhbhai Kathiria. It discussed setting up a Kamdhenu Peeth in universities in collaboration with the University Grants Commission (UGC), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and American Intercontinental University (AIU). Also Read: Cabinet nod to transport hub at Greater Noida“The research and knowledge transfer would be a boon for the cow population in rural areas of not only Prayagraj, but also of the neighbouring district,” said AU VC. An official with the Aayog said that a platform was needed for research and training on the science related to indigenous cows and the Indian education system.UGC was expected to give a grant of Rs 1.5 crore for establishing the Chair. Through this, efforts will be made to save old cows in rural areas. The volunteers/students will also provide fodder and medicines to the cows on a subsidized rate. Apart from this, the rate of milk will be determined in the interest of farmers. The conception of cows will be ensured free of cost. Earlier, the Aayog had written to the chief minister, his ministers as well as to the BJP lawmakers in Uttar Pradesh to help popularise cow-dung based products that include idols of Laxmi and Ganesha, which are worshipped on Diwali. The big promotion of diyas made up of cow dung took place just ahead of Diwali, with the Gau Seva Ayog’s plan to light one lakh such diyas at Lucknow’s Jhoole Lal Vatika on the banks of the Gomti river. A department at AU would be entrusted with the responsibility of running the activities under this Chair and the name of the department would be decided by AU administration in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/cow-service-commission-wants-research-on-cows-in-varsities-au-takes-the-lead/story-MTmRpDr6uInQpP9VxfGI9N.html
31-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt imposes night curbs for today, tomorrow to restrict New Year celebrations||The Delhi government has announced restrictions for Thursday and Friday, prohibiting the gathering of more than five persons in public places to ensure that New Year celebrations do not lead to a violation of Covid-19 regulations, especially at a time when a new variant of Covid-19 has raised concerns globally.The prohibition would apply from Thursday 11pm to Friday 6am and from Friday 11pm to Saturday 6am, said an order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) which HT has seen.

Eish Singhal, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi), under whose jurisdiction Connaught Place, India Gate and Delhi Zoo are, said that a police meeting on implementing the ‘night curfew’ order is scheduled for later in the day. “Since the order was passed only on Wednesday night, we’ll have to decide how to implement it.

31-12-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand submits plan to court for monitoring Gangotri glacier region||Uttarakhand government on Wednesday submitted an action taken report to the state high court, listing the steps it is planning to take for monitoring Gangotri glacier region at the mouth of the Gaumukh glacier, the origin of the river Ganga. The report also apprised the HC of the action taken against officials for non-compliance of July 2018 order, which directed the state government to report the status of Gangotri glacier once every three months. The matter was heard by division bench of acting chief justice Ravi Vijaykumar Malimath and justice Sharad Kumar Sharma. HT has a copy of the action taken report. In July 2018, the HC had directed the state government to rope in Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology to study the status of the artificial lake forming in the Gangotri glacier region at the mouth of the Gaumukh glacier, after every three months and present the reports to the court. Court gave the directions while responding to a PIL filed by Delhi-based Ajay Gautam in 2017. The action taken report said, “It would be appropriate for the Department of Disaster Management to nominate Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology as the nodal organisation to monitor inaccessible areas which are prone to similar disasters, using technical resources. Apart from monitoring the inaccessible regions of Uttarakhand, the institute shall also propose for responses in case disasters take place”. The report further recommends constitution of a high power committee comprising the secretaries of disaster management and information technology departments, inspector general of police of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), directors of Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology and of Indian Institute of Remote Sensing for an effective response to any natural disasters that may occur in the region.The state government informed the court that Piyoosh Rautela, executive director of Uttarakhand Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre has been suspended and three section officers have been granted 15 days time to submit their replies on the matter of the non-compliance with the court order.Also Read: Uttarakhand: Interfaith couple booked for religious conversion in violation of lawGautam’s PIL had pointed out that an artificial lake of 1500X250 metre had formed at the mouth of the Gaumukh glacier due to piling up of the nearly 30-metre-high debris at the mouth of the stream. “If it is not cleared in time, another Kedarnath-like disaster is waiting to happen,” the petition had said. Gautam said he had apprised court earlier this year that the compliance report, required to be filed after every three months, had not been filed. The formation of the artificial lake had come to light after a team of scientists from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, led by PS Negi, senior scientist, had visited the Gaumukh in July 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-submits-plan-to-court-for-monitoring-gangotri-glacier-region/story-2WRF0Q5V1jeIfYHTkHmflL.html
31-12-2020||City||Infighting, factionalism led to defeat for Congress in Panchkula MC elections||Factionalism and infighting have once again led the Congress party to admit defeat in a closely-contested election of the Panchkula municipal corporation (MC).Losing the mayoral race to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by a narrow margin, the Congress will sit in opposition with just seven seats in the House of 20.A stream of Congress leaders, unhappy with the distribution of tickets, had made a beeline to leave the party and join hands with the BJP. Ranjeeta Mehta, former Haryana Congress spokesperson and national coordinator for the All-India Mahila Congress, who was denied a mayoral ticket by the party, had switched over to the BJP on December 24.‘Old rivalries hard to forget’The directions from the state Congress leadership including state party president Kumari Selja were clear: stand united behind the candidates or face consequences. “As a result of the warning, different factions of the party presented a united front, albeit in public. But the old internecine rivalries are hard to forget especially when there is an opportunity to settle scores. That’s what happened behind the scenes during this election,” said a local party leader, requesting anonymity.There were instances when the fissures even came out into the open. “At least on two occasions, when state leadership came for campaigning, the mayoral candidate was ignored and not even invited to the public events,” said the leader.Party insiders also blame the legacy of Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia’s last term as mayor. “The residents were wary of history repeating again. Last time around, the city’s development had suffered immensely because of the tense relationship between her and the incumbent MLA Gian Chand Gupta,” said the party leader.With the winning margins as low as 49 in some wards, the presence of strong independent candidates also weakened the party’s prospects, some of whom were former Congress party members. “Omwati Punia who won as an independent candidate from ward 11 was formerly a Congress councillor,” said a former Congress councillor, who also didn’t get the party ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/infighting-factionalism-led-to-defeat-for-congress-in-panchkula-mc-elections/story-nDuYOmSE3hF6l7yO6izu6H.html

31-12-2020||Chandigarh||Sports gradation row: Vigilance probe ordered into issuance of grade-A certificate to IAS officer’s shooter son||A vigilance probe has been ordered by the Haryana government into the award of a grade-A sports gradation certificate to Vishwajeet Singh, son of Haryana IAS officer Jagdeep Singh that led to the former being selected in the Haryana Civil Services (HCS). Vishwajeet’s appointment to HCS has also been put on hold till the completion of vigilance inquiry. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has given his nod for an inquiry by a senior IPS officer of the state vigilance bureau, top officials said. ‘Father should have recused from grading son’ The grade-A sports gradation certificate which enabled Vishawajeet Singh, an international shooter, to qualify for the state civil services under the eligible sportspersons (ESP) category was awarded by his father himself as director, sports, the same day he got transferred. It was improper for Jagdeep not to recuse himself from grading his own son, said former principal secretary, sports and youth affairs, Ashok Khemka, in a letter written to the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC). ‘Tournament did not qualify for certificate’ The communication said Vishwajeet Singh’s declaration in his application that International Shooting Sports Federation (ISSF) was the organising authority of the ISSF Junior Cup 2014 tournament where he won a silver medal to qualify for ESP, was wrong. The organising authority instead is the German national shooting federation - Deutsche Schutzenbund eV (DSB), it said. Singh thus has wrongly shown ISSF as the organising authority in his application form so as to be considered against a tournament placed in a higher category. Also, the tournament did not qualify for sports gradation certificate issued to ESP for jobs under sports quota notified on May 25, 2018, the communication said. ‘His correct eligibility is a grade-B certificate’ Khemka’s communication also said that the silver medal won by Vishwajeet Singh at the Junior Cup did not qualify him for enhanced gradation available to medal winners. “Vishwajeet Singh scored 16th rank in 25 metre sport pistol men junior event. The medal was not given on a team game. It was based on team score obtained by aggregating the individual scores of three shooters (ranked 3rd, 15th and 16th) representing the country in the individual event,” the letter said. It further said the correct eligibility of Vishwajeet is a grade-B sports certificate in view of his participation in junior events in world championships at Granada in 2014. Top officials said that vigilance inquiry has been ordered on the basis of Khemka’s letter and the fact that the sports department could not ascertain the authenticity of the organising authority of the 2014 ISSF Junior Cup 2014 and the certificates issued to Vishwajeet Singh. Shooter petitions HC seeking appointment Meanwhile, Vishwajeet in a petition filed before the Punjab and Haryana High Court has argued that despite having been recommended by the HPSC for appointment to the post of HCS (executive) in the sports category, having been found medically fit and his character antecedents and supporting documents regarding sports achievements being verified, he has not been issued appointment letter. “The sports activities participated by Vishwajeet at different levels have duly been verified from the quarters concerned and found in order. Even the person who is lower in merit (though in sports category) has been given appointment, but the petitioner has not been issued appointment letter without any justified reason,” his counsel had told the bench of Justice Hari Pal Verma on September 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sports-gradation-row-vigilance-probe-ordered-into-issuance-of-grade-a-certificate-to-ias-officer-s-shooter-son/story-mfORnrrEMRxhYrldbl3QqK.html

Sorry for letting all of you down.”As per the information, he was a postgraduate. His father was an army officer and his mother ran an NGO for slum dwellers. Police department’s forensic expert Dr Saroj Dahiya said prima facie, it seemed that the man took the extreme step last afternoon or evening.“His parents said they had talked to him last time at 10.40pm on Tuesday.

31-12-2020||Chandigarh||Wife Shakti’s win may pump up Venod’s political fortune||A near decade long high till early 2014 followed by a period of wilderness. Venod Sharma, former Haryana minister and business tycoon was regarded as a spent force in state politics. However, Wednesday’s mayoral poll victory of his wife, Shakti Rani Sharma from Ambala could just be the spark that may breathe new life into Venod’s flagging political career. Shakti Rani Sharma who had got just 7,661 votes and finished a poor fifth when she contested her first election in 2014 from Kalka assembly constituency probably surprised everyone, including herself. Her comprehensive win by over 8,000 votes on Wednesday against the ruling BJP candidate is by no means a small achievement and has come as a shot in the arm for her husband’s plunging political stock. In fact, Venod himself lost in 2014 from the Ambala City assembly seat by over 23,000 votes. The duo had contested as candidates of their fledgling outfit Haryana Jan Chetna Party after Venod said goodbye to the Congress well before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. The party virtually folded up in 2019 assembly poll and Sharmas did not contest the assembly polls. A big beneficiary of nine years of Congress rule (2005-14) in Haryana, Venod Sharma, the clever political brain that he is, could see the decline of the grand old party coming. But his game plan of getting cosy with the BJP did not work out primarily due to stiff opposition by senior BJP leader, Sushma Swaraj. Venod, who was desperate to make a switch to the BJP or its erstwhile ally, Kuldeep Bishnoi’s now folded Haryana Janhit Congress, to guard his business interests was left high and dry after both BJP and Bishnoi cold shouldered him. His attempts to sing praises and back the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi too did not impress the saffron leadership. His friendship with the then chief minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, had earned him a cabinet berth in 2005 and top of the line portfolios such as excise and taxation, public works, power. Between 2005 and 2009, he registered a nine-time increase in his assets - from ₹9.3 crore in 2005 to about ₹86 crore in 2009, as per a comparison of his poll affidavits done by Association for Democratic Reforms. He was though forced to quit the Hooda cabinet in wake of allegations that he used his sway to influence witnesses in the Jessica Lal murder case in which his son Manu Sharma was the prime accused and was later sentenced to life imprisonment. Venod, as the president of Chandigarh unit of the Congress, had suffered a big political setback after his son was arrested for killing Jessica. His revival came due to his friendship with Hooda who ensured that he got a ticket from Ambala City seat in 2005. Shakti Rani’s mayoral poll win could probably be just the stimulus that the former Congressman needs to start afresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wife-shakti-s-win-may-pump-up-venod-s-political-fortune/story-yP50P7kvzqMRRf3G3xENxO.html
31-12-2020||City||Setback for BJP-JJP combine in Haryana mayoral polls||In a setback on Wednesday, the ruling BJP-JJP combine in Haryana could win only one of three mayoral seats for which elections were held recently. The mayoral elections in the cities of Ambala, Panchkula and Sonepat were held on Sunday. While the BJP struggled to win in Panchkula, the Congress and the Haryana Jan Chetna Party (HJCP) bagged mayoral posts in Sonepat and Ambala, respectively. Haryana Jan Chetna Party’s mayoral candidate and wife of former union minister Venod Sharma, Shakti Rani Sharma, became Ambala’s first woman mayor by defeating BJP-JJP’s Vandana Sharma by 8,084 votes.BJP’s Kulbhushan Goyal won mayor’s seat in Panchkula by defeating Congress candidate and former mayor Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia by 2,057 votes. In Sonepat, Congress’ candidate Nikhil Madaan defeated his nearest rival Lalit Batra of the BJP. While BJP candidates secured victory in 10 wards of Sonepat municipal corporation, nine wards were won by Congress nominees and one ward went to an Independent. The ruling BJP has won the president post in the Rewari municipal council. BJP’s Poonam Yadav won by a margin of 2,087 votes from independent candidate Upma Yadav. The BJP has won from seven wards and Independents grabbed 24 wards in Rewari. Posts of president in three municipal committees — Uklana (Hisar) , Dharuhera (Rewari) and Sampla (Rohtak) — went to independent candidates.In Uklana, Sushil Sahu defeated JJP’s Mahender Soni. Pooja, who was backed by former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, defeated BJP nominee Sonu in Sampla. In Dharuhera, Kanwar Singh became the president by defeating BJP’s Sandeep Bohra.Anant Ram, a retired political science professor, said the farmers’ agitation also played a vital role in the defeat of BJP-JJP alliance.“The results of the Uklana municipal committee reveals that voters are unhappy with the performance of Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and minister Anoop Dhanak as they lost the battle in their stronghold. The results of civic body polls are encouraging for Hooda because his loyal Nikhil Madaan became Sonepat’s mayor and Pooja won the president post in Sampla municipal committee,” he added.Urban voters taught lesson to BJP-JJP: HoodaLeader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the Congress has performed pretty well in Sonepat municipal corporation elections and the candidates backed by him won in Sampla and Uklana. “The urban voters have taught a lesson to the ruling BJP-JJP government and gave a referendum to their one-year rule,” he added.On being asked about Congress’ performance in Panchkula and Ambala MCs, the former chief minister said the party had not called him to campaign for its candidates in both these cities.“We will introspect about the reasons behind our defeat in these two corporations. The BJP has won the mayoral post in Panchkula by a thin margin, but we have secured a massive victory of over 13,000 for the post of mayor in Sonepat municipal corporation,” he added. ‘BJP’s arrogance hasn’t broken’Ambala mayor’s husband Venod Sharma said, “Despite being in power at the Centre as well as the state, I don’t think BJP’s arrogance has broken, but at least here the Haryana Jan Chetna Party won.”Meanwhile, Shakti Rani said, “I’ll work with full loyalty to meet the expectations of people. I’ll try to take everyone along.”According to legal expert Hemant Kumar, except Vandana Sharma, all the losing mayoral candidates are liable to lose their security deposits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/setback-for-bjp-jjp-combine-in-haryana-mayoral-polls/story-K1k9UX7ZJWV8lZD8Wla6PO.html

A police official said Pooja was a divorcee. “She was an orphan and raised by her uncle Kuldeep, a property dealer. She was staying in Rohtak for the past many months and had developed a relationship with Rohit,” he added.

31-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Graveyard is his home||He has one of the most unique addresses in the city. He lives in a graveyard. Alone.“This has been my home for 28 years,” mutters Asmuddin Ansari. In his mid-50s, he stays in a little cemetery tucked in one corner of the Sufi shrine of Hazrat Khwaja Qutubuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki, in south Delhi’s Mehrauli. This winter afternoon, Mr Ansari is sitting in a sunlit corner of the graveyard, silently staring upon the graves—some of which are more than one hundred years old and some are more recent. “The latest burial took place four months ago,” he says, explaining that it isn’t a public graveyard, and is reserved for members of select families.Dressed in a kurta pajama, Mr Ansari now gets up and heads to his sleeping chamber, which seems to be a small medieval-era arched ruin—Mehrauli is crammed with edifices dating to almost all eras. This chamber lies at one end of the graveyard. Inside, it’s a world of stone walls, of fluted columns and arches. A few household things are littered here and there—firewood, pans, detergent, a wall clock, a small mirror, and a plastic surahi (mug). A half-burnt candle is lying on the floor. A set of green chillies lies on a low wooden stool. A blanket and a mattress are rolled out on the floor.

However, this restriction shall not apply to international all-cargo operations and flights specifically approved by DGCA.”Read more: India extends UK flight ban till Jan 7, will impose restrictions thereafterIn the wake of the new strain of coronavirus emerging in the UK, Indian civil aviation ministry on December 21, announced flight suspension on routes from December 22 till December 31.However, such suspension of flights has caused trouble to the passengers throughout this year. Many of the passengers who were booked to fly to various domestic and international destinations are yet to receive their refund from the airlines. These include mainly the ones who were to fly by Air India. To add to the situation, the latest flight suspension has also troubled travellers; be it the ones stranded in the UK or the ones who were to depart from India to the affected countries in the UK.“The airlines had rescheduled flight to the first week of January, when the government announced flight suspension till December 31. However, with the further suspension to UK routes, the airlines again seem to be unclear on their refund/ rescheduling policy,” said a Pune-based businessman whose son is stranded in Birmingham.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uk-flight-ban-dgca-to-frame-rescheduling-refunding-norms/story-hi6WjnrgXFswhaPG2svuDI.html

31-12-2020||Delhi||Dug up stretch around Narwana Road triggers traffic chaos, irks locals||Residents of east Delhi’s Patparganj area have cried foul over a dug up stretch and encroachments around Narwana Road. Locals of the area have complained that a portion of the Narwana Road near Mother Dairy plant in east Delhi has been dug up again by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), which is triggering traffic snarls and has become a hazard for pedestrians. Adding to the woes are wrongly parked autorickshaws near Pandav Nagar underpass which aggravate the traffic mess, residents said. Navneet Nayyar, president of RWA Ekta Garden, said that the same road had been dug over a year ago and now it is being dug up again, which is not only creating traffic congestion but also giving rise to dust pollution. He said that a portion — about 800m of Narwana road — was first dug up over a year ago by the DJB for laying a deep sewer line, but even after completion of the work it was not repaired properly and only patchwork was done. “We braved traffic snarls and dust pollution due to the dug up road, when a sewer line was being laid a year ago. And now again the DJB has started digging work to lay a new water pipeline and we are forced to go through similar problems all over again. Why can’t they carry out these projects in one go ?,” Nayyar said.Read more| Expect cold wave, fog in Delhi in the next four days: IMDOn Wednesday, when HT visited the area, huge pipes lay occupying the footpath, even as other heavy machinery and vehicles stood parked on the road side , leaving precious little space for commuters. Nayyar also highlighted the issue of traffic congestion in the area due to “illegal parking of three wheelers” choking the Pandav Nagar underpass.“Illegal auto rickshaws, mostly from UP, haphazardly occupy a good portion of the road leading to traffic congestions. Other than this, there are car showrooms near Mother Dairy crossing that flout traffic norms by parking vehicles on Narwana Road. I have pointed this out many times to concerned authorities but nothing has been done so far,” he said.Another resident of the area, Mukta Sibbal said that the area has been in a “perpetual mess” for the last two years. “I don’t understand why they did not lay water pipelines when the road was dug up for sewer work. Residents of societies on both sides of Narwana road have to face inconvenience due to these issues. Footpaths have also been encroached as the authorities have put huge pipes and other machinery on pedestrian walkways,” she said.Ankush Chaudhary, a resident of Sadbhawana Apartments in IP extension, pointed out that the uneven road had also led to a few fatal accidents. “This is a case of sheer negligence by the authorities,” Chaudhary said.Responding to queries of encroachment by vendors on the road, a senior official of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation said that anti-encroachment drives are conducted regularly. “We will again look into the matter if there is any fresh encroachment in the area,” the official said.DJB spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.Ajit Kumar Singla, additional commissioner of police of eastern range traffic, said that while the digging work is beyond the traffic police’s jurisdiction, the local traffic police have been working around the problem to cause as little inconvenience to the commuters. “We have been carrying out special drives around that stretch. We have been challaning those parking haphazardly, towing away vehicles and clicking pictures of violators to prosecute them later. We have also deployed additional traffic staff in that area to regulate the traffic,” said Singla||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dug-up-stretch-around-narwana-road-triggers-traffic-chaos-irks-locals/story-Ys6qJiEdZ5YjDqRRhYL8mM.html
31-12-2020||Mumbai||ED is being used to settle scores with BJP critics, says Maharashtra home minister||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh has lashed out at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saying the ruling party at is implementing vendetta politics by misusing the central agency Enforcement Directorate (ED). He said that since the state government withdrew the permission for the probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in state-related cases without state government permission, the BJP is now utilising ED to harass leaders from opposition parties. “This has been happening in the country for the first time. The ED is being utilised to settle the political score against the leaders and the parties who speak against the BJP and their leaders. The ED notices are sent to the leaders who speak against the BJP. The CBI would do this in the past. But ever since Maharashtra government tweaked its notification and made state government’s permission mandatory for any probe by CBI in state-related case, the ED has been doing the favour to the central ruling party,” he said.

The home minister has, however, clarified that there was no restriction on venturing out to celebrate the New Year if the state guidelines are followed properly. “There is no restriction on going out to meet friends, but an assembly of more than five people is prohibited.

31-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to quarantine international fliers for free at its Covid-19 facility||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday decided to quarantine returnees from Europe, Middle East and South Africa for free at its jumbo Byculla Covid-19 centre, so as to prevent fliers from taking a detour to avoid quarantine.Earlier, it had been found that a few passengers were taking detours by landing in other states and then entering Mumbai, citing that it was unaffordable for them to complete the mandatory seven-day quarantine at hotels. HT had reported on December 29 how fliers, in order to evade getting quarantined at hotels, would take a flight to nearby states such as Goa and Kerala and come back to Mumbai by road or train or a domestic flight. These states have not made institutional quarantine mandatory like Maharashtra did to detect if passengers coming back were infected by the new, more transmissible Covid-19 strain, which originated in the United Kingdom (UK). These passengers could be potential super spreaders in case they are infected by the new Covid-19 strain, BMC has stated. Read more: Mumbai civic body turns to ward officers, hospitals for info on returnees from UK, Middle EastSuresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “We have opened our Byculla jumbo centre for institutional quarantining of incoming passengers from Middle East and Europe. This facility will be kept for those who claim they cannot afford to quarantine themselves at hotels.”Kakani added, “There are several professionalsm service-class citizens who are returning back and they have requested institutional quarantine facilities, instead of hotels. Hence, this facility will be available for free, considering our aim is to ensure that passengers do not exploit loopholes to escape quarantine. We, at BMC, are requesting citizens to act responsibly.” With Covid-19 cases going down in the city, the BMC’s bed vacancy also has gone up. As per BMC’s dashboard data, of the 16,437 Covid-19 beds in the city, 12,440 are vacant.According to protocols issued by the BMC, passengers arriving from Europe, Middle East and South Africa undergo screening and are later quarantined in the city hotels for seven days. They are allowed to complete remaining seven days of quarantine at home if they test negative between the fifth and seventh day. The hotel fare is between Rs1,500 to Rs4,500, depending on the budget of each. In case of passengers testing positive, they are shifted to hospital and their samples are sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune to ascertain if they are infected with a new strain of Covid-19.Meanwhile, until December 28, over 5,261 passengers have arrived from Europe and the Middle East. Also, the BMC has sent 12 samples to NIV, Pune, as they have tested positive for Covid-19. These 12 samples are of those passengers who arrived from the UK between November 24 and December 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-quarantine-international-fliers-for-free-at-its-covid-19-facility/story-ufYrDYDx5ZGCOikmp2wbQP.html
31-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body’s standing panel clears ₹400 crore more for Covid relief||After spending over ₹1,200 crore on works related to the coronavirus, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) standing committee on Wednesday cleared a proposal to allot an additional fund of ₹400 crore for Covid-19-related relief till March 2021, amid push back from all opposition parties in the BMC and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The proposal was tabled by the civic administration, alongside post facto approval for ₹450 crore already spent on Covid-19 in the past nine months since March. The BMC has spent an additional ₹800 crore from its contingency fund so far. The BJP moved an amendment to refer back the proposal to the administration and not approve it, which was seconded by leader of the opposition Ravi Raja. All opposition parties, including Samajwadi Party and Nationalist Congress Party, supported the push back. Last month, the standing committee had referred back the 125 proposals related to Covid-19 expenditure worth ₹450 crore that were tabled for post facto approval, and had demanded a white paper on details of how the money was spent. On Wednesday, the civic administration re-tabled a single proposal seeking post facto approval for ₹450 crore, and sought an approval for the additional ₹400 crore. While 12 corporators from all Opposition parties and BJP, who are members of the standing committee, voted to refer back the proposal, 11 corporators from the Shiv Sena voted to pass the proposal. Following this, chairman of the committee, Yashwant Jadhav, who is a corporator from the Shiv Sena, voted to pass the proposal. Raja said, “We had referred back the earlier proposals seeking details of how the money was spent. We did not receive any details, and the same expenditure was approved, alongside granting another ₹400 crore. I seconded the BJP’s amendment because I had earlier proposed referring back the 125 proposals. This is also setting a wrong precedent, where the chairman votes to get a proposal passed.” Rais Shaikh, leader of the SP in the BMC, said, “The standing committee suspects corruption in Covid-related expenditure of ₹450 crore that came to us for post-facto approval. We had therefore demanded details of how the money was spent. Those details have still not been provided by the administration, so we were demanding referring back of this proposal too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-s-standing-panel-clears-400-crore-more-for-covid-relief/story-CVc6fwIPUKEfJU7vYPFWXI.html

Developed by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Brazil’s apex body dedicated for space research and exploration, Amazonia-1 is the satellite that took eight years to be developed. The satellite is due to be sent to space in February 2021 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on the East coast of India. The flight landed in Chennai on December 23Once launched into space, the satellite is said to help monitor the ecosystem of the Amazon rainforest.Emirates SkyCargo, the freight division of Emirates airline said that it had to undertake extensive preparations for this charter flight to ensure the safe and secure transport of the satellite. The total cargo transported weighed around 22 tonnes.The air cargo carrier said, “We had to apply for special permission to operate a Boeing 777 freighter from Sao Jose dos Campos airport to uplift the satellite. Emirates SkyCargo together with the INPE, the airport and local partners conducted two comprehensive simulation sessions ahead of the transport date to be able to transport the sensitive cargo safely from the airport.”During the transportation process, the Amazonia-1 was dismantled into multiple components to facilitate easy loading and unloading from the aircraft. The carrier said that the satellite components were packed inside large containers to avoid any damage during the transport. To ensure the safe transportation of the satellite, four members of the team from INPE also travelled with the satellite to continuously monitor the status of the cargo during the flight from Sao Jose dos Campos to Dubai and then to Chennai.This is, however, not the cargo carrier’s first such transportation. Emirates SkyCargo has expertise in transporting satellites and other cargo developed for space technology. In 2018, the carrier had transported Khalifasat, the first satellite developed completely by Emirati engineers at the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre from Dubai to Seoul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/emirates-cargo-flight-carrying-satellite-lands-in-chennai/story-Pxa4RabX23KVC4st79YGlJ.html

Neither did the owner verify the credentials of the watchman, nor did he inform the Boisar MIDC police station as per the rules. The 25-year-old Boisar jewellery shop owned by Shriram Patil was robbed of its gold and silver ornaments and cash. The heist was committed around 2.30am on Wednesday, and the prime suspect is the watchman. The CCTV footage showed at least four people involved in the theft. The shop is located in Chitralaya area – a shopping destination located opposite the BARC Colony, and is in a densely populated area,” said senior inspector Pradip Kasbe of Boisar MIDC police station.“We have registered cases under section 457 (house trespass), and 380 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the watchman and others, and we are investigating further,” said Kasbe. “Despite our orders to verify the credentials of employees, the owner did not inform us while appointing the watchman, but we have strong clues, and we will arrest him within 24 hours,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-new-watchman-scoots-with-8-crore-gold-60-lakh-cash-from-boisar-jewellery-shop/story-AwgzQllYnecqHGbzfRGcIO.html

We were hoping that the schools will be allowed to reopen from January first week only to be able to conduct physical exams,” said the principal of a CBSE school in the western suburbs.While schools have been conducting online classes and exams since March this year, principals said that for prelims, the offline exam is the best option. “In the offline mode, one can get the actual practice of writing a board-like exam and with it becomes easy to curb unfair means. Our parents are also eager to send students for the exam and we are hoping that we can do so after schools reopen,” said Kavita Sanghvi, principal of the Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School in Vile Parle. Schools across boards conduct their prelim/preboard exams in the month of December and January every year, as board exams are scheduled between February and March.Several IGCSE schools in the city are concerned about the Cambridge A level exams that are scheduled in the month of February. “We are worried that students will not have enough time to appear for the mock exams before the finals. Also, physical school is necessary to clear doubts before examinations,” said the principal of an IGCSE school.On Wednesday, the BMC education department issued a circular announcing that schools across boards and mediums in Mumbai shall remain closed until January 15, 2021.

31-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra DGP appointed as CISF chief||Maharashtra director-general of Police (DGP) Subodh Kumar Jaiswal, has been appointed as the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) chief by the central government, on Wednesday. The state government too has given its consent.Jaiswal, an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer of 1985 batch, was appointed DGP in February 2019, after the proposal of an extension of two years to the then DGP Dattatrey Padsalgikar was denied by the ministry of home affairs. Jaiswal was elevated to the post of DGP from the post of Mumbai Police commissioner. However, Jaiswal was reportedly unhappy with the state government on various issues, including its transfer policy. He had opposed the transfer of the IPS officers before completion of two years of the tenure, as per the provisions in the Act. He will retire from the service on September 30, 2022.“The appointment committee of the cabinet has approved the proposal of the ministry of home affairs for appointment of Shri SK Jaiswal to the post of Director General of CISF....” the order issued by the department of personnel and training has stated. Sitaram Kunte, additional chief secretary, home, said, “He had applied for the central deputation and the state government had given consent about a month-and-a-half ago. The decision about relieving him from the incumbent responsibility will be taken soon, but I do not think Jaiswal will have to wait till the appointment of the new officer in his place. The appointment of the new DGP will be done as per the Supreme Court (SC) rulings in the Prakash Singh case and we will set the procedure accordingly.”“As per the Supreme Court order in Prakash Singh case, the home department sends a list of officers who have completed 30 years of their service to the UPSC in a sequence of their seniority.

31-12-2020||Mumbai||Contempt petition moved in Bombay HC against BMC for not laying sewage lines||A contempt petition has been moved by an NGO in the Bombay high court (HC) against the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for failing to comply with a July 2019 order, directing the civic authority to submit quarterly reports to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) regarding extension work of existing sewerage lines.The order was passed in the hearing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Citizen Circle for Social Welfare and Education, highlighting the fact that the sewage treatment plants were not functioning to their full capacity due to paucity of sewage lines, as a result of which untreated effluents were being released into the sea. The petition is expected to come up for hearing in due course. The contempt petition filed by the NGO through advocate Shehzad Naqvi states that in July 2019, it had filed a PIL which alleged that the BMC was not treating the sewage generated in the city, and the plants were not being utilised to their optimum capacity. The PIL had also pointed out that untreated sewage was being released into the sea as well as the Mithi river, thus causing damage to the marine ecology. After hearing the PIL, the HC had concluded that effluents were not being brought into the treatment plants, and hence directed BMC to ensure that proper sewage lines were laid to ensure that the sewage was directed to the plants. HC had also directed the BMC to furnish quarterly reports to the MPCB on the status of laying sewage lines that would take sewage to the treatment plants.According to the contempt petition, the NGO filed a right to information (RTI) application with MPCB seeking copies of the quarterly reports maintained by it from July 2019. The petition states that to their utter shock, surprise and dismay, the MPCB through its December 3, 2020 reply informed that no information was available on the same.In light of this, the contempt petition states that the BMC has deliberately and intentionally disobeyed the HC order and the same amounts to contempt of the court. While seeking compliance of the previous order, the petition also seeks directions to form policy to stop releasing sewage into the Mithi river, by laying a drainage system in the vicinity and imposing a penalty on the dwellers and industrial units in case they are found discharging the same in the river. The NGO sought from HC to appoint a panel of experts to assist the court while deciding the issues raised in the petition. The petition is expected to come up for hearing in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/contempt-petition-moved-in-bombay-hc-against-bmc-for-not-laying-sewage-lines/story-AEIeWP4LSoF6EJvNRzzp8L.html
31-12-2020||Mumbai||After drop during Covid-19 lockdown, noise pollution in Mumbai on the rise in December||Noise pollution levels had dropped significantly during the lockdown but have picked up since restrictions were lifted in September, according to measurements by the Awaaz Foundation.The foundation measured noise levels in residential and commercial areas of Mumbai, including Bandra, SV Road, Dadar and Mohammed Ali Road during the year.Before a statewide lockdown was announced in March to curb the spread of Covid-19, decibel (dB) levels, consisting mainly of traffic noise, ranged from about 65dB to 105dB. According to a 2018 NEERI (National Environmental Engineering Research Institute) report, noise pollution in Mumbai can be attributed mainly to traffic.However, with the government announcing a statewide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19, vehicular traffic came to standstill and noise pollution levels dropped. Between March and May, the decibel levels remained in the range of 41 to 64dB.“Immediately after the lockdown began in March when vehicular traffic was almost at a complete standstill, noise levels were lowest. In the subsequent months, when the lockdown rules were eased, vehicular traffic resumed, and noise pollution levels started going up again,” said Sumaira Abdulali, founder of Awaaz.In May and June, Awaaz measured noise levels in the range of 52.9 to 89.8dB.In September, when Unlock 4 was announced, noise levels were measured at 64dB to 90.5dB. In December, noise levels were between 64.6dB and 95.6dB.“While currently, the levels are still below the pre-lockdown phase, the noise levels are significantly higher than what was recorded during the first phase of the lockdown,” Abdulali said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-drop-during-covid-19-lockdown-noise-pollution-in-mumbai-on-the-rise-in-december/story-qpMsMuBcYdmCbQANxcD0gM.html

No injuries were reported. Fire department officials said they were informed of the fire at around 1.15 am.“The guard at the building reported it. The building has three storeys and a basement and the fire was on the second floor, which was the warehouse. We were able to contain it to that floor,” said Arun Kumar Singh, chief fire officer (CFO).It took 12 fire tenders from the department and a private one over 10 hours to douse the fire, although it was contained by 6 am, said an official.Officials suspected a short-circuit to be the reason for the fire.“There were no casualties, but one of our constables suffered an injury to his hand and was provided treatment. The warehouse was packed and goods worth crores were damaged. The others floors are occupied by different companies and the fire did not spread there,” said Singh.Later that night, another fire was reported from a scrap warehouse in sector 7.“It was a small fire which was probably caused by a short-circuit too. However, there were no people around and there wasn’t too much damage. We were able to contain it within an hour of receiving information,” said the CFO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/fire-reported-at-e-commerce-site-s-warehouse-in-noida/story-1Wrye7KI7xXcUnP39uHThP.html
31-12-2020||Chandigarh||Despite dip in challans during lockdown, speeding cases in Chandigarh see 250% rise in 2020||Even though the number of challans this year came down as vehicular movement remained on the lower side during the lockdown, the cases of speeding saw a rise of around 250%. Till December 27, 30,710 challans had been issued for speeding; this is the highest since 2014 for which data was available with the traffic police. In 2019, 8,814 challans had been issued for speeding for the same time duration.The reason for the spike can be attributed to the use of the three automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems since May 2020. Rather than have a whole naka to check speeding, the machines are set up with only a couple of people to operate it. Traffic violation information slip (TVIS) challans are automatically issued against the defaulters.Speaking about this PRO of the traffic police deputy superintendent of police (DSP, Traffic East) Charanjit Singh Virk said, “The high number of challans has come from the ANPR systems. These also keep our cops safe from Covid as no interaction is required with the drivers. We will continue their use in 2021 till the driving habits of the people in the city improve.”Speeding has remained the cause of over 90% of fatal accidents in the city over the years. Violators are fined ₹1,000 for the first offence and ₹2,000 for subsequent offences. The driving licence is also cancelled for a period of three months.In total, 1,71,145 challans have been issued by the traffic police till December 27 and ₹8,62,19,910 collected in fines. In comparison, 2,69,854 challans were issued in 2019 and ₹5,81,51,850 was collected.Speeding aside, there has been a fall in the number of challans issued for other offences. Drunken driving saw the lowest dip, coming down to 322 challans from 596 issued in 2019. This happened after the use of alcometers was discontinued around March after PGIMER had advised the traffic police to use disposable mouthpieces in the alcometers.Member of National Road Safety Council Kamaljeet Singh Soi said, “In 2021, the traffic police should continue the same momentum. Speeding needs to be checked at night as this is the time when people are most likely to indulge in fast driving.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-dip-in-challans-during-lockdown-speeding-cases-in-chandigarh-see-250-rise-in-2020/story-73ZvOLkjBHJgb14RKyKjbP.html

Now, protesting farmers at the Singhu border will be able to make video calls to their loved ones without any network glitches. Not only are we ready to install as many Wi-Fi hotspots as required by our farmer brothers, but if similar demands arise from Tikri and other borders, we will install free Wi-Fi hotspots there as well,” said the AAP’s national spokesperson and co-in charge of Punjab unit Raghav Chadha. He further said, “CM Arvind Kejriwal has always maintained that we must fight for the farmers till our last breath. We must support them in their historic movement. We had asked our farmer brothers for feedback on areas at Singhu with poor mobile reception. Based on their inputs, CM Arvind Kejriwal has installed Wi-Fi hotspots. Each hotspot will cover an area of over 31,000 square metres.” Also Read | ‘Support historic movement’: AAP leader Raghav Chadha sets up free WiFi at Singhu border for farmersLarge groups of farmers protesting against three contentious farm laws have gathered at Singhu border for more than a month now. The AAP has supported their demands and helped them with tents, water, toilets and other basic facilities. The party had also voted against the three bills (now laws) in both Houses of the Parliament in September. Last month, the AAP government in Delhi had also rejected Delhi police’s proposal to turn some stadiums into temporary jails to lodge the protesting farmers. The Delhi BJP had on Tuesday criticised the party for misleading farmers and called the act of installing Wi-Fi for farmers as a gimmick. Davinder Singh, a protester at Singhu border, said, “Free Wi-Fi service is already available at the protest site.

Ramesh Pandey, director of the National Zoological Park said a six-year-old white tigress named Nirbhaya had given birth to two cubs on December 10. “While she managed to deliver a cub, the mother developed complications due to her inability to release the other one and died on December 14. One of her cubs died during a C-section that was being performed on the tigress. The other cub was being hand-reared in the veterinary hospital by an expert team, but the efforts did not yield positive results,” Pandey said.Pandey said the cub died of “acute complications” on Tuesday. “The post-mortem examination has been performed, and its viscera is being sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly, for further examinations,” he said.Meanwhile, Pandey said zoo authorities have made all winter arrangements for the animals including use of paddy straws, teachers, and agronet covers. Delhi has been experiencing cold-wave like conditions with temperatures dropping below 4-5 degree Celsius. At 3.6 degree Celsius, Wednesday morning was also the coldest day of the season. “We have also started providing special food including soups, jaggery, and groundnuts to the animals in order to beat the cold,” Pandey said.The Delhi zoo, which is closed until January 31 because of Covid-19 restrictions, currently has a pair of normal coated tigers and five white tigers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tiger-cub-dies-at-delhi-zoo-weeks-after-mother-s-death/story-XPr8KsyBRHzVAWzQ2LJaDP.html
31-12-2020||Delhi||After a 9-month hiatus, traffic police to check drunk drivers on New Year eve||After a gap of nearly nine months when the Delhi Traffic Police did not issue a single challan for driving drunk due to Covid-19 infection fears, the force will be back to the streets on New Year’s eve to check drink driving and restrict vehicles from proceeding towards Connaught Place from 8pm on Thursday and possibly towards the India Gate on Friday.However, instead of the alcometers, the traffic cops would be relying on their “instinct and experience” to identify drunk drivers and then send them for tests. “Since using alcometers puts the police as well as the motorists at the risk of catching infection, we will be relying solely on our observation and experience to halt drunk drivers. They will then be subjected to a blood test and action will be taken against them if they are found to be drunk,” said Manish Kumar Agrawal, joint commissioner of police (traffic).For this, officials and doctors will be deployed across the city. “A sub-divisional magistrate and two doctors will be posted at the Parliament Street police station for violators in New Delhi district,” Agrawal said citing an example.Agarwal, however, said that the focus will be keeping the drunk drivers off the streets to make the roads safer rather than garnering high prosecution figures. “Our primary aim will be to regulate traffic,” said Agrawal.The restrictions against vehicles headed towards Connaught Place, meanwhile, will kick in from 8pm on Thursday and will continue till the New Year celebrations end.Also Read | Restobars at 50% capacity, strict vigil by officials as city rings in a New YearAt the inner, middle and outer circles of Connaught Place, only those vehicles will be allowed to ply which have valid passes. These include customers who have made prior booking with restaurants and thus have the passes, and those providing services to the restaurants and bars in CP.The customers holding these passes too will have to enter CP before 8pm.All other vehicles will be halted at separate points leading to CP and will have to walk to the restaurants and bars after parking their cars along certain lanes identified by the traffic police.Points after which vehicles won’t be allowed to proceed towards CP include the roundabouts of Mandi House, Bengali Market, Ashram Marg-Chitragupt Marg Crossing, Gole Market and other points such as North foot of Ranjit Singh Flyover, Minto Road-DDU Marg Crossing, Patel Chowk, Panchkuian Road-Bangla Sahib Lane, etc.Agrawal said that while the traffic police will be deploying its full strength on the city’s roads on Thursday evening and on Friday, they are anticipating lesser rush due to Covid-19 precautions and because restaurants are being allowed to operate up to only 50% of their capacity and unlike previous occasions, no special programmes are scheduled.That is a reason why no restrictions have been imposed on motorists heading towards India Gate. But restrictions could kick in on Friday morning if the situation is different, said Agrawal.In recent years, India gate has witnessed a large gathering of citizens, possibly tens of thousands, who visit the place on January 1. “On New Year’s eve, people are generally visiting restaurants. But if we see heavy pedestrian movement around India Gate, we will not allow vehicles to go through the C-Hexagon after 10 am on Friday,” the officer said.In that case, vehicles will be diverted from a host of points identified by the traffic police and the information about which will be relayed over the traffic police’s social media accounts as well as their personnel deployed at those restriction points.The police have further advised motorists to avoid Bhairon Marg/Mathura Road between Nizamuddin and Pragati Maidan in anticipation that there could be rush at the Delhi zoo.Diversions in an around Connaught Place and Ashoka Road too are possible if there is heavy pedestrian movement, Agrawal said, advising visitors to opt for public transport over private vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-a-9-month-hiatus-traffic-police-to-check-drunk-drivers-on-new-year-eve/story-FUsJi66sc1yYoEdLAmx48O.html
31-12-2020||Delhi||Restobars at 50% capacity, strict vigil by officials as city rings in a New Year||This New Year’s Eve, all the restobars in the city will operate at 50% of their capacity, dance parties and live concerts will be missing, and a host of safety arrangements will be in place as authorities keep a strict watch to ensure all Covid-19 precautions are being followed. Guests will be required to sit on alternate chairs and will be allowed access only if they wear a mask and submit themselves to thermal screening, the management of different city restobars have made clear in their rules for toned-down New Year’s celebrations this year . Delhi government officials said an increased number of government and police teams will be out across the busy markets of the city to enforce Covid-19 regulations and to prosecute violators. A host of meetings between police and government agencies with representatives of hotels, restaurants and bars over the last week ended with business owners assuring that they’ll operate at half their capacity. While enforcement agencies will be out ensure social distancing on the streets, the onus of ensuring that only permissible number of guests are allowed in restaurants and bars will be on the owners. Also Read | Covid-19: Strict measures in place in Bengaluru ahead of New Year celebrations“If the owners do not understand their responsibility, they’ll be booked under Indian Penal Code section 188 (disobedience to an order passed by a government servant) and under the Epidemic Diseases Act,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south). In meetings with the police, restaurants and bars agreed on putting a cap on the number of guests in each business place. “There are hardly any place that will have a gathering of more than 100 guests,” said another senior police officer. The officer said that police personnel in civil dresses will be randomly visiting restaurants and bars to count the number of guests on their premises. The celebrations are expected to be relatively simple this year. Manish Kumar Agrawal, joint commissioner of police (traffic), said that restaurant and bar owners have agreed not to hold special programmes which could lead to crowding, in view of the pandemic. So, there will no usual dance parties, rain dance or even live music concerts, said Manpreet Singh, treasurer of National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI). “We are unlikely to organise even live music concerts, not only because of Covid-19 restrictions but also due to lack of audience. We have already suspended live music events at restaurants because of lesser number of patrons due to the pandemic. However, light music is allowed,” he said. Also Read | After a 9-month hiatus, traffic police to check drunk drivers on New Year eveAkshay Anand, owner Toy Room Club at Ophelia Ashoka Hotel said, “We are not doing any events nor are we calling any special artist for the night (New Year’s eve), because big artists attract huge crowds, and we don’t want people to stand and dance and take any chances with social distancing. We will only do an à la carte menu dinner as per the government’s standard operating procedures.”The NRAI has also prepared its own standard operating procedures, under which thermal screening and entry of guests with masks on will be mandatory. Business owners said many restaurants and bars already are equipped with special ultraviolet light filters (used in hospitals to kill germs and viruses), air filters and air purifiers. NRAI treasurer Singh said that all staff members at restaurants will don face shields and hand gloves. Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders Association, said that while the restaurant owners and staff will ensure there is no lapse at their end, it is the government administration and the police that must take charge of ensuring that laid down norms are not violated. “We will ensure that no crowding takes place inside restaurants and shops, but onus lies with the government to discourage revellers at public places from violating norms,” Bhargava said. The police said they formed separate teams to check tviolations. “We have constituted separate teams for ensuring there are no incidents of cracker bursting, harassment and public drinking,” said DCP Thakur. Several stretches of roads have been identified as being notorious for motorcycle stunts and drunk driving and police barricades have been set up at those points. The police in some districts will also be equipped with sound level metres to ensure the music is below the permissible limits. Delhi lieutenant Governor, Anil Baijal, on Wednesday chaired a meeting with the police to strengthen their presence in key areas and to ensure “strict enforcement of Covid compliant behaviour” and women safety. The Delhi government, meanwhile, is scaling up its awareness campaigns, especially targeting the younger population, even as it gears up to prosecute violators on the eve of New Year, said Delhi’s chief secretary, Vijay Dev. Over the last one week, a senior official in the revenue department said, several meetings had been held with market associations, resident welfare associations, trader groups, and management bodies of prominent shopping arcades, pubs, restaurants and hotels. Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said, “We have to be extra alert this year in the light of the potential spread of the new UK variant of Covid-19. We cannot let our guards down.” During the festive season , when there were reports of crowding in markets across the city, an average of around 6,122 cases were reported every day in November and 3,451 cases were reported in October . Till Wednesday, four cases of the new Covid-19 strain that has emerged in UK — which experts fear could be more contagious — had been recorded in Delhi, putting the government on high alert. The overall Covid-19 situation in Delhi seems to be in control with the number of cases and overall positivity rate steadily declining in Delhi over the last one month. As on Wednesday, Delhi recorded 677 new Covid-19 cases -- with a positivity rate of 0.80% -- and 21 new deaths, the government’s health bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/restobars-at-50-capacity-strict-vigil-by-officials-as-city-rings-in-a-new-year/story-EQ9uK32BJIGZ3VKIVywWtL.html

On Wednesday, the minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, fell to 3.5 degrees Celsius. This was three degrees below the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 16.4 degree Celsius, four notches below the season’s normal. The minimum temperature at the Palam observatory was 5.2 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature there settled at 15.2 degree Celsius. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said, “On Thursday, the minimum temperature is expected to go down to around 3 degrees Celsius. From Friday, however, the temperature will start increasing,” Srivastava said. He said that New Year’s Day is likely to bring relief, when the minimum temperature is forecast to rise to around 5 degrees Celsius and to around 7 degrees Celsius on January 2 and 3. “A fresh western disturbance is likely to hit the western Himalayan region around January 4, which may bring light rains and thundershowers to the plains, including Delhi. This will be an active western disturbance and along with light rain the temperature will rise,” he said.

On Tuesday, the average daily AQI was 265, also in the poor zone. IMD scientists, however, warned that the pollution levels are expected to rise in the coming days. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said the air quality will deteriorate from Wednesday night and reach the very poor zone.  “For the next two days, the AQI is expected to remain in the very poor zone. But from Saturday, with the impact of an active western disturbance passing over Delhi, the air quality will show a significant improvement,” Soni said. Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), also said that “calm surface winds with low boundary layer height will lead to extremely low ventilation conditions on December 31 and January 1”.” “AQI may even touch severe category for a short period on New Year’s eve. A western disturbance is likely to affect the region by January 3, and improved surface winds speed, ventilation and rainfall are likely to bring relief,” the Safar analysis read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-records-season-s-lowest-minimum-temp-on-wednesday/story-UeapLintT1r0bX9gkFF2HK.html

Of the eight, seven are admitted to a special isolation ward of Delhi government-run Lok Nayak hospital. The eighth person infected with the new variant of the virus was a woman, who escaped while being transported from Delhi airport to Lok Nayak Hospital, and travelled to Andhra Pradesh. “The eight people who were found to have the new variant of the infection were among those who tested positive at the airport when the passengers from UK were being tested for two days. The genome sequencing of the other samples is yet to be done,” said a senior official from the Delhi government’s health department. All eight are either Indians or Persons of Indian origin, the official said. “Some of the people who tested positive had also gone to other places and then returned to the hospital,” the official said. On the second day of mandatory testing, another man — along with the woman from Andhra Pradesh — had given the authorities a slip and travelled to Ludhiana. He has been brought back to Lok Nayak Hospital by the authorities.Read more| Possible that Covid-19 UK strain entered India before, says AIIMS directorThe Indian government had suspended air travel from the United Kingdom from December 23 onwards after a new variant of Sar-CoV-2 was found to be circulating in London and other parts of that country. The new variant – which has 23 mutations, including one on the receptor binding protein on the spike used by the virus to enter the human cells – is thought to be 70% more transmissible, raising concerns of super-spreading events. None of the people found to have the new variant had severe symptoms of the disease. “All the patients have mild symptoms; none of them are in need of oxygen support. They are all isolated in separate rooms and will be monitored till the infectious stage is over,” said a senior doctor from the hospital. The 2,000-bed Lok Nayak Hospital was designated as the nodal centre for isolation of people who are suspected to have the new variant of the viral infection — those who have either returned from the UK between November 25 and December 21 or those who have tested positive after coming in contact with UK returnees. The hospital has set up a special ward for UK returnees and their contacts, who are each allotted separate rooms within the ward. So far, the hospital has at least 35 people admitted in this special ward. The genome sequencing of many others are awaited. Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said, “The government will leave no stones unturned in ensuring testing, tracing and isolation to prevent possible spread of the new variant of the virus.” Read more| New Covid-19 strain detected in Kolkata man after return from the UK“Rigorous contact tracing is being done in compliance with the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the Union ministry of health,” said Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev. The SOP of the Union health ministry says that once a UK-returned person tests Covid-19 positive, all of his or her contacts are to be isolated in institutional quarantine. “The contacts of all UK returned Covid-19 patients who have been identified so far are already lodged in a government-run isolation facility in Chhatarpur or a paid facility at a hotel in Aerocity,” said an official, on condition of anonymity. Around 14,000 passengers arrived at the Delhi airport between November 25 and December 23, of which around 1,500 are Delhi residents. However, HT reported on Wednesday, hundreds of them have so far evaded the city government’s outreach programme through incorrect and inadequate contact tracing details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/eight-uk-returnees-have-new-strain-of-covid-seven-of-them-isolated-in-lok-nayak-hospital/story-s4VFaDgMD7mWfIy0O32A4H.html

Construction agencies will also have to ensure that 80% of transplanted trees survive after being relocated. The policy also mandates that 10 saplings be planted for every tree cut for development projects. “No tree shall be unnecessarily removed in the area identified for development projects by the applicant. Trees should be properly preserved, and no trees should be unnecessarily removed in development projects,” Delhi government said in a statement on Wednesday. “When on-site preservation is not possible, scientific transplantation of all the affected trees shall be the new norm instead of felling of trees. At least 80% of the trees that are affected by developmental activities and cannot be preserved on-site shall be required to be transplanted,” the statement added. Read more| Geared up to tackle new Covid strain, says CM Arvind Kejriwal as city witnesses 703 new casesThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had on October 9, approved the transplantation policy for the preservation of trees in the Capital. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said the state government was determined to protect the city’s environment and added that the move would put a check on trees being felled for development work. “To ensure maximum chances of survival of saplings or trees planted through the compensatory plantation, it shall be mandatory for all trees planted to be a minimum of six feet in height and area as well as individual seedlings/trees to be geo-tagged,” the government statement said. A government spokesperson said the policy notifies a proper procedure that is required to be followed for tree transplantation at any project site. “A tree survey shall be carried out at the time of project feasibility assessment and site identification to obtain the required information for developing site planning and tree preservation proposals. The applicant shall select one of the technical agencies among the agencies empanelled for carrying out tree transplantation work,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-notifies-tree-transplantation-policy-announced-in-october/story-2fCrSxBXxJJwxZdgGUPs6L.html
31-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: More women join protesters at Delhi’s Singhu border||The number of women protesters swelled at Singhu border on Wednesday with several more groups joining in from parts of Punjab and Haryana. Majority of these women are either farmers or from the families of farmers, and have reached the Delhi-Haryana border to extend solidarity.Donning orange dupattas on their heads, a group of around 40 women from Panipat were seen sitting right in front of the main stage set up at the protest site on Wednesday. The group identified itself as “shabd mandali” or “kirtan mandali’. “We sing devotional songs during religious events. All of us are daughters, sisters, and wives of farmers. We know the gravity of the situation. The government has left farmers and their families with no choice but to come out on the roads,” said Amrit Kaur (42).The agitation at Delhi’s four key borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate, and Chilla – entered its 35th day on Wednesday.Few steps away, another group of women from Amritsar was spotted with all of them wearing green dupattas on their heads. Among them, Harpreet Kaur, 56, said, “Whenever a group of women travels together to the protest sites, they decide to keep a colour code so that we can easily recognise our group members in the crowd. Around 100 women from different villages in Amritsar and other districts in Punjab arrived here last night to participate in the movement. Most of us are under huge debts already and that’s why we can’t let the government make our situation worse by introducing these new “black laws’’.”Also Read: Farm laws stir: Breakthrough as govt accepts two demands of farmersAnother group of around 40 women from Tarn Taran Sahib, all of them donning yellow dupattas, were also spotted at the protest site on Wednesday. “Our husbands and brothers are already here participating in the protest. We were taking care of our crops back home as of now. We are small farmers with meagre income. The new farm laws will rob us off that as well. We can’t let that happen to us. So, we decided to join the protest here,” said Paramjeet Kaur, 27, who has left behind her two-year-old daughter back home to participate in the protest.Some women, who had left for their hometowns earlier after facing difficulties due to lack of toilets and private spaces, also returned to the protest site now. “We had been informed that some women-only toilets and all-women tents were installed at the border. Things have become more comfortable now. More women are soon coming from other parts of Punjab and Haryana to join the protest,” said Mahinder Kaur, 45, a farmer from Patiala.Meanwhile, the situation remained peaceful at Delhi borders on Wednesday with protesters seen shouting slogans against the government, singing songs of resistance, taking out marches with posters and banners, and attending speeches delivered from the stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/more-women-join-protesters-at-singhu-border/story-mbmcQUTzCS02g0MYuOpkAK.html

It is now one of the possible booths among others where vaccination drive would be undertaken, officials who did not wish to be named, said. The 500-bed centre -- that was meant for people with mild or no symptoms who did not have sufficient space for home isolation – started functioning on July 8, when Delhi was witnessing its first surge in Covid infections. However, the centre saw very few admissions and the government decided to shut it down like many other Covid Care Centres. “There were very few people being admitted to the facility. It did not make any sense to keep such a huge facility running and hence a decision to close it down was taken,” said an official in the know of the matter.The official further said that the space is being considered for one of the booths that will be set up for vaccination drives. “The government is in the process of identifying the booths in the city and it is being considered as one. No final decision on the matter has been taken yet,” the official said. Read more| 677 fresh coronavirus cases in Delhi, positivity rate 0.8%The Delhi government will set up booths across the city to vaccinate 5.1 million people in the first phase of Covid-19 vaccination. Each booth will be staffed by five persons, including one trained vaccinator who will give the shot to 100 people in a day, as per the government plan. “The CWG centre has provided patient care to around 1,800 individuals since July 8, of which around 160 had to be moved to the hospital on having developed fever, breathlessness or other severe symptoms. All patients have recovered,” said a senior official in the revenue department.For medical emergencies, it was attached to Lok Nayak – Delhi government’s biggest Covid-19 hospital.On November 5, when Delhi was amid the third and worst phase of severe uptick in Covid-19 cases, covid care centres across the city had 1,028 beds occupied out of 7887 – the highest so far.

31-12-2020||Pune||Security agency staff under Pune police scanner following crimes linked to no background checks||The Pune police have started a drive against security agencies that operate without a licence, and hire persons without local police issuing a character certificate. Two cases have been registered so far in the city, involving crimes committed by persons working for private service agencies. “We are going step-by-step. We are conducting drives to check if guards deployed are from registered agencies or not. Now there are two ways of doing that - either go to each agency office and check, or check with the guards that are deployed at societies and other places. We will consider cases of those who have applied for a permit and are awaiting permit. The same will be applicable to care-taker agencies as well,” said Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of police. The drive comes in the light of house-thefts and incidents of thefts and robberies at the houses of senior citizens. Of the total 339 theft cases registered in the city, a total of 140 involve the main-door of the house being tampered with; 63 are involve locks of houses being cut; 78 are shop shutters being pulled apart; while 22 are entry into the premises through a window, according to police. “There is a focus from the commissioner to streamline these agencies. So, we are checking how many of these agencies exist and how many are registered. These agencies avoid registration to evade taxes and some indulge in criminal activities as well,” said Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Crime, Pune. The number of theft cases have reduced from 455 in 2019 to 337 in 2020, owing to the lockdown. Of the 455 cases in 2019, 276 were detected while 176 cases have been detected in 2020 out of 337. “We were conducting a trial as per commissioner sir’s orders. Beat marshals and officers while patrolling were inquiring with security guards they were coming across if their agencies were registered. We were contacting their agencies and cross-checking their permits with our record. So we found one and the owner said he did not have a license or character certificates of any of his employees. So we registered a case,” said senior police inspector Dilip Shinde of Koregaon Park police station. A case under Sections 4 (Persons or Private Security Agency not to engage or provide private security guard without licence) of Private Security Agency (Regulation) Act, 2005 was registered at Koregaon Park police station. A similar case was also registered at Khadak police station on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/security-agency-staff-under-police-scanner-following-crimes-linked-to-no-background-checks/story-ICTvJC0bPywR9zo1IxwpHM.html
31-12-2020||Chandigarh||BJP’s Kulbhushan Goyal is Panchkula mayor||In a closely contested mayoral election in Panchkula, Bharatiya Janata Party’s Kulbhushan Goyal trumped the Congress’ Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia by 2,057 votes.BJP also secured a majority in the 20-member municipal corporation House by winning 11 seats along with its alliance partner Jannayak Janata Party. Congress won seven seats, and two went to Independent candidates.BJP was faster off the blocks in starting campaigning, roped in party bigwigs, including Haryana and Himachal Pradesh chief ministers, and proved to be better organised at the grassroots.Local MLA and Haryana assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta credited the “developmental work done by the party in the last six years” for the victory. “People have voted for the development. Earlier they elected me and now Goyal. We are grateful to the residents,” he said.This is third successive victory for BJP against Congress in Panchkula, once considered a stronghold of the grand old party. Gupta has won the last two assembly elections, and now with this win in the Panchkula MC, the power of balance has securely shifted towards the saffron party. The last victory for Congress was in 2013, when Ahluwalia was selected the mayor and the party won majority in the House with 12 seats. Talking to media after his victory, Goyal, said: “We could have won by a much higher margin, but the voting percentage was lower than expected than in previous years.” On December 27, only 55.9% of the electorate had turned up to vote. In the last MC election, the turnout stood at 64.1%.For Goyal, a real estate developer, this is first success at electoral politics in two attempts. Fighting the assembly elections on INLD ticket, he had lost to Gupta in 2014. He later joined BJP in 2019.Neck and neck till the endThe counting took place amid tight police security. It started at 8am and results were announced at around 3:15pm.It was for the first time there was a direct contest for the post of mayor. There were six candidates in the fray though it was mainly a two-cornered contest.In the first two rounds of counting, held at the Government College for Girls, Sector 14, Ahluwalia was ahead with a small margin. But, with the third round, Goyal reversed the trend and maintained his lead till the end. The gap between the two though decreased after the counting for rural and semi-urban wards started.In the end, out of total 1,03,768 votes polled, Goyal got 49,860 and Ahluwalia could secure only 47,803.The urban-rural divide in voting was also witnessed in ward-wise results. Congress and Independent candidates fared better in these wards, while BJP was stronger in urban sectors.For instance, Congress won in wards covering Rajeev Colony, Kot, Mattawala, Dabkauri, Toka, Khangersra, Alipur, Behar, Naggal, Jalauli, Khatauli, Sakhdarshanpur, Railly, Kundi, Ashiyana and Madanpur, while Independents won in wards covering Moginand and Ramgarh villages.‘We will make Panchkula a smart city’New mayor Kulbhushan Goyal, 60, has been living in the city for the past 36 years. Earlier with INLD, he joined BJP just two years ago. A civil engineer by education, he is into construction business and promoter of Amravati Enclave. Besides being the president of Panchkula Gaushala Trust, he is also the secretary of Bhavan Vidyalaya, Panchkula, and has been involved in social work. After winning the mayoral seat, Goyal shared his priorities for the city. “It’s the blessings of the people of Panchkula, who have showed trust in the party. We will make Panchkula a smart city. Making the city free from stray cattle and stray dogs is another priority,” he said, adding that with the BJP’s government at the Centre and in the state, “we will ensure overall development of the city”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kulbhushan-goyal-of-bjp-elected-panchkula-s-new-mayor/story-4ASXQBasooJXpxw56uYURL.html
31-12-2020||Delhi||Plan to party hard on New Years? Delhiites, be ready for a blood test instead of breath test!||How are you planning to celebrate this New Year’s Eve? If you want to bid the year goodbye by partying hard and getting drunk, then be prepared to give a blood test. Yes! This year, Delhi Police has decided to get blood tests done to check cases of drunk and driving. Informing about the plan, Manish Aggarwal, Joint CP, Traffic, Delhi, says, “We expect a lesser crowd this year due to coronavirus, but our arrangements would be as strict as previous years. Due to coronavirus, this time we will refrain from using alcometer, and have asked Delhi government to provide us doctors who will conduct the blood test. In and around the area of Connaught Place, this test will be conducted at Parliament Street while for other areas, the suspect will be taken to the nearest hospital. They [defaulters] will be subjected to the medical test to check the quantity of alcohol [in their blood]. We have also asked restaurants to allow entry only after a pre-booking, and issue parking labels especially in areas such as Connaught Place and Hauz Khas.” Those denizens who thought they would finally party to bid the corona-year a befitting goodbye, are sceptical now. Aayush Gupta, a resident of Faridabad who had plans to celebrate New Years in Khan Market, says, “This is a little scary to hear. I mean alcometer was fine, but blood test! Mujhe to injection se hi dar lagta hai, ab ya to piyunga nahi ya fir drive nahi karunga.” Another Delhiite, Sanghamitra Mallick, who lives in a PG in the Capital, has a similar reaction to this news, and says, “Ye sunne ke baad I’ve decided that at the time of going for the party, I’ll take the Metro, and while returning, we need to book a cab. I was okay driving down to the party venue till the time the cops checked with an alcometer, but blood test nahi karwa sakti mai to prove I’m not drunk beyond permissible limit. I understand why the Police is doing that, but it sounds so unsafe to go to a hospital to get checked for alcohol consumption in your blood. And I know certain ways to get rid of alcometer test, par blood test se kaise bachenge?” The restauranteurs say they have ensured all arrangements are in place to allow party lovers to enjoy even a safe experience in the pandemic - six feet distance, masks, sanitisers, pre-bookings etc. But, to discourage people from drunk driving, they will serve responsibly. “Our restaurant is hosting a New Year’s party that will follow all the government guidelines. Though the packages we have, allow unlimited food and drinks, it doesn’t mean we won’t take care of how much alcohol we are serving to our customers. It would not been the case that they can get a drink even after getting completely drunk. We will ensure that! Also if one will not be in a state to drive back home after party, we would encourage them to take a cab, and will make the necessary arrangements,” says Shaan Sarin, owner, TEO. And Ricky Sethi, owner, Talli Station, adds, “We’ve a permissible capacity number at our restaurant, and we will be strictly following that. For alcohol check, we will ensure that no mixing takes place.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271For more stories follow Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/plan-to-party-hard-on-new-years-delhiites-be-ready-for-a-blood-test-instead-of-breath-test/story-x8ilqM5C7lqn7Ch6XoigNN.html

However, the Covid-19 lockdown affected its progress, and the state government did not allow extension.Under the project, GMADA had proposed to have residential, commercial and institutional properties after acquiring 322 acres in six villages - Rajgarh, Takipur, Kartarpur, Kansala and Hoshiarpur.In February, only 118 of 450 landowners had opted for land pooling.“The acquisition process has been scrapped as we have not got extension due to the Covid-19 lockdown. We may issue a fresh notification in future, but as of now the process is stalled. We will write a letter to the deputy commissioner informing him about the status,” Sanjeev Kumar, estate officer, GMADA.Another senior GMADA officer, on the condition of anonymity, said the previous date was postponed due to poor response to the land pooling scheme and shortage of funds, but now the lockdown forced the scheme shut.Under the Land Pooling Policy 2013, farmers are offered housing and commercial sites in lieu of their land. For instance, in case of acquisition of eight kanals, the landowner has two options: To either choose a 1,000 square yards developed residential site and a 200 square yards developed SCO site or a 500 square yards residential site with a 300 square yards SCO site.“Farmers did not find the prospect fruitful as they did not expect their properties to attract buyers due to the real estate market slump. Many of them are also cautious of investing with GMADA, as it has yet to even develop Eco City-2, for which the same scheme was rolled out five years ago,” a landowner said, wishing not to be named.In November last year, GMADA had approved the rates of acquisition for 322 acres in five villages, with compensation for farmers fixed between Rs 1.8 crore and Rs 2.4 crore per acre, depending on the village.The project, announced in 2016, was initially delayed as farmers did not show any interest. Later, a fresh notification was issued in December last year. GMADA has already extended the date for acquisition of 737 acres for another township, Aerotropolis, till November this year. The township is spread over 5,400 acres, an expansion of GMADA’s Aerocity near the Chandigarh International Airport.Other townships under GMADA are Knowledge City and IT City, also close to the airport, and Eco City-1 and 2, Edu City and Medi City, all in New Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-shadow-gmada-scraps-land-acquisition-slams-brakes-on-eco-city-3-in-mullanpur/story-qUYvVLIRIsE1MN0HkFBBzO.html

Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, described the situation as “grim, depressing and perilous”.The Big Ben, which is undergoing repair since 2017, will come alive at midnight to herald the New Year, but there will be none of the iconic fireworks around it that would normally be watched by tens of thousands along the Thames and telecast live to millions across the globe.‘Covid-19 loves a crowd, cancel parties’ was the key message on a public information campaign on Thursday, urging Britons to usher in the New Year at home. Millions more Britons moved to the top Tier 4 Covid-19 alert system with the toughest restrictions on Wednesday night.Johnson said: “(As) as the sun rises tomorrow on 2021 we have the certainty of those vaccines. Pioneered in a UK that is also free to do things differently, and if necessary better, than our friends in the EU. Free to do trade deals around the world”.“This is an amazing moment for this country. We have our freedom in our hands and it is up to us to make the most of it. Leading both the G7 and the COP 26 climate change summit in Glasgow, And an open, generous, outward looking, internationalist and free trading global Britain, that campaigns for 12 years of quality education for every girl in the world”.He added: “2021 is the year we can do it, and I believe 2021 is above all, the year when we will eventually do those everyday things that now seem lost in the past. Bathed in a rosy glow of nostalgia, going to the pub, concerts, theatres, restaurants, or simply holding hands with our loved ones in the normal way”.Johnson, however, insisted that the UK is still a way off from that situation and warned that there are “tough weeks and months ahead”.Meanwhile, the Brexit agreement reached with Brussels last week received royal assent and became law. Several aspects of everyday life are likely to change as new post-Brexit realities unfold.This will include higher prices in supermarkets and changes to Britons visiting EU member-states. There will be a 90-day limit to their stay in any 180-day period, using queues for non-EU citizens at airports, and being asked by immigration officials to show return tickets and funds for their stay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/an-amazing-moment-for-uk-says-british-pm-boris-johnson-as-country-moves-out-of-eu/story-WXE4odAZCVOewDFz7B6QxO.html

It will go through the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, one of the world’s most geologically active areas.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway starts from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province and travels through Ya’an and enters Tibet via Qamdo, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Lhasa from 48 hours to 13 hours.Linzhi, also known as Nyingchi, is located close to Arunachal Pradesh border.Last month, President Xi Jinping instructed officials to expedite construction of the new railway project connecting Sichuan Province and Linzhi in Tibet, saying it would play a key role in safeguarding the border stability.With a designed speed of 160 km per hour, the 435-km rail line passes through 47 tunnels and 120 bridges, according to its constructor Tibet Railway Construction Co., Ltd.Construction started in 2014 on the railway connecting Lhasa, the regional capital, and Nyingchi in eastern Tibet. It is the first electrified railroad in Tibet and is slated to begin operations in June 2021, the Xinhua report said.So far, a total of 31.2 billion yuan (about USD 4.8 billion) has been invested in the project, according to official data.With more than 90 per cent of the railway built in areas more than 3,000 metres above sea level, the high altitude and complex geological conditions have posed great challenges to the project, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-finishes-track-laying-work-for-sichuan-tibet-railway-line-close-to-arunachal/story-qVNAjCbLTNoVT9Kyb1jYaN.html

31-12-2020||World||China plays down envoy’s visit to Nepal amid political crisis||China on Thursday played down the significance of the visit of a top official of the ruling Communist Party of China to Nepal to unite the warring factions of the Nepal Communist Party, saying the Chinese delegation’s talks focussed on enhancing inter-party interactions.The high-level Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Guo Yezhou visited Nepal this week and held separate talks with top leaders of the warring factions of the ruling party to patch up differences between them.The Chinese delegation returned home on Wednesday after concluding its four-day visit to Kathmandu while the political crisis continued in Nepal.Asked to disclose the outcome of Guo’s visit at a media briefing here, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin skirted any references to the present political crisis in Nepal and China’s efforts to bring about a rapprochement between Nepal’s feuding leaders.Wang said the Chinese delegation met the leaders of both the ruling party and the opposition in Nepal and exchanged views on conducting inter-party interactions and mutual learning, advancing practical Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation and other issues of mutual concern.“The Nepalese side congratulated the CPC on the upcoming 100th anniversary of its founding and expressed willingness to deepen traditional friendship,” Wang said. Nepal plunged into a political crisis after Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, known for his pro-Beijing leanings, in a surprise move, recommended dissolving the 275-member House on December 20, amidst a tussle for power with former premier Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’.Acting on Oli’s recommendation, President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House the same day and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10, sparking protests from a large section of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) led by Prachanda, also a co-chair of the ruling party.The Chinese delegation held talks with President Bhandari, Prime Minister Oli, NCP chairs ‘Prachanda’ and Madhav Nepal, former prime minister Jhana Nath Khanal and leader of the Janata Samajbadi Party Baburam Bhattarai.During his meetings with Oli and Prachanda, the Chinese leader is learnt to have told them to make efforts for reunification as the split in the largest communist party of Nepal will weaken communist movement in South Asia, according to a senior leader of Prachanda-led faction of the NCP. The Chinese delegation has suggested two possible solutions to resolve the current political crisis in Nepal, a senior NCP said in Kathmandu on Tuesday.Under ‘Plan A’, the dissolved House could be reinstated through the Supreme Court verdict followed by re-unification of the two factions, he said on condition of anonymity.The Chinese leader has advised the senior NCP leaders to give alternative to Prime Minister Oli if the Parliament gets reinstated. If the first option is not workable then the ‘Plan B’ would be to contest the mid-term election through electoral alliance among all the communist forces of Nepal, the NCP leader added.The Chinese team also met main opposition Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba and discussed the latest political developments in the country.China’s political profile in Nepal has been on the rise in recent years with billions of dollars of investments under its multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, including the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-plays-down-envoy-s-visit-to-nepal-amid-political-crisis/story-keXybsRgrgF0Np3X2oM5RO.html
31-12-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic meets 500th anniversary of 1st global voyage||Disease, mutinies and uncharted waters nearly sabotaged the global circumnavigation of the expedition led by Portuguese mariner Ferdinand Magellan. Five centuries later, the pandemic looms as a Spanish navy tall ship sails to commemorate the feat.The Juan Sebastián de Elcano, named for a Basque captain who completed the 1519-1522 circumnavigation with 17 of the roughly 240 crewmembers who began it, docked around Latin America after leaving Europe in August. Visitors were not allowed on board and the crew disembarked in just a few places, including the Chilean island of Dawson in the Strait of Magellan and San Lorenzo island in Peru.“This was possible after confirming that the environments were completely free” of Covid-19, Lt. Luis Martínez García, the ship’s public information officer, emailed from the vessel. The ship departs across the Pacific from Mexico on Friday.Magellan’s expedition for Spanish trade and imperialism opened a westward route from Europe to the Spice Islands, the Maluku archipelago in today’s Indonesia. The epic story invites appreciation for conflicting, overlapping perspectives on history as well as the rewards and perils of a connected world.It was “the first action humans took on a literally planetary scale,’’ said Joyce Chaplin, a professor of early American history at Harvard University and author of “ Round About the Earth: Circumnavigation from Magellan to Orbit.”“Only by the 19th century was it a safer kind of journey, and this was when it became a popular pastime, as in Jules Verne’s ‘Around the World in Eighty Days,‘” Chaplin said. “Now, we worry, like those early circumnavigators, that maybe taking on the entire planet is a deadly business, given how our collective impact on the globe is destroying species and ecosystems.”Magellan crossed the strait between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that has his name in modern Chile, where President Sebastián Piñera recently said the voyage was about “knocking down walls and building bridges where today ideas, people, knowledge and culture flow freely.″Magellan, a daring navigator with Portuguese military experience in Africa and Asia, was later spurned by Portugal, Spain’s rival, and distrusted by Spanish sailors in his fleet. While Magellan’s expedition exploited Indigenous people, Christopher Columbus is a far more divisive figure today for his role in the violent colonization of the Americas.Magellan’s interpreter, an enslaved ethnic Malay called Enrique by the Spanish, has been commemorated in parts of Southeast Asia. Malay writer Harun Aminurrashid wrote “Panglima Awang,” a 1958 novel about him that contributed to regional identity as Malaysia broke with British rule.The interpreter should “move out of the shadows of Magellan,” said Ahmad Murad Merican, a professor at the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization of the International Islamic University Malaysia.Portrayed in European accounts as subordinate, the interpreter has since been discussed as a “diplomat and a linguist” who sparked interest in “Malay navigation skills, boat building and the expanse of Malay travels across the oceans,” Merican said.Some speculate that the interpreter may have been the first person to travel around the world, in separate stages. That might have been possible if he continued west to his Malay homeland after Magellan died in an April 27, 1521, fight with warriors in what is today the Philippines. Some accounts from the time say the interpreter betrayed Magellan’s expedition after his death, though that narrative has been questioned.In 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines designated April 27 as a national holiday to honor Lapu-Lapu, the chief whose men killed Magellan. Lapu-Lapu is admired for resisting foreign intervention and is the namesake of a widely eaten fish.Magellan is credited with introducing Christianity in the Philippines, now the largest Roman Catholic nation in Asia. Yet he is lampooned in late comedian Yoyoy Villame’s song “Magellan,’‘ whose lyrics imagine his last words: ‘’Mother, mother, I am sick/Call the doctor very quick/Doctor, doctor, shall I die?”“We don’t aim to rewrite our history, far from it,” Celia Anna M. Feria, the Filipina ambassador in Portugal, said a year ago at a Lisbon conference on Magellan and the Philippines. But, she said, “We are taking the elements of our history apart’ and studying them.Feria described “magnanimity and humanity” during Magellan’s time in what is now the Philippines, saying he was received on woven bamboo and palm mats by dignitaries (not including Lapu-Lapu).History is about perspective, said Ambeth Ocampo, a Filipino professor who attended the Lisbon meeting. In a column in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, he said few details were recorded about Lapu-Lapu and so “history recedes into wishful or aspirational images of the hero” on monuments, in films, comics and even an advertisement for disposable baby diapers.Jesús Baigorri Jalón, an academic at the University of Salamanca in Spain who was a United Nations interpreter, said Muslim, Jewish and Christian coexistence in what became Spain showed that cultural mixing was common long before Magellan’s expedition.“The idea of ​​classifying ‘multicultural’ societies as a novelty of our times reflects ignorance or obliviousness of our history, that of the colonial powers and that of those that were colonized,″ Baigorri Jalón said.By showing that anywhere in the world was reachable over water, Magellan and his crew inadvertently demonstrated the connections shaping humanity today, said Laurence Bergreen, author of “ Over the Edge of the World: Magellan’s Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe.”“There was this singular event of 9/11 which the whole world reacted to, and you have the sense that the whole world was in some ways connected and vulnerable in some ways as well,” said Bergreen, who worked on the book around the time of al-Qaida’s Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.“Well, now it’s 20 years later almost, and there’s a pandemic, but it’s sort of the same thing that there are events that occur globally that affect everyone,” he said. “And so there’s a sense of a kind of a shared destiny among people who would otherwise not be aware of other people, or really wouldn’t care much about them.″The Spanish navy vessel on the commemorative trip is a “small city″ with engine power, a satellite system, garbage and wastewater treatment, a medical team, fresh bread every morning, and movies and other leisure activities, deputy commander Fernando García said in a Dec. 13 blog post.Referring to pandemic disruptions, García said that ″while other nations have canceled or postponed similar trips, Spain keeps it going, emulating the great feat completed 500 years ago.”Currently docked in Mexico’s Manzanillo port, the four-mast ship is scheduled to return to Spain in July, ending an 11-month circumnavigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-meets-500th-anniversary-of-1st-global-voyage/story-svm4Mifq2Nifz11WzUvW1I.html
31-12-2020||World||No reason given for Trump cutting short his Florida vacation amid tensions with Iran||President Donald Trump is cutting short his Florida holiday vacation and returning to Washington on Thursday, one day earlier than expected for reasons the White House didn’t explain.The White House announced the abrupt change in the president’s schedule late Wednesday, hours after Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he will raise objections when Congress meets on Jan. 6 to affirm President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the November election.The Republican challenge is a futile attempt intended to keep Trump in power, and a path the president has pursued after his campaign lost scores of legal challenges to the election outcome, including at the Supreme Court, and the Electoral College certified Biden’s 306-232 win.Trump’s early return comes as tensions escalate between the United States and Iran in the final weeks of his administration. There is concern in Washington that Iran could order further military retaliation for the US killing last Jan. 3 of top Iranian military commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Iran’s initial response, five days after that deadly US drone strike, was a ballistic missile attack on a military base in Iraq that caused brain concussion injuries to about 100 US troops.Iranian-supported Shiite militia groups launched a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Dec. 20. No one was killed, but Trump said days later that Iran was on notice.“Some friendly health advice to Iran: If one American is killed, I will hold Iran responsible. Think it over,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 23. He added, ”We hear chatter of additional attacks against Americans in Iraq.”His stand won the support of a key ally in Congress, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.``To the Iranians, if you’re going to try to do something on President Trump’s watch, you better be ready for a big pushback, so be careful what you do with Trump,’’ Graham told “Fox & Friends” on Thursday.Trump, accompanied by his wife, Melania, arrived at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida after dark on Dec. 23 and spent practically the entire vacation focused on trying to subvert the voters’ will from last month’s election.Iran was an exception as he stayed mum on many other major developments during the holiday break, including a Christmas Day bombing in Nashville, Tennessee, the discovery in California and Colorado of a new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus, and the death Tuesday of Rep.-elect Luke Letlow, R-La., from Covid-19 complications.Trump’s schedule change means he will miss the glitzy New Year’s Eve party held annually at Mar-a-Lago.Neither Trump nor the White House explained why he decided to shorten a vacation that had been expected to end on Friday.Trump, accompanied by his wife, Melania, arrived at his Mar-a-Lago home after dark on Dec. 23 and spent practically the entire vacation focused on the futile attempt to overturn the election as Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration approached.Despite the plan by Hawley and group of Republicans in the Democratic-controlled House to object on Trump’s behalf during the counting of electoral votes, the challenge will not prevent Biden from being sworn in as president, and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a Black woman of South Asian descent, from becoming vice president.During his vacation, Trump also took near daily swipes on Twitter at Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and other state elections officials over his loss to Biden in that state.Since losing the election and beginning a campaign to overturn the outcome, the usually chatty Trump has avoided engaging with reporters, even those who accompanied him to Florida. He went as far as barring them from his Christmas Day remarks to US troops, which is the type of event the White House typically opens for news coverage.Before he left Washington, Trump stunned Capitol Hill by objecting to spending — much of it sought by his own administration — in a government funding bill that had been paired up with a fresh round of needed coronavirus relief that included $600 payments to most individuals.Trump jeopardized the financial aid and flirted with a government shutdown slated for last Tuesday by implying that he wouldn’t sign the legislation unless lawmakers increased the payments to $2,000, a sum sought by most Democrats and some Republicans.Trump eventually signed the bill Sunday night after several days of uncertainty in exchange for congressional votes on his aid demands. He also wants Congress to lift certain protections for social media companies and investigate his unfounded claims of fraud in the election.Former Attorney General William Barr and other administration officials have said they saw no evidence of fraud on a scale massive enough to have changed the outcome of the election.The House voted this week in favor of increasing the payments, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., all but shut the door Wednesday when he declared that Congress had provided enough pandemic aid. McConnell blocked attempts by Democrats to force a vote in that chamber on the higher payments sought by Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-reason-given-for-trump-cutting-short-his-florida-vacation-amid-tensions-with-iran/story-ecmVHbpvivSOswew40oCfN.html
31-12-2020||World||Covid-19: Govt pushes for budget relief to help small businesses, middle class||India’s ruling party has urged the government to put more money in the pockets of middle-income families in the next budget and cut the costs of raw material for small and medium-sized businesses, a party spokesman said on Thursday.After the coronavirus impact shrank the economy in the last two quarters, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government wants to boost spending on projects for roads, ports and pipelines in the next fiscal year to revive businesses and generate jobs.Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) feels that while the poor received free rations and businesses got state-guaranteed loans and other concessions, the economy will benefit from slimming the tax bill for the middle class with more generous standard deductions.“The middle-income group is feeling a lot of pinch, and they need some support,” said Gopal Krishna Agarwal, who handles the BJP’s communication and coordination on economic affairs.“Incentivising consumption by them would also help the industry,” Agarwal told Reuters, days after meeting the finance minister to discuss budget suggestions by party members. “I can say the budget will take care of the middle class.”The government ranks more than 300 million of India’s population of 1.35 billion among middle-class consumers.Finance ministry spokesman Rajesh Malhotra said no ministry official would comment on the budget for the new fiscal year, which begins in April, until the document was unveiled in parliament on Feb. 1.Another proposal is to raise the depreciation allowances on items like cars, plant machinery and consumer durables such as refrigerators so that consumption increases and tax outgoings of businesses fall, Agarwal added.For medium-sized and small businesses, the government could also look to lower the import duties on some raw materials such as copper and base metals.“Raw material costs are rising not because of demand but because of supply constraints for consuming industries, and they are asking for some relief,” Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-govt-pushes-for-budget-relief-to-help-small-businesses-middle-class/story-ODZfVjYF8m92JboEroCbZO.html

31-12-2020||World||World begins welcoming locked-down New Year||The world began ushering in the New Year Thursday, with pandemic controls muting celebrations for billions of people eager to bid farewell to a virus-ridden 2020.After a grinding year that has seen at least 1.7 million people die from Covid-19, fresh waves of infection have sparked renewed lockdowns and forced would-be revellers to extend their 2020 tradition of watching events from the sofa.The eagerly awaited first seconds of 2021 fell on the Pacific nations of Kiribati and Samoa from 1000 GMT, with the uninhabited Howland and Baker Islands the last to tip over into the New Year, 26 hours later.New Zealand, which has won plaudits for its handling of the coronavirus, followed an hour later with large crowds gathered in Auckland to watch a fireworks display.Although still isolated by international border closures, months of zero recorded cases in the community has let life in New Zealand return to relative normality.In Australia’s largest city, Sydney, fireworks lit up the glittering harbour with a dazzling display at 1300 GMT, but few spectators watched in person.Plans to allow crowds were scrapped amid a cluster of around 150 new infections that have seen travel to and from Sydney severely restricted.“I think everybody is looking towards 2021 as a fresh beginning and a fresh start,” Karen Roberts, among the lucky few who were allowed past checkpoints around the area, told AFP at a bar nestled under the Sydney Opera House.In Tokyo, which will see in the new year at 1500 GMT, residents face the prospect a state of emergency being imposed after a daily record 1,300 new coronavirus infections were recorded in the last 24 hours.Italy -- where shocking images of makeshift morgues and exhausted medics awoke the world to the severity of the crisis -- is on a nationwide lockdown until January 7 and a 10 pm curfew is in place.From France to Latvia to Brazil, police and -- in some cases -- military personnel are being deployed to make sure night-time curfews or bans on large gatherings are enforced.In hard-hit London, 74-year-old American singer-songwriter Patti Smith will ring in the New Year with a tribute to National Health Service workers who have died from Covid-19, projected on the screen at Piccadilly Circus and streamed on YouTube.Social gatheringThousands are expected to attend a fireworks and a laser show in Dubai at the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest tower, despite a slew of new cases.All those attending the event -- whether at a public place, hotel or restaurant -- will be required to wear masks and register with QR codes.In Beirut, a city still reeling from the August 4 port explosion, authorities are also cutting loose. A night curfew has been pushed back to 3 am. Bars, restaurants and night clubs have all reopened and are advertising large parties to mark the turn of the year. On the banks of Lake Baikal in Siberia, where temperatures plummet to as low as -35 degrees celsius (-31 Fahrenheit), around a dozen Russians emerged invigorated after a new year’s eve ice dip.The swimmers, known in Russia as “walruses”, ran several kilometers (miles) through a snowy forest in swimsuits and festive costumes before plunging into the world’s largest freshwater lake.“It’s invigorating. It stings a little!” Andrei Bugai told AFP after climbing out of the water. “It’ll make you feel 10 years younger,” said Ksenia Novoseltseva, another swimmer, with a wide grin on her face.Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday used her New Year greeting to warn Germans the “historic” coronavirus crisis will extend into 2021 even if vaccines bring some hope. In Brazil -- which has already recorded more than 193,000 Covid-19 deaths, the second-largest number in the world -- fearful medics await a new wave.In recent days, social media has been filled with videos showing mask-less revellers enjoying a night out and television channels have even shown live images of police closing bars full of customers.“The pandemic peak was between May and July, which was when there wasn’t a lot of movement and we looked after ourselves more. Now there are many cases and people are acting as if there wasn’t a pandemic,” said Luiz Gustavo de Almeida, a microbiologist at the University of Sao Paulo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-begins-welcoming-locked-down-new-year/story-Iak0UHAg5RD407PaPM14BJ.html
31-12-2020||World||UK Covid-19 variant growing rapidly, affecting more people under 20: Study||The new variant of SARS-CoV-2, which is believed to have originated in the United Kingdom, is growing rapidly and affecting a greater proportion of people under 20, according to a study. A collaborative team of researchers from Imperial College London, University of Edinburgh, Public Health England, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the University of Birmingham, and the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium evaluated the relationship between transmission and the frequency of the new variant over a period of time.“There is a consensus among all analyses that the VOC (the Variant of Concern or new variant) has a substantial transmission advantage,” the study said.According to the study, the reproduction number for the new variant is currently between 1.4 and 1.8. It stated that the estimated difference between the reproduction number of the mutation is 0.4 to 0.7 higher as compared to other variants of the virus. The reproduction number reflects the number of people expected to get infected by a single individual in a homogeneous population. UPDATE #COVID19 new variant VOC202012/01 in England➡️VOC growing rapidly➡️Transmission advantage for VOC of 0.4 to 0.7 difference in reproduction number compared to non-VOC variant➡️VOC affecting a greater proportion of under 20s👉Report https://t.co/wZkdw9fCIj pic.twitter.com/YlffZnyPMlAlso Read | California announces first confirmed case of new Covid-19 variantThe study also found that individuals under 20 years make up for a higher proportion of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases infected with the new variant. However, the researchers said that it is too early to determine the mechanism behind this change. They suggested that it may be partly because the lockdown was in force in some places but schools were open.“These analyses, which have informed UK government planning in recent weeks, show that the new variant of concern, B.1.1.7, has substantially higher transmissibility than previous SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in the UK,” Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London said in a statement.Dr Erik Volz, a co-author of the study, said that very rarely a virus will change in a way that requires us to re-evaluate public health policy. Volz added that there is overwhelming evidence of a change in transmissibility of the new variant that should be taken into account while planning the Covid-19 response in the new year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-variant-growing-rapidly-affecting-more-people-under-20-study/story-k7iQ9nNA9g6xIPGLdwegiO.html
31-12-2020||World||Fireworks explode over empty streets in Sydney, Christchurch as 2020 slinks away into history||Blue and gold fireworks soared into the sky above the Sydney Opera House as they do every year, but the harbour below was a ghost town, a fittingly creepy send-off for a year that will not be missed.No light show will illuminate Beijing from the top of the TV tower. The lions of London’s Trafalgar Square will be barricaded off, as will Red Square in Moscow. In Rome, crowds will not assemble in St Peter’s Square, the Pope will lead no Mass, and revelers will not make their yearly dive into the Tiber.The New Year’s Eve ball will drop on Broadway. But in place of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers packed shoulder-to-shoulder into Times Square, the audience will be a small pre-selected group of nurses, doctors and other key workers, their families kept six feet apart in socially distanced pens.Good riddance, 2020. Hello, 2021.With more than 1.7 million people dead and 82 million infected around the globe since last New Year’s Eve - yet hope that new vaccines can help tame the pandemic - this year’s end is like none other in memory. Angela Merkel, in her 16th New Year’s Eve address as German chancellor, said as much.“I think I am not exaggerating when I say: never in the last 15 years have we found the old year so heavy. And never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope.”“I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona or who are having to fight against the repercussions of an illness when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,” said Merkel, 66, who said she would get vaccinated as soon as practicable. Germany has banned the sale of fireworks to discourage crowds. Authorities in Berlin said police would “punish violators consistently”.‘Hell of a year’In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic originated a year ago, thousands were expected to gather at popular landmarks across the city centre for the countdown to 2021. Some said they were being cautious, but weren’t particularly worried.“Safety is the priority,” said Wuhan resident Wang Xuemei, 23, a teacher.In Australia, where the Sydney Opera House fireworks are televised around the world as the first big visual display of the new year, movement has been restricted, gatherings banned and internal borders shut. Most people were barred from coming to Sydney’s downtown on Thursday night.“What a hell of a year it’s been,” said Gladys Berejiklian, premier of New South Wales state, which includes Sydney. “Hopefully 2021 will be easier on all of us.” In Madrid’s usually teeming Puerta del Sol square, there will be no screaming revellers delightedly stuffing grapes into their mouths - one for every stroke of midnight, according to tradition. Spain’s midnight curfew has been extended to 1:30 am for the night, but most people are expected to stay at home.As police dragged metal barriers across the square, 61-year-old retiree Jose Angel Balsa said he would spend the evening “with family, just the four of us at home, holding lots of video calls and hoping for this to end as soon as possible.”In Britain, where a highly contagious variant of the virus is rampaging and most people are under strict restrictions, official billboards instruct the public to “see in the New Year safely at home”. Barriers were erected in public places such as London’s Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square.Russian authorities stopped people gathering on Red Square. Bars and restaurants were to shut before midnight, but firework displays would go ahead.In Italy, bars, restaurants and most shops were closed, and a curfew imposed for New Year’s Eve at 10 p.m. Pope Francis cancelled plans to lead New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day services because of a flare-up of his sciatica condition, the Vatican said.In France, where a night curfew will also be in force, no more than six adults are allowed to gather around the dinner table. But there will be celebrations - small, perhaps, but with style.At “A la Ville de Rodez”, an upmarket Parisian delicatessen, manager Brice Tapon was preparing packages of foie gras, truffles and pate for groups of two or three.“I will... stuff myself with foie gras, champagne and all this food,” said Annie Chaplin, a customer. “And I’ll stay home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fireworks-explode-over-empty-streets-in-sydney-christchurch-as-2020-slinks-away-into-history/story-SRNMiGn1LR84uIQJfqLOdK.html

The UK government announced a new immunisation strategy after the committee recommended inoculating as many people as possible with the first dose before offering others their second dose.In its advisory published on Wednesday, the JCVI said that in order to maximise benefits from the vaccination programme in the short term, the second dose of AstraZeneca’s vaccine can be offered 4 to 12 weeks after the first dose. It further stated that the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be offered between 3 to 12 weeks after the first dose. “Pfizer and BioNTech’s Phase 3 study for the Covid-19 vaccine was designed to evaluate the vaccine’s safety and efficacy following a 2-dose schedule, separated by 21 days,” Pfizer said in a statement, adding that there are no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days.Also Read | UK to follow new immunisation strategy for Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.

The pharmaceutical giant has urged the UK health authorities to remain vigilant while introducing different dosing regimens. Pfizer stressed that it is important to conduct surveillance efforts on any alternative schedules.Meanwhile, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, AZD1222. The Phase 3 trials of AZD1222 against SARS-CoV-2 across two different dose regimens showed an average efficacy of 70.4%, with no hospitalisations or severe disease observed in the vaccinated groups from three weeks after the first dose. UK health secretary Matt Hancock said that the approval was “good news for the whole world” due to its cost and storage feasibility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pfizer-says-no-data-to-back-uk-s-new-vaccination-plan/story-CuOJ9cto4iztpzMo12BJsL.html

31-12-2020||World||Explainer: What we know about China-made vaccines||China was ahead in the global race to develop coronavirus vaccines with the most candidates in late stage of trials earlier in the year and its first approval of a homemade shot for the general public came on Thursday, yet with no detailed efficacy data.Following is what we know about China’s vaccine development, efficacy data and approval timeline.Which are the most advanced?Five vaccines from Sinovac Biotech, China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), CanSinoBIO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences are in late-stage clinical trials. None of them has released detailed efficacy data.Authorities approved a vaccine developed by Sinopharm’s Beijing affiliate on Thursday, a day after the developer said interim analysis of its Phase 3 trial showed 79.34% efficacy, without providing details.The efficacy reading is lower than the 86% rate for the same vaccine announced by the United Arab Emirates on Dec. 9, based on preliminary data.A Sinopharm executive said on Thursday detailed data would be released later without giving a specific timeline.Sinovac’s candidate has also showed varied efficacy readouts. Data from a late-stage trial of its CoronaVac shot in Turkey showed a 91.25% success rate, while researchers in Brazil said its efficacy was between 50% and 90%.Brazil expects to release CoronaVac’s efficacy data by Jan. 7 after three delays.CanSinoBIO plans to submit clinical trial results for its vaccine to authorities in Mexico next week, a top Mexican health official said.How many people have been inoclulated?While China has been slower than several other countries in approving Covid-19 vaccines, it has been inoculating its citizens for months with three different shots undergoing late-stage trials.China launched an emergency use programme in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection and has administered more than 4.5 million doses of Sinopharm’s two vaccines and Sinovac’s CoronaVac.It has been ramping up the programme over the past month in anticipation of greater transmission risks over the winter.The South China Morning Post newspaper reported that China would vaccinate as many as 50 million people before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February.China also approved a vaccine from CanSinoBIO for military use and the vaccine had been given to some 40,000 to 50,000 people, a CanSinoBIO executive said on Nov. 28.What technology is used?Sinopharm’s and Sinovac’s vaccines are based on traditional technology that uses inactivated or dead virus, that cannot replicate in human cells, to trigger an immune response.The overall occurrence rate of adverse reactions of those Covid-19 shots is similar to those of other inactivated vaccines, and the occurrence rate of relatively serious adverse effects such as allergy is about two in a million, National Health Administration official Zeng Yixin said on Thursday.Who is buying China’s vaccines?The United Arab Emirates became the first country to roll out a Chinese vaccine to the public this month.Pakistan announced on Thursday a 1.2 million dose purchase deal with Sinopharm.Sinovac’s CoronaVac shot has been signed up by Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, Chile and Singapore. The company is also in supply talks with Malaysia and the Philippines.CanSinoBIO has a supply deal with Mexico.President Xi Jinping has pledged to make China’s vaccines a global public good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-what-we-know-about-china-made-vaccines/story-A7HMgPIRPMcjt1vuFPhv8O.html

Loud blasts were heard and warplanes flew overhead for several hours, they said.Houthi-run Masirah television said the planes hit at least 15 locations in different districts in the capital. There were no immediate reports of casualties.Coalition air strikes have killed thousands, including many civilians, over the course of the war.But they have been less frequent in recent years as the conflict has reached a stalemate, with the Iran-aligned Houthis controlling most population centers and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi’s internationally recognised government - supported by Riyadh and Western powers - basing itself in Aden.The main war has been eclipsed by a power-struggle between Hadi’s government and southern separitists in Aden. Saudi Arabia has been trying to unite them to focus on fighting the Houthis.At least 22 people were killed and dozens more wounded in Wednesday’s attack on Aden airport, which took place just as members of Hadi’s new cabinet arrived from Saudi Arabia. A second attack was made on the Maasheq palace, where they had been taken to safety.A coalition statement said the alliance had downed an explosive-laden Houthi drone that was targeting the palace. “The desperate, terrorist attack to target Maasheq palace confirms the responsibility of the terrorist, Iran-backed Houthi militia of the attack in Aden International Airport,” the statement said. There was no immediate reaction from the Houthis, who had earlier denied responsibility for the airport attack.Aden has been mired in violence because of the rift between the separatists and Hadi’s government, which has been based there after being driven from Sanaa by the Houthis in 2014.The Southern Transitional Council (STC), which seeks independence for south Yemen, declared self-rule in Aden in April, triggering clashes with Hadi’s forces and complicating United Nations efforts to forge a permanent ceasefire in the overall conflict.The new cabinet unites the STC with Hadi in an effort to fulfil the Saudi aim of ending the feud.Government officials were among the casualties in the Aden airport attack. Three International Committee of the Red Cross staff members were also killed, the organisation said.Yemeni Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik said all members of the cabinet were “fine” and will remain in Aden despite the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-led-coalition-strikes-at-yemen-capital-after-attacks-on-aden-blamed-on-houthis/story-cbqFwAiChivUcyJXhjlSuO.html

31-12-2020||World||Dozens arrested for vandalising Hindu temple in Pakistan||Pakistani police have arrested at least two dozen people in overnight raids after a Hindu temple was set on fire and demolished by a mob on Wednesday, according to reports. The crackdown came even as the country’s chief justice, Gulzar Ahmed, on Thursday took suo motu notice of the attack on the place of worship in Teri village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district. The country’s supreme court will hear the case on January 5.Local police said raids had been carried out overnight, and more raids were underway to arrest those who participated in the vandalism or provoked the mob to demolish the place of worship.Some 1,500 people had reportedly participated in the attack on the temple.The chief justice took the step after minority lawmaker Ramesh Kumar briefed him about the temple being set ablaze, during their meeting in Karachi on Thursday.The Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj’s Samadhi along with the Krishna Dwara Mandir in Teri village was vandalised on Wednesday by an unruly mob. They claimed the temple had encroached on extra land and set it on fire.Noorul Haq Qadri, Pakistan’s minister for religious affairs, called the episode “a conspiracy against sectarian harmony”. He took to Twitter on Thursday, saying the “protection of the religious freedom of minorities is our religious, constitutional, moral and national responsibility”.Local media quoted advocate Rohit Kumar, a representative of the Hindu community, as saying that the temple hadn’t exceeded the area agreed upon.Meanwhile, dozens of Hindus reportedly rallied in the city of Karachi to demand the rebuilding of the place of worship in Teri village.The temple was first attacked and demolished in 1997. After intervention by the supreme court in 2015, the local community had agreed to its reconstruction. Despite the reconstruction, there was a dispute over the land allocated to the temple. This also led to some misunderstanding between the temple supporters and local clerics.In 1919, Guru Sri Paramhans Dayal was laid to rest at the site and a temple was built there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-arrested-for-vandalising-hindu-temple-in-pakistan/story-GzT1iIyceWl0ArQU11SPVK.html
31-12-2020||World||Pakistan to buy 1.1 million doses of Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine||Pakistan has decided to pre-book 1.1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Chinese state-owned company Sinopharm, the health ministry said here on Thursday, as the number of coronavirus cases reached 479,715 after 2,475 new infections were detected in the country. China on Thursday granted conditional approval to the country’s first homegrown COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinopharm. The approval came a day after Sinopharm said its vaccine showed 79.34 per cent efficacy and a 99.52 per cent antibody-positive conversion rate in the interim results of Phase III clinical trials. The decision to procure the vaccine was made in the meeting of a special cabinet committee on Wednesday after Sinopharm said that its vaccine was 79.34 per cent effective, the Ministry of National Health Services said. The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) has not yet approved the emergency use of the drug which once approved would be given free to all frontline health workers in the first quarter of 2021. The committee was informed that Pakistan was in contact with other drug manufacturers for future bookings. The committee said that the private sector would also be encouraged to approach Drap for emergency use of any available and safe COVID-19 vaccine. Meanwhile, another 58 people died in Pakistan due to coronavirus, taking the COVID-19 toll to 10,105, while 2,206 people were in critical conditions. The number of recuperated people reached 435,073 after 4,960 people recovered in the last 24 hours. It was the second consecutive day that over 4,000 patients tested negative. The authorities have carried out 39,659 tests in the last one day, registering a positivity rate of 6.24 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-buy-1-1-million-doses-of-sinopharm-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-YsDtuhWET7xJcnU0a8Rz6H.html

My mother was born in France, her mother was totally French as was her grandfather. So for me it is about reclaiming what I already have. And that makes me very happy,” said the 80-year-old Johnson, who was speaking in French.“I will always be a European, that’s for sure. One cannot tell the British people: you are not Europeans. Having a tie with the European Union is important,” he added.His son Boris was the public face of the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum and says Britain can “prosper mightily” as a fully sovereign nation outside what he sees as an overly bureaucratic EU.But on Wednesday the Prime Minister sounded a more concilatory note as parliament approved a new trade deal with the EU, saying: “This is not the end of Britain as a European country. We are in many ways the quintessential European civilisation... and we will continue to be that.” The United Kingdom officially leaves the EU’s orbit on Thursday night, after an often strained 48-year liaison with the European project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-father-is-applying-for-french-citizenship/story-stLB5ZA8E5hlaKppDMcYxM.html

While ministers say the roll out of vaccines will allow the country to start getting back normal by spring 2021, they have also warned the weeks ahead may be the hardest yet.The new faster spreading strain of the virus has driven daily infections to a record level, with more people hospitalized and daily death rates close to the peak of the first wave in the spring. The reopening of schools has been delayed and the government says restrictions could be tightened further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-tells-public-to-stay-home-for-new-year-s-eve-celebrations/story-2evKiJHMsaGH6cHL6ypKHO.html

The US, Germany, Japan and Australia have all been regulating Chinese investments more strictly, not just Taiwan,” added Su.Moreover, Taiwan has brought new regulations to close loopholes that could be used by Chinese companies to skirt regulations. Articles 3, 4 and 6 of the Measures Governing Investment Permits to the People of the Mainland Area have been changed to expand the definition of Chinese capital, reported Taipei Times.The rule further stated that any company found to break the regulations will face a maximum penalty of New Taiwanese Dollar 25 million and have to divest immediately, informed Su.The ministry also announced an amendment to the Regulations Governing Investment or Technical Cooperation in the Mainland Area, tightening control of Taiwanese technology and intellectual property (IP) going to China, reported Taipei Times.“Selling or licensing Taiwanese technology or IP will now be considered ‘technical cooperation’ and must be approved in advance,” the ministry said in a release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-tightens-control-over-chinese-investments-due-to-security-concerns-report/story-u1wEw6ZM9bS2ogc1lxY1jL.html

Prosecutors immediately appealed against the bail decision.Beijing imposed the legislation on the former British colony in June that critics say aims to crush dissent and erode freedoms in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city - charges that authorities in Hong Kong and China reject. Lai, a critic of Beijing who had been a frequent visitor to Washington, is widely believed to be a target of the new legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-top-court-puts-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-back-in-custody/story-Sq60ArMJ7aIpyX1MyB4I4H.html
31-12-2020||World||Possible Trump pardon overshadows WikiLeaks founder Assange extradition ruling||A UK judge will rule Monday on whether WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should be extradited to the US to face criminal charges after weeks of talk about a possible pardon from Donald Trump.The decision from a London judge will come after President Trump, whose administration brought the charges, issued a plethora of pardons to political allies. And lawyers say the odds of clemency from Trump are better than a judge buying Assange’s arguments that his human rights will be trampled on in America.“It’s very rare for the magistrates to refuse extradition requests from the US,” said Anthony Hanratty, a lawyer at BDB Pitmans in London, who specializes in extradition cases. “There’s a quite strong presumption that the U.S. will comply with obligations in relation to human rights and legal process.”Assange, 49, has been in custody or self-imposed exile in London for the better part of a decade. He initially sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in 2012 rather than face questioning in a Swedish sexual assault case, which was later dropped. Last year, when he was expelled from the embassy, he faced US charges related to WikiLeaks disclosures.He’s accused of working with US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to get classified documents from databases containing about 90,000 Afghanistan war-related activity reports, 400,000 Iraq war-related reports and 250,000 State Department cables.At a pair of extradition hearings earlier this year, delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, Assange’s lawyers focused their arguments on allegations that he couldn’t receive a fair trial in the US.But Assange drew praise from Trump during the 2016 campaign when WikiLeaks released emails that undercut Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. And it seems that Assange’s supporters have moved on from the extradition battle to focus on a possible pardon.Assange’s fiancée, Stella Moris, has spent the last few months making direct pleas to Trump via Twitter and appearances on Fox News.“I beg you, please bring him home for Christmas,” she tweeted last month.Officials at WikiLeaks declined to comment ahead of Monday’s ruling and instead referred to Moris’s tweets. The US Justice Department declined to comment.The pardon fever has only grown in recent weeks after Trump issued pardons to more than a dozen people. The recipients were mostly political allies, including Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager, and Charles Kushner, the real estate developer and father of the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Trump would face opposition to a pardon from inside his own administration. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo -- when he was CIA director -- described WikiLeaks as a hostile force that threatens the US.Barring a pardon, the extradition process in London will likely drag on no matter how Judge Vanessa Baraitser rules Monday. Appeals could take 18 to 24 months with possible challenges going to the UK Supreme Court and even the European Court of Human Rights, Hanratty said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/possible-trump-pardon-overshadows-wikileaks-founder-assange-extradition-ruling/story-ktbo5bx4GJChjH9lRSmkUM.html

31-12-2020||World||EU drug watchdog looking at timing of dosage in AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine review||The European Union (EU) drug watchdog is looking at when people should be given the second dose of AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine, rather than at the size of the first dose, as part of its review of the shot, a source at the agency said on Wednesday. Britain on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the coronavirus vaccine developed by the British duo, with the authorities recommending that a second shot is administered between four and 12 weeks after the first.Two full doses three months apart were found to be 80% efficacious, the UK drug regulator said, higher than the average that the developers themselves had found in their late-stage trials. For the European Medicines Authority (EMA), the crucial point is the level of protection people have once they have received the first shot and then have to wait between four and 12 weeks for the second one, the source said. “This is exactly what we are looking at. You must have sufficient coverage with the first dose given that this is a vaccination campaign in the middle of a pandemic,” the source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said.Earlier on Wednesday, AstraZeneca said it had submitted full data to pursue conditional marketing authorisation from the EMA, but the regulator said it still needs more information for approval.In a statement, the EMA said it expected more information from ongoing trials in January and it has requested additional scientific data from the company. It did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment on its analysis of timing and dosages. The Oxford/AstraZeneca shot has been plagued with questions about its most effective dosage since data showed some surprising results.Two full doses were given to the majority of participants and were shown to be 62% efficacious - but a smaller group of volunteers received by accident half a dose followed by a full dose, and registered 90% efficacy.The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said on Wednesday that the 90% rate had not stood up to analysis.The issue of the first shot at half dosage is also not on the table at EMA, with the regulator only looking at the two full dosage regimen.It makes more sense for the timing of the second shot to affect efficacy rather than the dosage size in this case, the source at EMA said.“The 12-week thing is reassuring from a scientific point of view because there is a logical explanation for these types of vaccines, but that the half dose was more effective than the full dose is something that actually clashes with logic,” the source said.However, the source said the variations in the trial have caused a complexity that makes it more difficult for regulators to assess it.AstraZeneca’s late-stage trial was originally designed for two injections four weeks apart. But in late-stage trial data published in The Lancet medical journal on December 12., the company said most participants had delays in receiving their second shot.The median time between two standard doses in UK volunteers was about 10 weeks, and six weeks in Brazil, it said.“Some people received the dose four weeks later, others 12 weeks later. It was all very variable. And that’s why it’s very difficult to interpret these studies,” the EMA source said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-drug-watchdog-looking-at-timing-of-dosage-in-astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-review/story-Itoj9p2et7DREQrOsxRitN.html
31-12-2020||World||Harsh winter can bring illness, death to Afghan kids: Report||More than 300,000 children in war-ravaged Afghanistan face freezing winter conditions that can lead to illness and death without proper winter clothing and heating, a humanitarian organization said Thursday.The ongoing military conflict in Afghanistan has destroyed many homes and forced thousands of children to shelter in camps for the homeless. There they are at risk of not only hunger and disease, including Covid-19, but also death from freezing temperatures.Chris Nyamandi, Afghanistan country director for Save the Children, said in a statement Thursday that early snow in northern Afghanistan has impacted children particularly badly.“The most vulnerable children are those whose schools have shut because of the worsening winter conditions,” he said. “Their families don’t have the money to buy winter clothing. Instead children are forced to huddle at home to escape the bitter cold.”Schools are closed until March in the coldest parts of Afghanistan, where the temperature can plummet to as low as minus 27 degrees Celsius (minus 16 degrees Fahrenheit).Save the Children has provided winter kits to more than 100,000 families in 12 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. The kits include fuel and a heater, blankets and winter clothes for children including coats, socks, shoes, hats.“The situation is bleak for children forced to live in camps in places like Balkh province. It is already very cold in this northern province with overnight temperatures as low as minus ten. But it will get much colder before March,” Nyamandi said. “For thousands of children the Afghan winter is a time of grim survival.”Violence has been on the upswing in Afghanistan even as Taliban and Afghan government negotiators hold talks in Qatar, trying to hammer out a peace deal that could put an end to decades of war.A report from Save the Children released Thursday cites 12-year-old Rohina, who lives in a camp for people forced to flee their homes in northern Balkh province. She attends Save the Children supported, community-based education classes.“We are poor and are living under open sky,” she said. “Me and my siblings are not able to sleep for the night because of the cold. How can someone learn like this?”At a camp in the northern part of the capital Kabul, there are more than 700 families, the majority of them displaced by violence in their hometowns. They and other families keep warm and cook by burning the garbage that surrounds them.“It is cold at night, cold in morning, we don’t have wood, we don’t have charcoal,” said 10-year-old Mohammad Dad, who lives at the camp. “We don’t have blankets we make fire out of plastic to keep us warm.”Mohammad’s grandmother, 50-year-old Raihan, lives with seven members of her son’s family at the camp.

She said a new date would “based on an independent technical review.”That means it will be months into President-elect Joe Biden’s administration before his new team at the Pentagon has all the information it will need to make a decision on the F-35’s full-rate production, the most lucrative phase for Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed.The simulated combat testing was to have occurred this month, the latest date of an exercise once scheduled for 2017.Whenever the testing occurs, it will take an additional two to three months to transfer and analyze the data and then draft a final report for delivery to Pentagon leaders and Congress. The report is mandated by law before a decision.A decision to allow full-rate production will be a seal of approval from the Defense Department to American taxpayers and foreign customers that the warplane has been fully tested, deemed effective against the highest-level threats, can meet its maintenance goals and can be produced efficiently.More than 600 of the F-35 program’s potential 3,200 aircraft already have been delivered, and the fighter is in use by the military in nine nations, including the US Air Force and Marine Corps. But it still hasn’t demonstrated its effectiveness against the most challenging Russian and Chinese air defense systems and aircraft. That will be measured in a sophisticated on-ground simulator at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland.Biden’s TeamBiden and his aides have complained that Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller and the Trump loyalists around him have failed to provide his transition team with adequate briefings, criticism that Miller has rebuffed.Maxwell, the spokeswoman for acquisition chief Lord, said it’s possible Biden’s team will be briefed on the F-35 memo during an “acquisition-specific” meeting scheduled to take place next week. Previously “we provided information on the F-35 as part of the initial transition books, and have since provided additional F-35 program information as part of broader Requests for Information on acquisition,” she said.The Defense Department’s F-35 program office is analyzing test preparations and expects to have revised dates for the simulation and for a potential full production decision by Feb. 28, according to Laura Seal, a program spokeswoman.Robert Behler, the Defense Department’s operational testing director, says in his latest annual report, set for release in January, that the roughly one month of combat testing is now expected to occur in mid- to late-2021.Maxwell said in spite of the delayed decision the program “will continue low-rate initial production at the planned rate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-keeps-398-billion-f-35-s-full-rate-production-on-hold/story-06gdKLdqC5V5QR8VtxCCBI.html
31-12-2020||World||2020 finally ending, but New Year’s revelries muted by coronavirus||This New Year’s Eve is being celebrated like no other, with pandemic restrictions limiting crowds and many people bidding farewell to a year they’d prefer to forget.Australia will be among the first nations to ring in 2021 because of its proximity to the International Date Line. In past years 1 million people crowded Sydney’s harbor to watch fireworks that center on the Sydney Harbor Bridge.Authorities this year are advising revelers to watch on television. People are only allowed in downtown Sydney if they have a restaurant reservation or are one of five guests of an inner-city apartment resident. People won’t be allowed in the city center without a permit.Some haborside restaurants are charging up to 1,690 Australian dollars ($1,294) for a seat, Sydney’s The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported Wednesday.Sydney is Australia’s most populous city and has its most active community transmission of Covid-19 in recent weeks. Melbourne, Australia’s second-most populous city, has cancelled its fireworks.“For the first time in many, many years we made the big decision, difficult decision to cancel the fireworks,” Melbourne Mayor Sally Capp said.“We did that because we know that it attracts up to 450,000 people into the city for one moment at midnight to enjoy a spectacular display and music. We are not doing that this year,” she added.New Zealand, which is two hours ahead of Sydney, and several of its South Pacific island neighbors have no Covid-19, and New Year celebrations there are the same as ever.In Chinese societies, the Lunar New Year celebration that falls in February in 2021 generally takes precedence over solar New Year, on Jan. 1. While celebrations of the Western holiday have been growing more common in recent decades, this year will be more muted.Beijing will hold a countdown ceremony with just a few invited guests, while other planned events have been cancelled. And nighttime temperatures plunging to -15 Celsius (- 5 Fahrenheit) will likely discourage people from spending the night out with friends.Taiwan will host its usual New Year’s celebration, a fireworks display by its capital city’s iconic tower, Taipei 101, as well as a flag-raising ceremony in front of the Presidential Office Building the next morning. The island has been a success story in the pandemic, registering only 7 deaths and 700 confirmed cases of Covid-19.Hong Kong, with its British colonial history and large expatriate population, has usually seen raucous celebrations along the waterfront and in bar districts. For the second year running, however, New Year’s Eve fireworks have been cancelled, this time over coronavirus rather than public security concerns.Still roiled by its coronavirus outbreak, Hong Kong social distancing regulations restrict gatherings to only two people. Restaurants have to close by 6 p.m. Live performances and dancing are not allowed. But crowds still throng shopping centers.In Japan, some people skipped what’s customarily a chance to return to ancestral homes for the holidays, hoping to lessen health risks for extended families amid the coronavirus pandemic.Rural restaurants saw business drop, while home deliveries of traditional New Year’s “good luck” food called “osechi” boomed.Emperor Naruhito is delivering a video message for the new year, instead of waving from a window with the imperial family as cheering crowds throng the palace.Train services that usually carry people on shrine visits overnight Dec. 31, as well as some countdown ceremonies, have been cancelled.Meiji Shrine in downtown Tokyo, which attracts millions of people every year during New Year holidays and is usually open all night on New Year’s Eve, will close its doors at 4 p.m. on Dec. 31 this year, the shrine announced on its website.In South Korea, Seoul’s city government has cancelled its New Year’s Eve bell-ringing ceremony for the first time since it started the event in 1953, months after the end of the Korean War.Eastern beaches and other spots where people typically gather watch the year’s first sunrise will be closed. The city of Pohang instead plans to broadcast live on YouTube as the sun rises at several of its beaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2020-finally-ending-but-new-year-s-revelries-muted-by-coronavirus/story-4S2XL0pZpMmKsS5C3sMHeO.html
31-12-2020||World||Heavy snow expected in Texas; storm could spawn tornadoes||A winter storm moving across southwestern Texas on Wednesday could dump more than a foot (0.30 meters) of snow before moving eastward and possibly spawning tornadoes in parts of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi on New Year’s Eve, according to weather forecasters.Jeremy Grams, a forecaster with the National Weather Services Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said 12 to 18 inches (0.30 meters to 0.46 meters) of snow was possible west of the Pecos River in southwest Texas, with another 3 to 5 inches (0.13 meters) predicted for western Oklahoma by Thursday.Tornadoes are possible as the cold air moving eastward with the storm collides with moisture and warmer temperatures from the Gulf of Mexico, Grams said.“On the warm side of the system we have the chance for tornadoes from southeast Texas across most of Louisiana and at least into southern Mississippi,” Grams said.Grams said a wintry mix of precipitation and a threat of tornadoes is uncommon — but not unheard of — this time of year.The storm produced what Grams said was a likely a brief tornado in Corsicana, Texas, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Dallas shortly before noon Wednesday.More than a dozen mobile homes were damaged in Corsicana, Navarro County officials said in a social media statement, but no injuries were reported. Two other homes were damaged by fallen trees.The Navarro County Office of Emergency Management did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Grams said any tornadoes would likely be classified as EF2, with wind speeds of 111-135 mph (179-217 kph), or below, compared to violent tornadoes which he said are those rated EF4 and above with wind speeds of 166 mph (267. kph) and higher. In Oklahoma, the state Department of Transportation reported wet and slushy roads on Interstate 40 in the central part of the state on Wednesday, and extending along I-44 to Tulsa. The state said salt and sand was being applied to make roadways less slick. The city of Odessa, Texas, in the Permian Basic oil patch opened a winter weather shelter that would be available through Friday. Federal guidelines for social distancing to stop the spread of Covid-19 will be enforced at the shelter, the city said.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday placed several state agencies on standby ahead of the storm. Meanwhile, another storm system dropped heavy snow across the Upper Midwest and led to winter storm warnings for parts of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Illinois.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heavy-snow-expected-in-texas-storm-could-spawn-tornadoes/story-oIO1BNRMAaEnZwPMLrZrOI.html
31-12-2020||World||Kamala Harris vows to ensure Covid-19 vaccine is distributed ‘equitably and free of charge’||US Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said on Thursday that once she and President-elect Joe Biden take office, they will ensure Covid-19 vaccines are distributed “equitably and free of charge”. Harris tweeted this announcement in support of Joe Biden’s criticism of the Trump administration’s pace of vaccine rollout. Warning that if vaccinations continue at the current pace “it’s going to take years, not months,” to vaccinate the entire nation, Biden has promised to administer 100 million shots of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine during his first 100 days in the Oval Office. “As Joe Biden said yesterday, once in office we will ensure that the Covid-19 vaccines are distributed equitably and free of charge—so it doesn’t matter the color of your skin or where you live. If you want a vaccine, you’ll be able to get one.” tweeted HarrisBiden announced on Wednesday that he will invoke the Defence Production Act to speed up vaccine production in the US. The Defence Production Act is a cold war era law that gives the President sweeping powers to control the country’s domestic industry. “I am going to move heaven and earth to get us going in the right direction. I am going to use my power under the Defence Production Act, when I am sworn in, and order private industry to accelerate the making of the materials needed for the vaccines as well as protective gear.” Biden said.Biden also stated that he and the Vice President-elect have been discussing a bi-partisan vaccine delivery plan for the country, with special emphasis on rural communities. “Vice President Harris and I have been speaking to county officials, mayors, governors of both parties to speed up the distribution of the vaccine across the nation. We’re planning a whole of government effort. And we’re going to work to set up vaccination sites, and send mobile units to hard to reach communities.” he added. Both Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have been administered the Pfizer/ BioNTech vaccine in the public eye to demonstrate its safety and efficacy. Harris told reporters that she got vaccinated to “dispel fears and mistrust in the minority community” about vaccines. The President-elect too has on many occasions stressed on the need for mass vaccination programs driven by communities. On Thursday, he acknowledged that the treatment meted out to minority communities by the government and scientific community has resulted in vaccine hesitancy, promising to launch a mass education campaign to help allay their fears. “We also know there’s a vaccination hesitancy in many communities, especially Black, Lation, and Native American communities, who have not always been treated with dignity and honesty they deserve, by the federal government and the scientific community throughout our history. That’s why we will launch a massive public education campaign to increase vaccine acceptance, we will do everything to show that vaccines are safe and critically important for one’s own health, and that of their families and communities.” Biden saidBiden ended his speech with the assurance that vaccines will be distributed all over the country on an equitable basis, where everyone will be vaccinated free of cost. “That means we are also gonna make sure vaccines are distributed equitably, so every person who wants a vaccine can get it no matter the colour of their skin or where they live. And we’re going to ensure that vaccinations are free of charge.” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-vows-to-ensure-covid-19-vaccine-is-distributed-equitably-and-free-of-charge/story-01X4oU6ltd18aqPhz9MdpL.html

According to witnesses, the mob was led by a local cleric and supporters of Pakistan’s radical Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party,Pakistan’s minister for religious affairs, Noorul Haq Qadri, called the attack on the temple “a conspiracy against sectarian harmony.” He took to Twitter Thursday, saying attacks on places of worship of minority religious groups are not allowed in Islam and “protection of religious freedom of minorities is our religious, constitutional, moral and national responsibility.”The incident comes weeks after the government allowed Hindu residents to build a new temple in Islamabad on the recommendation of a council of clerics.Although Muslims and Hindus generally live peacefully together in Pakistan, there have been other attacks on Hindu temples in recent years. Most of Pakistan’s minority Hindus migrated to India in 1947 when India was divided by Britain’s government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mob-attacks-sets-ablaze-hindu-temple-in-northwestern-pakistan/story-mH46FTC6eOaDlatTSbOjxI.html
31-12-2020||World||China approves first homegrown vaccine said to be 79.3% effective||Chinese health regulators said Thursday that they have given conditional approval to a coronavirus vaccine developed by state-owned Sinopharm.The two-dose vaccine is the first approved for general use in China. The go-ahead comes as the country has begun to vaccinate 50 million people before the Lunar New Year holiday in February.Conditional approval means that research is still ongoing, the company will be required to submit follow-up data as well as reports of any adverse effects after the vaccine is sold on the market, Chen Shifei, the deputy commissioner of the National Medical Products Administration, told a news conference.The company “must continuously update the vaccine’s instructions, labels and report to the agency,” Shifei said.The vaccine was developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products, a subsidiary of state-owned conglomerate Sinopharm. The company announced Wednesday that preliminary data from last-stage trials had shown it to be 79.3% effective.It is an inactive vaccine, which means the virus was grown in a lab and then killed. The germ is then injected into the body to generate an immune response.Final proof of its effectiveness will depend on publication of more data.Sinopharm is one of at least five Chinese developers that are in a global race to create vaccines for the disease that has killed more than 1.8 million people.In addition to the emergency vaccinations already underway, China plans to start vaccinating high-risk population, such as seniors as well as people with existing chronic illnesses. Officials did not say what percentage of the population they will vaccinate in China.“This is different in every country but the general thinking is that it has to reach 60% to protect the entire population,” said Zeng Yixin, vice minister of the National Health Commission.Practically, it means that the drug or product in question may be restricted for certain age groups, according to Tao Lina, a former government immunologist.Officials declined to name a particular price and gave conflicting statements about it. “It will certainly be in the limit of what people can afford,” said Zheng Zhongwei, a National Health Commission official.A minute later, Zeng, the other NHC official, stepped in to say that the vaccines “will definitely be free for the public.”The vaccine is already under mass production, though officials did not answer questions about current production capacity.Approval of China’s vaccine could also mean hope for countries around the world who may not have access to the Pfizer or Moderna shots, which have stricter cold chain requirements. Sinopharm’s vaccine is able to be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), or a normal refrigeration temperature.“This is very exciting that there is another vaccine and one that can be distributed in locations that don’t have the cold chain,” said Ashley St. John, an immunologist at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. “But at the same time we have to temper the excitement. We have to understand the long term efficacy, effect on transmission and effect on severe disease.”___Wu reported from Taipei, Taiwan.___The name of China’s drug regulator has been corrected to the National Medical Products Administration, not the Medical Production Administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-approves-first-homegrown-vaccine-said-to-be-79-3-effective/story-mzD7zGe0IwdXkSLYL9AXHJ.html
31-12-2020||World||Trump extends visa sanctions on nations refusing to repatriate their citizens||US President Donald Trump has indefinitely extended the visa sanctions on countries refusing to repatriate their citizens who violated laws in the United States. The visa sanctions on such countries were set to expire on December 31. Trump issued a memorandum on April 10 which empowered the Secretary of State and the homeland security secretary to deny visas to countries refusing to accept their citizens who violated American laws. “In light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the continuing public health risk it poses to Americans,” Trump said in a memorandum issued on Wednesday that his April 10 “memorandum shall continue in force until terminated by the president”. According to the April 10 memorandum, the secretary of state is authorised to “initiate a plan to impose the visa sanctions” if the Homeland Security Department determines a country not accepting returnees is delaying or impeding operations “necessary to respond to the ongoing pandemic”. The April 10 memorandum noted that countries “denying or unreasonably delaying” the repatriation of their citizens would be deemed to be causing “unacceptable public health risks for Americans”. “Countries that deny or unreasonably delay the acceptance of their citizens, subjects, nationals, or residents from the United States during the ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 create unacceptable public health risks for Americans,” Trump had said in his memorandum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-extends-visa-sanctions-on-nations-refusing-to-repatriate-their-citizens/story-CkNFIjVr3hwXXsMi10nlIM.html
31-12-2020||World||Pandemic made my last year in office the hardest, says Angela Merkel||Angela Merkel said in her last New Year’s address to the nation as German chancellor that 2020 was by far the most difficult of her 15-year leadership, yet the start of vaccinations against Covid-19 made 2021 a year of hope.In a rare show of emotion, Merkel, who steered Germany and the European Union (EU) through the 2008 financial crisis, the Greek debt crisis a year later and the migrant crisis five years ago, condemned a protest movement opposed to lockdowns and said she would get vaccinated when the shot is widely available.“Let me tell you something personal in conclusion: in nine months a parliamentary election will take place and I won’t be running again,” said Merkel, 66. “Today is therefore in all likelihood the last time I am able to deliver a New Year’s address to you.”She added: “I think I am not exaggerating when I say: never in the last 15 years have we found the old year so heavy and never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope.”Her message will resonate with most people in a country struggling with a rise in coronavirus infections and deaths and where a majority support lockdown measures and vaccination as the best weapons against the virus.Praise for Merkel, a trained physicist whose management of the pandemic has been guided by scientific advice, for having tamed the first wave has however turned to criticism of her perceived failure to tackle the second.Europe’s biggest economy holds an election in September and Merkel, whose conservatives are expected to win most seats in parliament, will most likely hand over the baton to one of three men vying to lead her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.“I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona or who are having to fight against the repercussions of an illness when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,” said Merkel.“Conspiracy theories are not only false and dangerous, they are also cynical and cruel,” she added. “I will also get vaccinated when my turn comes.”Merkel’s fourth and last term was marked by discontent within conservatives after losses in regional elections which many blamed on her decision to welcome more than one million asylum seekers in 2015.The setbacks at regional polls in 2018, in which conservatives lost voters to both the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the ecologist Greens, prompted her not to seek a fifth term.Should coalition building after September election drag on beyond December, Merkel will remain as caretaker chancellor in 2022 until a new government is in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-made-my-last-year-in-office-the-hardest-says-angela-merkel/story-iMnAuPyrT0nT5M9iSlMOvK.html

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said on Wednesday that it was tightening measures to ensure the safety and well-being of the crew and to safeguard public health in Singapore.Flight crew, who layover in “high-risk destinations”, will be required to undergo polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on three occasions - upon arrival in Singapore, and on the third and seventh day following their return, reported the Channel News Asia, citing a CAAS statement.The move follows the recent Covid-19 cases involving a Singapore Airlines (SIA) steward and a pilot. The crew will also be required to self-isolate until they receive a negative result from their seventh-day PCR test, said CAAS.The crew travelling to and from South Africa will also wear full personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 masks, face shields, protective gowns and gloves. These requirements have already been in place for crew travelling to and from the United Kingdom since December 24. South Africa and the UK have recently reported cases of the new variants of the coronavirus that are potentially more contagious. Singapore has reported 58,411 Covid-19 cases so far with 29 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-further-tightens-covid-19-measures-on-air-crew/story-8Zd5Xwtgy8XRPrLte274oM.html

McCain and USS Curtis Wilbur “conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit” in accordance with international law.Their movement “demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the Navy said in a statement on its website.China’s Defense Ministry called the move a “show of force” and a provocation that “sent the wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence forces’ and seriously endangered peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait area.”“We firmly oppose this,” the ministry said in a statement on its official microblog, adding that it monitored the ships’ passage from the air and sea. “The Chinese People’s Liberation Army at all times maintains a high level of alert and can respond at any time to any threat or provocation and resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”While China claims Taiwan as its own territory, the busy Taiwan Strait is generally considered an international waterway. China fiercely opposes any signal of US military support for Taiwan, a self-governing republic that relies on Washington for defensive weapons and political backing in the face of Chinese threats to annex the island by force.Taiwan’s Defense Ministry issued a statement saying it had observed the passage of the ships passage and that “the situation is normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-accuses-us-of-show-of-force-with-taiwan-strait-passage/story-GfXw8o4lFZ0c6JoCb15m4J.html

McCain and USS Curtis Wilbur had “conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit December 31 in accordance with international law”.“The ships’ transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows.”This is the 13th sailing through the strait by the US Navy this year.China’s Defence Ministry denounced the trip as “provocation” and “a show of force”, adding Chinese ships and aircraft trailed the US ships.The passage of the ships sent the wrong message to supporters of Taiwan independence and are a serious threat to peace and stability, it added.“The Chinese People’s Liberation Army maintains a high level of alert at all times, responds to all threats and provocations at all times, and resolutely defends national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the ministry said.Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said the ships had sailed in a northerly direction through the strait on what it termed an “ordinary mission”. Taiwan’s armed forces monitored the sailing and the situation is “as normal”, it added.China’s military said it had tailed the last US warship to pass through the Taiwan Strait on December 19, and denounced the mission.The day after that trip, Taiwan’s navy and air force deployed as a Chinese aircraft carrier group led by the country’s newest carrier, the Shandong, sailed through the Taiwan Strait.China said the group was on its way to routine drills in the disputed South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warships-transit-taiwan-strait-china-denounces-provocation/story-E53hEGEPNWL7fL7ubHWo5N.html

China has been unabashedly adversarial, so much so that it had even tried to prevent the council from condemning the Pulwama terror attack.India was last on the council in a two-year term ending 2012. That was the seventh. Its previous terms were 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985 and 1991-1992.Question: What are India’s objectives going into its eighth stint as a non-permanent member of the UNSC?Tirumurti: You are right, we are no strangers to the Security Council. This will be the eighth time that we will take our seat in the Security Council as an elected member. Every time India has been in the Security Council, we have contributed in a significant way to enhance peace and security – right from the first stint in the Council in 1950-51 when we played an important constructive role in the Korean War. In the council, we have stood for decolonisation (of) Africa and the Middle East, against apartheid, for developing countries, for democracy and rule of law, for multilateralism and for peace, security, human rights and development. We hope to reinforce these and work to combat terrorism, bring in reform, focus on maritime security and peace keeping, nudge the council towards peace building with greater participation of women and youth, and use technology for broader human welfare. But as importantly, India will work in an inclusive manner and try and bridge the fissures in the Council between the member states, exacerbated by Covid. Question: What are the prospects of achieving tangible progress in the reform of the UNSC, such as a movement towards adopting a text for negotiations? (Despite years of discussion, there is no document or a set of points to negotiate, accept or reject)Tirumurti: Well, the United Nations, which is the foremost multilateral body in the world today, is still stuck in 1945. The world has changed considerably since then and become truly multipolar. But the UN refuses to give space to a multipolar world thereby rendering multilateralism ineffective. The sad reality is that a handful of status-quoists have consistently opposed any reform and use the smoke-screen of what is called the Intergovernmental Negotiation (IGN) process to stop any move towards a consensus for reform. Unfortunately, this so-called process has dragged on for more than a decade without even commencing text-based negotiations. The naysayers are opposed to even the General Assembly rules of procedure to be applied to the IGN process. In the absence of General Assembly rules of procedure, no records are kept, there is no interpretation and no attribution to positions taken by member states. In other words, we have a process which is all talk and no action. We are determined to work with other like-minded countries to break this logjam. Question: Do you expect to use the stint to bolster India’s case for a permanent seat?Tirumurti: The process for the Security Council reforms happens initially in the General Assembly. However, our credentials have been established and acknowledged by almost all countries. But our tenure in the Security Council will give us an additional opportunity to demonstrate to the global community how important it is for the Security Council to be more representative and reflective of contemporary realities. Question: How will India use the term to address the most urgent crisis facing the world at the time, the Covid-19 pandemic?Tirumurti: At the outset, we need to remember that the mandate of the Security Council is primarily dealing with peace and security issues. The pandemic, while it is certainly a global crisis, is per se an issue that falls primarily in the realm of global health. Multilateral agencies such as World Health Organization are in the front line for pandemic response. In this context, what this crisis has demonstrated is that the global institutions are not equipped to handle a truly global crisis. In fact, plurilateral organisations such as the G20 have been more nimble and adept at addressing these Covid challenges. However, the Security Council will have to factor in the pandemic response while looking at global hot spots. For example, it broadly endorsed a call by the UN Secretary General for a global ceasefire, while making an exception for fighting terrorism. Question: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for increased multilateralism in a post-Covid-19 world. How will that play out in real terms at this multilateral forum?Tirumurti: PM Modi has actually called for reformed multilateralism. But yes, what the crisis has showed us is that genuine inclusive multilateralism is the way forward in a multipolar world. Today, there is talk of multilateralism in crisis. However, it is in crisis because countries do not see multilateralism delivering the results they desire. So, the Prime Minister’s call for reformed multilateralism is for reflecting this multipolarity in multilateral institutions and processes. My feeling is that reform in multilateralism is inevitable and the question is when and not if. Question: With a seat at the Security Council, will India be able to deal better with China’s obstructionist actions, such as its opposition to the designation of Masood Azhar, the founder of Jaish-e-Mohammad?Tirumurti: As far as terrorism is concerned, India’s position is crystal clear – we oppose terrorism and we have zero-tolerance for terrorism, no matter what its justification is. Many Pakistani terrorists and entities are already in the 1267 Sanctions list. In fact, Pakistan has the highest number of terrorists inscribed in this list in keeping with its reputation as the epicenter of terrorism. On China, let me just say that India has a positive and constructive agenda in the Security Council and we look forward to working closely with all members of the Council.Question: Indians will expect the non-permanent membership to be used to bring more attention on China’s growing aggression, which has raised concerns around the world. Do you think that will be a fair ask?Tirumurti: What we do in the Security Council is to deliberate on issues of common security concern for the world and not necessarily focus on bilateral issues. The history of our successive tenures in the Security Council is testament to the fact that we do not shy away from standing up for our sovereignty, for securing common security interests, for our principles and for international peace and security, no matter who the aggressor is. Question: How will India use the eighth term to advance the goal of combating terrorism in the neighbourhood and around the world?Tirumurti: We are one of the biggest victims of terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism. Decades of combating terrorism exported from our neighbour has resulted in steeling our determination against this menace. We will not accept any dilution of our fight against terrorism. We will not accept any justifications being given for terror, which some countries are doing their best to justify, even giving it a religious colour. Unfortunately, some like the UN Alliance of Civilisations are providing fodder for such justification. We are ready to stand with any country, inside the Security Council or outside, who are willing to advance our common objective to counterterrorism. We don’t want to go back to pre-9/11 days where the world was split into “your terrorist” and “my terrorist”. The world needs to guard against such attempts to skew the narrative. Question: India has been a world leader on climate change. The Prime Minister launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure at the UN in 2019. What more can be expected on this front in the next two years?Tirumurti: You are right. India is one of the few major economies to have walked the talk on climate change. According to the International Climate Action Tracker, India is the only country among the top five whose actions are on track to keep global warming below 2-degree Celsius target. We have already reduced our emission intensity by 21% over 2005 levels. Solar power has grown to 36GW. Our renewable energy capacity is already fourth largest in the world and will reach 175 GW by 2022. You mentioned the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. Besides that, the Prime Minister, along with the French President (Emmanuel Macron), also launched the International Solar Alliance which has been opened up for universal membership. India has already committed US$ 1.7 billion in soft loans for solar energy. You asked what more can be expected in the next two years. In fact, this is a question that we often ask to other countries who have made time-bound commitments but are nowhere near to fulfilling those. As the Prime Minister said recently, we should first review our achievements against targets already set. Only then will our voices be credible. We have called on the developed countries to not keep shifting the goal post of climate targets but demonstrate action, including those related to climate financing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-will-try-to-bridge-fissures-says-t-s-tirumurti-india-s-un-ambassador/story-CyKMmJ2sbHqJKEpA4RZ79J.html
31-12-2020||World||WHO, marking year since Covid-19 began, urges fair vaccine distribution to all||The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), marking a year since the first cases of the novel coronavirus were reported by China, urged countries on Wednesday to ensure that vaccines are made available to people at risk everywhere, not just in rich nations. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, appealed for $4 billion to buy Covid-19 vaccines for distribution in lower and middle-income countries through the COVAX vaccine facility.“This is the challenge we must rise to in the New Year,” Tedros said in a video message issued a day before the first anniversary of China reporting the first cases of pneumonia of unknown origin to the UN health agency.“Vaccines offer great hope to turn the tide of the pandemic. But to protect the world, we must ensure that all people at risk everywhere - not just in countries who can afford vaccines - are immunised,” he said.He also urged countries to combat conspiracy theories and attacks on science, saying “The choice is easy,” and the world can “walk the last miles of this crisis together, helping each other along the way, from sharing vaccines fairly, to offering accurate advice, compassion and care” to all who need them.The COVAX alliance, which aims to secure fair access to Covid-19 vaccines for poor countries, said on Dec. 18 it had agreements in place for nearly 2 billion doses, roughly doubling its supply, with the first deliveries due in early 2021.A WHO-led international mission of experts is due to visit China in the first week of January to investigate the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in the central city of Wuhan in December 2019.More than 81.84 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 1,788,443​ have died, according to a Reuters tally.“The likely scenario is the virus will become another endemic virus, a virus that will remain somewhat of a threat but a very low-level threat in the context of an effective global vaccination programme,” Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergency expert, told a press conference on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-marking-year-since-covid-19-began-urges-fair-vaccine-distribution-to-all/story-SG0aUxG5MkxFp4qNtCA9iN.html

The current production rate will allow the vaccine to be rolled out across Russia’s regions and be exported to other countries at the same time, Manturov said.Russia sent 300,000 doses of the vaccine to Argentina last week, causing frustration at home, with some people arguing that more shots should be made available at home.. Authorities on Wednesday reported 26,513 new daily coronavirus cases, including 5,105 in Moscow, pushing the national tally to 3,131,550 - the fourth highest in the world.Russia also said that 599 people had died in the last 24 hours, taking the official death toll to 56,426, though excess mortality data suggests the actual figure is around triple that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-to-distribute-over-1-mn-sputnik-v-shots-at-home-by-year-end-says-minister/story-2WlLgl6CJrfUS1wvpP33jI.html

Sharif, 70, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) supremo, has been living in London since November last year after the Lahore High Court granted him permission to go abroad for four weeks for treatment. The three-time former prime minister, who was convicted in two corruption cases -- Avenfield properties and Al-Azizia -- was declared a proclaimed offender earlier this month by the Islamabad High Court after he failed to appear before it despite several warnings. “(We) will cancel Nawaz Sharif’s passport on February 16,” Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told reporters here in response to a query. He, however, did not provide any further details. Meanwhile, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Accountability and Interior, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, said Pakistan had asked the British authorities to deport Sharif who was convicted by the courts. Pakistan currently has no extradition treaty with Britain. Prime Minister Imran Khan in October had said he would contact his British counterpart Boris Johnson, if needed, to discuss Sharif’s deportation. Sharif resigned as Pakistan prime minister in 2017 after the Supreme Court disqualified him from holding public office and ruled that graft cases be filed against the beleaguered leader and his children over the Panama Papers scandal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nawaz-sharif-s-passport-will-be-cancelled-on-feb-16-says-pak-minister/story-GDGgsmeasUU0RobSn9lZVI.html
31-12-2020||World||Census Bureau to miss deadline, jeopardizing Trump plan||The Census Bureau will miss a year-end deadline for handing in numbers used for divvying up congressional seats, a delay that could undermine President Donald Trump’s efforts to exclude people in the country illegally from the count if the figures aren’t submitted before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.The Census Bureau plans to deliver a population count of each state in early 2021, as close to the missed deadline as possible, the statistical agency said in a statement late Wednesday.“As issues that could affect the accuracy of the data are detected, they are corrected,” the statement said. “The schedule for reporting this data is not static. Projected dates are fluid.”It will be the first time that the Dec. 31 target date is missed since the deadline was implemented more than four decades ago by Congress.Internal documents obtained earlier this month by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform show that Census Bureau officials don’t expect the apportionment numbers to be ready until days after Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20.Once in office, Biden could rescind Trump’s presidential memorandum directing the Census Bureau to exclude people in the country illegally from numbers used for divvying up congressional seats among the states. An influential GOP adviser had advocated excluding them from the apportionment process in order to favor Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.“The delay suggests that the census bureau needs more time to ensure the accuracy of census numbers for all states,” said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former congressional staffer who specializes in census issues.By law the Commerce Department must present the president by year’s end with population figures from the 2020 census, data then used to determine how many seats in Congress each state gets. The president then is required to submit the numbers to Congress in early January. The Commerce Department oversees the Census Bureau, which conducts the once-a-decade head count of every US resident.However, there are no penalties for missing the deadline.“For the Census Bureau, goals No. 1 , 2 and 3 are completeness, accuracy and usefulness. They like to maintain the schedule, but that can’t be a priority for them,” said Kenneth Prewitt, a former Census Bureau director during President Bill Clinton’s administration.Besides deciding how many House seats each state gets, the census is used for determining how $1.5 trillion in federal funding is distributed each year.Trump’s July order on apportionment was challenged in more than a half dozen lawsuits around the US, but the Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that any challenge was premature, allowing the plan to move forward. The Census Bureau hasn’t publicly revealed how it plans to determine who is in the country illegally since the Supreme Court last year prohibited a citizenship question from being added to the census questionnaire.After the pandemic caused hiring shortages and prompted the Census Bureau to suspend field operations in the spring, the statistical agency asked Congress for extensions. The requests included one that would push the deadline for handing in the apportionment numbers from the end of the year to next spring.At the time, Trump said, “This is called an act of God. This is called a situation that has to be. They have to give it.”The request passed the Democratic-controlled House but went nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate after Trump issued his order.A coalition of municipalities and advocacy groups sued the Trump administration after it changed the schedule once again to shorten census field operations by a month and return to the Dec. 31 deadline for handing in the apportionment numbers. The plaintiffs argued the count was shortened by the Commerce Department so that census data-crunching happened while Trump was still in office, and they said it would cause minorities to be undercounted.They also worried that the shortened field operations and data processing would jeopardize the count’s accuracy and completeness. Bureau statisticians have been given only half the time originally planned to crunch the numbers, and Census Bureau director Steven Dillingham said last month that agency statisticians had found anomalies in the 2020 data that have popped up in past censuses.The Census Bureau’s watchdog agency on Wednesday said it was concerned about lapses in quality control checks meant to detect falsifications by census takers. The Office of Inspector General said the Census Bureau failed to complete 355,000 re-interviews of households to verify their information was accurate.Even top Census Bureau officials internally questioned being able to meet the Dec. 31 deadline, with associate director Tim Olson telling colleagues in an email that anyone who thought the census numbers could be crunched by year’s end “has either a mental deficiency or a political motivation.” The email was disclosed in the litigation.Former Census Bureau director John Thompson said the quality of the data is “the overarching issue” facing the Census Bureau.“If these are not addressed, then it is very possible that stakeholders including the Congress may not accept the results for various purposes including apportionment,” said Thompson, who oversaw 2020 census preparation as the agency’s leader during the Obama administration.He said in an email that missing the Dec. 31 target date “means that the Census Bureau is choosing to remove known errors from the 2020 Census instead of meeting the legal deadline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/census-bureau-to-miss-deadline-jeopardizing-trump-plan/story-6O6WvNiIALcRgeAGlhpSyO.html
31-12-2020||World||Biden picks first woman to serve as deputy defense secretary||President-elect Joe Biden will nominate former Pentagon official Kathleen Hicks to serve as the first female deputy defense secretary, saying he wanted someone who knows the department “inside and out” to help restore order to an agency he says was cast into disarray by President Donald Trump.Colin Kahl, who served as Biden’s national security adviser when he was vice president, will be nominated for undersecretary of defense for policy.The new additions to Biden’s national security team, announced Wednesday, signal a return to experienced hands after Trump has run through a number of defense leaders, including two confirmed secretaries and three acting secretaries of defense. Biden complained Monday that critical national security posts have been “hollowed out” in personnel, capacity and morale.Also Read: Joe Biden to block still-pending Trump administration regulationsHicks and Kahl would report to Lloyd Austin, the retired four-star Army general and Raytheon Technologies Corp. board member who Biden has tapped to be secretary of Defense.Austin’s nomination faces an additional hurdle in that both chambers of Congress would have to approve a waiver to a law prohibiting recently retired military officers to fill the top civilian job at the department. Neither Hicks nor Kahl have served in the military.Hicks, who heads Biden’s Pentagon transition team, is a think-tank expert on national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and is on the board of Aerospace Corporation.

A source familiar with his travel said Phillips flew commercial on Dec. 13 from Toronto to Antigua and then on to St. Barts, a popular vacation spot for the rich and famous over the Christmas holidays. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about his travel.The finance minister’s Twitter account had suggested that he was in Ontario while he has been in St. Barts.Phillips also travelled to Switzerland in August.“Some Canadians are still travelling for nonessential reasons.

31-12-2020||World||Germany: Merkel urges discipline in long, harsh winter to beat pandemic||In her last New Year’s address as chancellor, Angela Merkel called on Germans to remain disciplined in the fight against the coronavirus.The German leader -- who will step down after elections in September -- said perseverance would be needed during a harsh winter as a vaccination campaign ramps up. Amid concerns about its safety, she said she would get the shot as soon as it’s her turn.“These days and weeks -- there is nothing to sugar coat -- are difficult times for our country,” Merkel said in the text of a speech to be broadcast late Thursday. “And so it will continue to be for quite a while.”Germany is struggling to contain the spread of Covid-19, like many of its neighbors. Deaths jumped to a record on Wednesday and intensive care units threaten to become overloaded. Contagion rates are more than double government targetsIt’s a similar situation in other European countries. Spain on Wednesday said 9,860 new coronavirus cases were diagnosed, the highest daily number since the start of the pandemic. Earlier this week, Covid-19 fatalities in the country surpassed 50,000.Read more: Europe Faces Mounting Vaccine Pressure as German Deaths JumpMerkel’s comments indicate that restrictions to contain the disease will continue beyond Jan. 10, when most curbs are currently set to expire. The chancellor will meet with the premiers of Germany’s 16 states next week to discuss whether to keep non-essential stores, gyms and restaurants shut for longer.Even though vaccines will gradually be made available across the population, “the tasks ahead remain gigantic,” Merkel said, urging Germans to show the same solidarity and discipline next year that had gotten them through the pandemic so far.Europe’s largest economy has provided relatively generous aid packages to help businesses cushion the blow from lockdown rules. The spending has caused total new borrowing this year and next to balloon to over 300 billion euros ($369 billion), creating tensions within Merkel’s coalition.Merkel defended the spending, saying state aid helped ease uncertainty and even “existential fears” for people like shop owners, freelancers and artists.The somber tone belies a successful close to Germany’s European Union presidency. At the tail end of the six-month term, Merkel helped secure backing for the bloc’s landmark spending and recovery package, finalized a post-Brexit trade deal with the U.K. and completed an investment pact with China.Her final full year in office was probably her toughest.“Never in the last 15 years have any of us felt the outgoing year to be so weary,” Merkel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-merkel-urges-discipline-in-long-harsh-winter-to-beat-pandemic/story-qgvoYQPo4CHerOvBojN3DN.html
31-12-2020||World||Joe Biden to block still-pending Trump administration regulations||President-elect Joe Biden will issue a memo effective Inauguration Day that will block actions taken by the outgoing administration that haven’t yet become official, the transition team announced Wednesday.Jen Psaki, incoming White House press secretary, said the move will curb “midnight” regulations and actions. She cited a Trump Labor Department plan to make it easier for companies to classify employees as contractors, who typically don’t get overtime pay or health benefits.“The memo will potentially freeze this rule and not allow it to be implemented,” Psaki said.Incoming administrations historically issue a memo freezing new rules that have been announced but not yet published in the Federal Register. By suspending their publication, the new administration can wipe away such final rules and rewrite or abandon them.Also Read | California announces first confirmed case of virus variantPresident Donald Trump’s administration has been rushing to finalize a slew of regulations governing air pollution, energy efficiency and endangered species before Biden is sworn in. In addition to the forthcoming Labor Department rule, the administration is working now to finish new measures governing foreign agricultural workers and a regulation that would block the Environmental Protection Agency from relying on scientific research that isn’t or can’t be made public.While Biden officials can unwind many Trump rules, doing so will consume time and resources, generally requiring the creation of replacement rules through a formal notice-and-comment process that is designed to move slowly.The Inauguration Day memo would mean a potentially easier process for rewriting or scrapping late-moving Trump rules. Typically 60 days must pass for major rules to become effective after publication in the Federal Register.The Biden transition team also complained that the Trump administration isn’t doing enough to cooperate with the incoming administration.“Make no mistake, this lack of cooperation has real world implications, most concerningly as it relates to our national security,” said transition spokesman Yohannes Abraham. “This intentionally generated opacity makes it harder for our government to protect the American people moving forward.”An Office of Management and Budget official said the office had provided all factual information and has taken 45 meetings with the transition team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-block-still-pending-trump-administration-regulations/story-yHx8T5AjO2pIKeS89gufxH.html
31-12-2020||World||California announces first confirmed case of new Covid-19 variant||California on Wednesday announced its first confirmed case of the new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus, the second case documented in the United States in a day.Governor Gavin Newsom announced the infection found in Southern California during an online conversation with Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.“I don’t think Californians should think that this is odd. It’s to be expected,” Fauci said.Newsom did not provide any other details about the person who was infected.The first person in the US known to be infected with the variant was identified Wednesday as a Colorado National Guardsman who had been sent to help out at a nursing home struggling with an outbreak. Health officials said a second Guard member may have it too.The cases have triggered a host of questions about how the version circulating in England arrived in the US and whether it is too late to stop it now, with top experts saying it is probably already spreading elsewhere in the United States.“The virus is becoming more fit, and we’re like a deer in the headlights,” warned Dr. Eric Topol, head of Scripps Research Translational Institute. He noted that the US does far less genetic sequencing of virus samples to discover variants than other developed nations, and thus was probably slow to detect this new mutation.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 pandemicThe two Guard members had been dispatched on Dec. 23 to work at the Good Samaritan Society nursing home in the small town of Simla, in a mostly rural area about 90 miles outside Denver, said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist. They were among six Guard members sent to the home.Nasal swab samples taken from the two as part of the Guard’s routine coronavirus testing were sent to the state laboratory, which began looking for the variant after its spread was announced in Britain earlier this month, Herlihy said. Samples from staff and residents at the nursing home are also being screened for the variant at the lab, but so far no evidence of it has been found, she said.The confirmed Colorado case, first announced Tuesday, is in a man in his 20s who had not traveled recently, officials said. He has mild symptoms and is isolating at his home near Denver, while the person with the suspected case is isolating at a Colorado hotel while further genetic analysis is done on his sample, officials said.The nursing home said it is working closely with the state and is also looking forward to beginning vaccinations next week.Several states, including California, Massachusetts and Delaware, are also analyzing suspicious virus samples for the variant, said Dr. Greg Armstrong, who directs genetic sequencing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He said the CDC is working with a national lab that gets samples from around the country to broaden that search, with results expected within days.The discovery in Colorado has added urgency to the nation’s vaccination drive against Covid-19, which has killed more than 340,000 people in the US.Read more| United States facing 4 historic crises at once, says Joe BidenBritain is seeing infections soar and hospitalizations climb to their highest levels on record. The variant has also been found in several other countries.Scientists have found no evidence that it is more lethal or causes more severe illness, and they believe the vaccines now being dispensed will be effective against it. But a faster-spreading virus could swamp hospitals with seriously ill patients.The discovery overseas led the CDC to issue rules on Christmas Day requiring travelers arriving from Britain to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test. But US health officials said the Colorado patient’s lack of travel history suggests the new variant is already spreading in this country.Topol said it is too late for travel bans.“We’re behind in finding it. Colorado is likely one of many places it’s landed here,” he said. “It’s all over the place. How can you ban travel from everywhere?”Colorado public health officials are conducting contact tracing to determine its spread.Researchers estimate the variant is 50% to 70% more contagious, said Dr. Eric France, Colorado’s chief medical officer.“Instead of only making two or three other people sick, you might actually spread it to four or five people,” France said. “That means we’ll have more cases in our communities. Those number of cases will rise quickly and, of course, with more cases come more hospitalizations.”London and southeast England were placed under strict lockdown measures earlier this month because of the variant, and dozens of countries banned flights from Britain. France also briefly barred trucks from Britain before allowing them back in, provided the drivers got tested for the virus.New versions of the virus have been seen almost since it was first detected in China a year ago. It is common for viruses to undergo minor changes as they reproduce and move through a population. The fear is that mutations at some point will become significant enough to defeat the vaccines.South Africa has also discovered a highly contagious Covid-19 variant that is driving the country’s latest spike of cases, hospitalizations and deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-announces-first-confirmed-case-of-virus-variant/story-MKBXaGUQzrPNJsRCB7SKAJ.html
31-12-2020||World||New York should ban small-business evictions: Ocasio-Cortez||US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called on Governor Andrew Cuomo to extend his statewide ban on evictions to include small businesses.The outspoken Democrat also suggested that New York should extend rent protections to vulnerable small businesses and that the federal government should step in to help with rents and mortgages nationwide. Under legislation signed this week, New Yorkers suffering from financial hardships due to the coronavirus pandemic will be protected from evictions and foreclosures until May 1.“Our priority should be to keep people housed and prevent economic collapse of the family and local small businesses that are the backbone of our communities,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.Cuomo echoed the call on Wednesday but said state lawmakers should be the ones to take up legislation that will protect commercial tenants and small businesses, including a ban on late fees and penalties. Landlords should recognize that if they kick out a tenant, there’s unlikely to be anyone to replace them until the economy improves, he said.“If the legislature doesn’t do it, or doesn’t do it quickly, then I would do an executive order to do it,” he said at a virus briefing. “But I’d rather see them just close the loopholes in the bill so there’s no confusion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-should-ban-small-business-evictions-ocasio-cortez/story-2zCoM4J0RFpCeYrx0C4HRJ.html
31-12-2020||World||Mitch McConnell rules out passing house bill with $2,000 payments||Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday closed off chances of the Senate acting anytime soon on a House bill that would give most Americans $2,000 stimulus payments.The Kentucky Republican said the House legislation, approved in a bipartisan vote Monday, “has no realistic path” to quick passage in the Senate and that it falls short of the demands of President Donald Trump. He again blocked an attempt by Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to adopt the House bill to increase the payments to $2,000 from the $600 by unanimous consent.The Senate instead will work on combining the stimulus payments with measures on election integrity and rolling back social media liability protections, he said. That responds to all three issues Trump has said he wants, but a bill melding them likely will alienate enough senators in both parties to leave prospects for bigger stimulus payments dead in the Senate.“The Senate is not going to be bullied into rushing out more borrowed money into the hands of the Democrats’ rich friends who don’t need the help,” McConnell said. The House bill would raise the income cutoff to receive a payment.The clash over the payments also is entangling another piece of year-end business in the Senate -- a vote to override Trump’s veto of a $740.5 billion defense policy bill. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ed Markey of Massachusetts said they would continue to delay the defense legislation vote unless McConnell relents and allows a vote on a standalone bill on the bigger stimulus checks.“We are saying to Mitch McConnell, to allow the United States Senate to do what it’s supposed to do, and that is the vote,” Sanders told reporters. “The House passed the bill, it’s over here right now. Do you want to vote against it? Then vote against it.”Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey later blocked an attempt by Sanders to call up the House bill for a roll call vote.Trump’s pressureMcConnell and many other Republicans oppose taking up the House legislation despite increasingly angry statements by Trump urging the Senate to raise the stimulus payments to $2,000 from the $600 that was in the bill he signed into law on Sunday.“Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH! Also, get rid of Section 230 - Don’t let Big Tech steal our Country, and don’t let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!” Trump tweeted on Tuesday, repeating his unfounded claim of election fraud in November.That’s created a bind for the GOP. Georgia Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler came out in favor of the higher payments on Tuesday as they campaigned in a close contest that will be settled in a Jan. 5 runoff. Their Democratic opponents, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, had previously endorsed the $2,000 checks. The runoff will determine control of the Senate.Other Republican also are publicly on board, including Marco Rubio of Florida and Missouri’s Josh Hawley, both of whom are potential contenders for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.Republican critics of the House measure have focused on a feature of the bill which allows some payments to go to people with six-figure incomes.Income limitsMarried couples with a combined adjusted gross income of $150,000 or less and individuals who make $75,000 or less annually would be eligible for the full $2,000 per person amount. The payments are less for higher incomes, based on family size. For example, a single adult earning less than $115,000, a married couple earning up to $230,000, and a family of four with as much as $310,000 in annual income would get a portion of the $2,000 per person.“The problem with $2,000 is not targeted. It goes to people who didn’t lose any money,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican. “If we are going to spend that much money my preference is to target it.”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sidestepped a question about whether she would try to revive the legislation when the new Congress convenes after Jan. 3 if the Senate doesn’t act this week.The legislation “would have bipartisan support in the Senate if Mitch McConnell would only allow it to come to the floor instead of being an obstruction to those checks going to the American people.” she said at her weekly news conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mitch-mcconnell-rules-out-passing-house-bill-with-2-000-payments/story-inZOr9bgchjy4SAsabW36J.html

President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the Middle East’s biggest buyer of American weapons, in a bid to pressure Riyadh to end a war in Yemen that has caused the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.The package would include 3,000 GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I) munitions, containers, support equipment, spares and technical support, the Pentagon said.“The proposed sale will improve Saudi Arabia’s capability to meet current and future threats by increasing its stocks of long-range, precision air-to-ground munitions,” the Pentagon said in a statement. It added that “the size and accuracy of the SDB I allows for an effective munition with less collateral damage.”The Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale on Tuesday. Members of Congress have been angered by steep civilian casualties in Yemen and earlier this year tried and failed to block the sale of F-35 warplanes to Riyadh.Despite approval by the State Department, the notification does not indicate that a contract has been signed or that negotiations have concluded.The Pentagon said Boeing Co was the prime contractor for the weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-state-department-approves-potential-sale-of-3-000-smart-bombs-to-saudi-arabia/story-UCEpr9bG9DHVnRZY82y6LJ.html
31-12-2020||World||Airport blasts kill 30 as unity govt lands in Yemen||Multiple explosions and gunfire rocked Yemen’s Aden airport on Wednesday as a new cabinet flew in from its refuge in Saudi Arabia, killing at least 30 people and wounding 60 others, according to the Al-Masdar news website.Al-Masdar said a deputy minister of public works was killed, and two other vice ministers were wounded in the attack, which took place as cabinet members prepared to step off the plane. They had returned to Aden amid a heavy security presence and were whisked to their headquarters at the presidential palace after the assault.President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi blamed Iran-backed Houthi rebels who have been fighting the government since 2014, and vowed that violence won’t deter the government from working to normalise life in the war-battered nation, the Saba news agency reported. No one claimed responsibility.A blast was later heard near the presidential palace after the cabinet was taken there. The Saudi-led military coalition that’s been trying to restore Hadi to power said it intercepted a Houthi drone trying to target the compound.AP footage from the scene showed members of the government delegation disembarking as the blast shook the grounds. Many ministers rushed back inside the plane or ran down the stairs, seeking shelter.Thick smoke rose into the air from near the terminal building. Officials at the scene said they saw bodies lying on the tarmac and elsewhere at the airport.Yemeni Communication Minister Naguib al-Awg, who was also on the plane, told The Associated Press that he heard two explosions, suggesting they were drone attacks. Yemeni Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed and the others were quickly whisked from the airport to Mashiq Palace in the city.“It would have been a disaster if the plane was bombed,” he said, insisting the plane was the target of the attack as it was supposed to land earlier.Saeed tweeted that he and his cabinet were safe and unhurt. He called the explosions a “cowardly terrorist act” that was part of the war on “the Yemeni state and our great people.”Mohammed al-Roubid, deputy head of Aden’s health office, told the AP that at least 16 people were killed in the explosion and 60 were wounded.Images shared on social media from the scene showed rubble and broken glass strewn about near the airport building and at least two lifeless bodies, one of them charred, lying on the ground. In another image, a man was trying to help another man whose clothes were torn to get up from the ground.According to one Yemeni security official, three Red Cross workers were among the wounded, though it was not clear if they were Yemenis or of other nationalities. He and other officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.U.N. special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, condemned the explosion as an “unacceptable act of violence.” He said in a tweet that it was “a tragic reminder of the importance of bringing #Yemen urgently back on the path towards peace.”The ministers were returning to Aden from the Saudi capital, Riyadh, after being sworn in last week as part of a reshuffle following a deal with rival southern separatists. Yemen’s internationally recognized government has worked mostly from self-imposed exile in Riyadh during the country’s years-long civil war.The Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed al-Jaber, described the attack as a “cowardly terrorist act targeting the Yemeni people, their security and stability.”Despite “the disappointment and confusion caused by those who create death and destruction,” the peace agreement between the government and southern separatists “will go forward,” he insisted.Yemen’s embattled President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, in exile in Saudi Arabia, announced a Cabinet reshuffle earlier this month.The reshuffle was seen as a major step toward closing a dangerous rift between Hadi’s government and southern separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates. The Saudi-backed government is at war with with Iran-allied Houthi rebels, who control most of northern Yemen as well as the country’s capital, Sanaa.Naming a new government was part of a power-sharing deal between the Saudi-backed Hadi and the Emirati-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council, an umbrella group of militias seeking to restore an independent southern Yemen, which existed from 1967 until unification in 1990.The blast underscores the dangers facing Hadi’s government in the port city, which was a scene of bloody fighting between forces of the internationally recognized government and the UAE-backed separatists.Last year, the Houthis fired a missile at a military parade of newly graduated fighters of a militia loyal to the UAE at a military base in Aden, killing dozens.In 2015, then-Yemeni Prime Minister Khaled Bahah and members of his government survived a missile attack, blamed on the Houthis, on an Aden hotel used by the government.Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, has been engulfed in civil war since 2014, when the Shiite Houthi rebels overran the north and Sanaa. The following year, a Saudi-led military coalition intervened to wage war on the Houthis and restore Hadi’s government to power.The war has killed more than 112,000, including thousands of civilians. The conflict also resulted in the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airport-blasts-kill-30-as-unity-govt-lands-in-yemen/story-qLV0OigaeHRaQBPYxjn8SJ.html
31-12-2020||World||Chinese court jails 10 Hong Kong democracy activists for up to three years||A Chinese court on Wednesday jailed 10 Hong Kong democracy activists for up to three years over a bid to flee the city by speedboat to Taiwan, as a crackdown on dissent in the territory intensifies.The group was arrested by the Chinese coastguard on August 23 en route to the self-ruled island, which has quietly opened its doors to Hongkongers seeking sanctuary.The court in the southern city of Shenzhen sentenced Tang Kai-yin to three years in jail and Quinn Moon to two years for organising an illegal border crossing.The eight others were sentenced to seven months behind bars for illegally crossing the border.The sentencing follows the imposition of a sweeping new security law in Hong Kong this year that has given the government broad powers to prosecute political dissidents.A number of activists have fled the city for overseas and political organisations have shuttered their doors as Beijing seeks to keep a lid on unrest that rocked the financial hub for months last year.A total of 12 people were caught on the boat and the group were facing prosecution in Hong Kong related to last year’s protests before attempting their escape. They will likely be hit with further charges in the city after serving their mainland sentences.Two minors from the so-called “Hong Kong 12”, aged 17 and 18, were returned to the city on Wednesday after they admitted wrongdoing, Chinese officials said.The pair face charges of conspiracy to commit arson and possession of an offensive weapon and have been remanded in custody ahead of their next court appearance.The 10 adults first appeared before the Shenzhen court on Monday, but the trial -- like many in China’s opaque legal system -- was not open to foreign reporters or diplomats.These 10 were also fined up to 20,000 yuan (US$3,060) in addition to their jail terms.But the Yantian District People’s Procuratorate said it would not pursue its case against the two teenagers, surnamed Hoang and Liu.- Going fishing -Families of the accused were only notified of the trial date three days before the hearing and were unable to attend due to the short notice and Covid-19 restrictions.Their lawyers were barred from meeting the detainees, with authorities instead appointing state-approved legal representation.The lawyers on Wednesday said the sentences were too heavy and the allegation of organising a border crossing was not substantiated.According to mainland Chinese media, Tang bought the boat in August and learnt basic driving skills for the escape, while Quinn Moon was responsible for communicating with the rest of the group, urging them to tell the coastguard they were going fishing if caught.They all pleaded guilty to the crime and signed confession papers in the presence of lawyers, said the Southern Daily, a mouthpiece of the Guangdong provincial Communist Party committee.- ‘Fleeing tyranny’ -The United States on Monday called for the immediate release of the group, saying it was “fleeing tyranny”. “Communist China will stop at nothing to prevent its people from seeking freedom elsewhere,” a US embassy spokesperson told AFP. Amnesty International said in a statement that the group were at risk of torture serving sentences in mainland Chinese jails.“These sentences meted out after an unfair trial lay bare the dangers faced by anybody who finds themselves tried under the Chinese criminal system,” said Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Regional Director Yamini Mishra.“The Chinese authorities have shown the world once again that political activists will not receive a fair trial.”China’s foreign ministry on Monday pushed back against comments by foreign countries on the case.Washington must “immediately stop interfering in China’s internal affairs through the Hong Kong issue and immediately stop interfering in China’s judicial sovereignty”, spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters.The security law that now blankets Hong Kong gives authorities sweeping powers of prosecution for acts deemed terrorism, secession, subversion or collusion with foreign entities. The city had enjoyed unique freedoms since its handover from former colonial power Britain in 1997, with a deal promising a “one country, two systems” arrangement for 50 years. Beijing says the new security law was needed to restore peace and stability but critics have condemned it as a fatal attack on Hong Kong’s freedoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-jails-10-hong-kong-democracy-activists-for-up-to-three-years/story-dSidqEv3botwiOxJaVCa0H.html
31-12-2020||World||Russia opens new criminal case against Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny||Russian state investigators said on Tuesday they had opened a new criminal case against Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, accusing him of fraudulently spending public donations to organisations he controls on his personal needs.The move is likely to be seen as the latest sign that the Kremlin does not want Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany, to return to Russia after what Berlin and other Western nations say was an attempt in August to murder him with a nerve agent.Navalny is one of President Vladimir Putin’s leading critics and the Kremlin has said he is free to return home just like any other Russian citizen, something he has said he plans to do. It has said it has seen no evidence he was poisoned however and has denied any involvement in the August incident which saw him collapse on a plane before being airlifted to Germany.Russia’s Investigative Committee, which looks into serious crimes, late on Tuesday accused Navalny and unnamed individuals of large-scale fraud, saying he and others had spent 356 million roubles ($4.81 million) donated to organisations he controls on their personal needs.That, it said in a statement, included purchasing goods and services and covering personal expenses such as overseas trips.Navalny responded to the case on Twitter, saying it was fabricated and looked like a hysterical action ordered by Putin. He said he had predicted that the authorities would seek to jail him after failing to kill him.The Kremlin earlier on Tuesday declined to comment on other potential legal action against Navalny. Putin has said that media reports that Russian state security agents poisoned Navalny were part of a U.S.-backed plot to try to discredit him. He said Navalny was not important enough to be a target.Russia’s prison service on Monday gave Navalny another potential legal headache in the form of a last minute ultimatum: Fly back from Germany at once and report early on Tuesday morning, or be jailed if you return after that deadline. Navalny was unable to return in time.The prison service said a suspended sentence in an earlier and separate theft case Navalny says was politically-motivated could be changed to a real jail term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-opens-new-criminal-case-against-kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny/story-eLYUKUgBCJ4eLxJQf6JKkO.html

31-12-2020||World||British govt places millions under tight restrictions as Covid-19 cases soar||The British government on Wednesday extended its toughest coronavirus restrictions to more than three-quarters of England’s population, saying a fast-spreading new variant of the virus has reached most of the country.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that at midnight the government’s top infection-warning level, Tier 4, would be expanded beyond London and the southeast to cover large swaths of central, northern and southwest England, including the major cities of Manchester and Birmingham. The move will severely curtail New Year’s Eve celebrations in parts of England that are home to 44 million people, or 78% of the population.In England’s Tier 4, most people are advised to stay home, barred from mixing with the members of other households either indoors or out, nonessential shops are shut and restaurants and bars can only offer takeout.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also have implemented strong lockdown measures.Hospitals in the worst-hit areas of London and southern England are becoming increasingly overstretched, with ambulances unable to unload patients at some hospitals where all the beds are occupied. There are more people in hospitals with COVID-19 now than at the first peak of the outbreak in April.Britain has recorded more than 72,500 confirmed coronavirus deaths, the second-highest death toll in Europe after Italy. The country reported a record number of new confirmed cases on Tuesday, more than 53,000, and 50,023 on Wednesday.The U.K. also reported Wednesday that another 981 people with the coronavirus had died. It’s the highest daily figure reported since April, though it follows a lag in reporting over the Christmas holidays.Hancock said Wednesday’s authorization of a second vaccine for use in the U.K. was good news, but “sharply rising cases and the hospitalizations that follow demonstrate the need to act where the virus is spreading.”He told lawmakers in the House of Commons that the medicines regulator’s approval of the vaccine made by British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and Oxford University “brings forward the day on which we can lift the restrictions,”“But…we must act to suppress the virus now, especially as the new variant makes the time between now and then even more difficult.”In addition to the wider restrictions, the government delayed the return to school after the Christmas break for millions of students. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said secondary schools in England would not resume in-person teaching until Jan. 11, though most primary schools would go back on Monday as planned.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and another already in use developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany company BioNTech meant “there are plenty of reasons for people to be optimistic about the spring.”However, Johnson said, “people should not in any way think that this is over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-govt-places-millions-under-tight-restrictions-as-covid-19-cases-soar/story-TRyeVJrvFBRpq355PSGYtI.html

After intervention by the Supreme Court in 2015, the local community had agreed to its reconstruction. Despite the reconstruction, there was a dispute over the land allocated to the temple. This also led to some misunderstanding between the temple supporters and local clerics. Eyewitnesses said that hundreds of people set fire to the building on Wednesday. They surrounded and vandalised the temple for hours but police did not intervene.Local media quoted advocate Rohit Kumar, a representative of the Hindu community, as saying that the temple did not exceed the agreed area and that residents violated the agreement by vandalising the temple.No case has been registered and neither any arrest made so far in the incident. Pakistan’s federal Parliamentary Secretary for Human Rights Lal Chand Malhi strongly condemned the vandalisation by “some anti-social elements”.Hindus are the biggest minority in Pakistan. According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan’s Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents. They often complain of harassment by the extremists.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hindu-temple-in-pakistan-vandalised-set-on-fire/story-06WMhxga1WvRXA4shTjtlI.html

31-12-2020||India||Elaborate distribution plan on track as India awaits vaccine approval||India is gearing up to roll out a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and has put in a place an elaborate air and road transport network, and identified locations where it will be administered to people eligible for a dose in the first phase.A nod by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation’s Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on the application by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) for emergency use authorisation of its Covishield vaccine is expected this in the coming days, and will then go to the drug regulator for a final approval. The committee has been vetting the data from safety and efficacy trials conducted by SII.The adenovirus vaccine has been developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, which received regulatory approval in the UK on Wednesday, brightening the chances of Covishield getting the green light from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI).Described as a “vaccine for the world,” the manufactured-in-India candidate will meet a large part of India’s vaccination needs because it is cheaper, easier to store and transport and likely be available in greater quantities than the vaccines developed by Pfizer/ BioNTech. Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 pandemicThe drugs controller’s stamp of approval will shift the focus from the national capital to Hadapsar in Pune. The sprawling suburb full of techno parks is home to SII’s Covid-19 vaccine production facilities. Special cargo planes with cold boxes storage space and refrigerated vans will start ferrying vials of the vaccine from Pune to various parts of the country, officials with knowledge of the government’s vaccination plan said. State administrations will then distribute the vials to district authorities for delivery to the hundreds of thousands of inoculation centres to be set up across India. The process will span over several weeks.The initial lots of the vaccine will be sent only to government hospitals, public health centres or large private hospitals, the people cited above said. The first two priority groups—health care and other frontline workers such as police personnel -- will be vaccinated at these sites only. To administer the vaccine to the remaining high-risk population -- elderly adults, and those suffering from comorbidities -- polling booths, wedding halls, community centres, and mobile vans will be used as inoculation centres. Read more| India likely to start the new year with a Covid vaccine, hints DCGIOnce DGCI’s approval is granted, the national expert group on the Covid-19 vaccine will send an order to SII with specific details of how many vials (each vial of the vaccine will contain multiple doses) are to be shipped to each destination. The vaccines will be transported by air and road, but not by rail -- at least for now. “There is no plan to use refrigerated vans of Indian Railways as of now. For destinations near Pune, vaccines would be delivered by road. On longer routes, cargo flights will carry the pallets,” said the first official cited above. While the logistics and cold chains will be monitored primarily by the government, it will be SII’s responsibility to deliver the vaccines at the designated consignee points. “SII has the obligation to deliver it safely at the specific places and hand it over to the state or central officials. Once the handover is done, the responsibility of further distribution lies entirely with the government,” said a second official. India has 137 airports covering all 28 states and eight Union territories and as of March 2017 the road network spanned 5.8 million kilometres, according to official data. The country with the world’s largest universal immunisation programme has also set up fixed consignee points — or places for handing over vaccine shipments to the states -- in capital cities and prominent urban centres. “We are using these points for the last many years for our UIP. It will be a similar drill for the Covid vaccines,” said the second official cited above.The vaccines will be stocked at four Government Medical Store Depots (in Karnal, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata) and state and regional vaccine stores. Refrigerated vans will bring these vaccines to the last point in the cold chain , typically located in Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and Community Health Centres. “Transportation of vaccines from states and regional stores to divisions and districts would be done in cold boxes using insulated vaccine vans. Vaccines carriers with ice packs are used to transport vaccines from PHCs to the outreach sessions in the village,” said the first official cited above.. With so much at stake on the arrival of the vaccine, the authorities won’t take any risk with transportation, storage or delivery. The storage centres, vaccine vans and the inoculation centres will all be heavily guarded by police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elaborate-distribution-plan-on-track-as-india-awaits-vaccine-approval/story-QVgW9NktWjUdtA5KcmDMdP.html

31-12-2020||India||Kerala passes resolution against farm laws||A unanimous resolution passed by the Kerala assembly on Thursday against three contentious laws passed by the Centre to open up agricultural markets received support from an unexpected quarter -- the lone Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of the House.O Rajagopal, 91, who was minister of state for railways in the Atal Bihari Vajapyee government, opposed the resolution initially, but when it was put to voice vote, he did not walk out and supported it, much to the surprise of both the treasury and opposition benches. After the session, when reporters asked him about his support for the resolution, he said he backed it in accordance with the “democratic spirit of the house.” “I raised my disagreement in clear terms. But I supported the substance of the resolution in accordance with the democratic spirit. Nothing big about it, in democracy, such compromises are common,” he said, expressing the hope that the farmers’ agitation against the farm laws will be settled soon amicably. When asked specifically whether he wanted the bills to be withdrawn, he said that was why he had supported the resolution. After his stand triggered a controversy in the BJP, he said it was wrong to say he did not oppose the resolution and blamed the speaker for not seeking a a division of votes in the house.The veteran’s ambiguous stand has put the BJP, which had described the resolution as “a mere waste of time and money,” in an awkward position.Read more| Lone BJP MLA backs resolution passed by Kerala Assembly against farm laws “There is no difference of opinion in the party. He is a senior leader and we didn’t think he will support the resolution. I will talk to him about this,” said the party’s state president K Surendran. In Delhi, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan, who belongs to Kerala, said he was not aware what the senior leader said in the house, adding that the state unit will explain it. BJP leaders close to Rajagopal said he was unhappy with a growing factional feud in the state unit of the party. After the elevation of Surendran, some senior leaders in the state unit were sidelined and the party’s attempt to broker peace between two prominent factions, one led by Muraleedharan and the other by P K Krishnadas, hasn’t yielded results. “His position literally shocked the party. The central leadership is also unhappy with it,” said one party leader, who did not want to be identified. It wasn’t the first time that Rajagopal had courted controversy. When the speaker was elected election in 2016, he supported the ruling Left Democratic Front’s nominee, P Sreeramakrishnan. He said he had backed Sreeramakrishnan because his name contains the names of both Ram and Krishna. Many Left leaders praised Rajagopal. “He took the right decision unmindful of its consequences,” said state finance minister Thomas Issac. Earlier in the day, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan introduced the resolution urging the Centre to withdraw the new laws and heed the demands of farmers who have massed on Delhi’s borders to protest against the legislation. “The Centre wants to corporatize the farm sector. It must come forward to allay farmers’ fears. The entire country is with them. It should recognise public sentiments and withdraw the new laws,” Vijayan saidAll 140 members of the assembly supported his resolution. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-passes-resolution-against-farm-laws/story-MbYcVQBYcNwEJrPYajrYPI.html

31-12-2020||India||FASTags mandatory from January 1, Govt clarifies only hybrid lanes will accept cash till Feb 15||FASTags will be mandatory for all vehicles with effect from January 1, 2021, in M and N categories of motor vehicles sold before December 1, 2017, the ministry of road transport and Highways clarified on Thursday adding that only a single hybrid lane will be functional at tolls for accepting cash till February 15.Category ‘M’ stands for a motor vehicle with at least four wheels used for carrying passengers. Category ‘N’ stands for a motor vehicle with at least four wheels used for carrying goods, which may also carry people in addition to goods.“It is clarified that this Central Motor Vehicle Rule stands in force as it is,” said the ministry in an official statement on Thursday.However, at hybrid lanes of fee plazas on National Highways, fee payment can be made through FASTag as well as in cash mode till February 15, 2021. Moreover, in FASTag lanes of fee plazas, payment of fees will continue to be through FASTag only.“The Ministry has clarified that it is committed to implementation of 100% E-tolling at fee plazas from 1st January, 2021 onwards, mandated under CMV Rules, as amended,” it said in the statement.Electronic toll collection through FASTags has crossed Rs 80 crore a day with record 50 lakh transactions per day with more than 2.20 crore FaSTags issued thus far , the National Highways Authority of India had said last week.FASTag, a radio frequency identification (RFID) sticker typically fixed to a vehicle’s windscreen, lets toll booths wirelessly and automatically deduct the fee, thereby not requiring a vehicle to stop. The tags were made mandatory for all new cars sold after December 1, 2017, as a measure to encourage digital payments and free up congestion at toll booths.In a move aimed to give a major fillip to enhance digital payments and reduce bottlenecks at national highways, the Centre had mandated that all lanes of national highways toll plazas to be declared as “FASTag lanes” by December, 2019.Speaking at a virtual summit last week, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had said that the electronic toll collection system was useful for commuters as they would not be required to stop at toll plaza for cash payments, adding that it also saves time and fuel. Making FASTags compulsory would also ensure that vehicles pass seamlessly through toll plazas as payment would be done on an electronic basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fastags-mandatory-from-january-1-govt-clarifies-only-hybrid-lanes-will-accept-cash-till-feb-15/story-OPI1jk8nAoxs23T2XsmRRP.html
31-12-2020||India||Army mountaineer who helped India secure Siachen passes away||Colonel Narendra Kumar (retd), a former top mountaineer who played a crucial role in helping India secure the Siachen glacier, died on Thursday of an age-related illness at the Army’s Research and Referral Hospital. He was 87. He was the first to red-flag Pakistani military activity on the Siachen glacier. The army launched Operation Meghdoot in April 1984 to secure the glacier by occupying key passes and ridges on the Saltoro Range on the basis of Kumar’s reconnaissance reports, officials said. Fondly known as ‘Bull’ in army circles for his tenacity, the highly decorated veteran was awarded the Padma Shri, Arjun award and the Kirti Chakra, India’s second-highest peace-time gallantry award. “First to report on Pakistani mischief in Siachen sending patrol and mountaineering expeditions to the Glacier area. India was thus able pre-empt Pakistani attempt to occupy Saltoro Range ....Salute!” former army chief General VP Malik (retd) tweeted on Thursday. Other veterans also took to Twitter to pay tribute to Colonel Kumar, with some calling him a legend. “Absolute LEGEND! The one who raised the red flag on Pak’s evil designs on #Siachen Glacier. Was privileged 2bassociated with Col Kumar’s FIRST expedition to the glacier in 1978. We took out a casualty from the most important post, bang in the middle, aptly named KUMAR. RIP Sir,” Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd) wrote on Twitter. An alumnus of the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, Colonel Kumar was commissioned into the Kumaon Regiment in 1953. “A mountaineer par excellence, he was the first Indian to climb Mt Nanda Devi. He climbed Mt Everest in 1965, Mt Blanc (the highest peak in the Alps) and later Mt Kanchenjunga ( from the toughest NE spur). He climbed all these peaks despite losing four toes due to frost bite in earlier expeditions,” the officials said. He was also a member of the Antarctica Task Force in 1981. If it was not for his expeditions to Siachen Glacier and Saltoro Range as commandant of the High Altitude Warfare School, Pakistan would have annexed the glacier, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-mountaineer-who-helped-india-secure-siachen-passes-away/story-AGiTIYjkQK9gzhAGugK1sM.html

Bond in a video message said, “Happy New Year…friends, readers, countrymen… have a great 2021. I know you had a difficult 2020…we all have in our different ways… but everyone I know has been very patient, very good... And I hope and feel that things are going to be much better in the coming months …so I take this opportunity to say good luck…stay safe stay happy…Ruskin Bond.” One of India’s most famous writers, Bond came to live in Mussoorie in 1964, lives here with his adopted family in Landour area. He was conferred Padma Shri in 1999 and Padma Bhushan in 2014 for his literary works spanning five decades. The prolific writer who turned 86 in May this year has been busy as ever writing his next book, this time his lockdown diary, which, he says, may likely be titled ‘It is a Wonderful Life’. “It is the first occasion when the whole family is together at home in Mussoorie and celebrating New Year due to the pandemic,” said Rakesh Bond, the adopted grandson of Ruskin Bond “In the past all the family members would mostly be away in their workplaces. But in a way, the pandemic has brought us closer and given us the opportunity to celebrate New Year together this time,” said Rakesh. Rakesh said his grandfather spent the eve of the New Year with them, his wife Beena and his kids Sidharth, Gautam and Shristi. “Few tourists also visited the house in the morning to wish Bond a happy New Year,” said Rakesh. On how the lockdown has changed his daily routine, Bond had told HT earlier this year, “I am used to working from home for long hours. But an occasional outing or a walk helps. I wake up in the morning. Write for a few hours. Then after breakfast, I read something - mostly old favourites like The Story of My Heart written by Richard Jefferies, detective fiction by Agatha Christie and Indian writers like Amitav Ghosh, RK Narayan, Mulk Raj Anand, whom I knew. In the afternoon, I take a siesta and in the evenings I watch TV these days to catch up on what is happening in the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-mussoorie-s-landour-ruskin-bond-s-new-year-wish-for-his-readers/story-CDdDKxX6WysRyOl78DAF2N.html

31-12-2020||India||Indian, Afghan clerics jointly call on Taliban to stop attacks on civilians||Muslim clerics from India and Afghanistan have for the first time jointly issued a declaration describing the war in Afghanistan as “illegitimate” and calling on the Taliban to halt attacks targeting civilian institutions and public infrastructure. The declaration was issued following a meeting of the clerics from the two countries held at the India Islamic Cultural Centre in New Delhi on Wednesday, according to a statement issued by the Afghan foreign ministry on Thursday. The “First gathering of Islamic scholars of Afghanistan and India” brought together religious scholars and “ulema” or clerics from different Islamic institutions of the two countries. The gathering issued a joint declaration that called for an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan. “The war and violence perpetrated against the government and people of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by the Taliban, and targeting of civilian institutions and public infrastructures by the Taliban goes against the basic teachings of Islam and therefore it is illegitimate and has no religious justification,” the declaration said. The declaration added: “Islam is a religion of peace and it urges harmony and unity among Muslims, hence we call on both warring parties in Afghanistan to stop war and declare an immediate nationwide ceasefire.” The scholars and clerics from both countries called on the Taliban and the Afghan government to “rise to the occasion and seize this rare opportunity to accelerate their negotiations for establishing a just and lasting peace in Afghanistan”. “We support the steps taken by the government of Afghanistan to pave the way for reaching an enduring peace,” the declaration said. Noting that Afghanistan has made remarkable progress in various spheres in the past 19 years, the scholars and clerics called for the “hard-gained achievements to be preserved and protected”. “We call on other ulema and Islamic scholars to come forward in support of the peace process in Afghanistan and raise their voice against the heinous attacks on innocent people and to call on the Taliban to agree to a nationwide ceasefire and embrace peace,” the declaration said. Cities across Afghanistan have witnessed a spate of attacks in recent weeks, targeting civil society activists, human rights workers and members of the media. Dozens have been killed in these attacks, and interior minister Massoud Andarabi has blamed the Taliban for certain killings across the country. The group has denied involvement in the attacks. The attacks have led to questions and concerns about the troubled peace talks between government representatives and the Taliban in Doha, Qatar. Following a recent visit to Islamabad by a high-level Taliban delegation to discuss the peace process, several videos emerged of Taliban leaders acknowledging that the group’s top leadership is based in Pakistan and that it is consulted for all decisions related to the peace talks. The videos also showed Taliban leaders visiting terror training camps in Pakistan. Reacting to these videos, the Afghan foreign ministry said the “overt presence and activities of Afghan insurgent elements and their leaders in Pakistani territory clearly violate Afghanistan’s national sovereignty and continue to cause crisis and instability in the region”. It urged the Pakistan government “not to allow its territory to be used by insurgents and elements who insist on continuing the war”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-afghan-clerics-jointly-call-on-taliban-to-stop-attacks-on-civilians/story-68HzG8CiYOD0PaipFGZkCO.html

31-12-2020||India||Kerala’s lone BJP MLA backs assembly resolution against farm laws||The unanimous resolution passed by the Kerala legislative assembly on Thursday against the Union Government’s three farm laws received support from an unexpected quarter, the lone Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member O Rajagopal. The nonagenarian leader, who was minister of state for railways in the Vajpayee government, spoke against the resolution in the house initially but when it was put to voice vote he did not stage a walkout and supported it much to the surprise of the treasury and opposition benches. After the session, when reporters asked him about this he said he supported the resolution in accordance with the “democratic spirit of the house”. “I raised my disagreement in clear terms. But I supported the substance of the resolution in accordance with the democratic spirit. Nothing big about it, in democracy such compromises are common,” he said. When specifically asked whether he wanted to withdraw these bills he gave an indirect reply saying that was why he supported the resolution. He said compromise was the essence of democracy and the ongoing farmers’ agitation will be settled amicably soon. The ‘ambiguous’ stand of the veteran has put the party, which has dubbed the resolution “a mere waste of time and money,” in a piquant situation. “There is no difference of opinion in the party. He is a senior leader and we don’t think he will support the resolution. I will talk to him about this,” said party state president K Surendran. In Delhi, Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan, hailing from the state, said he was not aware of what the senior leader said in the house and the state unit will explain it. But leaders close to the veteran said he was quite unhappy with the growing feud in the state unit. After the elevation of Surendran some of the senior leaders were sidelined and the party’s attempt to broker peace between two prominent factions, one led by V Muraleedharan and other by senior leader PK Krishnadas, failed to yield any result so far. “His position literally shocked the party. The central leadership is also unhappy with it,” said another leader who did not want to be quoted. After the issue whipped up a controversy, later the leader said it was wrong to say he did not oppose the resolution and blamed the Speaker for not conducting a division of votes in the house. But his explanation was more ambiguous like his position on the controversial issue. The senior leader had courted controversy earlier also. During the Speaker’s election in 2016, he supported LDF nominee P Sreeramakrishnan and later he said he supported him because his name carried both Lord Ram and Lord Krishna. Having got a good opportunity to embarrass the BJP many Left leaders have praised O Rajagopal. “He took the right decision unmindful of its consequences,” said state finance minister Thomas Issac lauding him. Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan introduced the resolution urging the Centre to withdraw the new laws and heed farmers who were staging a protest for more than a month. “The Centre wants to corporatize the farm sector. It must come forward to allay farmers’ fears. The entire country is with them. It should recognise public sentiment and withdraw the new laws,” said the CM. He said if the situation continued like this supply of essential commodities to consumerist states like Kerala will be affected. “Farmers are carrying on their stir in chilling winter. Some of them have lost their lives also. Their woes should be addressed at the earliest,” he said. Later, all 140 members of the assembly supported his resolution. These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. But they triggered protests in Delhi and many places. Farmers say these reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporate houses, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system. Earlier Governor Arif Mohammad Khan had denied permission to convene the house on December 24 triggering a controversy. Later, the Speaker and two ministers had called on him with a fresh recommendation and he agreed to it. Congress deputy leader K C Joseph has criticised the Governor’s decision saying the government was forced to bend before him on several occasions but the CM denied it. The state assembly had passed a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-s-lone-bjp-mla-backs-assembly-resolution-against-farm-laws/story-kyyYx0Ids6JlJZ60Uklu2H.html

The decision to implement the scheme was conveyed to the Centre by Telangana chief secretary Somesh Kumar during a video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday. “The chief secretary informed the PM that the chief minister has taken a decision to dovetail Arogyasri health scheme of Telangana government with Ayushman Bharat scheme of Government of India,” a brief official note from the state government said. Health minister Eatala Rajender said on Thursday that the state government had decided in principle to implement Ayushman Bharat scheme of the Centre in the state from this year. “Whether it is a central scheme or the state scheme, it will be implemented only with public money,” he said. Ever since Ayushman Bharat was introduced in September 2018, KCR, as the Telangana chief minister is known, has been strongly resisting it and refusing to implement it in Telangana, stating that his government’s Arogyasri scheme was much better than Ayushman Bharat, which would benefit hardly a few lakh people. He even declared that Ayushman Bharat was a poor imitation of Telangana’s Arogyasri scheme. In the 2019 general elections, the BJP leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah, made it a big issue during their campaign, accusing KCR of denying the benefits of Ayushman Bharat to the poor people. “It is good that KCR has changed his mind on Ayushman Bharat. But he should tender an apology to the people of Telangana for refusing to implement the scheme in the last two years,” BJP state president Bandi Sanjay said. The change in KCR’s stand on Ayushman Bharat comes within three days of his U-turn on implementation of contentious central laws on agriculture. It was only on Sunday that the chief minister declared that the state government would hereafter not be involved in sale and purchase of agriculture produce, since the new farm laws were being implemented across the country. Stating that the government had incurred a loss of Rs 7,500 crore on purchase of agriculture commodities last season to ensure Minimum Support Price (MSP) to farmers hit by pandemic, he declared that the state was not a business organisation or trader to purchase the produce every year. It was only a few months ago that the TRS had voted against the farm bills in Parliament. The party leaders made strong statements against the agriculture bills and also took part in the Bharat Bandh programme held in the first week of December. KCR even announced that he would hold a national conclave in Hyderabad in the third week of December by consolidating all anti-BJP forces to fight against the Centre’s agriculture laws. Senior journalist and political analyst Suresh Dharur said the change in KCR’s stand towards the Modi government was pretty evident after his Telangana Rashtra Samithi faced shocking debacles in Dubbak assembly by-polls in November and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections in early December. “Apparently, KCR has sensed that the Bharatiya Janata Party is emerging as a strong force. If he continues to adopt a confrontationist attitude towards the Centre, he is going to lose further ground to the BJP in the state. That is why he has decided to drop his anti-Modi stand,” Dharur said. According to him, KCR appears to be following the path of Naveen Patnaik and YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, his counterparts in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, respectively, of cosying up to the BJP’s central leadership, thereby getting maximum benefits to the state in the form of approvals to new projects and additional funds. “If KCR remains friendly with the Centre, the state-level BJP leaders won’t have the chance of going aggressive against the TRS. This will also create some sort of confusion among the BJP cadres,” Dharur observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-another-u-turn-kcr-decides-to-implement-centre-s-ayushman-bharat-scheme/story-Cpee8VjmwTxA3HncXD7QJL.html
31-12-2020||India||BS Yediyurappa is the father of Operation Kamala, says Siddaramiah||Even as chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Thursday said that the ruling BJP had performed creditably by winning a majority of the Gram Panchayats in Karnataka the state, senior Congressman and leader of opposition in the state assembly Siddaramiah accused him of mounting an operation to lure opposition members.Polls were held for 5728 Gram Panchayats with voting taking place in two phases on December 22 and 27. A total of 91,339 members were declared elected on Thursday. “The BJP has been improving its performance both at the state and national level. In the Gram Panchayat polls, BJP supported candidates won more than 60 per cent of the seats. Of the 5728 GPs, BJP-backed candidates have won a majority in more than 3,800 of them. This was possible due to our national leadership and the collective leadership at the local level,” Yediyurappa said.The CM pointed out that apart from winning 12 of the 15 assembly seats in the bye-elections last year, the BJP had won both assembly seats where bypolls were held this year. “We have been improving our performance consistently,” he said.However, Siddaramiah refuted the claim of BJP that it has won a majority of the GPs. “Yediyurappa is the father of ‘Operation Kamala’ (lotus). Using their money power they are trying to lure our party supported candidates who won in the GP polls. Making false claims like having won a majority of the GPs does not reflect well on a CM,” Siddaramiah said.In Congress lexicon, Operation Kamala is allegedly the BJP’s covert way of trying to get the MLAs to leave opposition parties, particularly a ruling coalition.Political analyst Manjunath pointed out that since GP polls were fought on a party-less basis it was easy for all parties to claim victory.“In a number of seats it looked like a neck to neck fight between the BJP and Congress with the saffron party marginally ahead. JDS is a distant third. However, being in power means that BJP enjoys a natural advantage in trying to attract supporters of other parties and independents to install their choice to head the Gram Panchayats.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bs-yediyurappa-is-the-father-of-operation-kamala-says-siddaramiah/story-O3me331Z6vKFksPc8TUSCJ.html

Mufti shared the letter she sent to the director of the ED, claiming that various persons from Kashmir related to her were summoned by the agency.“The only common thread connecting these persons appears to be that they are all acquainted with me, my family or my politics in one way or another. The questioning of these persons is also focused on myself, my personal, political and financial affairs, my late father’s grave and memorial, my sister’s finances, home constructions, my brother’s finances and personal affairs etc,” read the letter.She stated that PDP leader Waheed Para was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in what she said was a “non-existent case” around the dates of elections.Youth leader Waheed Parra was arrested for allegedly supporting Hizbul Mujahideen, a banned terror outfit. The arrest came days after he filed a nomination to contest the District Development Council (DDC) elections. She said that she was ready to face any questioning but demanded fairness of process.“The use of the ED against political opponents is not an unknown device for a party in power at the Centre.

31-12-2020||India||CBI raids TMC youth leader’s homes in Kolkata in coal smuggling case; BJP targets Abhishek Banerjee||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday raided three residences of businessman and youth Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Vinay Mishra and businessmen Amit Singh and Niraj Singh, who are siblings, in connection with the ongoing investigation into the coal smuggling case. None of the suspects were home during the raids. Notices were served, asking Mishra and the others to appear for questioning at the CBI office in Kolkata on January 4. It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of West Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited operates several mines. In early December, the CBI also raided the home and office of Ganesh Bagaria, a Kolkata-based chartered accountant. Ever since the probe started in September, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been alleging that the money from the sales was whitewashed through shell companies and siphoned into the funds of the ruling party. The BJP has also alleged that the main beneficiary is Abhishek Banerjee, Lok Sabha member and nephew of chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Abhishek Banerjee is also the president of the TMC’s youth wing. On July 20, he appointed 15 general secretaries, including Mishra. Accompanied by Central police force personnel, the CBI teams on Thursday simultaneously raided three apartments Mishra owns at Chetla and Rashbehari in south Kolkata and Lake Town in east Kolkata. Mishra’s south Kolkata residences are located not far from the homes of Mamata and Abhishek Banerjee. CBI officials refused to comment on the outcome of the raids and progress in the probe. An official said on condition of anonymity that several laptops, which were password protected, and documents were seized from Mishra’s residences.Anup Majhi alias Lala, the prime suspect in this case, is absconding and a lookout notice has already been issued by the probe agency. In November, the CBI raided 36 offices allegedly run by Majhi and also conducted a probe at the ECL headquarters in Asansol. The CBI teams on Thursday also raided the residences of Amit Singh and Niraj Singh at Konnagar in Hooghly district. Mishra and the Singh siblings are also under a cloud over allegations of their possible involvement in the smuggling of cows to Bangladesh that the CBI is probing since 2018. Two Border Security Force (BSF) commandants have so far been arrested in this case and several more are under scanner alongside officials in the state police and the Customs. The BJP leadership took jabs at the TMC after Thursday’s raids. “This is the true picture of the team members under the “able” leadership of the Nephew. What a great team he has made to take the @AITCofficial to a “different” level. #TolabaazBhaipoHatao!” tweeted Suvendu Adhikari, the former transport minister who joined the BJP on December 19. In the tweet, Adhikari referred to Abhishek Banerjee as bhaipo (nephew in Bengali) and called him a tolabaaz (extortionist). Ever since he left the TMC, Adhikari and the youth TMC president have been targeting each other in public. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh also took potshots at Abhishek Banerjee and the chief minster at a rally at Dankuni in Hooghly district. “All the ill-gotten money went to Kalighat (where the chief minister lives),” Ghosh alleged. The TMC brushed aside the allegations. “Mishra is not an important leader of the TMC. The raids won’t make any difference to the party,” said TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy. Building pressure on the ruling party, leaders of the CPIM) and the Congress legislative parties in the state assembly demanded that the government should convene a special session and prove its majority. “People are confused. They do not know how many MLAs the TMC has,” said CPI(M) lawmaker Sujan Chakraborty. “I do not know why the Congress and the CPI(M) are making this strange demand or how long their alliance will last,” quipped deputy parliamentary affairs minister Tapas Roy. Suvendu Adhikari’ father and elder brother represent two Lok Sabha constituencies in East Midnapore. His younger brother Soumendu, who headed the civic body at Contai, their hometown, was removed from the post by the government on Sunday soon after he said at a BJP rally that his family will join the saffron party very soon. Soumendu Adhikari moved the Calcutta high court against the order on Thursday afternoon. The case will come up for hearing on January 4. There was a chaos at the civic body when Siddhartha Maity, the newly appointed civic body head, went to join duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-raids-tmc-youth-leader-s-homes-in-kolkata-in-coal-smuggling-case-bjp-targets-abhishek-banerjee/story-Sj3EVuegfXjqh48Oigm2jM.html

But necessary permission for delivery of rice after custom milling of the purchased paddy to the FCI for the central pool is still awaited from the Centre’s Food and Public Distribution Department,” the letter stated.Baghel said that this delay in the process of lifting rice by the FCI affected paddy procurement drive.“A huge stock of rice has been piled up at procurement centres due to non-lifting of rice for the central pool. Delay in timely disposal of paddy, might lead to damage to the produce,” Baghel said.He further said that the Centre has agreed to provide only 1.45 lakh new jute gunny bags to the state against the demand of 3.50 lakh jute gunny bags and so far only 1.05 lakh bags have been provided.In the letter, he urged the Centre to fulfil the demands of the state government so that paddy procurement in the state can continue.Meanwhile, BJP leaders claimed that the state government is trying to hide the failure in procuring paddy in the state.“Most of the farmers of the state are suffering in selling their paddy at procurement centres. The government has done nothing for the farmers; they are only making mockery of procurement. Thousands of farmers are not getting a token for paddy selling … They are simply not prepared and failed,” said Sacchinand Upasane, a senior BJP leader and spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-bhupesh-baghel-complains-to-pm-modi-over-paddy-procurement-delay/story-K5u57jd4o1URE3oENN4B6I.html

31-12-2020||India||Covid-19: Law ministry provided courts with infrastructure to go virtual||As the coronavirus pandemic made courts adopt the new normal and go virtual in 2020, the Union law ministry pitched in by providing the required infrastructure to ensure online hearings are held smoothly.As part of its push to improve India’s ranking in the ease of doing business, the ministry also brought in an ordinance to amend the arbitration law.Issued in November, the ordinance ensures that all stakeholder parties get an opportunity to seek an unconditional stay on enforcement of arbitral awards where the arbitration agreement or contract is “induced by fraud or corruption”.The ordinance which further amends the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 also does away with the 8th Schedule of the Act which contained the necessary qualifications for accreditation of arbitrators.This provision had faced criticism from some quarters that the conditions prescribed in the law came in way of India getting the benefit of having foreign arbitrators.“But that was not the case and a wrong impression had got created. Still, to do away with that impression, the concerned schedule has been dropped,” a government functionary explained.Now, the qualifications based on which arbitrators will be accredited will be prescribed by regulations, which will be framed by a proposed arbitration council.Till recently, an arbitration award was enforceable even if an appeal was filed against it in the court under Section 36 of the law. But the court could grant a stay on the award on conditions as it deemed fit.As per the latest amendment brought through the ordinance, if the award is being given on the basis of an agreement based on fraud or corruption, then the court will not impose a condition to stay the award and grant an unconditional stay during the pendency of the appeal if it has been challenged under Section 34 of the arbitration law.The law ministry ordinance said the amendment was necessary “to address the concerns raised by stakeholders after the enactment of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2019 and to ensure that all the stakeholder parties get an opportunity to seek an unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards where the underlying arbitration agreement or contract or making of the arbitral award are induced by fraud or corruption”.In February, the Union Cabinet approved the constitution of the 22nd Law Commission which advises the government on complex legal issues. The term of the previous law panel had ended on August 31, 2018.But the law ministry is yet to notify the new panel, which will have a term of three years. The panel will have a full-time chairperson, four full-time members (including a member secretary), and law and legislative secretaries.Seeking to boost the capability of the lower judiciary to hear cases online, funds have been released to set up “video conference cabins” in 2,506 court complexes across India.While funds to the tune of Rs 5.21 crore were released in September to set up video conference cabins, another Rs 28.886 crore were given in October to buy additional video conference equipment, including hardware, cables and monitors.The funds were provided by the e-committee of the Supreme Court and the Department of Justice in the law ministry.While India has 3,288 court complexes, which house thousands of subordinate courts, the funds have been released for 2,506 court complexes to set up video conference cabins.Bigger court complexes with a large number of courtrooms would get multiple cabins as compared to smaller complexes.The size of a court complex, including the number of courts it houses, depends upon the size or population of the state.As courts continue to hear cases online amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has also procured 1,500 additional video conferencing licences at an approximate cost of Rs 9 crore for providing the facility for high courts and district courts.While the procurement has been completed, the process of installation is on.Such licences are required for legal and extended use of the video conference facility software.From the day the nationwide lockdown was imposed to check the spread of coronavirus till October 28, high courts and district courts across India have heard over 49.67 lakh cases virtually, according to data collated by the law ministry.The Centre had imposed the lockdown from March 25 to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. From June 8, it started gradually relaxing restrictions under ‘Unlock’.This year, the law ministry also asked states to set up special courts to settle disputes related to infrastructure project contracts under a law which was amended two years ago, saying it is very important in improving the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ ranking of both India and states.Citing the examples of the high courts of Allahabad, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, it has suggested other high courts to allocate a special day to make already functioning designated special courts for dealing with infrastructure project litigation as dedicated courts.Section 20 B of the Specific Relief (Amendment) Act, 2018, provides for designated courts. But the law ministry wants a designated court to function as a dedicated court on special days.In a letter to the registrars general of all high courts last week, the secretary (Justice) in the law ministry said that the Karnataka, Allahabad and Madhya Pradesh high courts have set up designated special courts instead of dedicated special courts under the Specific Relief Act.The high courts have dedicated special days every week to enable exclusive handling of specific relief matters pertaining to infrastructure project contracts.“This arrangement could be considered for adoption in your high court as an alternative measure until dedicated special courts are set up. This could be helpful in the enforceability of contract both from the perspective of time and cost, thereby stimulating investors’ confidence and creating conducive business climate,” the letter said.In October, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had written to all chief ministers pressing for special courts under the Specific Relief (Amendment) Act, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-law-ministry-provided-courts-with-infrastructure-to-go-virtual/story-s2fNhaiGX20PzaazIt6YYJ.html
31-12-2020||India||Uttarakhand asked to explain delay in restoration of Kedarnath Samadhi of Adi Shankaracharya||Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday issued a show cause to the state government asking why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against it for non-compliance of its October 2018 order for restoration of the samadhi of Adi Shankaracharya, near Kedarnath temple, within a year.The samadhi was damaged in the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy. The court has sought a reply from the state government within two weeks. The matter was heard by division bench of acting chief justice Ravi Vijaykumar Malimath and justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari. Ajay Gautam, a Delhi based activist, who appeared in person in the matter, said that in October 2018, HC had directed the state government to restore the samadhi of Adi Shankaracharya within a year. “As the restoration of the samadhi has not been completed yet, I filed an application in the court regarding the same in November this year. Hearing the matter, the court has now issued show cause to the state government and directed it to submit its reply within two weeks in the matter,” he said The Kerala born Adi Shankaracharya was an 8th-century Indian spiritual leader who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta and made a significant contribution in unifying Hinduism by setting up four mathas (monastic institutions) across India.Uttarakhand Himalayas hold much significance in the context of Adi Shankaracharya as he is believed to have taken samadhi here at Kedarnath. He also established one of the four mathas at Joshimath and installed the idol at Badrinath. Also Read: Plan to develop 100 villages along the Indo-China border to be sent to CentreDisposing of the PIL in October 2018, the court had ordered that “State is directed to restore the Samadhi of Adi Shankaracharya Ji positively within a period of one year.. at Kedarnath”. It also directed the district administration to ensure that the local traditional hill architecture is taken into consideration while repairing/restoring the samadhi of Adi Shankaracharya and also to ensure that the architecture merges with the surrounding landscape. Elaborating the importance of the Shankaracharya and his samadhi in the state, HC had noted that he retired to the Himalayas at the young age of 32 years and entered a cave near Kedarnath. “Kedarnath is a Hindu pilgrimage site in Uttarakhand. The Samadhi of Adi Shankaracharya was built near Kedarnath temple. Samadhi was also revered by the pilgrims visiting Kedarnath. Samadhi of Adi Shankaracharya Ji was swept away in the Kedarnath tragedy in the month of June, 2013. Thereafter, it has not been repaired. It is in these circumstances that the present writ petition has been filed”, the order had observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-asked-to-explain-delay-in-restoration-of-kedarnath-samadhi-of-adi-shankaracharya/story-IKp6zjRQbz7HkXBcUvEHsI.html

The deadline was earlier set to January 1 with transport minister Nitin Gadkari saying that FASTag will be mandatory for all vehicles in the country.Speaking at a virtual summit last week, Gadkari had said that the electronic toll collection system was useful for commuters as they would not be required to stop at toll plaza for cash payments, adding that it also saves time and fuel. Making FASTags compulsory would also ensure that vehicles pass seamlessly through toll plazas as payment would be done on an electronic basis.The transport ministry had issued a notification in November which said that FASTag was mandatory from next year for old vehicles that were sold before December 1, 2017. FASTag is an electronic toll collection system in India which is operated by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). It was launched in 2016; in two years, their number crossed 3.4 million. As per the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, since December 1, 2017, FASTag had been made mandatory for registration of new four-wheelers.

The subject expert committee (SEC) under the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) will meet on January 1 to consider the emergency-use authorisation application of three companies—Pfizer, Serum Institute of India that is to manufacture the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Also Read: ‘Dawai bhi, kadai bhi’: PM Modi for caution even after vaccinationThis will be the second meeting of the SEC with the companies to examine the data that has been produced so far. Somani said that the approval process was fast-tracked in view of the pandemic by quickly processing all applications, allowing parallel phase 1 and 2 trials without waiting for complete data. “There has been no compromise on the safety of efficacy of the data. The only thing is that the regulator has accepted partial data,” he said. Representatives from the industry appreciated the hand-holding and quick assessment by the regulator. The manufacturing and stockpiling licenses granted by the drug regulator also helped the companies prepare for a massive vaccination drive. “With the manufacturing and stockpiling license, Serum Institute of India (SII) has already been able to stockpile 75 million doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine and by the first week of January we will have 1 million doses. Nobody across the world has so much stock and we can start supplying as soon as we get the approval. After the phase 2 data of Novovax is released, we will start stockpiling the other vaccine too,” said Umesh Shalingam from SII, who was present at the webinar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-likely-to-start-the-new-year-with-a-covid-vaccine-hints-dcgi/story-UgrrZ7I6URz6mGPeBGYAyK.html

[I] spoke to the CM on imposing night curfew in the state on lines of the state of Delhi & Karnataka. The file is already in process,” Rane said via social media. He added that the Central government had advised enforcement of containment protocols. “I have received a letter from the health secretary, Govt of India (MoHFW) to ensure SOPs and strict protocols are laid down by each state, based on the situation in the respective states,” Rane said. States including Delhi and Karnataka have imposed curfews to prevent late night gatherings to celebrate the New Year. Goa has reopened for tourism and has lifted restrictions on gatherings, including parties, with the riders that social distancing should be maintained. However, visuals emerging from party hotspots have shown an alarming lack of social distancing as tourists have begun to let their guard down while on holiday. Goa has witnessed a huge spike in flight arrivals, largely fuelled by holiday makers seeking a good time during the Christmas and New Year period. The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa has praised the government for ‘helping the industry’ so far with a ‘consistent policy’ instead of constant chopping and changing. “It is important that the government sensitizes tourists on the need for wearing masks and maintaining protocols as tourists; when they are on a holiday, tourists often tend to be more relaxed than when back home,” Nilesh Shah, the president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa, said. On December 27, the Goa airport handled 72 arrivals and 72 departures with more than 11,000 passengers arriving and nearly an equal number departing, the highest traffic since the lock down and 85% of the pre-Covid levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-new-year-s-eve-goa-health-minister-pitches-for-night-curfew/story-U4znq80ElOmtVm2tzqSxdL.html

31-12-2020||India||India’s protesting farmers hold key to self-reliance in edible oils||Indian farmer Shingara Singh has grown grain for 35 years and is one of thousands of protesters against agricultural reforms who have the power to help slash a huge annual bill of $10 billion for imports of vegetable oils.But Singh, 55, says he will only switch to growing oilseeds, such as rapeseed and sunflower, on his 15-acre (six-hectare) plot in the northern state of Punjab, if the government promises guaranteed rates for his produce.“Sometimes we grow sunflower, but we don’t get to sell it at the MSP,” said Singh, 55, referring to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) the government pays for his rice and wheat. “In fact, we often have to sell sunflower at deep discounts,” added the blue-turbanned Singh, a participant in the farmers’ daily sit-ins on the edge of the capital, New Delhi.Such a switch by farmers in the breadbasket states of Punjab and Haryana could cut shipments of edible oils that have tripled over the last two decades to rack up India’s third biggest import bill, after crude oil and gold.That would also melt bulging inventories of rice and wheat worth billions of dollars that lie unsold in government warehouses, after years of bountiful harvests.But industry experts say grain growers are unlikely to make the switch in large numbers unless the government offers financial assistance.“Farmers will shift to oilseeds if the government agrees to give incentives of a few thousand rupees per acre for diversification, which is necessary,” said veteran trader Govindbhai Patel, the head of GG Patel & Nikhil Research Co. Such a move looks unlikely during the stand-off over three new farm laws adopted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in September, which protesting cultivators call a ruse to abandon MSPs.These prices are set for more than 20 crops each year, but state buying agency the Food Corporation of India (FCI) applies them only to purchases of rice and wheat, blaming a lack of funds and storage space.Only the prospect of financial support will encourage farmers to switch from grain crops, with their government-set prices, to the less predictable gains of oilseeds.“We’ve requested the government to give that kind of support to farmers,” said BV Mehta of industry body the Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA).The government, which earns 350 billion rupees ($4.77 billion) from levies on edible oil imports, can easily set aside 40 billion rupees a year for crop diversification, through more taxes on such imports, Mehta added.Higher output of oilseeds and fewer imports of oils will boost farmers’ incomes, create jobs in the domestic crushing industry and help save precious foreign exchange, he said. The growers’ transition away from grain is a key step in a government plan to boost oilseed production, said a senior government official, who sought anonymity in line with policy.Once the government resolves the farmers’ month-old agitation, it can chalk out financial incentives to drive crop diversification, industry officials say. Negotiators for both sides are to meet on Jan. 4 to try and break the deadlock.GRAIN PREFERRED TO OILSEEDSGovernment purchases, initially meant to promote self-sufficiency in domestic staples, have spurred farmers, especially those with access to better irrigation, to favour grain over the years, rather than oilseeds and pulses.That has pushed India to the rank of the world’s second-biggest producer of rice and wheat, but caused a glut. At the same time, lower oilseed output has made it the world’s biggest importer of oils, to meet nearly 70% of consumption.Such imports have surged to 15 million tonnes from 4 million two decades ago and could touch 20 million by 2030, boosted by a growing populace with higher incomes to satisfy a penchant for calorie-laden curry and deep-fried food.India buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia and soyoil and sunflower oil from Argentina, Brazil, Russia and Ukraine.Oilseeds are now mainly grown in rain-fed areas with low crop yields, but Punjab, with efficient irrigation, can expect higher yields, experts say.Farmers in the state and neighbouring Haryana can produce 6 million tonnes of rapeseed if they divert half the area now under wheat, bringing a domestic supply boost of 2.5 million tonnes, Mehta estimated.Farm economists say India should create a transition fund.“Both central and state governments should work out a financial package that will get this crop diversification rolling,” said former government adviser Ashok Gulati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-protesting-farmers-hold-key-to-self-reliance-in-edible-oils/story-wANIy3RATvenoects7WsnL.html

India has fared much better than other countries in this field and the infection rate is also going down continuously.” he added. India got one step closer to having a Covid-19 vaccine after the UK granted emergency approval to the AstraZeneca-Oxford candidate. The Serum Institute of India (SII) which is manufacturing the Oxford vaccine here, expects a similar outcome. The Prime Minister confirmed that preparations for a vaccination drive are underway and people will soon be administered an India-made vaccine. “Preparations are in the last stages for the vaccination programme against Covid-19. People will get vaccines manufactured in India,” he said. Applications by SII and Bharat Biotech for emergency use approval of their vaccines were taken up by a government appointed expert panel on Wednesday. The panel is slated to meet again on Friday for another round of discussions on the same. India has the second highest number of infections in the world after the US. The SII manufactured vaccine which can be safely stored at 2 to 8 degree Celsius offers India the best chance at a successful vaccination drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dawai-bhi-kadai-bhi-pm-modi-for-caution-even-after-vaccination/story-E7UN7gd1YNV99HwBZQHT8O.html

31-12-2020||India||‘Have to strengthen India’s role in health care in 2021’: PM Modi’s top quotes at AIIMS Rajkot event||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday laid foundation stone of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Gujarat’s Rajkot and said that the facility will help improve healthcare infrastructure in the state. The Prime Minister termed the upcoming hospital as another link strengthening the medical infrastructure of the country.PM Modi, who was addressing the event via video conferencing, said that the number of new coronavirus cases are decreasing in the country.Here are the key quotes from PM Modi’s address:- India has emerged as the nerve centre of global health. In the year 2021, we have to strengthen India’s role in healthcare. We are working on mission mode to improve medical education in India. After the formation of National Medical Commission, the quality and quantity of health education will improve.- When your health takes a hit, every aspect of life is severely affected and the whole social circle, not just the family, is affected. So this last day of the year is to remember India’s millions of doctors, health warriors, sanitation workers, working in drug stores, and other front line corona warriors. I salute the companions who have given their lives on the duty path.-This difficult year has shown how effectively it can withstand a difficult crisis when India is united. India took effective steps in time with solidarity, the result of which is that we are in a much better position today. The country, which has more than 130 crore people, is densely populated. There are about 10 million people who have won by fighting this disease.- In 2003, Atal Ji’s government had planned to add six AIIMS to the six that existed back then. These new six were completed in 2012, a total of 9 years! In the last six years, we’ve started work on 10 new AIIMS, out of which, some are already functional. Apart from AIIMS, 20 super speciality hospitals are also being built in the country.- The kind of medical infrastructure that has been developed in Gujarat in the last two decades is a big reason that Gujarat is better able to deal with the challenge of coronavirus. AIIMS Rajkot will further strengthen, strengthen Gujarat’s health network.- Gujarat’s success in the medical sector is behind two decades of relentless efforts, dedication and determination. In the last six years, Gujarat is also getting the definite benefit of the scale on which work has been done for treatment and medical education.- Over Rs 30,000 crore of poor people’s money has been saved due to Ayushman Bharat Yojana. This scheme has freed the poor people of India from the struggles of good treatment due to lack of money.- The maternal mortality rate in India has fallen a lot compared to the past. Concentrating on the outcome isn’t enough - both implementation and impact are equally important. To bring wholesome changes in behavioural patterns, we must improve the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-to-strengthen-india-s-role-in-health-care-in-2021-pm-modi-s-top-quotes-at-aiims-rajkot-event/story-cYonjtBRYDghw2ekf93e2N.html
31-12-2020||India||Lone BJP MLA backs resolution passed by Kerala Assembly against farm laws||The resolution against Centre’s farm laws passed by the Kerala legislative Assembly received unlikely support - from the lone member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Olanchery Rajagopal.Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan said that the resolution was passed unanimously through a voice vote at the special session of the Assembly.Rajagopal did not stage a walkout and later agreed to the points in the resolution. He was Minister of State for Railways in Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s cabinet.This has come as a major embarassment for the BJP. The president of the state unit of the party, K Surendran, said he will check what Rajagopalan said in the assembly. Surendran also said that he doesn’t think a senior leader like Rajagopalan will take a contrary view.Punjab had become the first state to pass a resolution against the contentious farm laws in October.The BJP-led central government has said that the “landmark” laws are beneficial for small farmers and will give them choice to sell their produce as per their choice. The laws, passed by Parliament in September, essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces which allow traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales. These laws also lay down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Together, they will allow big corporations to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations.But these laws have triggered protests near Delhi with several farmer unions coming together with the demand that the Centre repeal them. Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system.Many opposition parties have supported the farmers, with the Congres reiterating their demand of scrapping of these laws. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) accused the government of not listening to the farmers.Several rounds of talks between the government and the farmers have so far failed to break the deadlock. However, in the latest (sixth) round of talks on Wednesday, the Centre acceded to the demand to spare farmers heavy fines for crop-residue burning, as provided for in an anti-pollution ordinance, and to continue the current mechanism of giving subsidised power for agricultural use.However, the two principal demands of a repeal of three new farm laws and a legal guarantee of minimum support prices yet to be discussed. The government did not take up these core demands on Wednesday, deferring them till the next round of talks on January 4, which the farmers have agreed to participate in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lone-bjp-mla-backs-resolution-passed-by-kerala-assembly-against-farm-laws/story-OdLPlA5qwdHIuBuscrsOBO.html

31-12-2020||India||Kerala Assembly passes resolution demanding withdrawal of farm laws passed by Parliament||The Kerala Assembly on Thursday passed a resolution against the farm laws cleared by Parliament in September. The resolution was tabled by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who said that the three laws “will only help big corporate houses”.The resolution said that farmers’ genuine concerns should be addressed and the Centre should withdraw all three farm laws.While moving the resolution, Vijayan said in the one-hour special session that the country was now witnessing one of the most iconic protests ever by farmers in its history.“Legislative assemblies have the moral responsibility to take a serious view when people have anxieties about certain laws which affect their lives,” Vijayan said, adding that agriculture was part of the culture of the country.Kerala has vast experience in this regard. Kerala is a state that has successfully implemented the Land Reforms Act, said Vijayan. “In addition, Kerala has made excellent interventions in resolving agricultural crises with the participation of local bodies and co-operative terminations. After the Green Revolution in the country in the 1960s, a system was set up to provide foodgrain farmers with a minimum price for their produce,” the chief minister added.Kerala became the first state in the country to starts a Minimum Support Price (MSP)-based system for perishables. The scheme, which came into effect from November 1, fixed MSP for 16 varieties of vegetables.The MSP is determined based on the cost of production and productivity. Though it is very similar to how the Centre procures cereals, what differentiates this system is that the MSP will be made available to farmers when the market price falls lower.The cabinet observed that this will ensure price stability and good returns for the farmers. It will also help protect farmers from market price fluctuations.The 16 varieties of crops include tapioca, banana, pineapple, cucumber, tomatoes, cabbage, carrots, potatoes, beans, beetroot and garlic.The southern state has no Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), so the move is being likened to government’s direct interference in price mechanism.In fact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had lashed out at the Kerala government over the issue. “Those ruling Kerala for years are joining Punjab farmers for selfies, but not doing anything for mandi system in own state,” the PM had said after releasing Rs 18,000 crore as the next instalment of financial benefits under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme last week.“Farm reforms became necessary because poor farmers, who are over 80%, were getting poorer during rules of previous governments,” he had further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-assembly-passes-resolution-demanding-withdrawal-of-farm-laws-passed-by-parliament/story-AEciWT0mTmIfhxNuTm08vK.html

Hours after he joined the party on Wednesday, Gujjar, who fired at a demonstration against the Citizen (Amendment) Act in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, was hurriedly expelled.As social media reactions poured in criticising the party for inducting Gujjar, a red-faced BJP unit in Uttar Pradesh issued a statement claiming they had “no idea of his involvement in the controversial Shaheen Bagh incident.”This is not the first time that the party has had to issue a quick expulsion message following the public uproar.ALSO WATCH | ‘Low level politics by BJP’: Congress defends Rahul Gandhi’s foreign visit In 2014, Sabir Ali from Bihar was expelled from the party within hours of his induction. Ali’s entry into the BJP set off a furore within the party as well with some members alleging he was a sympathiser of Yasin Bhatkal, the alleged mastermind of the terror group Indian Mujahideen. BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who is now a Union minister, had tweeted against Ali’s joining but later deleted the post. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, BJP ideological fount, also backed Naqvi’s opposition to Ali’s joining.Also Read: Shaheen Bagh shooter Kapil Gujjar joins BJP, expelled two hours laterAli’s induction was discussed at the party’s highest levels with the then BJP president Rajnath Singh suggesting that such issues should be discussed internally. The same year, late Sushma Swaraj made public her opposition to the induction of B Sriramulu, an associate of Karnataka’s Reddy brothers accused in the Bellary mining scam.“I want to make it absolutely clear that B Sriramulu has been admitted in the party despite my stiff opposition,” Swaraj had tweeted even as Sriramulu was not removed from the party. The BJP was also forced to rescind the membership of another controversial figure, Pramod Muthalik, who joined the party in Karnataka’s Hubli with much fanfare in 2014. Muthalik heads the Sri Ram Sene, which led an attack on women at a pub in Mangaluru in 2009.Asked whether the party is considering a process to streamline such inductions, a BJP leader said it is impossible. “For mass-based political parties, not just the BJP, it is not possible to keep track of every entry or induction. Sometimes these inductions happen at the block level or the district level. It is only when something untoward about a candidate is brought to the notice of the state or the central leadership action is taken,” the leader said on condition of anonymity.The leader said most inductions that happen in the presence of senior party leaders at the state or the central level are arranged based on the joinee’s request.“Sometimes those who want to join request the state or the central leadership that their formal induction into the party fold be done in the presence of senior leaders otherwise there is no protocol for joining,” the leader said.Political commentator Ajay Kumar Jha said, “While it is not possible for parties to keep track of every joining, it is important that they take quick action if they find that the credentials of anyone are questionable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kapil-gujjar-s-quick-entry-exit-from-bjp-a-throwback-to-similar-inductions-into-the-party/story-ebeVyYn8zE4uYZftCHHo5M.html
31-12-2020||India||SC questions relationship pact between actress, producer in lieu of movie role||The Supreme Court on Wednesday wondered if there can ever be a valid agreement between a man and a woman in exchange for a role in films. A bench of justices Indira Banerjee and Aniruddha Bose was amused to learn about a memorandum between a Bhojpuri film actor and a producer, also a builder, with stipulations regarding movie roles and their relationship.“Can such an agreement ever be accepted as a matter of public policy? Friendship of whatever nature this may be, what is the consideration? Acting in films?” asked the bench during a hearing on an anticipatory bail plea.The contract in question was signed in May 2018 and said the 26-year-old actor and the 41-year-old producer were in a relationship since 2016 without any pressure or coercion. It added the producer, who had a divorce case pending with his estranged wife at that time, will also arrange a role for the actor in Bhojpuri films and that they will not level criminal accusations against each other over this relationship. But in July the actor registered a case against the producer-builder, accusing him of rape after deceiving and threatening her. She also accused him of blackmailing her by filming her intimate moments with another producer using a spy camera.Also Read: SC notice to AP on plea against condition of 3-year practice as lawyer to appear in civil judge examFearing arrest, the man moved the Bombay high court for protection from arrest. His plea was rejected on December 21 with the judge noting that “spy camera is really a cause for concern.”Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for the producer-builder on Wednesday, called the actor’s complaint bogus and said it was filed with the only objective of “extracting money” from his client.Rohatgi said the actor has made a similar complaint earlier too and later settled it after receiving a huge amount of money from another man. He said this is why his client decided to have an agreement with the woman.Rohatgi showed to the bench the memorandum signed between the producer-builder and the actor to corroborate his argument that the relationship was completely consensual and that his client had agreed to give the woman roles in movies.But the bench was unimpressed with the stipulations made in the agreement. It questioned Rohatgi whether such an agreement between a man and a woman can ever be a valid document. “What kind of an agreement is this? We cannot go by this.”The bench said it is disinclined to give pre-arrest bail to the accused also because of the use of a spy camera. It asked him to approach the trial court for a regular bail after the surrender.Rohatgi pleaded for some time to surrender since trial courts in Mumbai have limited functioning due to Covid. Accepting this, the bench gave the producer four weeks to surrender and apply for regular bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-questions-relationship-pact-between-actress-producer-in-lieu-of-movie-role/story-sQ5Rn2Z6LO1vI4y3e63dLO.html

The last day of 2020 is dedicated to all health workers who are putting their lives at stake to keep us safe, he added.The project will mean generation of thousands of jobs, good health care and development of Gujarat, the PM said. “We could only establish 6 AIIMS after so many years of independence. In 2003, Atal ji’s government took the initiative to establish 6 more AIIMS. In the past 6 years, we have started work on establishing 10 more AIIMS,” PM Modi said.About 201 acres of land has been allotted for the project, according to a release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office. It will be built at an estimated cost of Rs1,195 crore, and is expected to be completed by mid-2022.Commenting on the current coronavirus situation, he said, “A country such as India, with its huge population, saw nearly 1 crore of its people winning their battles against coronavirus. India has fared much better than other countries in this field and the infection rate is also going down continuously.”Vaccine development is in its final stages in India, the PM said, adding that he was confident the nation would move forward towards vaccination, showcasing the same unity it showcased in fighting against the virus this year.“In the recent years, people have got access to health care facilities. Government schemes and awareness about these schemes go a long way in improving the health of India’s daughters,” PM Modi said, urging experts to study the effect of these schemes on the education of Indian girls. “These schemes are a big reason why there is a drop in the drop out rate of girls from schools,” he said.Gujarat governor Acharya Devvrat, state chief minister Vijay Rupani, Union health minister and Union minister of State (MoS) for Health Harsh Vardhan were also present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-lays-foundation-stone-of-aiims-rajkot/story-6jXlTkRJsHxDENAm0kPYmL.html

Their production was ramped up in March amid growing demand for them as the Covid-19 pandemic worsened. The export of the kits and other protective equipment was banned in March, so that enough supplies could be procured by the central government, which were subsequently supplied to the states free of cost. India was producing was producing 10 million PPEs per month, on the specs that were demanded by the Central government to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The Central government had placed an order for 22 million PPEs in March to meet the demand for health workers. The government had also faced severe criticism for not being able to provide enough coveralls for essential workers.In June, the ministry allowed the export of 500,000 PPE kits monthly. In July, India exported 2,300,000 PPE kits to five countries.The government allowed the PPE exports amid demands from the industry as it started producing surplus kits. The PPE production came as a boost for the industry as it faced nearly 84% fall in apparel sales and an acute shortage of labour due to the pandemic in the first quarter.“As per CMAI [Clothing Manufacturers Association of India] research conducted with the help of AC Nielson, the total Indian market for apparel was worth Rs6.5 lakh crore in 2019,” Rahul Mehta, the chief mentor at CMAI had earlier told Hindustan Times. “We estimate it will go down by 15% in 2020 to around Rs5.85 lakh crore. However, in the quarter of April to June, most brands and retailers would not achieve more than 15-20% of their 2019 first quarter sales.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-now-second-largest-producer-of-ppe-kits-textile-ministry/story-0wpw6Y302b2gEmWf9iQvdJ.html
31-12-2020||India||Kerala Assembly’s one-day special session begins, CM Pinarayi Vijayan moves resolution against farm laws||The Kerala legislative assembly is holding a one-day special session on Thursday to pass a resolution against new farm laws which have triggered widespread protests.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan moved a resolution which said that the country is going through a difficult situation and it was the duty of the state government to stand along with the agitating farmers. The resolution also said that the stir which was held under trying conditions and inclement weather failed to oppose eyes of the Union government.“All three laws will only help big corporate houses,” the chief minister said.“The current situation makes it clear that if this agitation continues, it will seriously affect Kerala. There is no doubt that Kerala will starve if the supply of food items from other states stops,” he added.Congress and all other parties have supported the resolution. Congress deputy leader K C Joseph even criticised the Governor for delaying permission to convene the house.O Rajagopal, the lone member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is also attending the session.Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan had on Monday given his assent for convening the state assembly for a one-day special session on December 31. The governor’s nod came after CPI-M led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government sent a fresh proposal to convene the assembly after he had turned down an earlier recommendation.The duration of the session is expected to be of one hour.The governor had earlier declined nod for the special session on December 23 to discuss the contentious laws, saying that the chief minister had not addressed the question raised by him on the nature of emergency warranting the very brief session.In a letter to Vijayan, Khan had also stated that the government wanted the special session to “discuss a problem for which you have no jurisdiction to offer any solution”.Vijayan had shot off a letter to Khan describing as regrettable his decision while asserting that the governor was bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers and that moving resolutions and conducting discussions in the assembly “cannot be regulated by gubernatorial powers”.A large number of farmers mainly from Punjab and Haryana are demanding the repeal of the laws, contending that these would pave the way for a dismantling of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism and the mandi system, leaving them to the “mercy” of big corporates.The government has been saying these fears are misplaced. A fresh round of talks - the sixth in a month - was held on Wednesday in which the Centre acceded to the demand to spare farmers heavy fines for crop-residue burning, as provided for in an anti-pollution ordinance, and to continue the current mechanism of giving subsidised power for agricultural use.However, the two principal demands of a repeal of three new farm laws and a legal guarantee of minimum support prices are yet to be discussed.The government did not take up these core demands on Wednesday, deferring them till the next round of talks on January 4, which the farmers have agreed to participate in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-assembly-s-one-day-special-session-begins-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-moves-resolution-against-farm-laws/story-2FXIFwkz4FZrdeIofObq2M.html

31-12-2020||India||India will have Covid-19 vaccine within days: AIIMS director||Amid concerns of the new strain of coronavirus (Covid-19) spreading in India, AIIMS Delhi Director Dr Randeep Guleria said the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine getting approved for use in the UK was a “big step forward” and India was days away from getting a vaccine. “This is very good news that AstraZeneca got approval for its vaccine by UK regulatory authorities. They have robust data and in India the same vaccine is being developed by the Serum Institute of India (SII). This is a big step forward not only for India but many parts of the world,” Guleria told ANI in an interview.“This vaccine can be stored at two to eight degrees centigrade. Therefore it would be easy to store and transport. Storage can be done using a simple fridge rather than what is required in the Pfizer vaccine of minus 70 degrees centigrade,” he said. “We vaccinate children and pregnant women as part of our universal immunisation program. Using the same platform to store vaccines at 2 to 8 degrees centigrade, it will be easier for us to store Covid-19 vaccines,” he added.“Now, we have a data, and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved based on the studies in UK, Brazil and South Africa. There is also data from SII. I think, once the data is shown to the regulatory authority, we should get approval for the vaccine in the county within a few days. I would say days rather than weeks or months,” he said. Meanwhile, Pune-based SII has sought emergency approval for the vaccine--Covishield-- developed along with global pharma giant AstraZeneca and Oxford University. Company CEO Adar Poonawalla  on Monday said Covishield rollout is expected in January and 40-50 million doses of the vaccine have already been stockpiled.This comes in the backdrop of Covid-19 cases in the country crossing the 10.22 million-mark on Wednesday. According to the health ministry website, there are 262,272 active cases of Covid-19 and 98,341,41 people have recovered from the disease so far. As many as 148,439 have lost their lives due to the infection.(with ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-have-covid-19-vaccine-within-days-aiims-director/story-IIoECY3cPkFMh3THZNfz3M.html

After the United Kingdom, which is battling a new strain of the coronavirus, approved the vaccine being made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, India too is expected to follow suit. A meeting of the expert panel of Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) will take place on Friday where a decision is expected. Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), which is manufacturing the adenovirus vaccine in India, has already applied for its emergency approval.Meanwhile, China has given conditional approval for general public use to a Covid-19 vaccine developed by China National Biotec Group (CNBG). The approval is the first for general public use among a handful of Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidates in various stages of development. Colombia and Bolivia have reached deals with Johnson & Johnson and Russia respectively for a vaccine.Here are the latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccine: 1. In the United States (US), Kansas governor Laura Kelly has received the first of two vaccine shots. Kelly designated herself and 10 other state officials as eligible to commence vaccination this week. The governor added that hundreds of other, non-elected state officials have been made eligible for early vaccines by their agencies. “We’re putting them in line so that we can ensure that the state government can continue to function,” Kelly said. Till now, only about 2.7 million Americans have been vaccinated as of Wednesday evening in New York, according to Bloomberg.2. Syringe and needle makers in Brazil warned that the country’s Covid-19 vaccination program was at risk after the Jair Bolsonaro-led government set very low auction prices and further failed to draw bids for enough syringes to meet requirements. The health ministry on Tuesday had sought to purchase 331 million syringes at an electronic auction but ended up purchasing only eight million, or 2.5 per cent of the target.

31-12-2020||India||India calls on Sri Lanka for early release of 40 fishermen||India on Wednesday called on Sri Lanka to ensure the early release of fishermen arrested recently on the charge of poaching in Sri Lankan waters.According to a statement by Ministry of Fisheries, the Indian side also reiterated the need for releasing all fishing boats in Sri Lankan custody in line with the commitment given by Sri Lankan President during his state visit to India in November 2019.This issue came at the fourth meeting of the joint working group on fisheries through virtual mode, during which the entire gamut of issues related to fishermen and fishing boats was discussed.Referring to the recent ‘apprehension’ of 40 fishermen and 6 boats by Sri Lanka Navy, the leader of the Indian delegation called on the Sri Lankan side to ensure their early release and till such time, to provide necessary facilitation including consular access and necessary assistance, the release said.The Fisheries Ministry said that two sides also exchanged views on the status of cooperation between Navy and Coast Guard of both countries in patrolling, existing hotline between the Coast Guards and related operational matters, cooperation in preservation of marine environment as well as the schedule for the fifth meeting of the JWG. The Indian side conveyed its sincere determination to work in a constructive spirit with the Sri Lankan side for convening an early meeting of the Fisheries Ministers on both sides.Earlier this year, during the virtual bilateral Summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa held on 26 September, both leaders agreed to “continue engagement to address the issues related to fishermen through regular consultation and bilateral channels.”The Indian side highlighted the initiatives being taken by India under the new Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana and other schemes of Government of India and governments of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to diversify and reduce fishing pressure in the Palk Bay.The first meeting of the Joint Working Group was held on December 31, 2016, in New Delhi. The Second Joint Working Group was held in Colombo on April 7, 2017. Meanwhile, the third meeting was held in New Delhi on October 13, 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-calls-on-sri-lanka-for-early-release-of-40-fishermen/story-YmT6vFhSmej9hAFqb5O47J.html
31-12-2020||India||How Covid-19 pandemic hit the states||Two months into the outbreak in India at the start of May, Ladakh was by a large margin the region with the highest testing rate with 8,294 samples tested for every million residents. Delhi was second, with around 2,500 tests per million, followed by Andhra Pradesh (1962). Manipur (149 tests per million), Mizoram (151) and West Bengal (171) were the states testing the least. In terms of case fatality ratio (CFR), in Meghalaya, 8.3% of people getting infected were dying — the highest proportion in the country — followed by Madhya Pradesh (5.3%) and Gujarat (5.0%). Among the states that had reported death, fewest were dying in Kerala (0.6%), Bihar (0.6%) and Odisha (0.7%).  OCTOBER 1Jump six months to the start of October, and the states with smaller population now dominate the testing per million ranking. Ladakh was still at the top, and was followed by Arunachal Pradesh and Goa (Delhi was on the fourth spot with around 16,000 tests per million). Madhya Pradesh now was the state with the lowest testing rate in the country (25,097), followed by West Bengal (33,758) and Nagaland (37,407). Also Read | Resuming life after Covid-19 lockdownBy this time, most states had significantly improved their CFRs and the ranking had changed significantly. Punjab was now seeing the largest proportion of cases end in fatalities – 3%. In Maharashtra (by a large margin the worst-hit state in the country), 2.6% of cases were dying, while in Gujarat this number was 2.5%. States with smaller populations were again better performing in saving lives as only 0.1% cases were dying in Daman & Diu, followed by 0.2% in Arunachal Pradesh and 0.3% in Nagaland.DECEMBER 29By the end of December, Delhi had gone on a blitzkrieg of testing through early November to curb the third wave in the Capital. As a result, it again finds itself among the best-testing regions (428,000 tests per million) behind Andaman and Nicobar islands. Madhya Pradesh (55,779) still has the worst testing rate in the country, followed by Nagaland and Rajasthan.

31-12-2020||India||Resuming life after Covid-19 lockdown||As infections were reported first across the world, the preferred first step to control Covid-19 by most countries was a lockdown. On March 25, India went into what was one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. This first set of curbs remained in place till April 14 and was extended four times till the end of May, each time with gradual relaxations. This was then followed by seven phases of gradual unlocking till December 31.Google publishes Covid-19 Community Mobility Reports for 131 countries to show how the lockdown affected the movement of people. The report uses “aggregated and anonymised data to chart movement trends over time by geography” across a range of places such as grocery stores, parks, workplaces and places of transit and compares it to a “baseline” activity established as per pre-lockdown. A look at what it showed for India.Also Read | The rise of data as an antivirusWORKPLACESMovement at offices and workplaces dropped to its lowest in the recorded time frame touching -72% on March 25 — the day the nationwide lockdown kicked off. It averaged in the late -60s till the end of the second phase of the lockdown, from when it started showing a gradual recovery. By the last week of December a large number of offices had shifted to a work-from-home model, which meant that activity at workplaces remained around 15% below the baseline. RESIDENTIALThere was a 30% increase from baseline in mobility around residential areas on the first day of the nationwide lockdown. This remained more or less the same through the next five weeks. Through May, however, movement around residential areas started dropping every week, finally settling at around 10% above pre-lockdown levels by the end of the year. GROCERY AND PHARMACYThis is the field that has reported the biggest resumption of activity among all sectors mapped. From a 77% drop in movement at retail and recreational locations on March 25, it dropped further to 80% through April and most of May. From October onwards, activities have overtaken what was reported in pre-pandemic levels – a factor that offers some cheer for the economic recovery of the country. TRANSIT HUBSWhen the lockdown was announced, movement at transit hubs such as trains and metro stations dropped 73% from the baseline – one of the biggest drops recorded. Since then, it reported a gradual recovery, but by the last week of the year it still to remains around 8% below the baseline. RETAIL AND RECREATIONMovement at retail and recreational locations dropped 78% on March 25, the first day of the lockdown. This remained low the next few weeks, dropping as low as -87% on April 18. Through May, however, activity started recovering slightly by the end of the fourth lockdown. But even by the end of December, activity at retail and recreation centres remains around 30% below pre-pandemic levels.PARKSThis is another one of the activity centres in the Google report that has shown relatively little recovery. On May 25, data shows that 54% fewer people were logged in and around parks across the country. This went on to drop to as much as -68% by the end of March. And though it since recovered, movement at parks remained 15% below the baseline by the end of December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resuming-life-after-covid-19-lockdown/story-0CWCX2ueWl4Lddih70r21O.html
31-12-2020||India||The rise of data as an antivirus||No one could have known back in December 2019, when the first batch of infections of Covid-19 were identified in Wuhan, China, that what was happening would change the world as we know it. Events throughout 2020 would be drastically dictated, and reshaped, by the discovery of that virus. What transpired through the year was a global pandemic of a scale not seen since the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic. But in 100-plus years since then, much has changed. Technology and globalisation now allow people to travel at a far faster rate, which ended up spreading the disease a lot quicker. But this advancement in technology also allowed scientists to track, in near real-time, how the virus was spreading; discover more about the virus almost every passing day; understand which treatments were working and which weren’t ; measure the impact of the outbreak on the economy; and most recently, monitor new mutations in the virus strain.Within weeks, government-funded as well as independent data scientists kicked off large-scale tracking exercises that generated troves of real-time data, all posted online, and shared to be used by the entire world. This data, coupled with recent advances in computing power and new analytical study methods, would go on to play a massive role as the year progressed. The role of high-quality, transparent, and disaggregated data and statistics became the pivot around which governments across the world drafted strategies to fight the outbreak.All this led to the biggest collaborative public data-gathering exercise in history, enabling thousands of people (scientists and amateur data experts alike) to break down, analyse and study how the virus behaved, and to find ways in which a pandemic could be stopped.Also Read | Year-end cheer: India closer to Covid-19 vaccine after UK’s Oxford nodAs 2020 ends , here’s a look at what a year of data told us about a new virus, and what it says about the future.DISTINCT WAVES, EACH GETTING WORSEAmong the several lessons from the 1918 influenza was that such massive viral outbreaks come in distinct waves, which generally tend to get more severe in each instance. The 1918 influenza rolled out in three distinct waves – the first peaked in early 1918, the second towards the spring of the same year, while the third peaked in winter of 1918 and early 1919. The second wave caused significantly more deaths than the first, while the third was marginally less fatal than the second. Scientists believe that the second wave was caused by a more virulent mutant virus, somewhat akin to the mutant strain of Covid-19 discovered in the UK earlier this month. The second wave was also exacerbated by troop movement for World War I.Such clear waves have been visible in the coronavirus outbreak as well – although the severity has altered to a degree. Let’s take the case of the United States (by far the worst-hit in the world with nearly 20 million cases and nearly 350,000 deaths). It is the only country to have witnessed three clear waves with each reporting more cases than the one preceding it. But deaths during the second wave didn’t rise as much, while the third wave, despite being more fatal than the second, was proportionately better than the first wave (see chart 1). Most European nations are currently grappling with the second wave – which, again, was more severe than the first in terms of cases, but better in terms of deaths.The drop in deaths in the second wave in Covid can primarily be explained by two main factors. One, thanks to advances in technology, doctors and scientists were able to work at a far more frenetic pace and were able to identify treatments far more effectively compared to a century ago. Within a few months of the emergence of the virus, they were able to learn a good deal about the treatments that work, and just as importantly, those that don’t. Second, thanks to advancement in IT, medical experts the world over are now able to instantly share any breakthrough treatment to better to protect people.POSITIVITY RATE AS AN INDICATOROne of the most crucial data aspects of Covid-19 is the positivity rate, or the percentage of samples tested that return positive for Covid-19. This is a key metric in determining how widespread the virus is in a community, with some saying it is a clearer indicator of the intensity of an outbreak than case figures. A common thread in the outbreak across the world was that the positivity rate of a region started rising a few weeks before cases did, and vice versa, dropping before cases came under control. India’s case and positivity rate trajectories serve as a good example (see chart 2).An HT analysis on September 28 showed that states and Union territories in India that had a lower positivity rate, and thus a well-calibrated testing strategy, saw a lower proportion of their population succumbing to the virus. This means that adequate testing, especially when the positivity rate in a region starts rising, forms a very crucial aspect of saving lives.According to the World Health Organization a positivity rate below 5% for at least two weeks in a region means the outbreak is under control. In India, the positivity rate has been below this threshold for a month-and-a-half now.THE SUPERSPREADER FACTORThe number of secondary cases generated from every single primary case is one of the most crucial factors that determines how fast an epidemic grows, and subsequently how dangerous it is. One of the key characteristics of Covid-19 that epidemiologists noticed early on during its spread was how certain people ended up becoming superspreaders – they were responsible for infecting a lot more people. While instances of superspreading have been reported for more than a century, dating back to 1918, a vast volume of research data was generated this year regarding Covid-19 superspreaders.A study published in October in the journal Science, on transmission patterns of Sars-CoV-2, showed that there was a wide variance in the number of people to whom infected people passed on the virus — while many were not infecting anyone, a handful of superspreaders were responsible for a majority of new infections. It showed that only 8% of all infected patients accounted for 60% of new infections (and thus become superspreaders), while 70% of infected patients did not pass the disease to anyone (see chart 3). The contact-tracing study, conducted by a group of researchers led by Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Washington-based Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP), looked at disease transmission patterns in at least 575,000 people who were exposed to nearly 85,000 Covid infections in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.Another study by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published in early November, analysed 60 superspreaders and superspreading events to find that these have a much larger role in transmission than earlier believed, and that such examples were a lot more common than earlier estimated. The study’s lead author, Felix Wong, a post-doctoral researcher at MIT, wrote that extreme events that deviate significantly from the mean are a lot more frequent than what one would predict. “Most people generate zero or one cases, but it’s the people generating hundreds of cases that we really should be worried about,” Wong wrote.Experts say superspreaders are the real engine behind the growth of Covid. In order to contain superspreading, the MIT researchers ran mathematical simulations where gatherings were limited to 10 people, i.e. each infected person was assumed to have had only 10 contacts (and infecting only 10 even in the most extreme case). This, they found, curbed the impact of the small superspreader group, bringing down infection numbers quickly.THE AGE FACTOROne of the earliest lessons picked up by doctors and scientists about the nature of Covid-19 was how it was disproportionately fatal for those who are older, even though it infects people in the younger age groups far more. In other words, the risk of severe illness, and subsequently death, increases with age; but the risk of infection is higher among younger people. This is very clearly visible in the death trends in the US, where eight out of 10 people who have died were above the age of 65 years, according to data maintained by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This is very similar in India as well, where nearly nine in every 10 people who lost their lives to the disease till December 16 were above the age of 45, even though only four out of every 10 reported infections fell in that age group.The role of age also explains why countries such as India performed better at saving lives than the West. Countries with a lower median age ended up seeing a better case fatality rate – the proportion of infected patients that die. In India, for instance, where the median age is around 28 years (the youngest among the world’s worst-hit countries), around 1.4% of those infected have died – the lowest among the countries worst-hit by Covid. In contrast, Italy, which has the oldest population among world’s worst-hit Covid nations with a median age of 46 years, has seen the largest proportion of deaths – 3.5%. Similarly, the UK (median age: 41) and the US (median age: 38) have both fared much worse than India in CFR – 3.1% and 1.7% respectively.SAVING LIVES: THE ENDGAMEThe final goal when battling an outbreak is to save as many lives as possible – an area where doctors and governments are improving every day. When Covid-19 surfaced, in the initial weeks, very little was understood about how the disease progressed, and a relatively larger proportion of those infected were dying.In the first few weeks of the outbreak in China, around 17% of all people getting infected were dying (for cases reported in Wuhan between January 1 and 10). By the end of January, this number had settled to around the 3% in China – the CFR number that was then widely regarded as the global average of the disease. However, when the disease gripped other parts of the world, the CFR showed massive variances. In France, for instance, one in every five people (19.7%) getting infected was dying by early May. Around the same time in Italy, around 14% of all infected people were dying. While this may be because of the relatively older population in these countries (as stated above), this high CFR was not limited to just these countries. Around the same time, over 7% of all people who had been reported infected had died the world over.But from there, things start getting better. As scientists and doctors studied the disease more, they figured out better treatments, while the lockdowns imposed roughly from May to August in the West gave some reprieve to the health care systems in these countries. By early September, the global CFR dropped to less than half the peak level – 3.4%. In fact, if we only look at the cases reported after September across the world, this number has again halved and stands at 1.6%. The overall global CFR of the disease is 2.2% at the moment.GOING FORWARD: THE ROLE OF DATA CLARITYThroughout history, humanity has never seen a time where the importance of rapidly processed, clear, open and disaggregated data and statistics has been as clearly underlined as it has been during this year. A stronger argument has never been in place to have accurate, open and readily available data at all levels – local, district, state, national, even global.Governments across the world must push to make all Covid-19 data — testing, geographical spread, availability of hospital beds, results of clinical trials, age/gender break-ups — public. In this global crisis, data collaboration between governments, doctors, epidemiologists, researchers, academia, think tanks, civil society, as well as the private sector, has been pivotal in saving lives. Independent researchers, journalists and data scientists have set up open-sourced Covid-19 dashboards to track infection data from nearly every country in the world. Data nerds across the world (this writer included) have relied heavily on dashboards such as Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 database, Worldometers, Our World in Data, and others, to analyse trajectories and trends. Sharing information openly and transparently on caseloads and deaths, gaps in the health care system, vaccine development, and scientific and medical developments, is the foundation on which scientists and governments will build the machinery to mitigate this pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-rise-of-data-as-an-antivirus/story-4OJnoxDtroS2uQKOp7E8YP.html

The attack comes within days of police arresting four militant associates and scuttling their separate plans to trigger grenade explosions in Poonch and Jammu districts at the behest of their handlers in Pakistan with the intention to disturb peace in Jammu region and harm communal brotherhood.“A grenade was thrown on a temple in Hiranagar sector around 7.30 pm but luckily it missed the intended target and exploded in an open area, without causing any damage or casualty,” Kathua Senior Superintendent of Police Shalinder Mishra told PTI about the Wednesday evening attack.He said the whole area was immediately cordoned off and a massive operation was launched to nab the assailants.No one has been arrested so far, he said. Officials said the blast triggered panic among the people who ran for cover after hearing the loud noise. On Sunday, police had arrested a Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist with two grenades near Bagh-e-Bahu in Jammu, foiling his attempt to carry out an attack in the winter capital. A day earlier, three militant associates were arrested and six grenades were seized from them in Poonch district as police said they were planning to carry out a grenade attack at a religious place with the intention to harm the communal harmony in the border district.On December 25, two terrorists, hailing from south Kashmir and affiliated with ‘The Resistance Force’ (TRF), believed to be an offshoot of LeT, were arrested in Jammu with an AK assault rifle, one pistol and some ammunition .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grenade-attack-on-kathua-temple-misses-target-blast-triggers-panic/story-M0ss3cHaEcuz5c7YikDd2H.html
31-12-2020||India||BJP, JJP suffer setback in Haryana civic polls||Haryana’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Janta Jannayak Party (JJP) combine suffered an electoral setback on Wednesday as it could win just one of the three mayoral seats for which elections were held on Sunday, an outcome that came against the backdrop of an ongoing farmers’ protest against three contentious farm laws.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November 26, demanding a repeal of the three laws. While the BJP won in Panchkula, the Congress and the Haryana Jan Chetna Party (HJCP) bagged mayoral posts in Sonipat and Ambala, respectively. It was for the first time that direct elections were held for mayoral posts in the three cities. The setback for the ruling coalition has come in the wake of the BJP sweeping mayors polls in five Haryana cities two years ago.In 2018, the party had won mayoral polls in Hisar, Karnal, Panipat, Rohtak and Yamunanagar. In November this year, the ruling combine had failed to win the Baroda assembly bypolls in Sonipat, with the Congress retaining the seat.For the post of mayor in Ambala, HJCP’s Shakti Rani Sharma, wife of former Union minister Venod Sharma, emerged as a surprise winner, defeating Vandana Sharma of the BJP by a margin of 8,084 votes. The Congress candidate ended up at the fourth spot, officials said. The win came as a boost to the Venod Sharma-led party, which tasted its first win after the 2014 Haryana assembly poll debacle. Kulbushan Goyal of the BJP will be Panchkula’s new mayor. He defeated Congress’ Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia by 2,057 votes.For the elections to the mayor’s post in Panchkula, 1,333 voters exercised the NOTA option.The Congress won the Sonipat mayoral polls. The party’s Nikhil Madaan defeated BJP’s Lalit Batra by 13,818 votes. Polls were also held to elect councillors of all wards in the three cities. Voting was also held to elect the president and members of the municipal council in Rewari and the municipal committees of Sampla (Rohtak), Dharuhera (Rewari) and Ukalana (Hisar).In the Ambala MC polls, the BJP won eight of the 20 seats, HJCP 7, Congress 3 and Haryana Democratic Front 2. In Sonipat, the BJP won 10 wards and the Congress 9. On one seat, an Independent emerged victorious. In Panchkula, the BJP and the Congress won nine and seven seats, respectively. The JJP won two. The post of the Rewari municipal council chairperson was bagged by BJP’s Poonam Yadav.

31-12-2020||India||India extends suspension of UK flights till January 7||India has extended the suspension of flights to and from the UK until January 7 from December 31 in bid to contain the spread of a new, more transmissible strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that originated in that country, and at the same time delayed by a month the planned resumption of regular international commercial flights. A decision has been taken to extend the temporary suspension of flights to and from the UK till 7 January 2021. Thereafter, strictly regulated resumption will take place, for which details will be announced shortly,” civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Twitter on Wednesday.Flights to and from the UK were suspended on December 23 after the UK government announced the detection of the highly infectious variant of the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The tighter screening process imposed on the last batch of returnees has already resulted in 20 cases of Covid-19 caused by the variant being detected; other returnees, over the past month, are being traced across India. Details of the restrictions that will be imposed on India-bound flights from the UK after January 7 are being drafted, Puri wrote on Twitter .According to officials aware of the development, the government may mandate the Reverse Transcription- Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test for all passengers flying in from the UK after January 7 in addition to mandatory quarantine.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) , the aviation regulator,on Wednesday also extended until January 31 the suspension of regular international flights until January 31.Also Read | New coronavirus strain in India: Here are some states where cases have been foundIndia has been operating international flights through special arrangements called transport bubbles reached with 24 countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Canada, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, the Maldives, Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Rwanda, Tanzania, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates (UAE), the UK and US since suspending scheduled overseas flight operations in March.Puri had said at a press conference on Tuesday that the suspension of flights to and from the UK was likely to be extended. “I foresee a slight extension of the temporary suspension. I don’t expect that extension to be a long or indefinite extension. In the next day or two, we will find out if any additional steps need to be taken, or when we can start easing the current temporary suspension,” Puri said.The minister said passengers who arrived from the UK on December 21 and 22 were made to take an RT-PCR test for Covid-19 at the airport, with only those who tested negative being allowed to go home, where they were told to stay in isolation for seven days.

31-12-2020||India||Cold wave conditions prevail in North India||Cold wave conditions continued to prevail in the northern states of the country on Wednesday, while dense fog enveloped several areas, including Jammu where nine flights were cancelled due to poor visibility.The India Meteorological Department said a cold wave swept through Delhi as the minimum temperature dipped to 3.5 degrees Celsius.    The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 3.5 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 16.4 degrees Celsius.The weather stations at Jafarpur and Lodhi Road recorded a low of 3.5 degrees Celsius and 3.7 degrees Celsius, respectively, it said.During nighttime, “dense” fog reduced visibility to 50 meters in the Palam area. However, it improved to 400 meters by 9 am. The visibility at Safdarjung was 500 meters.Delhi’s air quality was recorded in the “poor” category on Wednesday. The city’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was 290.Nine flights to and from Jammu Airport were cancelled as a dense fog enveloped the region for a second day, while the prevailing cold wave condition tightened its grip after the recent snowfall in the high altitude areas. Jammu Airport Director Pravat Ranjan Beuria said five more flights have been delayed.A dense fog returned to Jammu city amid a drop in the night temperature which settled at 2.9 degrees Celsius, 4.5 notches below normal during this part of the season.However, the sun came out around noon provided some relief from the bone-chilling cold and improvement in the visibility in some areas.Bhaderwah in Doda district was the coldest recorded place in Jammu region with a low of minus 3.8 degrees Celsius, a spokesman of the MET department said.The shrine atop Trikuta hills and adjoining areas also experienced the first snowfall of the season on the weekend. Intense cold wave conditions swept Kashmir as the mercury fell below the freezing point across the valley.The cloud cover ahead of Tuesday’s snowfall had kept the night temperature around the freezing point for two consecutive nights in most parts of the valley but the respite ended as the mercury plunged to minus 11 degrees in Gulmarg in north Kashmir, the officials said.They said Gulmarg tourist destination was the coldest recorded place in the valley.Pahalgam, which serves as the base camp for annual Amarnath yatra in south Kashmir, recorded a low of minus 9 degrees Celsius -- a drop of six notches in 24 hours.The officials said the minimum temperature in Srinagar - the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir - was minus 2.2 degrees Celsius on Tuesday night.There was dense to very dense fog at isolated places in western Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday and cold wave conditions prevailed at a few places across the state.The Lucknow meteorological office said day temperatures fell markedly in Allahabad division, while there was no large change in the state’s other divisions.The day temperature was appreciably below normal in Jhansi, Agra and Meerut divisions and normal in the others. The lowest temperature in the state was recorded in Fursatganj at 3.6 degrees Celsius, while the highest was recorded in Banda at 23.6 degrees Celsius.The weather office forecast said it would most likely remain dry in the state and warned that dense fog was likely in western UP and isolated places in the eastern part of the state.Cold wave conditions are likely to prevail at isolated places in the state, the weather office said. The Meteorological Department has forecast rain and snowfall in Himachal Pradesh from January 3 to 5. The Shimla MeT Centre has predicted rainfall in plains and low hills, and rain and snowfall in mid and high hills of the state from Sunday to Tuesday.  Meanwhile, the weather remained dry in the state in the last 24 hours, Shimla MeT centre director Manmohan Singh said.  Keylong, Kalpa, Manali, Dalhousie and Kufri shivered at sub-zero temperature on Wednesday, Singh said.  Tribal district Lahaul-Spiti’s administrative centre Keylong remained the coldest place in the state at minus 12.7 degrees Celsius, he said.  Shimla recorded a low of 0.9 degree Celsius.Cold conditions persisted in parts of Rajasthan where mercury dipped below freezing point at two places.Mount Abu shivered at minus 4 degrees Celsius, while in the plains Churu was the coldest, recording a minimum temperature of minus 1.5 degrees Celsius followed by Pilani where the mercury settled at 0.5 degrees. Cold wave conditions prevailed in most parts of Punjab and Haryana, even as a thick layer of fog enveloped the two states in the morning.The minimum temperatures hovered well below the normal limits at most places, even though there was a marginal increase as compared to Tuesday’s temperatures.At a low of 1.8 degrees Celsius, Amritsar was the coldest place in Punjab.Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, also experienced a cold night at 4.6 degrees Celsius.Narnaul was the coldest place in Haryana recording a low of 2.4 degrees Celsius, while Hisar, Sirsa and Bhiwani also reeled under biting chill with respective minimum temperatures of 3.7, 3.6 and 3.9 degrees Celsius.According to the MeT department officials, barring Rohtak, a thick blanket of fog enveloped the two states in the morning, reducing visibility levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cold-wave-conditions-prevail-in-north-india/story-KLpSUlV7AIbb4powr5JFTM.html

31-12-2020||India||Uttarakhand: Interfaith couple booked for religious conversion in violation of law||An interfaith couple who had approached the Uttarakhand High Court seeking protection has been booked here along with two others for allegedly not following the provisions of the state’s anti-conversion law, police said on Wednesday. According to police, this is the first case of violation of the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act in the state since it came into force in 2018. An FIR was lodged at the Patel Nagar police station here on Tuesday against the couple who got married in September, the husband’s uncle in whose presence the ‘nikah’ took place and the qazi who solemnised the alliance, Patel Nagar SHO Pradeep Rana said.The high court, after the couple approached it seeking protection, had directed the District Magistrate to inquire into the matter, police said. The police found that the woman had converted to Islam without informing her parents or the district authorities prior to her marriage as is required by the law, SHO Rana said.Circle Officer Anuj Kumar said it was in violation of sections 3, 8 and 12 of the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018.Section 3 of the Act prohibits conversion either directly or otherwise, by use of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage.  Section 8 of the Act says, “One who desires to convert his religion, shall give a declaration at least one month in advance to the District Magistrate or any official authorised by him for the purpose saying that he wishes to convert his religion on his own and at his free consent and without any force, coercion, undue influence or allurement.“The religious priest, who performs purification Sanskar or conversion  ceremony for converting any person of one religion to another religion, shall give one month’s advance notice of such conversion to the DM or someone authorised by him.” It further says any contravention of the provisions shall have the effect of rendering the said conversion, illegal and void.Section 12 says when an offence is committed under this Act everyone deemed to have taken part in its commission by way of aiding, abetting or counselling conversion shall be charged as if he has actually committed it.  This is the first case of violation of the Act since it came into force in 2018, the Circle Officer said. In another case, the Uttarakhand High Court had recently asked the Haridwar administration to give protection to a couple after the wife cited a threat from her family due to their interfaith marriage. The woman had filed a notice before the district magistrate of Haridwar for changing religion from Islam to Hinduism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-interfaith-couple-booked-for-religious-conversion-in-violation-of-law/story-pc2GyOM7SLRDakbwJFjinI.html
31-12-2020||India||Shaheen Bagh shooter Kapil Gujjar joins BJP, expelled two hours later||Kapil Gujjar, the man who allegedly fired at least two shots in the air close to New Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh in February and warned anti-CAA protestors assembled there to disperse, formally joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday, only to be thrown out less than two hours later when the local unit of the party realised who he was.Functionaries of the BJP said Gujjar joined the party together with his supporters at the city unit’s office in the Nehru Nagar area in a ceremony where sweets were distributed and his admission to the party was cheered.“Today, Kapil Gujjar joined with hundreds of his supporters and he has influence in his area. The youth have joined the party as they like our party’s policies; the way our Prime Minister works; the way our chief minister Yogi Adityanath ji works and also the way our state president Swatantra Dev Singh ji is working to strengthen the party,” Sanjeev Sharma, president of the BJP’s city unit, told reporters.“These youth were working for Hindutva and were working in other parties. But today they all came under one flag and met the state president who directed me to arrange for their joining,” Sharma added.Near the Shaheen Bagh protest site on February 1, Gujjar fired at least two shots in the air from a pistol, warned protestors against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to disperse and shouted communal slogans. The police registered a case against him under the Arms Act; he received bail from a city court on March 7.On Wednesday, the city unit of he BJP was caught on the back foot when news of Gujjar’s entry into the party went viral on social media. Sharma hurriedly released a statement that said some members claiming to be from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) had approached the BJP for admission and Kapil Gujjar was among them. He said Gujjar’s link with the Shaheen Bagh controversy hadn’t been known to the party, and once it came to light, the state leadership directed the city unit to cancel his membership with immediate effect.“He came with his supporters at around 2pm for joining. We had no clue about the controversy related to Shaheen Bagh. So by 4pm, we cancelled his joining and also of others who came with him. We got directions for cancellation from our senior leaders,” Sharma said.He didn’t reply when asked whether the BJP had checked Gujjar’s credentials before he was admitted.BSP district president Kuldeep Kumar said Gujjar and the others who joined the BJP were neither the party’s members nor its supporters. “The BJP unit is trying to drag our party’s name into controversy due to frustration as their act (Gujjar’s admission) came to light. We have absolutely no connection with Gujjar whatsoever,” he added.Gujjar had said at his admission ceremony that he wished to do “big for Hindutva”.“The BJP is strengthening Hindutva and wants to take it forward. Most of the works are for mostly for Hindus. I also want to work for Hindutva and want to do big,” Gujjar told reporters.BJP’s Uttar Pradesh state spokesperson Chandra Mohan noted that the Ghaziabad unit had immediately cancelled the membership of Gujjar and his associates after coming to know of the Shaheen Bagh controversy. “At the party level, we are conducting an inquiry of all people attached to Gujjar’s joining and suitable action will be taken,” Chandra Mohan added.Delhi police officers said on Wednesday that they were yet to file a charge sheet in the case against Gujjar because they were still awaiting the forensic report on the bullets and the pistol he used. Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rakesh Pawaria said: “The forensic report pertaining to the firearm that was used in the offence is still awaited. The probe is still on.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shaheen-bagh-shooter-kapil-gujjar-joins-bjp-expelled-two-hours-later/story-dY93Ht6MSS2x2ZuFoIjoEI.html

This year’s Independence Day celebrations were also muted because of the coronavirus disease outbreak and measures imposed to check the spread of the disease.Fewer people will be allowed to witness the parade on January 26, with the government following strict social distancing protocols, and the parade itself will be shorter and with smaller marching contingents compared to previous years, the officials cited above said on condition of anonymity. Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageNot more than 25,000 spectators will be allowed at Rajpath this year, compared to over 100,000 people who usually turn up for the parade, braving cold weather and standing in queues before the crack of dawn to enter the area. Children below the age of 15 will not be permitted at the parade. The size of the marching contingents from the armed forces and the paramilitary will be smaller. These squads will only have 96 participants compared to 144 in the ordinary course, the officials said. The shortened route of the parade will end at the National Stadium instead of the Red Fort, the officials said, adding that the cultural programmes will also be fewer.

31-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||It’s December 31, the end of the year, and India may be just a day away from approving a vaccine. The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) reviewed on Wednesday data submitted by Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech as sought by it in its last meeting. In that meeting, in response to SII’s emergency use authorisation application for Covishield (the name given by the company to the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford that it is manufacturing here), the committee asked for more data on safety and efficacy. SEC also indicated that it would wait for an approval of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine by the UK drug regulator, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The data was submitted last week, and on Wednesday morning, MHRA approved the vaccine (the Phase 3 trials were carried out in the UK and Brazil; Indian phase 3 trials are ongoing, and it is believed that some of the interim findings from that are part of the data submitted by the company). Bharat Biotech is also believed to have submitted some data although it isn’t clear whether this includes interim findings from its ongoing Phase 3 trials. Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageSEC has said it will meet again on Friday. It’s possible that an approval for Covishield could come the same day. This means India could start vaccinating people as early as next week if everything else is in place.A combination of circumstances and events has made this possible, but no one could have scripted it better – to end what may well be the worst year of this millennium with an inexpensive locally made vaccine which is easy to transport and store is the best of all possible outcomes. The new year will be more about vaccines and vaccination than anything else (even the new strain, which, as expected, has surfaced in more places and people in India). As The Who sang, “Got a feeling ’21, is going to be a good year.”The UK has said it will start vaccinating people with the AstraZeneca/Oxford shot on Monday. Phase 3 trials have shown the vaccine to be 62% effective when two full doses are administered. That compares unfavourably with the 95% efficacy shown by vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, but over the weekend, AstraZeneca’s CEO told The Sunday Times that the company has submitted more data to the UK drugs regulator that shows that its efficacy “after two doses, is up there with everybody else”. This data is yet to be published, but 62% efficacy is not all that bad – indeed, if AstraZeneca/Oxford had been the first to declare the results of Phase 3 trials, and put out an efficacy number of 62%, the news would have been met rapturously.Ravaged by a new mutant strain of Sars-CoV-2 – the seven-day average of daily cases in the country is nearing 40,000; the tally for December 29 was around 53,000 – the UK has taken the brave (and radical) decision of giving one shot of the two two-shot vaccines it has approved (Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford) to as many people as possible, instead of stocking up for scheduled second shots. This could mean an increase in the time between the two shots to as much as 12 weeks, instead of the recommended four. The UK’s decision will affect the efficacy of the vaccines for sure – only detailed studies will show to what extent – but the country’s hand may have been forced by the surge in cases that has already overwhelmed its health system. India may be tempted to follow suit, but given that the seven-day average of daily cases is at a six-month low, the country would do well to stick to its plan of administering two shots of the vaccine to 300 million people in its primary priority group (the deadline to do this is June). Serum Institute expects to increase its capacity to 100 million doses a month by March and 300 million doses by July.The challenges posed by the pandemic are not over, and 2021 will see more challenges related to what will be the world’s biggest vaccination drive, but a dashboard of vaccinations will be a welcome addition to HT’s Covid-19 database.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-aP78IX9rDZpH8aBIyTe7gM.html
31-12-2020||India||14 more cases of new Covid-19 strain in India; 4 in Delhi||Fourteen more people have tested positive for a hyper-infectious, mutant strain of the coronavirus in India, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday, taking the tally of such cases in the country to 20. Four of the new patients were from Delhi, officials in the city-state confirmed.On Tuesday, six people — three from Karnataka and one each from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh — who returned from the UK were found to be carrying the new variant, which is known as VOC-202012/01. Of the 14 new cases on Wednesday, eight were detected at the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Delhi, four at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences Hospital (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru, and one each at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in Delhi and the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBG) in West Bengal’s Kalyani.Apart from the four Delhi residents, a 33-year-old woman from Noida’s Sector 50, who returned from the UK on December 18, was found to be infected by the mutant strain on Wednesday. Also Read | A year of trials: Controversies, pitfalls AstraZeneca-Oxford Covid-19 vaccine faced“As of Wednesday, of the total Covid positive UK returnees having the new strain, four are residents of Delhi. This is as per the reports conveyed to the Delhi government by NCDC,” a senior government official said, requesting anonymity. This number was later confirmed by Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev.Elsewhere, while Bengal confirmed its first case of the new strain, the Karnataka government said a total of seven people, including the three detected on Tuesday, tested positive in the southern state after genome sequencing of positive samples released by the Indian Sars-Cov-2 Genomics Consortium (Insacog) labs. The place of residence of the other new patients was not known immediately. Positive samples of those who returned from the UK recently have been sequenced in six of the 10 designated, government-run Insacog labs across the country. According to government estimates, about 33,000 passengers arrived from the UK at various Indian airports from November 25 to December 23. Authorities have begun conducting the gold-standard RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test on these passengers in batches, though tracing all of them is becoming a difficult task with hundreds furnishing vague addresses and switching off their phones. Those found negative in RT-PCR tests are sent to a seven-day home quarantine, while the genome sequencing of positive samples are done at Insacog labs for the detection of the possible UK variant of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThose detected with the mutant strain are being kept in single-room isolation in designated health care facilities by states. Their close contacts are also being put in quarantine even as comprehensive contact-tracing has been initiated for co-travellers, family contacts and others, according to the government.“The situation is under careful watch and regular advice is being provided to the States for enhanced surveillance, containment, testing & dispatch of samples to INSACOG labs,” a health ministry statement said.India also extended the suspension of flights to and from the UK until January 7 from December 31, in a bid to contain the spread of the new strain believed to have been originated in that country. In West Bengal, the son of a senior official of the state health department tested positive for the new variant after returning from London 10 days ago, news agency PTI quoted an unnamed official as saying.“He is undergoing treatment at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital’s super-specialty section. He is under observation. We have advised all those who have come in contact with him to isolate themselves,” the official told PTI. He added that the patient was not having “serious health issues” at the moment.In Karnataka, health minister K Sudhakar said of the seven people found positive for the mutant strain, three were from Bengaluru and four from Shivamogga. The swab samples of 26 people who tested positive for Covid-19 were sent to NIMHANS to ascertain whether it was the new strain, he said. The 26 were among the 1,614 UK returnees, who underwent the tests.First detected in London and Kent in mid-September, the variant was identified by UK authorities as a matter of concern on December 14. They later disclosed evidence that it appeared to be more transmissible, and was behind a spike in cases in the country’s capital as well as its south-east. The variant has 23 changes in its genome, eight of which appear to influence the spike protein that the pathogen uses to latch on to host cells. Some of the other changes could make it more adept at infecting susceptible cells and possibly even evade some immune response, although detailed studies are underway. In a preliminary assessment released late on Monday, UK scientists estimated that VOC-202012/01 did not lead to more deaths or hospitalisations but caused noticeably more secondary infections than the older variant. The new variant has already been reported by Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore. Clinical microbiologists said the new variant did not seem to be posing a big threat in terms of severity of the disease, even though it is capable of infecting more people in a given time.“Increased transmissibility means more people will get infected...since there are no implications on pathogenicity, which is the ability to cause the disease, it isn’t much of a concern at the moment. For Covid-19 detection, the same RT-PCR testing will be conducted, and the government’s surveillance system is already in place to conduct large-scale genome sequencing to check for the new variant. So, nothing essentially changes on ground,” said Dr Navin Kumar, head, clinical microbiology and infection prevention, Manipal Hospital, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/14-more-cases-of-new-covid-19-strain-in-india-4-in-delhi/story-GDKIu5LaMcznXwKjhpheoK.html
31-12-2020||India||Year-end cheer: India closer to Covid-19 vaccine after UK’s Oxford nod||The UK approved on Wednesday the coronavirus vaccine developed by University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, paving the way for its rollout at a time when the country is in the grip of its worst wave of infections, and offering an important endorsement that will likely be taken into account in India, where authorities reviewed the inoculation later in the day.While the UK said it will begin administering the first shots from next week, Indians will likely need to wait a little longer since the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) – which is vetting the data from safety and efficacy trials – said it is yet to reach a decision and a further meeting will be convened on Friday. The SEC decision is likely to factor in the approval by UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The adenovirus vaccine is being manufactured by Pune‘s Serum Institute of India (SII). Described as a “vaccine for the world”, it is the most likely candidate to meet a large chunk of India’s vaccination needs because it is cheaper, easier to store and transport, and likely to be more available than the two other vaccines so far approved in other countries -- mRNA ones developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Also Read | A year of trials: Controversies, pitfalls AstraZeneca-Oxford Covid-19 vaccine facedUK’s MHRA, on December 2, approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, making it the first inoculation to be approved anywhere in the world after due scientific process. The Moderna vaccine was approved by the US on December 18.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent several days in intensive care with Covid earlier this year, called the approval to the Oxford vaccine a “truly fantastic news” and “a triumph for British science”. “We will now move to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible,” he added. On Tuesday, 53,135 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK -- the highest single day rise since mass testing began - as well as 414 more deaths, reinforcing the need for the country to speed up its vaccination process. London, which is among areas in south-east England where a new, more transmissible variant has been spreading, registered 14,875 new cases. The UK’s state-funded hospital system has come close to being overwhelmed, with 21,286 Covid-19 patients, forcing some hospitals to cancel other procedures. In New Delhi, the SEC of CDSCO held its second meeting on coronavirus vaccines, attended by representatives from SII, which has sought the emergency use approval. Pfizer-BioNTech and Bharat Biotech too sought approvals, which was discussed at the meeting.“…Further time was requested on behalf of Pfizer. The additional data and information presented by SII and Bharat Biotech Pvt. Ltd. was perused and analysed by the SEC. The analysis of the additional data and information is going on. SEC will convene again on 1st January 2021 (Friday),” said a statement by the government. The SEC had asked SII and Bharat Biotech for information December 9.The Union government has announced that India targets to vaccinate at least 300 million high-risk people against Covid-19 by July next year. It is currently drafting a list of recipients to be put on the priority list. In the UK, the priority list includes about 25 million people, the BBC reported. Till December 24, the last date for which data was available, according to Our World in Data, 800,000 of these people had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said: “The regulator’s assessment that this is a safe and effective vaccine is a landmark moment, and an endorsement of the huge effort from a devoted international team of researchers and our dedicated trial participants.” Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca chief executive, said the company could provide the UK with up to 2 million doses a week, with the first doses arriving on Wednesday or Thursday: “Vaccination will start next week and we will get to 1 million a week and beyond that two million a week very rapidly.”UK health secretary Matt Hancock said: “Because we’ve got enough of this vaccine on order to vaccinate the whole population – we’ve got 100 million doses on order – add that to the 30 million doses of Pfizer and that’s enough for two doses for the entire population”.But the import of UK’s decision is seen as relevant for other countries because the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is cheaper than its rivals and easier to store or move. The ultra-cold or freezer temperature storage required by other vaccines is “very impractical” in developing countries, said Dr Gillies O’Bryan-Tear, chair of policy and communications for Britain’s Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine, Reuters reported. It means the AstraZeneca one “may reach more parts of the world than the Pfizer one,” he said. The company has also said it will sell it for $2.50 a dose and plans to make up to 3 billion doses by the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/year-end-cheer-india-closer-to-covid-19-vaccine-after-uk-s-oxford-nod/story-j1p1zKTmSP6fH3tVvGpSOM.html
31-12-2020||India||Farm laws stir: Breakthrough as govt accepts two demands of farmers||The widely anticipated sixth round of talks finally led to some headway in the standoff between the Union government and protesting farm unions on Wednesday, with the Centre acceding to the demand to spare farmers heavy fines for crop-residue burning, as provided for in an anti-pollution ordinance, and to continue the current mechanism of giving subsidised power for agricultural use.However, with the two principal demands of a repeal of three new farm laws and a legal guarantee of minimum support prices yet to be discussed, the light at the end of the tunnel is still faint. The government also offered to form a five-member panel to examine the farm laws, which was also rejected by the farmers. “On the farm unions’ demand for the repeal of farm laws, the (agriculture) minister said that this too can be referred to a committee which will study the constitutional validity and propriety keeping in mind the welfare of farmers,” a government statement said.The farm unions have been asking the government to scrap three new agricultural laws approved by Parliament in September, and to bring a new legislation guaranteeing that all farm produce be bought at federally fixed assured rates. The government did not take up these core demands on Wednesday, deferring them till the next round of talks on January 4, which the farmers have agreed to participate in.When farmers raised the issue of repealing the farm laws, the government side asked the union leaders to come up with “alternatives” to a roll-back of the laws, an official aware of the discissions said, requesting anonymity. The farmers rejected this proposal, and insisted that their protest on the outskirts of Delhi would continue until the laws were repealed.Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar also asked the farm leaders to detail what their issues with the three laws were, the official added.On the issue of a legal backing for MSP, the government “proposed to form a committee to look into the demand, which we rejected”, said Kavitha Kuruganti, the lone woman representative of farmers who participated in the talks.Also Read | The farm laws: How not to do reformsUnion ministers Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash led the government side, while 41 leaders of farm unions represented the farmers.Progress was made when the three ministers declared that the government would keep farmers out of the Delhi-NCR anti-pollution ordinance, and make changes in the draft Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 to protect their interests.The anti-pollution ordinance invoked in October has harsh provisions to fine polluters up to ₹1 crore, including farmers. The burning of crop residue is one of the major causes of severe pollution in northern India. The government had also proposed to switch to giving direct cash to farmers instead of power subsidy, which farm unions had opposed, saying the move will increase irrigation costs. The government agreed not to go ahead with this change. “We have been able to agree on two out of four major demands. There were mutual agreements on the electricity amendment bill and on keeping farmers out of the anti-pollution ordinance,” farm minister Tomar said. The minister said the talks were held in a very “cordial atmosphere”. He said the remaining two demands — on repealing the laws and a legislation on MSP — would be discussed on January 4. “I once again appeal to farmers to at least send back the elderly, women and children taking part in the protests in this extreme cold weather,” Tomar said.Although the farmers wanted the discussions to focus first on the repeal of the farm laws, Tomar suggested that the easier issues be taken up first and then declared the government’s intention to accede to the demands on changes in power subsidy and the anti-pollution law.There appeared to be greater bonhomie between both the sides, with the three Union ministers seen sharing meals the farm leaders had brought with them during the lunch break. The farm leaders reciprocated the gesture by having tea served by the government. In five earlier rounds of talks, the farm leaders had refused to partake of meals served by the government.But the farmers, at the same time, said they would intensify their agitation until the two larger demands were met. “We consider the two demands that were accepted today to be the minor demands, while the government deferred the more solid, core demands of repealing the laws till the next talks on January 4. In its December 9 proposals, the government had already hinted it would accede to these demands,” Kuruganti said.Darshan Pal, the leader of Krantikari Kisan Union, said the acceptance of the two demands on Wednesday was a “step forward” but the agitation would continue.Farm unions have launched one of the largest strikes in decades to demand that the Centre revoke the three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces; allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales; and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Together, they will allow big corporations to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations.Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system.“The government’s acceptance of the two demands today was predictable since these were the less complicated of the four demand,” said RS Mani, a former economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.Mani said the government was right to propose a committee to examine the demand for a law on MSP for its economic consequences.Kuruganti said the farm leaders rejected the idea of a committee because “farmers have a long history of experiences with government committees which are used cleverly to water down demands”.On Wednesday, in an interview to wire service ANI, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh called farmers the “backbone of the country”. He said he didn’t approve of farmers being branded “Naxals” and “Khalistanis”.“I don’t know who is making these allegations, but farmers are farmers.”“I appeal to farmers to at least wait for two years, give a chance to the farm years as an experiment and see the results,” the defence minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-stir-breakthrough-as-govt-accepts-two-demands-of-farmers/story-SfTtFZ6G12lWsaXbBpBP1J.html

These will also be connected by an automated people mover to the Delhi Metro. Modern and secure residential facilities will be built for the Prime Minister and the Vice President, according to the minutes of the EAC’s December 17 meeting.An earlier application by CPWD to amend the terms of reference for the project to add several new components of construction was rejected by EAC on grounds that the former had been seeking clearances in a piecemeal fashion.. EAC observed in the minutes of a meeting published on November 25 that CPWD should refrain from the piecemeal approach for the proposed development and redevelopment of projects in the Central Vista.Approval for terms of reference signifies the initial clearance needed for any development project. After its application to amend was rejected, CPWD submitted a fresh proposal . In CPWD’s revised proposal, there was no mention of the Prime Minister’s Office, which found a mention in previous one. The total built-up area has been reduced from 18,37,057 sq.m to 17,21, 500 sq.m, but the cost of the redevelopment project has increased by Rs 1,656 crore, from Rs.11,794 crore to Rs. 13,450 crore.According to the minutes of the latest EAC meeting, 10 petitions against various features of the Central Vista project are pending in the Supreme Court.Read more| Central Vista revamp: MPs’ offices to come up in place of two buildingsThe minutes suggest that around 4,58,820.0 sq m of built-up area will need to be demolished as part of the project. The buildings on the site include the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA), Shastri Bhavan, Krishi Bhavan, Vigyan Bhavan, VP Residency, National Museum, Jawahar Bhavan, Nirman Bhavan, Udyog Bhavan, Raksha Bhavan and INS Hutments.“All buildings are RCC {reinforced concrete} frame structures with infill masonry walls. The structures are of G+5 to G+6 storey. Since the building is situated in a very sensitive area, adequate care and precaution will be taken to reduce noise and dust while ensuring appropriate safety. Buildings will be fully covered from all sides with appropriate staging/barricading and covering using appropriate green cloth or sheets for full building height so as to control and contain the dust/debris within the building premises,” CPWD said in its proposal.When asked to respond on the pollution impact of the redevelopment project, a ministry of urban affairs spokesperson said: “Utmost care with sprinklers and water guns and high barricading will ensure minimal pollution.” “The minutes do not reflect the enormous scale of challenges posed by this project even though these issues have been communicated to the EAC several times through numerous letters and has been discussed in the media and in courts all through 2020. The EAC has asked the project to explain the benefits of this project. Why is the EAC not interested in the problems that citizens have identified with this project? Who will be a neutral referee for this government project’s environmental assessment?” asked Manju Menon, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research think tank.Read more| ‘Shouldn’t be a fait accompli’: Supreme Court allows Central Vista ceremony, not workAccording to the tender for the next phase of the Central Vista redevelopment project— the redevelopment and restructuring of the Central Vista Avenue, which includes most of the Rajpath stretch and the row of government offices that are parallel to it-- the contractors will have to install air purifiers and keep construction noise under preset thresholds, HT reported on November 9.The successful bidders shall follow green construction practices and get a periodic green audit conducted. “The contractor will also have to install air quality monitors, requiring a number of air purifiers to maintain air quality index below acceptable levels of PM 2.5 -- within 150 [for] up to 500m from the site of work -- during the entire construction period,” the tender said.The second phase of the project will include the demolition of dozens of office buildings.

31-12-2020||India||HC pulls up Andhra govt for attacking judiciary||Criticising the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government for alleged infringement of fundamental rights of the people and blatantly attacking the judiciary, the Andhra Pradesh high court on Wednesday expressed dissent over the Supreme Collegium’s recommendation for the abrupt transfer of chief justice J K Maheshwari. A division bench headed by justice Rakesh Kumar made the comments in disposing of a petition filed by the state government asking the judge to recuse himself from a case pertaining to the sale of government lands under a scheme called Mission Build AP to raise funds for social welfare schemes. Justice Kumar, who will be retiring on Thursday, directed the Registrar General of the high court to file a criminal case against senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Praveen Kumar, special officer of Mission Build AP, for wrongly attributing some comments to the judge that he said he had never made. In an affidavit filed on December 16, the IAS officer expressed concern that Justice Kumar may be biased against the government and his continuance on the division bench could deprive it of a fair hearing. He quoted media reports as saying that the judge had made “unwarranted” comments on the alleged breakdown of constitutional machinery in the State. Describing the allegations made by the IAS officer as false and malicious, justice Kumar said the affidavit was contemptuous and it amounted to interference in the discharge of judicial functions. He called for an explanation form the officer as to why he cannot be prosecuted for contempt of court and gave him six weeks’ time to reply. Read more| Woman who fled to Andhra Pradesh has UK strainIn his 55-page judgement, justice Kumar referred to the criminal cases pending against the chief minister and recalled reports of how he allegedly misused power to force the police to withdraw cases against him. He also referred to Jagan Reddy’s letter to Chief Justice of India (CJI) S A Bobde on October 6 that made allegations against Supreme Court judge N V Ramana, state high court chief justice J K Maheshwari and a few other judges and the ensuing leak of the letter to the media three days later. He said the transfer of high court chief justice on December 14 would send a wrong message to the people.”... fact remains that he succeeded in getting undue advantage at the present moment (through the transfer of the high court CJ),” justice Kumar said. There had been friction between justice Maheshwari, who took over as Andhra Pradesh chief justice in October 2019, and Jagan Reddy. In March, the high court put a spoke in the state government’s decision to paint panchayat buildings with the colours of the ruling party . A month later, the high court set aside Reddy’s decision to introduce English as the medium of instruction in government schools.For months, the tussle between the government and judiciary in the state continued over several issues, finally reaching a flashpoint in September when the high court issued a gag order barring the media from reporting the contents of a first information report (FIR) in a land scandal in the city of Amaravati involving former advocate general Dammalapati Srinivas and daughters of a sitting Supreme Court judge, justice NV Ramana.Read more| Woman dodges Delhi officials, reaches Andhra after testing +ve on arrival from UKIn October, Reddy wrote a letter to CJI Bobde, complaining that justice Ramana was trying to influence cases in the high court to destabilize his government. Justice Kumar said that due to the transfer of the chief justice, the Jagan Reddy government was bound to get undue benefit, especially with regard to the hearings on petitions filed by poor farmers of Amaravati against the bills to create three Andhra Pradesh capitals. Amaravati had been designed the capital of Andhra Pradesh by Jagan Reddy’s predecessor N. Chandrababu Naidu. “Now, the final hearing on the batch of petitions on Amaravati has been stopped. There is every likelihood that some time may be consumed in reconstitution of the Bench and thereafter from zero hearing in those cases may commence,” he said. Justice Kumar also referred to criminal cases being dealt with by central agencies against Jagan Reddy. “After the Supreme Court bench headed by Justice N V Ramana in September ordered speedy disposal of criminal cases pending against politicians, the Andhra police on September 23 closed seven or eight criminal cases against Jagan Mohan Reddy,” he pointed out. Justice Kumar said the court was finding it difficult to protect the fundamental rights of citizens in Andhra Pradesh because of the violation of their rights. He referred to several Habeas Corpus petitions filed before the court following alleged illegal detentions. He recalled that in one such petition, he had even summoned the director general of police to the court on the enforcement of rule of the law in the state. He defended the observations he made on Wednesday. “But since on the verge of my retirement, my impartiality has been questioned by the government of Andhra Pradesh on my face, in my defence, I was constrained to record above facts which may not be disputed. My only endeavour is to uphold the majesty of law,” justice Kumar said.Government chief whip G Srikanth Reddy said it was unfortunate that the high court judge had made such observations against the state government on the verge of his retirement. “It clearly shows he has recorded the comments in the judgement out of some personal grudge against the chief minister and the government. We don’t have anything personal against him, but such comments would only reflect badly on his credibility. I am afraid people may lose their faith on the judiciary with such personal comments against the chief minister,” Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-pulls-up-andhra-govt-for-attacking-judiciary/story-HX6ThUsMlob18RGDk6BJrO.html
31-12-2020||India||Cardin’s innovation was across disciplines: Rajeev Sethi||Renowned designer Pierre Cardin, who died on Tuesday aged 98, was the first international designer to hold a fashion show in India – this was back in 1967 and it was held to a packed audience, which included the then prime minister Indira Gandhi, in the Ashoka hotel. HT spoke to Rajeev Sethi, designer and founder of Asian Heritage Foundation, who met Cardin around that time and went on to work in his atelier for three years between 1969-71. Read edited excerpts.What was your first memory of meeting Pierre Cardin?I think it’s extremely important that India knows that its journey in fashion internationally started because of Pierre Cardin. He bought a whole lot of things from the market and the Handicrafts and Handlooms Export Corporation of India Ltd in 1967. Pupul Jayakar, who was heading the HHEC at the time, invited him to the country. I went to audition as a model for a fashion show that he was doing at the Ashoka hotel, but that was just ostensibly because I carried with me all my sketches and paintings to show him. I didn’t model but he liked the drawings very much and asked me to work for him in Paris. That was a seminal show, and it was the first time we saw international fashion.Tell us a bit about the work that you did with himI got a scholarship from the French government to go to France, and since I had met Cardin earlier, I went to see him. I ended up working with him all of 1969, ’70 and ’71. I helped his atelier to set up his laboratoire d’idees or laboratory of ideas, where we were going into trans-disciplinary experiments and experiences and do (a lot in) theatre, culinary art, experiential exhibitions. It was like a circus. But this was before he bought the Theatre des Ambassadeurs on Avenue Gabriel and renamed it Espace Cardin (it opened in 1971 complete with a full-fledged theatre). He believed in the synergy of art, fashion and theatre. It had more to do with the lifestyle beyond the haute couture that Paris was known for. In 1970, he sent me back to India to collect items for an exhibition on India at Espace Cardin, called Des Indes Moderne. Eventually, the exhibition had works designed by me, including items of furniture.What is the contribution that Pierre Cardin will be most remembered for?By the time I got to Paris and joined him, he was already a global brand. What attracted me was that he was moving beyond fashion into things that touched life as a whole. He could link this kind of trans-disciplinary market with commerce. Of course, people had made perfumes but no one had made it at a scale that Cardin did. Branding idea is not new, but what you can do with branding, from the glamour industry, and take it to a more prêt-a-poter line, is his innovation. He said you could do all the things that Haute Couture does, and you could do it so bespoke that it could become even ready-to-wear. He was the first to break the dichotomy between the two, and he made high fashion think seriously about the fashion that goes out to more people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cardin-s-innovation-was-across-disciplines-rajeev-sethi/story-YssBwKYqDqk6Me8FmrOCLJ.html
31-12-2020||India||100 booked as tensions flare in Madhya Pradesh||Police invoked prohibitory orders and booked nearly 100 people in two districts of Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday to stamp down on communal tensions that flared up a day ago after two separate attempts to damage Muslim shrines. The tensions were sparked during rallies organised by some Hindu groups to raise funds for construction of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya, according to police and leaders from both sides. These rallies were passing through Muslim-dominated areas on Tuesday when the disturbances occurred, they said. In both cases, police said it arrested miscreants responsible for the incident and that no damage was done to the shrines. Madhya Pradesh police said 96 people were booked across two districts and 28 arrested.The first incident was reported from Dorana village in Mandsaur district. Police said some men climbed atop a local mosque, and put a saffron flag on the structure. The incident was also captured in a viral video shot during the rally. “There was no damage to the shrine. The police immediately swung into action and removed those who were atop the shrine,” said Mandsaur superintendent of police Siddharth Chaudhary.Police lodged four FIRs for alleged desecration of a religious place and alleged vandalism. Two separate FIRs were lodged by Hindu groups against Muslims, alleging they were abused and attacked, police said. In rural Indore, at least eight people were injured during stone pelting and clashes during a ”jan jagran rally” by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP, an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The incident occurred at Chandankhedi village and one person was injured in a separate firing incident as well, police said.Soon after this incident, police added, some people climbed a Muslim shrine in nearby Gautampura and attempted to damage a part of the structure. They were removed by the police and an FIR was lodged against unknown people under section 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). “There was no damage to the shrine as police acted swiftly. During violence a motorbike was set afire and a man sustained injuries in a firing incident,” said Indore superintendent of police Mahesh Chand Jain. The Hindu side lodged counter FIRs against local Muslims. In all, four FIRs were registered in the case, Jain said. A video of this incident went viral on social media.The incidents in Indore and Mandsaur on Tuesday came days after stone pelting during a similar rally in Ujjain’s Begumbagh on December 25. Over 10 people were injured in the incident. Eight people, including two women, from Ujjain were booked for the violence and six of them, all men, under the National Security Act.Begumbagh is a locality near Ujjain’s famous Mahakal temple where several Muslim organisations staged a sit-in against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in January and February. Jain and Chaudhary said prohibitory orders were issued in both districts to prevent further tensions and additional police forces deployed. On Wednesday, Muslim groups in Mandsaur submitted a memorandum to the district administration and police, alleging community members and the Dorana shrine were targeted in a pre-planned manner and the guilty should be booked under National Security Act (NSA). Shakeel Ali, a member of Waqf Board in Mandsaur said, “There are deliberate attempts in the region to target us and vitiate the atmosphere by people from certain right wing groups. Police already knew that rally was being taken out to target members of a particular religion and create communal tension but police remained mute spectators.” The Hindu groups rejected the charges. “The fact is our jan jagran rallies are completely peaceful but there was provocation from the other side through stone pelting incidents. The rallies were planned as a prelude to our fund-raising campaign to begin from January 14. There was no violence from any of the participants of the rallies,” said Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) state vice-president Anil Goel.(With inputs from Anand Nigam in Ujjain and Rohit Soni in Mandsaur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-booked-as-tensions-flare-in-mp/story-NAfiGTWz6MHc3fIKsskT9I.html
31-12-2020||India||Airport operators told to draft SOPs for Covid-19 vaccine transport||The Centre has instructed airport operators, including state-run Airports Authority of India (AAI), ground handling service providers and airlines to put in place standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the transportation of Covid-19 vaccines that will be approved by the government, civil aviation ministry officials said.The SOPs will be drafted in coordination with the ministry of health and the department of pharmaceuticals, which will be spearheading the formation of a multi-mode cold chain that will ensure the refrigerated production, transport, storage and distribution of the vaccines .“All the main stakeholders -- the airports, the ground handlers and the airlines -- have been alerted and they have been asked to draw up their plans,” aviation secretary Pardeep Kharola said. He added: “The exact SOPs will be formulated with the ministry of health and department of pharmaceuticals when we know the exact quality of the vaccines in terms of what are the precautions that need to be taken, how it has to be transported and what all measures are required. All this has to be factored in. That will be done nearer to the date of transportation and the detailed SOPs will be laid down.”The aviation ministry has held a round of meetings with airline executives on transport logistics. The central government has started preparations for setting up a cold storage chain for the Covid-19 vaccine that will eventually be approved for use in India, HT reported on December 7.Civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri told reporters on Tuesday that a vaccine may be available in India by January and the Centre aims to inoculate at least 300 million people until July 2021 for which at least 600 million doses will be required.Kharola said temperature regulation will be the most important factor across the entire vaccine supply chain that is being established.“From the place of manufacture to the place of consumption is a long chain and there will be different modes; there will be road travel, air travel, there will be storage, there will be distribution and then there will be administration of the vaccine. This entire process is being prepared on a war footing,” Kharola said on Tuesday.“In the administration of the vaccine, transportation is going to be a very important component. This vaccine has to be moved from the place of manufacturing to all corners of the country. The movement of the vaccine will be multi-modal, it cannot be merely civil aviation. It will be a combination of different modes. For our part, we are coordinating with the ministry of health and {department of} pharmaceuticals. We have also had meetings with airports and airlines regarding the transportation plan for the vaccine,” he added.Several airlines too have begun preparations for transportation; and started partnering with pharmaceutical transportation companies offering cold storage. On Monday, low-cost airline SpiceJet announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Pluss Advanced Technologies (PLUSS) for the supply of indigenously developed, precise temperature controlled boxes.“While transporting pharmaceutical products, biological products or vaccines in particular, the need to maintain precise temperature ranges is very important and the efficacy of vaccine can be impacted if the temperature goes above or below the specified range. PLUSS, an India based material solutions company, has designed and manufactured a precise temperature-control delivery solution that is required for vaccine delivery to the last mile,“ PLUSS said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airport-operators-told-to-draft-sops-for-vaccine-transport/story-tcRgCt1XFMI9vKQqVKs1YO.html

The Indians are part of the crew of the two ships carrying Australian coal that haven’t been allowed to offload their cargo. The situation is believed to be the outcome of the China-Australia trade row, and reports have suggested more than 1,400 seafarers and about two million tons of Australian coal are stuck on vessels outside Chinese ports. There are 23 Indian crew members on the bulk cargo vessel MV Jag Anand, in anchorage near Jingtang port in Hebei province since June 13. Another 16 Indian crew members are on MV Anastasia, in anchorage near Caofeidian port since September 20. “Chinese authorities have been in close communication with Indian side [and] provided timely assistance [and] necessary supplies to Indian sailors,” Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said on Twitter on Wednesday evening. “China has never denied any vessel departure. Real cause of situation is freight forwarder doesn’t want to adjust plans due to commercial interests,” she said. Shipping minister Mansukh Mandaviya told reporters that the government is in talks with the Chinese side to bring back the Indian sailors. “Diplomatic talks are going on for this successfully. Our seafarers will come to India very soon,” he said, without giving details. The external affairs ministry said last week that other foreign vessels had been allowed to enter Chinese ports and discharge their cargo in the months during which two ships with Indian crew members were prevented from doing so on the grounds of Covid-19-related restrictions. “We understand that some other ships, which arrived after the Indian ships arrived, have actually managed to discharge cargo and leave. The reasons for this are not clear,” ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told reporters at a news briefing. Both Jag Anand and Anastasia are carrying Australian coal. Chinese Customs haven’t cleared Jag Anand’s cargo and local authorities haven’t allowing the crew to leave the vessel, citing Covid-19-related restrictions. Jag Anand’s charterer has refused to allow it to sail to another port to relieve the crew. Anastasia’s second officer, Gaurav Singh, told the media that mental health issues, lack of medical support and a decline in drinking water quality had compounded the problems of the crew. Srivastava said the “unprecedented situation” had resulted in stress among the crew. The Indian side has requested Chinese authorities to allow the ships to discharge their cargo and change their crew members. The Chinese side has said crew change is not permitted at Jintang and Caofeidian ports because of Covid-19-related restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-blames-companies-handling-cargo-for-stranded-indian-ships/story-uVzzzqrgNw9nLFLsQy0hvO.html

Check full list||In the view of the Covid-19 pandemic, New Year celebrations on December 31 will be a muted affair across the world and as well as in India this time. The outbreak of the new Covid-19 UK variant has also spread fear forcing several states governments to ban new year celebrations. However, not all tourist spots can afford to shut their doors to revellers.The Union Health Ministry has asked all states to keep a strict vigil on New Year celebrations that could be potential Covid-19 super-spreader events and also to curb crowding as a precautionary measure during the winter season. In a letter to states and Union Territories, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan stated that the number of active cases has been declining steadily in the country for the last three-and-half months.“You will appreciate that in the wake of New Year and various celebratory events associated with it as well as ongoing winter season, strict vigil is required to be maintained to curb all potential ‘super spreader’ events and places where crowds may gather,” Bhushan said in the letter.Here is all you need to know:States where New Year celebration is bannedKarnatakaUttarakhandRajasthanTamil NaduOdishaPunjabWhere celebrations are allowed under restrictionsShimla> Rs 1,000 fine for not wearing masks> Curfew from 10pm to 6am in Shimla, Kullu, Kangra and Mandi. > A strict vigil will also be kept on the tourists through CCTV cameras and drones.

31-12-2020||India||Nitish Kumar trashes RJD’s claims of defections from JD (U), says party is united||In a big relief to the NDA camp in Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar said Wednesday that JD (U) was united and there was no truth in claims about party leaders defecting to any other party. His reaction came after the opposition RJD in the backdrop of growing uneasiness between the BJP and JD (U) over developments in Arunachal Pradesh claimed that 17 JD (U) MLAs were willing to change sides.RJD leader Shyam Rajak claimed that 17 legislators from Nitish Kumar’s party were in touch with them and all set to join the opposition party. “Seventeen JD (U) legislators are in touch with RJD through me. They are desperate to join RJD at the earliest but we have stopped them as they will lose their membership due to anti-defection law,” said Rajak. The RJD leader claimed that JD (U) legislators were unhappy about the way BJP was asserting itself on Nitish Kumar in the new government. Rajak, a former JD (U) minister, who returned to the RJD before the assembly election, said that talks with others are also on. “To evade anti-defection law, at least 25 to 26 legislators should defect at a time,” he said and added that this will happen soon. Nitish Kumar, who stepped down from the JD (U) national president’s post last Sunday called it a “baseless talk” “All is well in JD (U). There is no weight in RJD claims. All these are baseless,” the chief minister said.JD (U) state president Bashistha Narain Singh advised RJD to stop talking absurdly. “First set your own house in order. Everything is fine in NDA,” he said while the party’s spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said JD (U) legislators were united and RJD should keep its flock together. “There is no resentment in JD (U). Our party is upset over what happened in Arunachal but this does not mean that our legislators will get misguided. RJD in turn should keep its house together as many of the legislators are unhappy with Tejashwi Yadav’s style of functioning,” said Ranjan. Nitish Kumar’s strong denial to RJD’s claim has come as a big relief to NDA partners particularly the BJP, which found itself on the backfoot after the JD (U) took aggressive posture following Arunachal Pradesh developments where six JD (U) MLAs defected to the BJP. “Nobody can break our (NDA) house. Nitish ji is our guardian and our mukhiya is strong,” said deputy CM Renu Devi of the BJP. On Tuesday, some RJD leaders had tried to lure Kumar by projecting him as PM candidate if he made way for Tejashwi Yadav as Bihar chief minister. “Nitish Kumar should give up the chief minister’s chair and pull out of the NDA. He should help Tejashwi Yadav form the new government and the RJD would return the favour by backing him as prime ministerial candidate in 2024,” Uday Narain Chaudhary, a former state assembly speaker and RJD leader had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-trashes-rjd-s-claims-of-defections-from-jd-u-says-party-is-united/story-0uWztgDx0E5wZgQna8JMkM.html

According to the will, his legal heirs include his wife Champa Bai, 47, and Jackie, 11-month-old, his pet dog. “My wife Champa Bai lives with me and takes care of me. Jackie is my pet dog and it also takes care of me. I immensely love both of them. I am in good health at the moment. I fear that my pet dog may become an orphan after my death. I wish to give Jackie a share in my property so that he doesn’t become an orphan and he is well taken care of. I strongly believe that the two will take care of me till my last breath and after my death they will perform my last rites,” Verma stated in his will.The farmer went on to emphasize in his will that the two will be his legal heirs and after his death they would be owners of his properties. “Whoever will take care of Jackie after my death will use his share in my properties to look after him and will become owner of Jackie’s share of the property after his death”, states the will. The properties mentioned in the will include agriculture land of about 21 acre. Verma said he made will after a domestic dispute and hinted that for practical purposes, the will is all but cancelled. “I have loved dogs since my childhood. I got the puppy from my son-in-law after my previous dog died. I got the will notarised after a domestic dispute when I thought that Jackie might be abandoned after my death. My son was upset with me. The village sarpanch came to me and asked me to cancel the will. Though the will is not cancelled yet, the issue stands resolved within the family,” Verma said.Sarpanch of the village Jamuna Prasad Verma said, “I went to Verma’s house along with some other members of the panchayat and tried to reason with him that such a will had no value but it would definitely cause a rift in his family. I think he wrote the will and got it notarised out of anger. He has assured me that he would cancel the will.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-in-madhya-pradesh-declares-dog-legal-heir-in-will-along-with-wife/story-kG8cESOcrycEoOdUBAPfmO.html
31-12-2020||India||Farmers protest updates: With some progress, govt and farmers decide to meet again on January 4||Government and farmers’ unions met at 2 pm on Thursday, as protests against the three farm laws enter day 35. On Monday, the government had proposed to hold the sixth round of talks on Wednesday, with the farmers’ unions accepting the proposal a day later. Initially, responding to the Centre’s offer to hold the sixth round of talks at a date and time as convenient to the farmers, the unions had on Saturday proposed to hold the dialogue at 11 am on December 29. The unions had earlier rejected the government’s first proposal in this regard.After the meet, the stakeholders have decided to come together for a seventh round of talks on January to end the stalemate. Previous five rounds of talks, including one each on December 1, 3 and 5 have failed to resolve the impasse. While the Centre has refused to repeal the laws and has instead suggested amendments, the farmers are adamant on a complete rollback.On Tuesday, day 34 of the protests, police in Patna had to lathi-charge a group of protesters who were trying to march to the Bihar governor’s residence to express their support for the farmers protesting at various borders of Delhi. Also on the day, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), whose government is in power in Delhi, announced that it would provide free wifi to the protesting farmers. The AAP has, on a number of occasions, expressed its support for the farmers, with party convenor and Delhi chief minister visiting the Singhu border, the epicentre of the protests, twice. Last month, Kejriwal had rejected the Delhi Police’s request to turn the city’s stadiums into temporary jails, as the police tried to stop the protesters from entering the national capital. Then, on December 17, Kejriwal and AAP MLAs had torn copies of the three laws at a special one-day session of the Delhi Assembly.Here are the updates from day 34 of the anti-farm law protests:With some progress, govt and farmers decide to meet again on January 4The government and farmers union on Wednesday reached some consensus as ministers said that meet concluded positively. “Today’s talks were held in a very good environment and it concluded on a positive note.

31-12-2020||India||Mandatory FASTags, Quarterly GST filing and WhatsApp services: Rules that are changing from Jan 1||From January 1, 2021, many rules related to the implementation of Positive Pay system, cheque frauds, FASTags for all four-wheelers across India and new mode of Goods and Services Tax (GST) return filing facility for small businesses are set to change.Here’s a look at the new rules before their rollout:1. FASTag mandatory for all four-wheelers: The Union ministry of road, transport and highways has issued a notification making FASTag mandatory for all four-wheel vehicles that were sold before December 1, 2017, after amending the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989.2. ‘Positive Pay’ system for cheques: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to introduce the ‘Positive Pay’ system for cheques from January 1, 2021. Re-confirmation of key details may be needed for cheque payments beyond Rs 50,000 under the system. The issuer of the cheque will have to provide information such as the cheque number, its date, payee name, account number, amount among other details.3. Contactless card transaction limit increased: RBI has also enhanced limits for contactless card payments from ₹2,000 to ₹5,000. However, this will be at the discretion of the user.4. Quarterly Goods and Services Tax (GST) return filing facility: About 9.4 million small businesses are set to come under a simpler, quarterly Goods and Services Tax (GST) return filing facility. These firms with sales up to ₹5 crore will need to file only four returns showing the summary of all transactions in the quarter in the new regime instead of 12 that are now filed once every month.5. Dial zero before making landline to mobile calls: The department of telecommunications (DoT) has made it mandatory to prefix zero for all calls made from fixed lines to mobiles, effective January 15.6. WhatsApp to stop working on select phones: WhatsApp is going to withdraw support from some platforms from January 1.

31-12-2020||Editorials||Lessons India can learn from the vaccine rollout in other countries||In the fortnight between December 14, when the first American received a coronavirus vaccine, and December 29, the United States vaccinated 2.13 million people. The country has done more vaccinations than any other across the world, and its tally represented close to 50% of the inoculations carried out globally till Tuesday. In itself, reaching 2.13 million people over 14 days is not a small order – but it is one that falls short of expectations. American authorities expected to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of 2020. Instead, rollout has been hobbled by time lost in quality checks, managing vaccination reporting tools and planning distribution flows.The first month of vaccine rollout has not been smooth elsewhere too. In Germany, delays were reported at several sites after temperature logs showed some of the vaccine boxes did not maintain the temperatures required for the Pfizer-BioNTech dose – potentially damaging stocks. In Canada, which approved two vaccines, supplies came in a slow trickle. In the United Kingdom, where Pfizer estimated four million doses were made available, only 800,000 have been administered. Teething troubles are not uncommon in any exercise with such a number of moving parts — the factory-to-syringe process includes a range of people and modes of transportation — but they can be costly at a time when we are racing against the pandemic. These experiences hold important lessons for India. The country did well to begin mock drills, giving its digital management platform as well as human resource training an early shakedown. The exercise covered seven districts in four states and exposed crucial areas that need improvement well in time. But, in a country over 1.3 billion people, such dry runs must quickly be replicated in more districts. Officials must look at the experiences in other countries and keep open the scope to tweak or overhaul protocols, including how India selects and prioritises the groups of people who are first in line for a dose. Just like its early legwork on the delivery side, the government must now intensify efforts to ensure supplies by announcing its first purchase deals. Regulatory processes are expected to reach crucial breakthroughs shortly (a key meeting was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon), which should give the government the confidence to commit to purchases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/lessons-india-can-learn-from-the-vaccine-rollout-in-other-countries/story-Lf7QYKls4zyrNuFbwHTK1L.html
