18-12-2020||News||1971: A military victory and the birth of a nation||There was deep resentment against the Pakistani establishment among the Bangla-speaking people in East Pakistan, who had been treated as second-class citizens in their own country. The Pakistani army decided to crush the voices of self-determination through a crackdown called Operation Searchlight which resulted in large-scale rape, murder and looting. The flood of refugees into India meant another confrontation with Pakistan.The sense of urgency was heightened when a post at Dalu Haat (on the border of India and East Pakistan in Meghalaya), used by refugees to cross over, was attacked by Pakistani troops. The Border Security Force (BSF), despite significant casualties, fended off the attack. After this, my unit was ordered to immediately move into Meghalaya to look after the border from Baghmara to Mahendraganj. As an intelligence officer (IO), I routinely went with the Mukti Bahini to register targets. The Mukti Bahini initially comprised only students and non-military personnel, had a limited leadership and was fearful of the Pakistani army. But having trained with the Indian Army, it was successful in several missions.In October, we moved to Tripura and were tasked to clear the Belonia bulge. We were to support the Mukti Bahini operating in East Pakistan as part of this. Amid regular attacks by Pakistani artillery and Sabre aircraft, we, along with the Mukti Bahini, gained control of the Belonia bulge by mid-November. We then pulled back into what is now Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary. At the end of November, the unit was tasked to plan a roadblock behind the forward defensive line in an area 10-11 km in depth.It was believed that a Pakistani artillery regiment of 105 mm guns was positioned near Parikot. I was to go behind enemy lines with a Mukti Bahini guide to get information on the location of the guns, and also scout for locations where the battalion could take up blocking positions to cut off the Chauddagram axis. When we reached the enemy positions in Parikot, I could locate the sentries who had to be tackled. However, this would entail the risk of being pursued by the enemy once the bodies were discovered. Fortunately, as I was about to silence the sentries, the guns fired, and this assisted in mapping their locations. My team had around ten jawans and we had to make a 30-km dash back from enemy territory before first light.On December 3, war was officially declared with Pakistan. We received orders to make a daylight attack on December 4 to capture Chauddagram, where the Pakistani positions overlooked the road that went to Parikot and onwards north to Chandpur. I was tasked to lead the assault, which seemed a rash idea as the enemy could see us coming. We were met with heavy enemy fire and suffered casualties. We had no choice but to wait out the counter-attack. On the morning of December 5, we launched an attack on the Pakistani post which we captured.We were told to proceed to Mudaffarganj that was en route to Chandpur. We encountered many Pakistani units as they tried to retreat to Chandpur. We captured a large number of Pakistani officers and soldiers, a risky operation as they often outnumbered us. We had to convince them that they were surrounded by a much larger force. These prisoners of war were handed over to the divisional resources tasked to handle them. Mudaffarganj presented another problem as the Pakistanis had surrounded that area and inflicted casualties on 1/11 GR. Our unit surrounded the Pakistanis and our firing broke their morale leading them to run away towards Chandpur. In the morning, the corps commander arrived in a helicopter and told our unit to rush to Chandpur as the Pakistanis were abandoning it. This called for innovation as we had no transport. We rounded up everything that could move — fire engines, garbage trucks, cars and cycles to assist in our dash. Using this unorthodox method, we captured a large number of Pakistani troops.From Chandpur, we were ordered to join our brigade and move to Chittagong. I was to move before the unit to carry out a reconnaissance mission. I decided to take a shortcut and landed in Comilla town which had not yet been liberated. On spotting my jeep, the locals started celebrating the liberation of the town. Later, I learnt of the risk taken as Comilla was still under Pakistani control. The move to Chittagong had to be through the hill tract. I led the recce through hills to find a route for the unit and brigade which followed the path by cutting bushes to clear a lane. On December 16, we received news of the surrender at Dhaka, came out of the jungles and moved into Chittagong where a surrender ceremony took place.A short swift war, a manoeuvre on foot in which the Pakistani army was outclassed tactically and strategically giving birth to a new nation — this victory has no parallel in military history anywhere in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/1971-a-military-victory-and-the-birth-of-a-nation/story-j08OainfDwS3aMJjt5zFNL.html
18-12-2020||News||In Punjab, the centrality of the mandi system||The stand-off between the government and the farmers on the new farm laws shows no signs of easing. For a long time, the government insisted that the protest was led by middlemen and large farmers only in Punjab, and to some extent Haryana, who were concerned about losing their privileges. However, the expansion of the movement and organised support for it in other regions have defied these claims and left almost everyone surprised. Nevertheless, the mobilisation across all sections of Punjab’s society, even the diaspora, unseen in any other region, in support of these protests warrants an explanation.The mandi has been a major rallying cry for the protests in Punjab. Its importance to agricultural life, as it has developed over the past half a century in the state, cannot be overstated. Under the mandi system farmers bring paddy and wheat to the shop of the commission agent (arhtia) in regulated Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), or mandi, yards for sale. Any amount of these crops within certain quality standards is purchased by the government, through the Food Corporation of India and other state-level procurement agencies, at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) (also known as “open procurement”).This assured purchase at MSP has been the main source of income support for Punjab’s farmers. Of course, larger farmers have benefitted disproportionately more than smaller ones. The former can avail of economies of scale in production and bring larger crop volumes to the mandi. Smaller farmers face higher input costs (for example, costs of renting in machinery) and bring lower volumes of crop (sometimes even lower quality if they are unable to purchase and apply inputs in a timely way). But to say that the mandi system does not benefit the smaller farmers is a bit of a stretch. Even for them, the system provides an important safety net, an assurance that, at the least, they can expect a certain amount of household income through the agricultural year. Expenses and debts can be managed against that.Certainly, as the government constantly reminds us, commission agents have also been key beneficiaries of this system. Commission agents in the grain mandis of Punjab get a commission of 2.5% of total sales from the buyer among the highest in the country. In fact, it is on the basis of this assured transaction that they also extend informal credit to the farmers at very high interest rates. Given that the new farm laws are likely to undermine the mandi system (indirectly, even if not stated explicitly) which is crucial to their business, it is no surprise that they too are supporting the farmer protest.But what is really notable is that protesting farmers too are consistently justifying the role of the agents. Why? To some extent, it is because a small section of large farmers has also become commission agents. But in addition, moneylending by them constitutes crucial financial support for farmers when credit from commercial banks and cooperatives proves inadequate, which is often the case. This is particularly true for smaller farmers, who often have to deal with the harshest interest rates but also have no other source of credit support. There is no reason to believe that the reformed markets in the wake of the new laws will not have middlemen, and farmers worry about whether these new middlemen will extend similar support to them.There are other, less obvious, ways in which the rhythms of Punjab’s local agrarian economy are dependent on the mandi system. It is when the farmers sell their crop that they have the income (or the next round of credit) to pay rent for leased land and pending wages to farm labourers. It is also then that they buy inputs for the next crop and make other kinds of household purchases, ranging from groceries to medicines for the elderly and stationery for the children. Landless rural populations, some of whom still work as farm labourers, also know that the subsidised rations they receive depend on the government’s purchase of surplus wheat and paddy. There is much to be said about the work of some of the state’s more progressive farmer and farm labour unions in creating this awareness and building alliances with other sections of society to broad-base the support for the protest. But even otherwise, it is commonly understood that the mandi system is the lifeblood of Punjab’s agricultural, even small-town economies.All this is hardly to say that the mandi system is devoid of problems and does not need serious reform. I have already mentioned the predicament of small farmers and the contentious role of commission agents. Years of paddy and wheat monocropping — enabled through this system — have severely affected soil fertility, groundwater availability and yields. But equally, efforts towards crop diversification have been half-hearted and ineffective. Meanwhile, non-agricultural employment opportunities are dismal and the state government’s finances are in shambles. So, while the state clutches at straws, the new laws offer nothing to calm the anxieties of its people about life after the mandi system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-punjab-the-centrality-of-the-mandi-system/story-V1QIJJuShlfDIRiaE7ukQJ.html

As the day progressed, the weather cleared up to make way for the sun. Still, the maximum temperature at 17.2°C was four notches below normal.According to PAU’s meteorological department, this cold wave is expected to continue over the weekend, following which the day temperature was likely to increase.The India Meteorological Department declares a “cold day” when the minimum temperature falls below 10°C and maximum temperature is 4.5-6.4°C below normal. Poor visibility due to fog posed problems for commuters, especially those on Delhi- Jalandhar National Highway- 44.A car driver had a narrow escape after his vehicle rammed into a barricade placed to divert traffic in Khanna. The driver, Sanjiv Kumar, said reflective tapes or indicators were vital at such locations to avoid mishaps amid haze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/minimum-temperature-in-ludhiana-drops-to-3-2-c/story-YT1i7gxK14burV4IdV5tyN.html
18-12-2020||Chandigarh||Need to find ways to end Ladakh standoff: Ram Madhav||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ram Madhav on Friday said the continued standoff at the border will bleed India more than China and that there was a need to find a way to solve and end it.“My only point is our standing off with China at the border will bleed us more. China can probably afford standing at the border for 8 to 10 months, but every day we are bleeding economically. So, ideally we have to find a way to solve this standoff and end it,” Madhav said during a virtual panel discussion at the Military Literature Festival. He added that the one good thing that was happening today was that we were insisting on talking about the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which can help define it.He was responding to the comments of Lieutenant General Harcharanjit Singh Panag (retd), a former commanding officer of army’s Northern Command.“Even if we have to sit at LAC for next one year, it is a small price to pay for stalemating China.Otherwise China will achieve its aim, we will have to bear the cost. I assure you that China will be equally keen after some time to agree to the status quo,” he said. In his opening remarks, Madhav said China was a big challenge and spoke about the need to look beyond the immediate China threat to achieve long-term goals. “Whatever happens in the coming months in that sector (Ladakh) is not going to conclusively solve problem between the two countries. What is of utmost importance to us at one level is to respond to immediate challenges that we face today. But, at the same we should not lose sight of India’s long-term strategic objectives and in that stream of things, how to handle countries like China,” he said. Stating that militarily and at the government-level, the immediate challenge had been dealt with in an appropriate manner, Madhav said India had been able to limit the issue and had not drifted to join any camps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/need-to-find-ways-to-end-ladakh-standoff-ram-madhav/story-29disxYi6LVs2QGFzzcMvI.html
18-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Authority begins removing unauthorised posters from city walls||In order to keep public spaces free from unauthorised billboards and clean city walls, the Noida authority on Friday began a drive to remove the same. Apart from this, the authority has also decided to act tough against those found putting up billboards illegally.“We have directed all circle officials to start a special drive to issue notices to those who indulge in putting up posters illegally at public spaces. If they do not remove the posters despite facing notices then we will impose heavy penalties to discourage them from defacing the walls,” said Rajeev Tyagi, general manager of the Noida authority.For administrative purposes, the city has been divided into ten work circles. Each circle is headed by a circle officer.“We have directed each circle officer to identify those who have defaced city walls and issue them notices. We will take legal action and also remove these posters at locations where we cannot identify the people behind these posters,” said Tyagi. The authority on Friday removed posters from one of the main roads – Master Plan-I road. “We cannot reach out to those who put posters up at public places. Therefore we have decided to deploy our staff to remove these posters and banners,” said Tyagi. The authority has started this drive as it wants to make the city neat and clean by the beginning of January, when the ministry of housing and urban affairs will send inspection teams for the Swachhta Survey 2021.Noida was ranked 25th in the country in the Swachhta survey in 2020, in 10 the lakh population category, and was ranked first in Uttar Pradesh. The authority hopes that the city will be able to score better in the cleanliness index this year. And to achieve that goal, it wants to leave no stone unturned. “Our target is that the city becomes clean on all fronts and we are taking effective measures for that,” said Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-begins-removing-unauthorised-posters-from-city-walls/story-iEZnMH7tvZiOlWIa8x1JIL.html
18-12-2020||Noida||Contact tracing dips in December, Ghaziabad has overall 345 Covid-19 cases with zero contacts||The contact-tracing exercise which is done on daily basis to find out contacts of Covid-19 patients has dipped in the ongoing month of December and stands at an average of about 19.2 contacts per positive patient. The officials said that as per state government’s directions given in October, they have to trace at least 25 contacts per patient. The official figures of the district health department states that the district was tracing an average of about 22.2 contacts per positive case in October and it went further to an average of about 29 contacts per positive patient in the month of November. However, the figure has dipped to 19.2 in 15 days of December. Further, the list also includes 345 positive cases whose contacts are yet to be traced. These include 239 positive cases in the month of December while the rest are in different months from May to November. “The contact tracing has dipped a bit in the month of December and it could be due to fact that some of our supervising staff members have turned positive while some staff involved in contact tracing has also taken medical leaves. Regarding the 345 odd positive patients having no contacts, majority are in the month of December. The rest are yet to be traced,” said an officer from the district health department who wished not to be named. The positive cases having zero contacts are one each in months of May and June, 23 in July, 28 in August, 22 in September, 15 in October and 16 in November besides 243 in 15 days of December. “We are working to complete the pending contact tracing and it is likely that we will be able to make up in another couple of days,” the officer added. From March to December 15, the district as per the official records of the health department has a tally of 25330 positive cases and their contact tracing has yielded 417298 contacts with an overall average of about 16.5 contacts per positive patient. Contact tracing is a vital task during the Covid-related activities and helps in finding out any suspected cases who have been in touch with a positive patient. The teams deployed in contact tracing finds such contacts and get them tested in order to check the spread of infection. The positive contacts are further isolated and taken to healthcare facility for treatment. “We will check up the issue with contact tracing and if it has dipped a bit we will review and get the issue resolved within couple of days,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Experts said that daily contact tracing is must under present circumstances as despite lot of awareness measures people still move about and can pass on infection to others. “We have instances where people after turning positive visited us despite our telling their attendants to ensure that they don’t move out of house. So, there is still laxity on part of people who move about and may infect others. So, even nowadays it is very easy to trace 25 contacts per positive case,” said Dr Ashish Agrawal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “If the health department has shortage of staff or resources, they must deploy additional. Daily contact tracing is as important as surveillance or testing and should be beefed up,” he, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/contact-tracing-dips-in-december-ghaziabad-has-overall-345-covid-19-cases-with-zero-contacts/story-WClcQHgEsUEkno5980l11M.html

The two officers had visited a private bank in Sector 18 to enquire about a transaction related to a bank account when the incident took place, at 1:15 pm.Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Zone 1, said that sub-inspectors Rashid Khan and Pankaj Sahu had come to Noida from Jabalpur. “The two officers told Noida police that they were in plainclothes at the time of incident. They visited a private bank in Noida’s Sector 18 on Friday to enquire about the bank details of a suspect who has been accused in a cyber crime case. They left the bank and on the way, they had a heated argument with four persons, who had come there in a car,” the DCP said.Noida police said that sub-inspector Khan told them that he took out his licensed revolver in self-defence but the suspects allegedly snatched the gun and fled the spot.The DCP said that the matter, prime facie, appears to be suspicious.“The officers have not revealed what cyber crime case they were investigating. The second sub-inspector, Sahu, also had his licensed gun on him but he did not use it when the incident took place. The police also received information from other sources, besides the sub-inspectors. It appears the two officers had a dispute with some people who fled with the gun,” the DCP said.The Noida police said they are investigating the matter from all angles and scanning CCTV cameras from near the spot. Police said a case of robbery under Section 392 of Indian Penal Code will be lodged at the Sector 20 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/revolver-of-madhya-pradesh-sub-inspector-snatched-in-noida-s-sector-18/story-GuBNyaR1lr5E8lZnri1beN.html
18-12-2020||Noida||Noida: More than 5,000 Covid-infected patients cured in home isolation so far||About 93% of the 5,402 Covid-19 patients in Gautam Buddh Nagar who were permitted to be treated at home had recovered till Friday. Of the active 699 patients, over half are under home isolation.Till Friday, the district had recorded 24,484 total cases and a recovery rate of 96.47%. Since July 25, the Uttar Pradesh government had allowed asymptomatic patients to recover at home instead of being shifted to a Covid care center. Doctors say being at home helped patients recover faster and more people would test for the virus.District additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Lalit Kumar said: “To be on the safer side, a patient is shifted to a Covid-dedicated hospital in case the pulse rate is very low or spikes a high fever. We also look out for oxygen saturation rate, which should not go below 95%, or symtoms such as cough, respiratory problems or other complications. So far, we had referred 220 home isolated patients to different Covid-19 hospitals, but all of them recovered too. None of the home isolated patients in the district has succumbed to the virus till date.”On the other hand, GB Nagar district CMO Dr Deepak Ohri, said that the rapid antigen kit testing in the recent past indicates that the rate of Covid-19 spread in the district has slowed down significantly.“From the 21,664 rapid antigen tests conducted from December 10 to December 18, only 63 samples tested positive. Even in the over 20,000 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR, considered the most accurate) samples collected during this span of time, only 294 samples returned positive,” he said.District magistrate Suhas LY said that keeping the number of active cases low was priority and they had done it through continuous ‘track, test and treat’ method.“Our health workers are doing a commendable job in testing and surveillance. Our case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.35%, too, is much better than the state’s CFR of 1.41%. The health workers have been asked to intensify surveillance and testing in those areas which have been identified as critical hotspots,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-more-than-5-000-covid-infected-patients-cured-in-home-isolation-so-far/story-ExN41KQyJJDq45NTnsjdSM.html
18-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Agency selected to build flyover at Parthala Chowk||The Noida authority has awarded the tender for the Parthala Chowk flyover to Manglam Buildcon Limited, a private agency. The flyover, which will be 697 metre-long, is scheduled to be completed by the end of December next year. “The authority has selected Manglam out of the three who applied for the flyover project, which will provide seamless connectivity to thousands of commuters. The chief executive officer has directed the agency to start work immediately on this project as it has a deadline of December-end, 2021,” said Rajeev Tyagi, the general manager of the Noida authority.The authority will spend Rs80.53 crore on this project. Parthala Chowk, one of the main intersections in the city, witnesses daily traffic congestion, particularly during peak hours in the mornings and evenings.According to a survey conducted by the authority’s traffic cell, about 18000 motorists during peak hours. The survey found that about 1.25 lakh commuters use the intersection daily, where the Master Plan-III road meets the Faridabad-Noida-Ghaziabad (FNG) Expressway.The authority had, in the June beginning this year, issued a tender to select an agency for this project.The flyover will be a six lane stretch, to be built on the Master Plan-III road, which connects Noida with Greater Noida West.“Commuters travelling from Delhi, Noida to Greater Noida West, Ghaziabad and Hapur side will enjoy a smooth ride once this flyover becomes operational by the end of 2021. It will benefit residents of sectors 51, 52, 61, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79 and 119, among others,” said Tyagi.Officials said that with this flyver, vehicular movement to Greater Noida’s Kisan Chowk located in Sector 1 will become seamless. Commuters, who use the FNG Expressway, will also not have to face any traffic signal at Parthala, added officials.The authority has been planning to remove the need for traffic signals on city roads for the past three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-agency-selected-to-build-flyover-at-parthala-chowk/story-4B25Q1U10svYVLfyVoCadK.html

Since the start of protests last month, there had been at least six rounds of talks between the central government and the farmers’ leaders over the new agriculture reforms that has caused much apprehension, but failed.The Kisan Sammelan on Friday, attended by Union minister for textiles and Amethi MP Smriti Irani, was projected as the party’s attempt to assuage fears by speaking directly to the farmers on the ground.“Let them conduct more such events across the country but we will not be change our stance. We demand the complete roll back of these laws,” said Rakesh Tikait, a leader and spokesperson for the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Tikait faction. “In fact, we will urge our supporters to go in large numbers to these events and raise questions. It would be interesting to see if the Union minister replies. Our khaps (communities) have already decided that they will counter these events by holding ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyaan’ in western UP.”“Even the Union minister for agriculture has written to farmers on the so-called advantages of the new laws. But finally they will come back to us leaders of the protest. And, I would like to ask the government where is Covid-19 now? Is it finished? They were lecturing us about the possible spread of the virus at the protest sites. Is there no risk of Covid at these events?,” Tikait said.Thousands of farmers from western Uttar Pradesh led by the BKU (Tikait) and other farmers from Punjab and Uttarakhand have been protesting at the UP Gate since November 28 and have also blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the National Highway-9. During a ‘Sarv Khap Sammelan’ at the UP-Gate on Thursday, representatives of 10 different Khaps spoke about a “middle path” to resolve the ongoing stalemate and had said that they were willing to move two steps backwards and the government should also follow the same step in order to resume talks and resolve the issue. The Khap representatives had reiterated the farmers’ demand for rollback of three new farm laws. At the event, Irani hit out at the opposition political parties and said that “those who exploited farmers for 70 years” were falsely presenting themselves as their well-wishers to gain political mileage.  She addressed farmers and party supporters from different districts of Meerut and Saharanpur divisions. Union minister of state Sanjeev Baliyan and UP minister Suresh Rana had accompanied her. Irani said the BJP government always kept farmers interest first and had provided sufficient budget in schemes for their welfare. ”Farmers had to sell their crop within district (earlier), but now they can go anywhere in the country to sell it.

18-12-2020||Gurugram||Two arrested for kidnapping 8-year-old for ransom of ₹50 lakh||An eight-year-old boy, who was kidnapped from Ullawas in Sector 65 for a ransom of ₹50 lakh, was rescued from Palwal on Thursday night. The police have arrested two persons in connection with the case. They are, however, yet to nab two other suspects — an auto-rickshaw driver and his relative — till Friday evening. According to the police, the four suspects, who belong to Palwal and Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, were relatives and had met in Palwal at a family wedding. They had allegedly planned the kidnap over drinks, said the police. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the suspects thought of kidnapping a minor from Delhi but later changed their plan. “They believed that people of Gurugram have more money and conducted reconnaissance of several areas in the city. They finally planned to take up a room on rent in Gurugram and targeted Ullawas village as the rent was low,” he said. Sangwan said the suspects started doing rounds of Sector 65 area and on December 6, zeroed in on a man, who was driving his Innova car in Ullawas. They followed him till his house. “They started digging details of the family and finally decided to kidnap the only son of the man, who is a businessman by profession. The boy used to play outside the house every day and was friendly by nature,” he said. The suspects planned the kidnapping and called a juvenile from Palwal whose age is yet to be identified. However, the police said he is nearly the age of the victim. All five started living in a rented room. Meanwhile, the juvenile befriended the victim and started playing with him. He used to often get him chocolates and chips and used to spend a lot of time with the victim, said the police. The juvenile allegedly told the victim and his family members that he lost his parents in an accident when he was only two years old, and, since then, he had been living with his uncle who is an auto-rickshaw driver. The uncle used to give them joyrides in the area and the victim become comfortable with them, said the police. On Wednesday, the victim was playing outside his house, when the juvenile allegedly asked him to come for a ride in the auto-rickshaw. The victim boarded the rickshaw, inside which there were already three people present. The auto was covered with side curtains and two more suspects boarded the auto while they were moving out of the village. Sangwan said the suspects along with victim drove towards Palwal from Badshahpur in the auto-rickshaw. The victim after a few minutes asked them to drop him home. When they refused, he raised an alarm, after which one of the suspects injected medicine in his arm that made him slip into unconsciousness It took almost two hours to reach the rented house in a colony which was situated at the outskirts, some 58 kilometres from Gurugram. “The boy woke up late evening but due to the effect of the medicine, went back to sleep. When he woke up on Thursday morning, he raised an alarm but to no avail. The suspects then told him that he had been kidnapped and they would release him only after his father paid them ₹50 lakh,” he said. The police said the suspects called the father on Wednesday evening and informed him about his missing son.They asked him to wait for their call on Friday. Meanwhile, the father of the victim complained to the police and shared the mobile number from which he had received the call. Before they could make another call, the police nabbed two of the suspects from Mathura and they led the police to the house where the child was kept. KK Rao, commissioner of police, on Wednesday evening formed a special investigation team, led by Sangwan, and three crime units were given the task to rescue the boy. “Teams were sent to UP and Palwal and the spot was identified by Friday afternoon. The kidnappers sensed the police presence and three of them fled from the spot before police could enter the house,” he said. The boy was rescued unhurt and was handed over to the family members on Friday night. During questioning, the suspects revealed that they targeted the Class 4 student as his father drove an Innova car and seemed to have a good business. They had also learned that he had recently received a big payment and it was kept at home, said the police. The arrested persons have been identified as Dharambeer and Vishnu of village Khayra in Mathura in UP. They were taken on one-day police remand on Friday. The police said one of the suspects is a distant relative of man arrested in April 2013 for allegedly kidnapping a four-year-old boy from Eldeco Mansions on Sohna Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-arrested-for-kidnapping-8-year-old-for-ransom-of-50-lakh/story-ne6LmUWhaYiJuKxfYBPGRL.html
18-12-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: Officials inspect UP-Gate farmers’ protest site, roll out directions for fire and electrical safety measures||The Ghaziabad district administration and police on Friday inspected the UP Gate farmer protest sites to ensure the protesters were not at risk of a fire that could go out of control. The farmers, officially estimated to be around 2,500-3,000 at the site, have been holding ground during peak winter with the help of gas stoves, bonfires and ‘hukkah’ to keep themselves warm. The site also has about 15 langars (community ktichens) that run on firewood and LPG cylinders. “We directed the department of electrical safety and the fire department to ensure that no untoward incident takes place. Their officers have been directed to brief farmers about proper use of electrical fittings and other gadgets. The teams have also been asked to co-ordinate with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI),” said Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range). Kumar was accompanied by district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey to inspect the site. Many of the protesters were also drawing power by illegally tapping into electrical panels of the street lights erected onthe Delhi Meerut Expressway to run heaters, washing machines etc and to charge their mobile phones. NHAI officials had earlier complained to the district magistrate over the issue.“We have asked the department of electrical safety and the fire department to arrange 20-25 charging points for the protesters,” said Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city). The fire department said that they had briefed farmers about safety. “Two fire tenders have been deployed at the highway section, while two others have been deployed below the UP-Gate flyover (which are the protest sites). One is stationed on the Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway. We also met people there and asked them to take all precautions,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer. Rakesh Tikait, leader and spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Tikait faction, said, “We have been here for about 23 days now and have no option but to use power from wherever available. It is a necessity.” ‘Rift no more’Two farmer groups that, on Wednesday, set up another protest site after differences with the BKU (Tikait), returned to the main protest platform on the UP Gate flyover on Friday. BKU (Balraj Bhati) and Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan had then claimed that the BKU (Tikait) had “expelled” them from the protest but were united for the cause of the farmer. The two groups had preferred for a more accommodating stance during the talks with the central government, while the Tikait faction said it wanted the three new farms laws to be revoked.Balraj Bhati, the leader of his faction, on Friday said that they had dismantled their protest site after senior farmer leaders arrived and resolved the issue. Sardar VM Singh of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan said: “We have a common agenda (against the farm laws). I just want to stick to it. I have no issues with Rakesh (Tikait). I just said that if we are fighting the government, we cannot sit with the government.” Singh had said that he would have accepted the central government’s offer of written assurance on buying produce at the minimum support price (MSP). He believed that this would effectively dilute the effect of the farm laws. This allegedly earned the ire of the Tikait faction.Rakes Tikait said, “Sardar VM Singh is here with us and he is a big farmer leader and all of us are fighting for the cause of farmers. He also arrived at the common dais on Friday and there is absolutely no issue between us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-officials-inspect-up-gate-farmers-protest-site-roll-out-directions-for-fire-and-electrical-safety-measures/story-OUUqGNBHYcgB02Ehub44pJ.html
18-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG to observe zero-waste day on December 25||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to observe a zero-waste day on December 25, during which the civic body will only collect wet waste from households across the city, said officials on Friday. Officials said that the MCG is likely to observe this day once every month in future.MCG officials said that they will collect only wet waste from locations where residents carry out waste segregation. In other areas, where residents are yet to adopt the practice, workers have been asked to inform residents about the basic types of waste segregation and given instructions not to collect any waste at all on December 25.As per MCG joint commissioner Dheeraj Kumar, who is also the civic body’s nodal officer for the Swachh Bharat Mission, the rationale behind observing a zero-waste day is to inculcate the habit of waste segregation in residents across the city.“The objective behind observing a zero-waste day is to make residents aware of the various types of waste segregation, its benefits, and adopting the practice into their daily lives. We want residents to realise that wet waste will help in generation of compost while certain dry waste products can also be recycled and reused. This way, the city will produce zero to limited waste,” said Kumar.He further said that the MCG has issued directions to workers of Ecogreen — the civic body’s concessionaire for door-to-door collection of waste — to strictly lift only wet waste on the day and accordingly sensitise residents, at the time of collection, about the various methods of segregation and its importance. He also said that a seminar was also held with Ecogreen workers earlier this month where all these measures were explained to them in a step-by-step fashion.“The zero waste day will not be a type of enforcement but a gradual method to shift the pattern of waste segregation in the city. By holding zero waste days every once a month, we want to bring out a gradual change in the habit of residents rather than forcing them to do so. We believe that in the long-term, the former method will be more successful,” said Kumar.As per MCG officials, in many condominiums, societies, and townships across the city, waste segregation is a must for residents. Failure to segregate waste can lead to imposition of penalty by residents’ welfare associations (RWAs). In such areas, there are composting plants set up within the residential areas.“It is a great strategy to reduce this city’s waste output. It will also empower RWAs to direct residents to segregate waste and create a mechanism for setting up various types of bins and encourage them to set up in-house compost units. The MCG should however, also look at the option of levying penalties on residents for not adopting waste segregation or not lift waste from their households for a period of time, or both,” said Puneet Goyal, president Tulip Violet RWA.Kumar further said that besides planning a zero-waste day every month, the MCG is also planning to hold zero plastic day in a similar manner.“We also want to simultaneously reduce the city’s dependency on plastic. Just last week, a cloth bag bank was opened to distribute cloth bags and replace the usage of polythene in the city. We will be aiming to hold this event in public spaces such as markets initially before extending it to households,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-observe-zero-waste-day-on-december-25/story-FRa49A5y2tuNarGvnzG8YN.html
18-12-2020||Gurugram||To administer Covid shot, Gurugram will need 250 vaccination sites, 500 officers||The Gurugram health department on Friday said they would identify at least 250 sites by the month end to administer the Covid-19 vaccine as and when it becomes available. The district will also have 500 vaccination officers who will be deployed at the sites.Dr MP Singh, who was recently appointed as Gurugram’s district immunisation officer, said, “We have completed registering nearly 50,000 frontline workers in the public and private sector across the district. They will be vaccinated at designated session sites, which are yet to be identified. Each site will administer the vaccine to not more than 100, or not more than 200 individuals, depending on the size and feasibility of the location.”While the district’s 19 urban and primary healthcare centres are likely to be included in this list, additional sites have been sought from the education and labour departments.“Schools, colleges, community centres and offices and all such locations may be used in addition to our own clinics and dispensaries,” said Singh.The sites will be opened when the district fixes timelines and finalises the list of those who will receive the jab. About 40 doctors are being trained to administer the vaccine.Each site will have four vaccination officers in addition to the person trained to administer the shot.Two would be police officials who will check the healthworkers’ identification on entry, their registration papers and manage their data on the Co-Win app -- a digital platform which will be a repository of information for the management of Covid-19 vaccination in the coming months“A third officer, either a civil defence volunteer or a home guard, will be for crowd control while a fourth officer from the women and child development department will monitor the vaccine recipient to check for adverse effects,” Singh said. “We can proceed with site identification only once we know the staff availablility. We have already conveyed to the district administration our requirement.”At a meeting of the district vaccination task force on Friday, health department officials met with representatives from the police, education, labour and women and child development departments, who are slated to assist with the upcoming immunisation drive against Covid-19.Meanwhile, the district reported 152 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday (up from 108 on the previous day), along with 106 new recoveries and two new deaths. The district tested 4122 samples tested on Friday, of which 3.6 percent were positive for Covid-19. This marks the fourth consecutive day that Gurugram’s daily test-positivity rate has remained below the five percent mark. The district’s total Covid-19 tally stands at 55487 cases, of which 1718 cases are active.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/to-administer-covid-shot-gurugram-will-need-250-vaccination-sites-500-officers/story-BVvboH9IwD54niy1DSAgyH.html
18-12-2020||Noida||Noida residents apply for HSRP as Delhi police issue challan||Noida residents have started applying for High Security Registration Plates (HSRP) for their vehicles as the Delhi Police started issuing fines of ₹5,500 in ‘limited enforcement drive’ for the violation from Tuesday. The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has mandated that all vehicles sold in India before April 2019 need to have an HSRP. HSRPs are tamper-proof, as compared to the conventional number plates. These plates are issued only after the vehicle owner provides information such as engine number, chassis number, etc. This is a crucial step in preventing counterfeiting of high security registration plates.Gautam Budh Nagar has around 7.34 lakh vehicles registered, of which 6.84 lakh vehicles need the HSRP. Noida police have not launched enforcement for this violation in the district. A K Pandey, assistant regional transport officer (administration) Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the process of getting an HSRP is completely online. “People can book their slot accordingly on www.bookmyhsrp.com and https://www.makemyhsrp.com. They need to fill the vehicles’ details, make the payment and get the time slot to visit their dealers’ office to get an HSRP,” he said. The district transport department has 4,50,159 two-wheelers, 2,11,853 four-wheelers (private), 2,210 two-wheelers (commercial), 14,392 cabs, 17,720 good carrier, 18,393 autos, 5,045 e-rickshaws, 3,206 buses, 1,332 school buses, 490 ambulances, 7,291 tractors and 2,730 other vehicles registered with it. Pandey said that around 50,000 of them registered after April 2019 have HSRP pre-installed. The transport department has not received updated data on the newly HSRP fitted vehicles. However, it is estimated that 40,000-50,000 vehicles have got new HSRP through different dealers in Gautam Budh Nagar. The fee is ₹300-400 for two-wheelers and ₹600-1,000 for four-wheelers, depending on the vehicle make.Manish Shrivastava, general manager (sales), Ace Honda in Sector 9, said that he gets orders for HSRP through and https://www.makemyhsrp.com. “The customer applies on the website and we get notification in two days. The https://www.makemyhsrp.com is an authorised agency for HSRP. They deliver the number plates to our agency. We then contact the customers who bring their vehicles to get the number plates,” he said, adding that the application process takes one week’s time. “We deliver only 10 HSRPs every day at present,” he said. Amit Gupta, a resident of Prateek Wisteria in Sector 77, said that he has a Hyundai i-10 car which needs HSRP. “I mostly drive in Noida. Since the Delhi police have started the enforcement drive, I have planned to get it as soon as possible,” he said.With the demand in HSRPs, some mechanics in Sector 16 market and along Captain Vijayant Thapar Marg in Sector 28 have started making counterfeit number plates. A mechanic, without disclosing his name, said that normally it takes two weeks to one month to get HSRP through an official channel. “However, we deliver it in three days’ time at a charge of ₹1,500,” he said. ARTO Pandey said that a forged HSRP is illegal and the department has not received such complaints so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-residents-apply-for-hsrp-as-delhi-police-issue-challan/story-PGY7nR6omoEL2C7adAzoaN.html
18-12-2020||Gurugram||Health minister Anil Vij’s condition improves||State health minister Anil Vij’s condition has shown improvement over the past 24 hours, doctors said on Friday.

18-12-2020||Gurugram||Congress holds protest in support of farmers||Leaders and party workers of the Haryana Congress led by state president Kumari Selja wore black badges as a mark of protest against the three farm laws passed by the Union government. “Farmers of the country have been forced to protest on the borders of national Capital in bitter cold for the last three weeks. But the government is not ready to listen to them under the pressure from the capitalists,” Selja said. The party had organised a meeting at its office in Kaman Sarai on Friday to pay tribute to the farmers who have lost their lives since the protests started in November. Selja said that despite farmers losing their lives, the ruling party leaders were making allegations against the farmers and forcing them to come on the roads to seek justice. She also accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) of spreading misconceptions about the farmers’ protest and accused the party of engaging in politics of division. “The BJP wants to turn farmers into labourers, which cannot be tolerated. The BJP had promised to implement the recommendations of Swaminathan Commission report. It promised to double the income of farmers, but not a single promise has been fulfilled”, Selja alleged. BJP, however, said that Congress leadership was misleading the farmers despite the fact that the same proposals were introduced by it in the past, both in Punjab and at the Centre. “The Congress government in Punjab passed a similar law in 2006, while in Haryana, they entered into agreements to create silos with private companies. The opposition, including the Congress, is trying to take political mileage from this protest by misleading farmers. The land ownership or MSP system will remain unchanged by these laws,” said BJP spokesperson Raman Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/congress-holds-protest-in-support-of-farmers/story-DU2HqsR217n1bBYlSB7IpI.html

18-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Mercury rises but city shivers as icy winds sweep region; respite from cold wave from Monday||Cold wave conditions persisted in the region on Friday even as mercury soared in Noida by over three degrees in the past 24 hours. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the cold wave will continue on Saturday and may further extend to Sunday at some areas across the national Capital region (NCR), including Noida. The cold day conditions will, however, come to an end by Saturday due to the dispersal of fog, said analysts.“Day time temperatures rose slightly on Friday and the main reason behind this is that the fog, that had lifted about 300 to 400 metres above the surface, has dispersed. This has let sunlight through over several areas, thereby increasing day time temperatures, bringing cold day conditions to an end. The cold wave will, however, persist for another two days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. On Friday, Noida recorded a minimum temperature of 8.1 degrees Celsius against 4.5 degrees a day earlier. Meanwhile, the average minimum temperature recorded at Safdarjung observatory, considered average for the NCR, was 4.6 degrees Celsius, same as a day earlier. The maximum temperature for Noida on Friday was recorded at 19.1 degrees Celsius against 14.4 degrees Celsius a day earlier. For NCR, the average maximum was 19.8 degrees Celsius against 15.2 degrees Celsius a day earlier. Meanwhile, wind speed varied across NCR, with icy cold north-westerly winds varying from 15 to 8 kmph at different areas, making the wind chill factor -- a factor that varies the actual temperature realisation based on the wind speed – higher at certain areas across the region. Cold wave is the condition when the minimum temperatures are 4.5 degrees Celsius below the season’s normal, while cold day is the condition when even the maximum temperature is below 4.5 degrees Celsius below the season’s average.According to the IMD, the minimum and maximum temperatures are likely to be between 4.0 and 21.0 degrees Celsius for the region on Saturday.“There is a western disturbance likely around December 21, which will lead to variable wind directions with more westerly and south-westerly components. This will lead to slight rise in temperatures, and thus the cold wave may stop from December 21 onwards,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-mercury-rises-but-city-shivers-as-icy-winds-sweep-region-respite-from-cold-wave-from-monday/story-sSm8o0FXOo75HYhRY8SHrK.html
18-12-2020||City||Farmers asked to clean up protest sites at Bawal and Shahjahanpur||Haryana and Rajasthan Police on Friday have asked protesters at Bawal and Shahjahanpur to keep the sites clean.Police teams deployed at the sites had complained of odour and improper disposal of garbage.Farmers protesting in Bawal in Rewari and Shahjahanpur on Delhi-Jaipur highway at the Haryana-Rajasthan border had set up more than 30 tents on Wednesday at the sites. While many farmers sleep at the protest sites, others return to their respective village at night, police said.Police said leftover food, rotten vegetables and used disposable plates were piling up at the spot. Abhishek Jorwal, superintendent of police (Rewari), said that they informed the civil authorities to clean Bawal area and dustbins were placed on Friday. “The situation is under control and the protestors silently protesting on the service lanes have been asked to keep the area clean to ensure no one faces any inconvenience,” he said.Ram Murti Joshi, superintendent of police (Bhiwadi), said that the civil teams were cleaning the sites and the farmer leaders have been asked to take charge and maintain cleanliness. Tej Bahadur Yadav, a former constable of the Border Security Force (BSF), who was sacked from service and who lost the 2019 Lok Sabha election against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s in Varanasi and now at the protest site, said that they have brought dustbins and have asked the kitchen members to ensure cleanliness. “A tractor-trolley driver has been asked to disposed of garbage at a site in Bhiwadi,” he said.Farmers at the Shahjahanpur border connecting Haryana and Rajasthan have been denied access by the to move ahead on the national highway.The police on Monday had set up barricades to stop the protestors from crossing the border and hence one side of the carriageway is blocked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-asked-to-clean-up-protest-sites-at-bawal-and-shahjahanpur/story-HSieKEVzwtAKL0zPvVqDHP.html
18-12-2020||Gurugram||DTCP to cancel allotment of plots violating building norms in DLF Phase-3||To curb illegal constructions in DLF Phase-3, particularly in the plots meant for the EWS category, the department of town and country planning(DTCP) has decided to start a drive to disconnect water, power and sewage connections of such plots and eventually cancel their allotment. DTCP officials said that there have been rampant construction violations and those related to the transfer of ownership in EWS plots. To pursue this matter, the department has sought information the licensee of the colony — DLF. RS Bhath, district town planner(enforcement), Gurugram, said that it has been observed that rules and regulations of urban development and terms and conditions of licence are being blatantly violated. “Many owners are carrying out illegal construction after taking occupancy certificate(OC).Common violations include, 100 percent ground coverage, additional floors up to 6-7 storeys, combining two or more plots, and the misuse of premises for commercial establishments, such as offices, grocery shops, restaurants, etc,” said Bhath.In view of large-scale violations, Bhath said that it has been decided that power, water and sewage connections n such properties would be disconnected. This action would be taken jointly by the DTCP and other bodies, such as Haryana Sahari Vikas Pradikaran, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram(MCG), the electricity department, the police and DLF. To carry out a concerted drive, the DTCP has asked the developer to share a plot-wise detailed list, mentioning the original allotment status along with the details of the change in ownership for EWS category plots. It has also asked the company to share allotment letters and builder-buyer agreements with the allottees. “We have also asked that EWS plots in which buyers have constructed beyond permissible limits or have made illegal transfers should be identified and the list should be shared with us. We have also sought an action plan for disconnection and suspension of services to these plots. Once these violators are identified, the proposal to cancel the allotments of these property owners will be discussed in detail,” he said, adding that the department is working out legal modalities for the cancellation of allotment.DTCP officials said that the reason for this elaborate exercise is that massive illegal constructions on EWS plots poses a serious danger to the residents and to adjoining buildings. The notice issued by the department on Thursday further said that Gurugram being in seismic zone- 4, needs to be prepared for any natural calamity. Although efforts, such as issuance of notices, sealing drives and even demolition drives, have been executed, but the situation has become worse, it stated. “Demolition drives have been carried out but there is a need for more concerted action against such structures”, said Bhath. A DLF spokesperson, when asked about the matter, preferred not to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-to-cancel-allotment-of-plots-violating-building-norms-in-dlf-phase-3/story-5jo5VAgcg4wkDXrlBNsg4L.html
18-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Will fight 2022 UP assembly elections if demand not met, say farmers at Chilla border||Leaders of some of the farmers, who have been protesting at the borders Delhi shares with Noida and Ghaziabad against the three new farm laws, said Friday that if the government does not accept their demands, they will contest the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in 2022.“We have been on protest for two weeks now but the government is not taking note of our grievances. We have a lot of supporters in Uttar Pradesh. In the last four decades several governments came and went. I was also offered a ministerial position by some governments but being apolitical, I refused. We have already formed a political outfit – Kisan Kranti Dal. We will contest the UP assembly elections in 2022 if our demands are not addressed,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)-Bhanu president Thakur Bhanu Pratap.Thakur Yogesh Pratap, the BKU-Bhanu’s UP president, held a five-day hunger strike (Sunday-Thursday) against the farm laws at Chilla border.“I ended my hunger strike on Thursday after consultations with BKU members and office bearers. We found that some farmers died at the Singhu border while a Sikh leader, Baba Ram Singh, committed suicide. But the government did not take any notice of farmers’ plight. The government is callous and it does not matter to them if one fasts or dies,” he said.Farmers have been protesting at the Chilla border and the Dalit Prerna Sthal since December 1 against the three new farm laws. The protest has blocked the Noida-Delhi road at the Chilla border and vehicles bound for the national Capital have been diverted to the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway and Kalindi Kunj routes.Yogesh said that some farmers from Western UP were trying to reach Noida but they have been detained at different places, to weaken the farmers’ protest. The farmers have blocked the Noida-Delhi road at Chilla border in protest.Meanwhile, BKU Lokshakti members on Friday protested at the Dalit Prerna Sthal by performing mock suicide acts as a symbolic demonstration of the plight of farmers. Master Shyoraj Singh, BKU-Lok Shakti president, said that this is a difficult fight for the farmers. “The government has placed its entire machinery and ministers against the farmers.

18-12-2020||Gurugram||City gets respite from cold, temperatures to rise from Friday||Gurugram got a respite from the ongoing cold wave on Friday, with Gurugram recording a maximum daytime temperature of 18.4°C, up from the season’s low of 13.1°C the previous day. The minimum temperature was 4°C, the same as Thursday, with yet another episode of shallow to moderate fog in parts of the city during the early hours. As per the India Meteorological Department’s seven day forecast for the city, the minimum nighttime temperature is expected to rise to as much as 7 degrees Celsius by December 24, while the maximum daytime temperature is expected to touch as much as 22 degrees Celsius in the next week. Foggy and misty mornings are expected to continue, with partly cloudy skies during the daytime. Air quality in the city also improved slightly, with 224 (poor air) on the CPCB’s AQI bulletin (down from 246 on Thursday), which experts attributed to high speed winds which touched up to 15kmph in some parts of the city. “We would have seen an even further decline in pollution, but since the winds themselves are cold there has not been much vertical diffusion of pollutants on Friday,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality expert. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality is likely to start deteriorating marginally from 18.12.2020 but remain largely in lower end of Very Poor category.” Experts said this was due to a possible slowing down of wind speeds, which will once again lead to an accumulation of pollutants closer to the earth’s surface.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-gets-respite-from-cold-temperatures-to-rise-from-friday/story-vSgUZ5WD99yFQSZexIedXL.html
18-12-2020||Gurugram||Ranks of protesting farmers swell as they continue agitation at Haryana border||Vishal Soni, a 30-year-old production engineer, took a leave from work on Thursday and travelled 10km to join the farmers’ agitation near the Shahjahanpur border at the Delhi-Jaipur National Highway. Soni said that while he had been sharing information and articles on social media to amplify the farmers’ protest, he felt the need to do more and join them on the ground. “I come from a rural background and stand in solidarity with the farmers. While I had been restricting myself to social media posts until now, I wanted to join the protests, even if it was for a day,” said Soni. He said that listening to farmers’ concerns at the protest site had strengthened his belief that they were leading a legitimate fight for their rights and were not misled, as was being claimed by the government. “Farmers are not being misled or tutored by anyone. I heard them and observed various facets of the protest here. They are honestly putting forward their demands,” said Soni. He is among many other individuals who have been visiting the site in support of farmers’ agitation against the new farm laws. Farmers from states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Haryana have been protesting near the Shahjahanpur border at the Delhi-Jaipur highway since the past six days after the Rewari Police stopped them from proceeding towards Delhi to join the farmers’ agitation. While farmer groups continue to assert that their goal is to proceed towards Delhi, they said that the dharna at Rewari had developed into a full-fledged protest site on the lines of the blockade at other borders surrounding the national Capital. Farmers across the country have been protesting against the three newly enacted farm laws — The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 — passed by Parliament during the monsoon session. The farmers fear that the new laws will put them at the mercy of large corporations and lead to the removal of the minimum support price (MSP) they receive on important crops. Ram Singh, a farmer from Gharsana tehsil in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar district, said that farmers had carried ration for the initial days but subsequently, help had poured in from different quarters. “Early in the morning, someone got multiple sacks of oranges delivered for us. We don’t even know the name of the donor. The ration is not a problem. Someone or the other pitches in as and when there’s a need,” said Singh. He said that with the kind of support farmers had been getting, they could sustain the protest for years. “We are prepared to agitate for years, if required. We will not stop until the laws are rolled back,” he said. Harvinder Singh, a farmer from Shri Ganganagar, said that people had been supporting them by providing essential supplies and efforts were underway to reach out to organisations such as Khalsa Aid. “Students from Delhi University visited us in solidarity. They collected around a lakh rupee and purchased tarpaulin tents for farmers here. We were facing a shortage of milk so they brought in dry milk packets,” said Singh. He added that relatives of villagers back home had been sending various supplies for the farmer groups. “One of our brothers today came with a water tanker, beddings, and food. Another brought medical kits provided by Khalsa Aid. Langar is also prepared daily. Bit by bit, we are expanding our caravan of farmers here,” said Singh, who was earlier protesting at the Tikri border. He said that many groups of farmers from Rajasthan who were agitating at Tikri had decided to strengthen numbers at the Haryana-Rajasthan border. “More strength was needed here. The Central government also knows that this is an important stretch. If this stretch is blocked, the pressure will increase. So, we decided to mobilise our numbers here when the police prevented us from going to Delhi,” said Singh. On Friday, nearly 300 farmers from Dadri tehsil of Bhiwani on their way to join the agitation at Shahjahanpur were stopped by police. Abhishek Jorwal, superintendent of police (Rewari), said that the police wouldn’t allow the highway to be blocked and trolleys attempting to reach the site had been stopped at Dadri. “One side of the carriageway has remained blocked for the last eight days. We have deployed forces at all inter- and intra-district borders and no farmer groups will be allowed to reach the site,” said Jorwal. Sanjay Madhav, the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that around three hundred farmers who had earlier been camping at Tikri border had been stopped at Mahendargarh bypass near Charkhi Dadri. “These farmers are from Hanumangarh and Shri Ganganagar in Rajasthan. They were earlier at the Tikri border. They were stopped by the police near Charkhi Dadri. The government will not be able to stop us for long. More and more people are joining us daily,” said Madhav. Farmers have also been protesting at two other points in South Haryana. While a group of farmers have camped at Bawal, another group of farmers are putting up at Delhi-Agra highway near the KMP Chowk in Palwal.Ram Kishan Mehlawat, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Haryana’s general secretary, said that farmers had been camping at Bawal Chowk since last week. “A regular continuous dharna is underway at Bawal Chowk. Our plan is to mobilise numbers and proceed towards Delhi,” said Mehlawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ranks-of-protesting-farmers-swell-as-they-continue-agitation-at-haryana-border/story-DkQgcZpWGTjbhtYRy59wGO.html
18-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG to survey illegal mobile towers next month||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will begin a survey to identify illegal mobile towers next month, officials said on Friday. This follows the MCG request to telecommunication companies last month to provide a list of their mobile towers in the city. The exercise resulted in the discovery of 367 illegal towers. As per MCG officials, fewer than 200 mobile towers are legal.MCG officials, however, said they expected to find more illegal towers in the survey. In 2018, the civic body had identified more than 5,000 illegal mobile towers and subsequently given telecommunication companies two months time to regularise them.The survey they will also inspect the structural stability buildings hosting mobile towers. If there is damage, the company will be asked to move the tower.“Regularising of mobile towers is essential as it will ensure that they are conforming to the norms. It will also help us identify structures which may not be able to support the weight of these towers and are susceptible to collapse. We can subsequently initiate remedial action,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.The MCG has also reduced the annual licensing fees for mobile towers within the jurisdiction from ₹2.5 lakh to ₹15,000 in the hope of ensuring towers are regularised, help them generate revenue and provide good service to people.MCG officials also revealed that none of the mobile towers has a valid fire No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the fire department. However, with the Haryana Fire Service Act stating that a NOC is only required for structures that have occupancy, the fire department has not initiated any action on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-survey-illegal-mobile-towers-next-month/story-vqmDoyH0IY5fnqWwgoIUVN.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Don’t arrest unsuspecting buyers of stolen phones, discharge those you arrested: Delhi Police officer’s order seeks to save innocents from legal hassle||A senior police officer has issued an order in two districts under his jurisdiction to ensure that people who unknowingly purchase stolen mobile phones are not arrested, and those arrested in the past are discharged.Pointing out that “implicating” such innocent buyers in a criminal case is “not appropriate”, the order issued by Suvashish Chaudhary, joint commissioner of police (southern range), reasoned that such action threatened to derail the future and careers of innocent buyers of stolen mobile phones. People who are found to be in possession of a stolen mobile phone are usually booked under Indian Penal Code 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property), a non-bailable offence that carries a prison sentence of up to three years, a fine, or both.“It has been seen that lately persons who have been arrested under IPC Section 411 are merely innocent buyers, who have, without knowledge of the consequences, been duped into buying cheap secondhand mobile phones,” Chaudhary said in his order. “All the SHOs be directed not to arrest such persons under IPC 411, just to increase the figure of receivers arrested. Instead, they should concentrate on getting the real receivers of stolen property, who actually but them as a commercial interest,” the order issued on December 15 added. While many senior police officers HT spoke to denied arresting innocent buyers, others acknowledged that they had little choice. “The law says that anyone found in possession of stolen property is to be booked and arrested. It is difficult to ascertain quickly whether a buyer was actually innocent or was trying to mislead us,” said a senior police officer under whose jurisdiction a prominent used phone market is. “But if our initial probe makes it clear that the buyer really didn’t know the truth, we just implicate them instead of making an arrest. They then have to explain their situation to the court,” said the officer, who didn’t want to be identified. While a person arrested needs to seek bail, those implicated are let off from police station after giving them assurances.“If an offence doesn’t require us to arrest someone to seek a remand or make a recovery, or if the suspect is not a threat to the victims or the probe, and if the stipulated jail term is less than seven years, the officer on the ground can implicate them rather than arrest them. But they’ll have to make a court appearance,” explained a police officer.These buyers are usually caught when the police, during their investigation of a stolen or snatched phone, track them down. JCP Chaudhary said that a review of this situation in south and southeast districts in his jurisdiction suggested that innocent buyers were being booked and arrested. While he didn’t reveal any data, another police officer who didn’t want to be identified said that this figure ranged between 20% and 80% of the total number of buyers in different police stations. “Mobile phones are not like stolen cars in which buyers know they need documents. Many used phone buyers are very poor people who end up buying stolen phones at cheap rates and without bills. These are people who wouldn’t have purchased these phones if they knew they were stolen goods,” said Chaudhary. He said that apart from their careers being threatened by being booked and arrested, these buyers also ended up being stigmatised as they are considered as usual suspects when police look out for stolen phones,” said Chaudhary.And by making such arrests, the police were not getting to the root of the problem, he said. “The investigating officer will have to discern between the actual receiver of the stolen phones and the unsuspecting buyers,” said Chaudhary.It remained unclear whether the order would be replicated by officers of other districts. The joint CP of another range said that there was no need for this order. “The mandate is to arrest criminals only, not innocent people. So, we don’t need to issue an order,” the officer said, requesting anonymity. But Vikram Singh, former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, welcomed the written order as a “humane step” and said that issuing such an order in writing would ensure transparency and would allow a cushion for innocent buyers to explain their case. “Ignorance of the law is not an excuse and technically it is a crime to purchase a stolen phone, but this is a humane approach. The investigators need to apply their minds and put in the extra work to ensure they aren’t arresting innocent buyers,” said Vikram Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/don-t-arrest-unsuspecting-buyers-of-stolen-phones-discharge-those-you-arrested-delhi-police-officer-s-order-seeks-to-save-innocents-from-legal-hassle/story-wPv7bS5YvcCku8ozIJLWgL.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Remove protesters from outside CM’s house, gathering violates DDMA order, says HC||The Delhi high court on Friday asked the Delhi Police to ensure that the mayors of the three municipal corporation and other protesters, who have been staging a sit-in protest outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence, are removed, while stating that the protest gives an incorrect signal that the prohibitory orders of the Delhi District Management Authority (DDMA), in view of Covid-19 spread, are not being followed.Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, while hearing a plea by the Civil Lines Residents Association that the protest was causing an inconvenience as protesters were blocking the road, said the court expects the police to take action in accordance with law for the implementation of the DDMA order of September 30, prohibiting political and other gatherings.Mayors from Delhi’s municipal corporations and 22 BJP councillors have been protesting against the Delhi government since December 7 demanding release of ₹13,000 crore to municipal corporations by the Delhi government. Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “We are fighting for the rights of municipal workers. We have not yet received any communication from the police regarding our removal from the protest site.”“You have to shift them (protesters). The district magistrate has to pass an order. Otherwise, an incorrect signal will go,” Sachdeva said.“It is expected that the police will take appropriate steps in accordance with the orders issued by the DDMA and Section 144 (CrPC) which has been imposed in the Civil Lines area where the protesters are sitting on a dharna (sit-in),” the judge said.The directions come after advocate Gautam Narayan, appearing for the Delhi Police, told the court that they have earlier asked protesters to vacate the premises as Section 144, which prohibits the gathering of four or more people, has been imposed on Flagstaff Road where the chief minister’s residence is located. They also said they asked protesters to follow the DDMA directive which prohibits any protest in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.Police also apprised the Delhi high court that several requests have been made to protesters to vacate the premises but the protesters are defiant.Narayan also told the court that in an allied matter -- two AAP MLAs Raghav Chadha and Atishi have challenged the denial of permission by the police to hold a protest outside the residences of Union home minister Amit Shah and lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal -- he has made a submission that no protests, political activities or other gatherings are allowed in the city.To this, the court said if the DDMA order has directed that there can be no protests, then action should be taken. He said the district magistrate should issue an order asking the protesters to vacate the space.“An order has to be issued by the district magistrate. If they don’t agree, then action should be taken in accordance with law,” Sachdeva said. The court posted the matter for further hearing to December 21 after the Delhi Police counsel sought an adjournment for making efforts to remove the protesters.The AAP did not respond to calls and messages sent to them seeking a reaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/remove-protesters-from-outside-cm-s-house-gathering-violates-ddma-order-says-hc/story-Gw0UJg6D4S32dDlDqz9IOJ.html
18-12-2020||Chandigarh||‘Need for collective action against terrorism’||American political scientist Dr C Christine Fair on Friday said the world must work together to stop terrorism, while emphasising on the collective strategy against terrorism.She was speaking on “The Taliban are coming calling: Deep states in Pakistan and India” during the fourth Military Literature Festival. An expert on counter-terrorism and issues related to the Asian region, Dr Fair said some countries in the Asian region were helping a number of terrorist organisations, including the Taliban, at the expense of people around the world.In a conversation with KC Singh, India’s ambassador to Iran, Dr Fair said lack of better coordination between the Pakistani government and the military was one of the reasons for the rise of the Taliban. “No country could solely curb terrorism-related activities. Collective action is needed to control it,” she said.Referring to Asian countries affected by terrorism, she said India had emerged at the top in the list of developing countries due to its stand against terrorism.About the role of the media, she said the declining trend of investigative journalism at present was a matter of concern.With the formation of a new government in the US, Dr Fair said the future will decide the new American government’s strategy about dealing with Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/need-for-collective-action-against-terrorism/story-696HffjHJ767WWEoN3YBtL.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Farmer leaders to meet today to chalk out course in wake of SC ruling||A day after the Supreme Court asked the government and the agitating farmer groups to “talk to each other” on the three contentious farm laws and find a solution, farmers across the four protest sites in Delhi on Friday endorsed the apex court’s suggestion and said they wanted the government to repeal the laws.Balwinder Singh, 48, a resident of Chahal village in Tarn Taran district, said, “People tried to malign our agitation but did not succeed. The Supreme Court upheld our right to protest and it only shows that we are right. We only hope that the government comes to its senses and understands the plight of farmers.”On Thursday, several farmer leaders said they would hold consultations with top Supreme Court lawyers on whether to “implead” as a party in the ongoing proceedings before the Supreme Court. Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal), said, “The farmer union leaders have called a meeting on Saturday afternoon at 2pm. We will decide the further course of action in that meeting.”Many protesters also reacted adversely to the Union agriculture minister’s open letter to farmers. Dinesh Chaddha, a lawyer from Barwa village in Ropar district of Punjab, said, “The union minister’s letter is highly misleading. His assurances about the minimum support price (MSP) mean nothing if it is not included in the Act itself. As far as contract farming is concerned, everybody knows that corporates will have the upper hand in forming such agreements; so the government should intervene in such matters.” Protesters at the four borders points of Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, and Chilla continued to demand a repeal of the laws even as a steady stream of supporters joined the protesters already camped in these places. At Singhu border, protesters were joined by Bollywood actor Swara Bhasker and Punjabi Singer Babbu Maan. While food and medical camps saw the usual number of crowds on Friday, a tattoo artist’s stall, offering free tattoos, got a lot of attention from young farmers.To protect the farmers against the chill, the Sarbat Da Bhala Charitable Trust started erecting a 110 feet by 40 feet enclosure on Friday, a few kilometres from the stage at Singhu border. “About 200 farmers can sleep there and since the tent will be closed from all sides, it will be better than sleeping in the open and catching the chill,” the work in-charge Jitendra Verma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmer-leaders-to-meet-today-to-chalk-out-course-in-wake-of-sc-ruling/story-OtlhOhb0lhRB1KsqRhBEqM.html
18-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC to take action against illegal encroachments along Buddha Nullah||The municipal corporation (MC) has decided to take action against over 950 encroachments along the Buddha Nullah which include commercial, industrial and residential units.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal conducted a meeting with the members of the sewerage board and irrigation department and officials of other departments concerned at the MC’s Zone-D office on Friday.The MC has already started establishing micro forests along the nullah and the work order has been issued to install iron fencing around it.The civic body officials have now been told to make a schedule for the entire process to clean the nullah including demolition drive, establishment of micro forests, laying sewer lines and construction of roads. They were also told to chalk out the plan for removal of the encroachments in a phased manner and were directed to involve the sub divisional magistrate (SDM) concerned in the process.The officials said that MC before installing the iron fencing, the authorities have decided to raze the encroachments. Also, if the micro forests are developed in the first phase, then they might get damaged during the demolition drive.The company which was involved in the demarcation process of the nullah submitted its final report in October which stated that there are over 950 encroachments along the nullah. Of these, around 60% are residential and 40% factories or commercial units. Four religious buildings have also been constructed by encroaching upon the nullah area. Sabharwal said, “The officials have been told to make a proper schedule which will also specify which project will be taken up at what time. Also, the civic body will initiate action against the encroachments soon. Some of them have already been demolished in Gopal Nagar area, but a drive will be started to remove all of them in the coming time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mc-to-take-action-against-illegal-encroachments-along-buddha-nullah/story-03wMmzc5XPCKeUxAJD2U8J.html

18-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana roads remain treacherous despite ₹630cr spending||The Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) has spent around ₹630 crore on streets and roads over the last five years but to no avail as harried motorists continue to navigate haphazard construction and pothole-riddled roads. The roads are all the more treacherous after rainfall with those on two-wheelers risking life and limb. From the main roads to residential areas and the markets of the city, the sad state persists despite the civic body sparing no expense. An average ₹126 crore (including municipal funds and Punjab Infrastructure Development Board grants) has been spent on upgrading the roadways each year since 2015. A record ₹219 crore was spent on developing road infrastructure in 2016-17 during the SAD-BJP regime. Dugri, Haibowal, Model Town extension, Field Ganj, Giaspura, Civil City, Tajpur Road, Tibba Road, Janta Nagar, and Shimlapuri are the worst affected areas.Travelling on Ferozepur Road, Malhar Road and Pakhowal Road also guarantees a bumpy ride thanks to ongoing development projects. The worn down and broken roads continue to blight the industrial and financial hub of the state, which is visited by a slew of customers, businessmen and industrialists on a daily basis, bringing into question the state’s largest local body’s ability to keep a check on quality and internal corruption. At present, the MC is working to avail ₹100 crore loan for taking up development projects in the city.An MC official , who did not wish to be named, said, “There has been no check on the quality of development work. The alleged nexus between councillors, senior officials and contractors allows shoddy work to pass muster.”‘MC steeped in corruption’“In fact, contractors allegedly pay a fixed commission to officials and office-bearers to avert action. In the last week of October, a group of municipal corporation engineers also approached cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and mayor Balkar Sandhu and demanded that the MC stop the inquiry into already completed the development projects,” the official said, adding that no proper drainage system and the absence of a storm water sewer contributed to accelerated wear and tear.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said,”I cannot comment on development works conducted before I was posted in the city. However, now we conduct regular sampling and monitoring. Payments to contractors have been stopped after samples failed quality test. Some contractors have been asked to reconstruct roads in the past and errant contractors will be blacklisted, if they fail to work efficiently.”Mayor Balkar Sandhu said,”Contractors and officials have been given clear instructions to not compromise with the quality of work and efficiency has also improved of late. Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu has also been conducting surprise inspections to check quality of work. While contractors are being forced to reconstruct the inferior quality roads, a number of inquiries have also been marked in road constructions projects taken up in the past. ”Parcelling out blame, the MC commissioner said, “Residents are also responsible for the short life of roads as cars are washed along roads and the accumulated water damages the material.”Gurjot Singh, a resident of Salem Tabri area, said,”The civic body has been wasting taxpayers money on constructing roads just to woo the public before elections, but no one keeps a check on the quality. The main roads still get the attention of the civic body officials, but no one cares for internal roads and streets.” Samples fail quality testIn July, seven samples collected from Amantran Colony, Guru Vihar, Chander Nagar, Bal Singh Nagar Road, Ashok Nagar, Daba Road and a road near GNE College (towards Dugri) failed the test. Samples collected from a stretch near RK Road, Circular Road near Daresi Ground and Baba Mukand Singh Nagar had also been found specious.Seven out of eight road samples of RMC roads collected from Balbir enclave in the Haibowal area also failed the quality test. Following the complaint filed by a RTI activist, the vigilance bureau had also sought an action taken report from the MC in the case wherein the samples have failed the quality test. Despite ringing demand to blacklist errant contractors no such action has been taken.Irregular recordsThe MC has also failed to maintain records of development projects taken up in the past and officials have no record of which road was constructed in what year, resulting in wastage of public money as development projects are proposed in the same area frequently.Jaskirat Singh of the NGO Naroa Punjab Manch said it is necessary to keep the records as in absence of the same MC will not be able to check whether the service life of a road has expired or not.During the MC’s general house meet held on November 10, Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) councillor Swarandeep Chahal raised an objection stating that the MC officials had installed new interlocking tiles on existing tiles even when the existing tiles were in good shape.To exacerbate matters, over 600 measurement books (MB) issued to staffers in the past have not been returned and many of them are missing from the record.The MC officials must mention details of construction projects in the MB books on a daily basis in order to make payments to contractors. After a complaint was submitted by an RTI activist regarding the same, Sabharwal marked an inquiry into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-roads-remain-treacherous-despite-630cr-spending/story-osiJ3EAYKocTMYb84OyVwI.html

18-12-2020||City||Ludhiana police step up vigil outside ATMs after Dec-14 robbery bid||After the robbery bid at Punjab and Sind Bank ATM on Ferozepur Road opposite the Verka milk plant, Ludhiana police have increased vigil during night hours. Patrolling teams have been asked to check all ATMs repeatedly.The teams have been also directed to look into the attendance of security guards deployed at the ATMs during patrolling. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal has already ordered all banks to appoint at least one security guard who should be present at all ATMs located within the jurisdiction of Ludhiana police commissionerate from 8pm to 6am. Agrawal has made it clear that no ATM would be allowed to operate without a security guard. The patrolling parties have been also asked to click pictures of the ATMs they visit and send it to their seniors. Division Number 8 station house officer (SHO) Inspector Jarnail Singh said that all patrolling parties and PCR squads were asked to check every ATM and question people found roaming randomly on roads. The Punjab and Sind Bank’s ATM, where few miscreants attempted a robbery in the wee hours of December 14, is closed for repairs. A team of police personnel is keeping tight vigil in Feroze Gandhi market, where ATMs of six banks are installed. Due to the night curfew, movement of people is restricted. The police teams, it has been learnt, are checking ATMs on highways every 20 to 30 minutes. Satnam Singh, a security guard at Feroze Gandhi market, said that the movement of police has increased around the ATMs. “Police personnel came to check if everything was fine. They enquire if the CCTVs are working or whether we have noticed some suspicious movements,” he added. Bhupinder Singh, another guard, said the cops have asked them note down phone numbers of police officials and call on those numbers in case of any suspicious activity.Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said that they have increased the vigil outside ATMs and other financial establishments. “The banks have been already asked to depute security guards at the ATMs as we will not allow ATMs to function without guards at night,” he added. He also said that the banks and financial establishments have been asked to take all security measures, including installation of alarm systems and night vision cameras. The police chief also said that they have been identifying the ATMs without security guards. “The survey would be completed in next two to three days,” he added. Previous attacks on ATMsOn December 2, three masked robbers took away ₹26.37 lakh after cutting open an HDFC Bank’s ATM in Lall Kalan village of Samrala.

As I belong to Chhotu Ram’s family, my first duty is to stand with the farmers. I was asked by the members of Sir Chhotu Ram Vichar Manch to raise the farmers’ voice as they feel that the three new laws are harmful to them.”“The government and farmers should continue dialogue and find an amicable solution to this issue. I am ready to join the farmers protesting at the Delhi border and sit on a hunger strike with them if they allow me. No one is provoking the farmers; they are agitating of their own will,” he added.On being asked about his MP son’s stand on the laws, the former minister said, “Brijendra will clarify his stand but I am standing with the farmers.”When asked if he was switching sides, the former Uchana MLA said there is no truth to such “speculations”.

18-12-2020||Lucknow||UP’s anti-conversion law premised on overturned court verdict, hears HC||The Allahabad high court on Friday directed the Uttar Pradesh government to file a counter-affidavit to a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the constitutional validity of the new ordinance against forced and dishonest religious conversions that some right-wingers term as ‘Love Jihad’.The bench comprising chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Piyush Agrawal passed the order in the PIL filed by Saurabh Kumar, a lawyer. The bench refused to grant any interim relief in the form of a stay order on the ordinance and directed the state government to file a counter-affidavit by January 4, 2021.The petitioner’s primary contention is that the ordinance impinges upon the fundamental right to choice and the right to change of faith. According to the petitioner, the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, is morally and constitutionally invalid.The petitioner requested the court to declare the ordinance ultra vires or beyond the legal remit of the Constitution. Besides, he requested the court to direct the authorities not to take any action under the ordinance during the pendency of the petition. According to the petition, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had on October 31, 2020, made a statement that his government would bring a law against Love Jihad, a term used by right wingers to allege a conspiracy to convert Hindu women.During his public statement, the chief minister referred to a single-bench judgment of the Allahabad high court in the case of Priyanshi alias Shamreen and another versus the state of UP, in which the court had observed that religious conversion just for the sake of marriage was invalid. The petitioner pointed out that a few days later, a division bench of the high court overruled the single bench verdict, which had disapproved of religious conversions for the sake of marriage in the Salamat Ansari and others vs state of UP and others. Also Read: Hathras woman was gang-raped, killed, says CBI, names four in chargesheetThe division bench, in this case, held that “the right to live with a person of his/her choice, irrespective of religion professed by them, is intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty.” The bench had observed this while holding the single-bench judgment as not good in law. In the light of the division bench ruling, the petitioner has submitted that the impugned ordinance assumes a contrary position to the ruling of the high court in the Salamat Ansari case. Also Read: Couple ties knot, hours after bride injures back in an accident in UP’s PrayagrajThe petitioner submitted that the provisions of the ordinance give the state policing powers over a citizen’s choice of life partner or religion and thus militated against the fundamental rights to individual autonomy, privacy, human dignity and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution (right to life and personal liberty).The impugned ordinance also requires every religious conversion to be scrutinised and certified by the state.Taking exception to this, the petitioner has submitted that the very concept of forcing an individual to explain and justify a decision, which is closely personal to him/her, before an officer of the state is contrary to the Constitution of India, which ensures such rights.The court has fixed January 7 as the next date of hearing in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-s-anti-conversion-law-premised-on-overturned-court-verdict-hears-hc/story-BRXI4LstQNODzjc5tZ6rFL.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC asks police to shift protesters outside CM Kejriwal’s home, says it sends a wrong message||The Delhi high court on Friday asked the Delhi police to shift protesters outside Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s house. Mayors of municipal corporations have been protesting outside the chief minister’s house demanding release of funds and clearance of dues. The Delhi High Court also asked the Delhi Police to take firm steps to ensure that the directions imposed by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) are implemented. The Delhi Police also informed the court that they have earlier asked protesters to vacate the premises as Section 144 of the CrPC, which prohibits the gathering of four or more people, has been imposed in Flagstaff Road where the chief minister’s residence is located. They also said they asked protesters to follow the DDMA directive which prohibits any protest in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Police also apprised the Delhi HC that several requests have been made to protesters to vacate the premises but the protesters remained defiant. Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said that the District Magistrate should issue an order asking protesters to vacate the premises. He said, “You have to shift them (protestors) . The District Magistrate has to pass an order. Otherwise an incorrect signal will go.”The court has also listed the matter for hearing on December 21. The Delhi High Court was hearing a plea by the Civil Lines Residents Association against the protests outside Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on grounds that it was causing inconvenience to residents as protester were blocking the road. The Delhi High Court earlier had said that any venue cannot become a protest site as there are designated areas for protesting, like the Ramlila Maidan and Jantar Mantar. The court had said, “There is no problem if you come, protest and then go away. But this is going on for 11 days. Once you set a precedent, anyone will come and squat there. If this is permitted for all times to come, then you know what is the state of certain areas, like Ramlila ground and Jantar Mantar, where squatting and protests are permitted? We cannot have that kind of situation in a residential colony.”The Delhi high court expressed concern when they heard reports that the mayors will run their offices from the protest site. South corporation mayor, Anamika Mithilesh Singh told HT on Tuesday that additional commissioners and heads of the departments were called to the protest site to discuss pending municipal work. She said, “We had called the additional commissioners and heads of the departments to discuss pending work. We have given them instructions that the municipal work shouldn’t suffer due to our protest. Now onwards, the files will be brought here for clearance.”Mayors from Delhi’s municipal corporations and 22 BJP councillors have been protesting against the Delhi government since December 7 demanding release of Rs 13,000 crore to municipal corporations from the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-asks-police-to-shift-protesters-outside-cm-kejriwal-s-home-says-it-sends-a-wrong-message/story-cTcSvzhC76aE9S238naETJ.html

18-12-2020||Ranchi||NCW seeks report on ‘rape’ complaint against Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren||The national commission for women (NCW) has sought a detailed action taken report (ACT) from Maharashtra director general of police (DGP) in an alleged rape complaint filed against Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren in Mumbai in 2013. The case was reportedly withdrawn by the complainant within days of its filing. A press note from the commission issued on Thursday said, “It has come across a media report regarding a Mumbai-based model who alleged that she was not only raped by Hemant Soren and Suresh Nagre in 2013 but she and her family were also constantly threatened against speaking about the alleged incident in public.”NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma has asked the DGP to send the report at the earliest, the statement said. The commission noted that a viral letter, reportedly written by the victim, contained details of incidents that had occurred in the last seven years.The issue was first highlighted by BJP’s Godda parliamentarian Nishi Kant Dubey in July this year.Taking to Twitter between July 27 and 29, Dubey had highlighted the aforesaid case and alleged that Soren had then misused his chief minister’s office to settle the case.Dubey alleged that such an allegation against the chief minister was a shame on democracy. “Mumbai police should reinvestigate the matter,” Dubey had tweeted on July 28.Reacting to Dubey’s comment, Soren filed the aforesaid defamation suit in a Ranchi court on August 4 against Dubey seeking compensation of Rs 100 crore.Also Read: Jharkhand woman raped, three arrested: PoliceSoren, in his plaint, claimed that he had not entered into any settlement or compromise with the lady who had allegedly filed the complaint against him.“In fact, the plaintiff (Soren) was not aware of the purported complaint till the defendant (Dubey) tweeted and posted about the same,” Soren said in his complaint.He stated that he had instructed his lawyer in Mumbai to carry out a search of the court records. Due to limited functioning of the court in prevailing pandemic situation and religious holidays, the lawyer has not been able to provide any information to him, the chief minister said.In a latest move, Soren has also filed an injunction petition seeking court’s order to gag Dubey and his agents from posting any kind of tweets against him.The court has fixed December 21 to hear the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/ncw-seeks-report-on-rape-complaint-against-jharkhand-cm-hemant-soren/story-KUpQIlE1LKzkK9vji7SVkM.html

18-12-2020||Delhi||DDA starts work to revive 30 water bodies in its parks||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has started the work to rejuvenate 30 out of 50 water bodies in its parks. The land-owning agency has prepared a site-specific plan for these water bodies and work on close to 10 water bodies has already begun.There are 122 water bodies under DDA’s jurisdiction of which 50 are located under its horticulture department which is responsible for the maintenance of its district and regional parks and other green spaces.Rajeev Kumar Tiwari, principal commissioner (horticulture), DDA, said, “We have already prepared a detailed plan for the rejuvenation of 30 out of 50 water bodies under our horticulture department. We are trying to revive the water bodies by channelising stormwater from drains as per site conditions and also by using treated water.”Work is going on at Mehrauli Archaeological Park where the agency is reviving three water bodies spread over 6-7 acres using phytoremediation -- a bioremediation process.Also read | DDA to announce new housing scheme, offer 1,175 new flatsA senior DDA official said that the three water bodies are currently flooded with sewer water from the neighbouring residential areas. Using the phytoremediation process, contaminants, pollutants from the soil and water will be removed using various types of plants to remove, transfer, stabilise, and/or destroy contaminants in the soil and groundwater. “The work at the site started in July. It is a big project and will be completed by next year. Through this technology, we will naturally treat the sewer water in the water bodies,” said the official.DDA has completed the work at the Ashoka Park in New Friends Colony and at the water body at Sector 5 Dwarka.In some cases, Tiwari said, recharging the water body is not possible due to high subsoil infiltration rate. “So, we have decided to use it as a rainwater harvesting site by diverting storm water drains,” he said.At Smritivan in east Delhi’s Kondli, DDA officials said, the water body can’t be recharged due to the nature of soil. “We got the soil test done at the site. Due to the porous nature of the soil at the water body, it is difficult to recharge the water body. We have decided to use the site for rainwater harvesting. We will be creating infrastructure to divert stormwater drains in the neighbouring areas to this waterbody,” said the official.The 30 water bodies are located in Rohini, Pitampura, Dwarka, Hauz Khas, Mayur Vihar, Tughlaqabad, Dheerpur etc. To revive some of them, the DDA is planning to use treated water from Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs).Tiwari said that the DDA has prepared a site-specific plan for each water body, depending on its present condition, possibility of recharging it using water from nearby sources.“There are many water bodies which receive dirty water from nearby drains. We are trying to set up STPs to treat the water with a twin objective of irrigation to the park and ensuring good quality water in the waterbody. Effort is also being made to treat the water through phytoremediation methods wherever feasible,” said Tiwari.Environmentalist Diwan Singh, who has been working on reviving water bodies in the Capital, said, “It is good that they are now focusing on reviving the water bodies. But using treated water from STPs is not a good idea. The treated water is completely free of contaminants. If this is used, it will only contaminate the groundwater. Stormwater should be used for recharging the water bodies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-starts-work-to-revive-30-water-bodies-in-its-parks/story-9fnuFh5VkEdbOYscFtDV3L.html
18-12-2020||City||Criminal case can’t be quashed only on ground of compromise, rules Bombay high court||Observing that a criminal case cannot be quashed only on the ground of compromise between the parties, Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court last week refused to drop criminal proceeding against a gynaecologist from Nagpur for causing death of a woman soon after she had delivered twins through caesarean section.The division bench of justice VM Deshpande and justice Anil Kilor said the high court has very wide powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but they can be exercised only when there is gross abuse of process of law.However, the bench said, the court will not allow a joint plea from the parties merely because they pray for dropping the criminal case on the ground that they have reached a compromise.“Such parties must demonstrate that continuance of the proceedings is sheer abuse of process of law and it would be wasteful of the public time and money,” the bench said while rejecting joint petition filed by the gynaecologist Dr. Sangeeta Daf and complainant, Mahesh Jumade, who lost his wife, Swati, due to the former’s alleged negligence.On September 26, 2013, Jumade had approached Sakkardara police alleging that he lost his wife due to Dr Daf’s gross negligence. He said his pregnant wife had registered for delivery with Mother Care Hospital, run by Dr. Daf.On September 21, 2013, he said, his wife had gone for a regular check up at the hospital, when she was informed that an urgent ceasarean section will have to be performed and accordingly, she was operated upon the next morning and delivered twin daughters. The family was informed that the mother and children were fine. However, the family realised the woman was bleeding profusely. She was taken to another hospital, where she died the same day. The police then sought an opinion from the medical board of the Government Medical College at Nagpur. An offence for causing death by negligence was registered after the board gave its report, concluding that the wife of the complainant died due to “lack of reasonable care and monitoring” at Mother Care Hospital.The court noted that the report, at least prima facie, made it clear that Dr. Daf had failed to take reasonable care and monitor the condition of the woman after delivery.In this backdrop, HC refused to accept the joint claim of the doctor and the complainant that Swati’s death was “part of destiny,” something beyond human control. “In this case, we will not allow ourselves to accede to the prayer made, especially when there is a report by three expert doctors who unequivocally recorded a finding that there was no reasonable care and monitoring at the hands of the applicant No.1 (Dr. Daf) and that she was negligent,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/criminal-case-can-t-be-quashed-only-on-ground-of-compromise-rules-bombay-high-court/story-3CmArfJJU52TjcXwtuDkCL.html
18-12-2020||Lucknow||On road to 2022 polls, Yogi gives appointment letters, crunches jobs data||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath appears focused on keeping a count of the jobs his government has been able to create officially as he steps up efforts to give a further push to development works ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.Adityanath has also begun distributing appointment letters for various government posts to highlight creation of jobs in the state.As the opposition is bound to make ‘unemployment’ a big issue in the 2022 assembly elections in the state, as it did in Bihar, the UP government has organised programmes for distribution of appointment letters to government jobs. These programmes also include the chief minister’s interaction with the youth. He has chaired over distribution of about 60,000 to 70,000 appointment letters of assistant teachers and various other posts in the past few weeks and more such programmes are likely to be organised in the coming months.“Yes, this is very clear that the BJP and all other parties are now focusing on the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath obviously wants to draw focus on the welfare measures, the development works and the jobs being given by the state government. The chief minister is distributing appointment letters to ensure that the message about job creation is effectively conveyed,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of the department, political science, at Lucknow University.Major opposition parties, however, continue to target Yogi for what they call the state government’s ‘failure’ to create jobs.“This is for the first time that any chief minister is distributing appointment letters to the youth as if he is giving them personal jobs. Unemployment is rising and the youth are desperately looking for jobs. The state government has failed to give any jobs. Instead of giving jobs to the youth, the BJP will mislead the people with statistics about creation of jobs as the party has been doing so on other fronts,” said the leader of opposition in the UP assembly and senior Samajwadi Party leader, Ram Govind Chaudhary.Also Read: UP 2022 Assembly polls: AIMIM’s bid to expand starts turf war with Peace partyA government spokesman claimed that about 2,662,960 persons had got employment in the past eight months due to Adityanath’s efforts. 525,978 of these got jobs through the employment portal. He added that the One District, One Product (ODOP) scheme had proved to be a game changer for job creation.The spokesman credited Yogi Adityanath for effectively employing the government machinery to provide employment opportunities to migrant workers who returned from other states soon after a nationwide lockdown was clamped in the country in March to contain the spread of coronavirus disease.Also Read: Top UP BJP leaders drafted for ‘Mission Bengal’ with key responsibilities “An action plan was prepared.

18-12-2020||City||Three agri products from Varanasi likely to get GI tag soon||Three produces from Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, are likely to get a GI tag soon. A geographical indication, or GI, is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin. Ramnagar brinjal, Adamchini rice and Banarasi Langda mango, all from Varanasi, will get GI (Geographical Indication) tag that will help give a boost to export of these agri products. “Application to get GI tag for these three agri produces has already been filed by three farmers with the support of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. Human Welfare Association, a non government organisation, facilitated the application filing,” said GI expert Padma Shri Dr Rajnikant. While Ramnagar brinjal is famous across the region for its taste, Adamchini rice is famous for its essence and aroma. Banarasi Langda aam is a famous variety of mango. Next in line for a GI tag is Banarasi paan leaves and the process has already been started. Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) chairman Dr M Angamutham on Wednesday visited the fields of Ramnagar brinjal, locally known as Ramnagar’s Bhanta, and spoke to the farmers as part of APEDA’s plan to export these brinjals to foreign countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-agri-products-from-varanasi-likely-to-get-gi-tag-soon/story-9t45YN9fTTwgdjNN8DwJ3I.html
18-12-2020||Lucknow||UP 2022 Assembly polls: AIMIM’s bid to expand starts turf war with Peace party||Buoyed by its success in Bihar assembly elections, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) party has launched a campaign to strengthen its support base and organization in Uttar Pradesh after joining hands with the Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) for the 2022 assembly election in the state. However, the AIMIM move has triggered a slugfest with the Peace Party, led by Dr Mohammad Ayub. AIMIM state unit president Shaukat Ali is leading the campaign and has organised workers’ meetings in Bahraich, Sitapur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Shravasti, Siddharth Nagar and Basti districts. Speaking about AIMIM’s plans, Ali said, it has decided to contest the Zila Panchayat election to be held next year followed by the 2022 Assembly election. Along with membership drive, the party is strengthening its organisation at the grass roots level, he said. “We are working to establish an organisational structure from state level to booth level,” he said. AIMIM has decided to field candidates on 25% seats, particularly those in Muslim dominated areas, in 2022 Assembly election. It has called upon all ‘secular’ parties to join hands to stop the BJP from retaining power in the state polls. The party had fielded candidates on 38 seats in the 2017 Assembly election, however, it failed to open its account and polled just 0.24% votes. The AIMIM effort to expand in east and central UP has irked the Peace Party, which has influence among the weavers community in the east UP. A large number of Peace Party workers have joined the AIMIM.On Wednesday, Peace Party state unit president Abdul Mannan joined AIMIM in the presence of party chief Asaduddin Owaisi.In a series of tweets on Thursday, Mohammad Ayub attacked AIMIM and accused it of luring Peace Party cadre and alleged that it was hand-in-glove with the BJP.Also Read: Supreme Court rejects UP plea against Kafeel Khan’s release after detention under NSAAyub also called upon Muslims and his supporters not to be ‘taken for a ride’ by AIMIM. He alleged that AIMIM leaders have filed a fake case against him and the BJP government lodged him in jail. “The AIMIM is using the Muslim community for the sake of power and is not bothered about their welfare,” he said. In the 2012 Assembly election, the Peace Party had contested 208 seats and bagged four seats by polling 2.35% votes. However, in the 2017 assembly election, all the 68 candidates fielded by the lost and its vote percentage dropped to 0.26%. AIMIM leaders hit back at Ayub’s allegations and alleged that the Peace Party had not worked for the welfare of Muslims. “If Ayub is concerned about the upliftment of Muslims then he should join the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha launched by SBSP and AIMIM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-2022-assembly-polls-aimim-s-bid-to-expand-starts-turf-war-with-peace-party/story-I5MSh16MuirhHoHB3p7uRL.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: This one for the ‘Sharabi Kababi’||Attired in a Kanjeevaram silk sari, Madhur Jaffrey looks squarely at the potential buyer, her arms resting daintily on a chopping board. This was her first book’s cover, the year was 1973.An Invitation to Indian Cooking is Delhi’s most iconic cookbook. With 200 recipes, it introduced Delhi cuisine to the West. The New York Times called it “the best Indian cookbook available in English”.Every great city has books devoted to it but only a few help spread its fame across the world. No understanding of the Capital can be complete without leafing through this book, even if food writing isn’t your thing. Sadly, it’s rarely sighted in the city’s bookstores.“It’s a classic,” confirms author Pushpesh Pant, who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of Delhi cuisine. “Madhur belongs to an old Kayastha family in Civil Lines. Her love for food and Delhi, her elegance, her evocative writing, and her reputation as an actor in Merchant-Ivory films worked efficiently to introduce our city’s cuisine to the West.”An alumnus of Delhi University’s Miranda House, Ms Jaffrey left her hometown long ago for the UK, then to the US where she lives in New York, aged 87, enjoying renown as a food writer and actor.Published by Alfred A Knopf, Invitation was edited by the legendary Judith Jones, who worked on the books of culinary greats Julia Child, James Beard, M.F.K. Fisher, Marcella Hazan, Claudia Roden and Edna Lewis. In her book, Ms Jaffrey told readers that she would give them a “chance to understand and cook the food of one specific area — the region in and around Delhi”. She traces the origins of Delhi’s cuisine to the royal kitchens of the Red Fort, where the Persian meat and rice favoured by the Mughals was combined with Indian spices and vegetable dishes.Smattered with charming vignettes, the cookbook can be enjoyed for reading pleasure alone. The glossary consists of phrases as cute as “Dey Dal May Pani (put water in the lentils)”, “Quon Bhai Chai Hojai (Well now brother, how about tea?)” and “Sharabi Kababi (one who likes to eat and drink)”.Delhi’s cuisine, however, have grown vastly varied over the years, making the book more of a museum to what the city once was. “An ideal city cookbook should tell you not about the nihari of Karim’s,” warns Mr Pant, “but about the litti chokha of Gurugram’s Sector 23 Market, the chop of Mayapuri, and the Moradabad Biryani of Vasant Kunj. The perfect cookbook must be super-local.”True, and Ms Jafrrey’s cookbook made our city’s khana super-global.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-this-one-for-the-sharabi-kababi/story-sfYtyrOJHQiJwDCbesncAP.html
18-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC decision on Kanjurmarg plot unfortunate; courts intervene in anything these days: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut||A day after the Bombay high court (HC) stayed the transfer of land and Mumbai Metro car depot work at Kanjurmarg, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut termed the decision “unfortunate” and said that the courts enter into any issues nowadays. Without naming the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Sena chief spokesperson said that the Opposition had politicised the matter and the court should not enter it.“The Opposition has politicised this issue, and the court should not enter into these issues. The [Kanjurmarg] land belongs to Maharashtra; where did these saltpan workers come from? The courts intervene in anything these days. The upper court grants bail to a murder accused man, bypassing the lower court. The government is termed ‘illegal’ when it takes action against unauthorised constructions. We have never seen such a judicial system,” Raut said while addressing media persons in Mumbai.The Sena leader added that the Mumbai Metro-3 project is for the good of the people, and pointed out that politicians are not going to build bungalows and farmhouses on the Kanjurmarg plot. “No politician is going to construct their bungalow or farmhouse on the Kanjurmarg land. This is a matter of development of Mumbai, Maharashtra and eventually of the country. It is unfortunate that such a decision has come in this case,” the Rajya Sabha member said.The BJP-led Central government and the Sena-led state government are locked in a tussle over the relocation of the Metro-3 car depot to Kanjurmarg. The previous state government led by the BJP had planned it at Aarey Milk Colony in Goregaon, which was opposed by environmentalists. On taking charge as chief minister (CM), Uddhav Thackeray last year stayed work on the depot at Aarey and appointed a panel to suggest possible alternative sites for the depot.“People now have doubts in their minds whether such decisions [on the car shed project] are coming because there is no BJP government in Maharashtra,” Raut alleged.He claimed that the former Devendra Fadnavis-led government wanted to construct homes for police and weaker sections on the Kanjurmarg plot. “That means the land belongs to the [state] government, doesn’t it?” he asked. “It seems there is some conspiracy to see that the Maharashtra government is not allowed to carry out work in the interest of the people or development,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-decision-on-kanjurmarg-plot-unfortunate-courts-intervene-in-anything-these-days-shiv-sena-mp-sanjay-raut/story-YqltRGhOe7ODEvznAUfhHO.html

The train services will be operated from Monday to Saturday.Passengers who travelled on the first day of operations stated that increasing frequency of AC local trains, operating a higher number of AC locals during peak hours and allowing them to ply on the fast railway lines would be helpful.“This is the first time I am travelling by the AC local train and I’m excited. I will definitely upgrade my first-class railway pass to an AC train pass. However, the train frequency should be increased. Once that is done, more passengers will prefer AC local train services,” said Manisha Deshpande, who commuted from CSMT to Kalyan.Sudip Kumar, who travels daily between CSMT and Kanjurmarg railway station, stated that trains should be introduced during peak hours and their frequency needs to be increased. “It is a comfortable journey and it will definitely benefit the mainline commuters. The train has only 10 services a day which can be a problem. More services should be introduced during peak hours,” he said.Few passengers also stated that operations of trains on the fast railway line will help in saving time. “I have been travelling for 20 years on CR and I’m very happy that finally, the AC train has arrived. We were waiting for the train to begin operations on the mainline. Railways should consider operating the AC train on the fast line as well,” said Laxman Gauge, who used the AC train to travel from CSMT to Kalyan.Presently, local train services are operational only for people working in essential services, specially-abled and cancer patients. Women commuters and lawyers are also allowed to commute during a stipulated period.The fare of the AC local train is 1.3 times higher than that of normal local trains. A one-way ticket to travel from CSMT to Dadar costs ₹65; CSMT to Kurla costs ₹125; CSMT to Thane costs ₹180 and the fare to Kalyan costs ₹210.CR operated its first AC local train on the trans-harbour route between Thane-Vashi and Panvel railway stations on January 30, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-22-passengers-for-mumbai-s-csmt-kalyan-ac-local-on-first-day-of-operations/story-4kebFN5ZbZ3nEeAn5AYTFN.html
18-12-2020||Mumbai||Scrap circular on appointing Class 4 staff on contract: Teachers’ associations in Maharashtra||Teachers’ associations across Maharashtra have urged the state education department to take back its recent decision to allow appointments to Class-4 posts only on a contractual basis in government and aided schools across the state. On Wednesday, Shikshak Parishad, an association of teachers and non-teaching staff protested outside the office of the deputy director, demanding a roll-back of the circular issued on December 11. “The circular is paving the way for privatisation in recruitments across schools in the state. Several vacant posts in schools will now be filled only on contract with a very low salary, and it is impossible for peons, cleaning staff, etc, to work on such low wages. We want the government to take back the circular,” said Shivnath Darade, secretary of Shikshak Parishad. Officials from the education department did not respond to calls and messages. The circular issued by the education department on December 11 stated that once the current staffers on Class-4 posts retire, new appointments should be made by the school on a contractual basis. Employees under Class 4 include peons, cleaning staff, security guards, laboratory attendants, etc. While appointments to these posts were conducted by the government till now, henceforth schools will have to complete them at their level and the appointed staff will only be a contractual employee of the school instead of being the permanent staff of the government like it was earlier. The government will give a fixed allowance to schools for every vacant post, depending on the school’s location and the cost structure drawn out by the government. For cities like Mumbai and Pune, the allowance will be ₹10,000 per month for each post, and in schools across other corporations, it will be ₹7,500 per month. For schools in rural areas, a monthly allowance of ₹5,000 has been set. On December 14, Shikshak Bharati, another teachers group, protested across the state against the decision. “The decision is against the rules for appointment of staff in schools in the state, and thus needs to be scrapped,” read a statement issued by the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/scrap-circular-on-appointing-class-4-staff-on-contract-teachers-associations-in-maharashtra/story-6J0p1u8L5qWb1wAGKFz4JN.html
18-12-2020||Mumbai||Kanjurmarg land transfer bordered on fraud on power: Bombay HC on Mumbai Metro car shed issue||The Bombay high court (HC) has termed the manner in which the collector of the Mumbai suburban district transferred 102 acres of saltpan land at Kanjurmarg to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for the Metro car shed an act that “bordered on committing fraud on power”. The bench on Wednesday stayed the collector’s order and restrained the MMRDA from carrying out any further work at the site. “The collector’s action of passing the October 1, 2020 order, in the manner he did, does border on committing a ‘fraud on power’,” the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni said in its reasoned order, which became available on Thursday. In the order, the HC stated that the decision-making process leading to the October 1 order did not pass the test of judicial scrutiny. “We are conscious of the element of public interest involved in setting up of the Metro car shed on the subject land; at the same time, we cannot remain oblivious if a person is divested of its/his right in property without the authority of law,” said the bench. The bench said the collector’s order had dispossessed parties interested in the saltpan land “not by procedure known to law, but by an executive fiat”. The judges noted that the collector had treated the land as state property and transferred its possession to the MMRDA by referring to certain notifications and resolutions, without giving any opportunity either to the Central government or to Maheshkumar Garodia, who claims to be the salt department’s licensee. The HC found the action completely contrary to record, especially the communications and orders of various state officials clearly admitting the Central government’s ownership over the saltpan. In this regard, the bench has referred to an adjudicatory order passed by an officer on special duty of the state government on September 30, 1996, declaring the saltpan land belonged to the central salt department, and letters written by the metropolitan commissioner and additional chief secretary of the urban development department, as recently as on March 28, 2019 and December 4, 2019 respectively, to the ministry of commerce and industry requesting them to allot the saltpan land for the Metro car shed. “In a society where ‘Rule of Law’ has primacy, the minimum that we expect of a responsible office as the collector is to adopt a fair, reasonable and impartial approach,” the bench said. “That is unfortunately lacking in the present case.” The judges said the state could not have utilised the subject land for any public purpose conceived by it, especially when an application filed by the state government, seeking the court’s permission for utilising the saltpan land for Metro car shed was pending adjudication. In the order, the bench also criticised the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “It seems that there has been a change in policy with a change in the ruling dispensation in the state,” said the bench, without referring to the fact that the MVA government shifted the Metro car depot from Aarey Colony, a site selected by the earlier Devendra Fadnavis government, to Kanjurmarg. “While changes can be effected keeping in mind what the larger public interest warrants, extraneous considerations ought not to outweigh all other considerations of propriety, legality and fairness in administrative actions,” said HC. “We are waiting for a written order of the high court. It will be improper to comment on oral observations. We will take a further decision, accordingly,” said chief secretary Sanjay Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kanjurmarg-land-transfer-bordered-on-fraud-on-power-bombay-hc-on-mumbai-metro-car-shed-issue/story-wmZXJLhfufr5GR69Oz2YRO.html
18-12-2020||Mumbai||After Bombay HC stay on transfer of Kanjurmarg land, MVA government may consider Metro shed at bullet train plot in BKC||A day after the Bombay High Court (HC) ordered an interim stay on the transfer of a 102-acre land in Kanjurmarg to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for an integrated Metro car shed, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is looking at other options, including using the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), where a terminus for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train has been proposed. The on-going tussle between the Central and state government could take an uglier turn if the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government goes ahead with the BKC plot. Officials said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday asked the officials concerned to relook at all records related to the project. “The chief minister has asked for all records again. He is likely to announce the next step himself,” said an official. Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar confirmed they were considering BKC as one of the options for Metro car shed. “The Kanjurmarg plot, where the car shed is being planned, is entangled in a legal process, which will take time. Hence, it has been proposed to examine the technical feasibility of the BKC plot. Based on the findings of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL), the state government will take the further decision,” Kumar said. While the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government had handed over a plot in BKC to the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRC), which is implementing the bullet train project, the MVA government has been non-committal on the project since it came to power. Earlier, Thackeray had also questioned if the bullet train is of any benefit to Maharashtra. The government has not made it clear if it is the plot earmarked for the bullet train’s Mumbai terminus. The option was also considered earlier, but dropped by the then government considering the commercial value of the area. BJP leader Pravin Darekar on Thursday said, “Just because it is the bullet train project, the government should not meddle with it. It is time to bring all stakeholders together and complete the project on time.” Wednesday’s order resulted in a political slugfest between the ruling parties and the BJP, with the latter stating that the state took the decision of transferring the car shed from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg only to satisfy its ego. The state has claimed that the salt department has not been able to prove its ownership of the plot. A senior official from the state government said, “A 2018 order by the then BJP revenue minister clearly states that saltpan lands belong to the state government. The transfer order by the suburban collector also quotes this order.” Suburban collector Milind Borikar on Thursday, however, said he was still waiting for the detailed court order to comment on the next step. State transport minister Anil Parab said, “The state will consult the legal department and look at the detailed order before deciding the course of action.” Meanwhile, many citizens and transport experts have expressed their dissatisfaction over the delay in the project, especially Metro-3, which was to be made operational by December 2021. Paresh Rawal, a transport expert, said, “Even if the land [at Kanjurmarg] was available and litigation-free, still it doesn’t make any sense to shift the Metro terminal to any location other than what was planned and executed.” In what could worsen the ongoing state-Centre tussle, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is looking at using a plot at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), where a terminus for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train has been proposed, for the Metro car shed. The move comes a day after the Bombay High Court (HC) ordered an interim stay on the transfer of a 102-acre land in Kanjurmarg to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for the shed.Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar confirmed they were considering the BKC plot for bullet train as one of the options for Metro car shed. “The Kanjurmarg plot, where the car shed is being planned, is entangled in a legal process, which will take time.

The budget carrier’s flight was scheduled as a cargo flight. However, it booked passengers and operated both the flights as commercial ones.Sources from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said the flight had reached Port Blair but was denied permission to land on both the days, after which the flight had to return mid-air. HT has access to documents which reveal that the budget carrier is permitted to operate only cargo flights on Tuesday and Wednesday between Chennai and Port Blair airports until March 24, 2021. “The flight schedule implies that the airline in this case had to operate as cargo flights for December 15 and 16. However, on both these dates, the flight was sold as a passenger flight and hence it was denied permission to land at Port Blair,” said a source from Chennai airport.Arun Kumar, director general of Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), said the regulatory agency is investigating the matter. A GoAir spokesperson confirmed the development, but did not reveal the details. “GoAir flight G81305 from Chennai to Port Blair made an air turn back/diversion due to operational reasons and landed in Chennai with 160 passengers on board. GoAir has taken utmost care and rendered all the requisite assistance to the passengers. The airline sincerely regrets the inconvenience caused to the passengers,” said the spokesperson.Upset with the diversions, passengers took to complaint about the situation. “@goairlinesindia http://GoAir.in flight #G8 1305 from Chennai to Port Blair couldn’t get permission to land at Port Blair due to any reasons. Passengers are stuck at Chennai Airport Runway. Please help (sic),” read a tweet by Chirag Tamakuwala, a flier who had to land back in Chennai owing to the violation.Another passenger, Viral Patel, a businessman from Gujarat, tweeted on Wednesday, “@goairlinesindia WHAT you did to us yesterday IS PATHETIC while going from Chennai to Port Blair.

18-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai NCB slaps notice to Karan Johar asking him to explain 2019 party’s video||The Mumbai office of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has sent a notice to director-producer Karan Johar in connection with a video of a 2019 party organised by him which had gone viral.A senior NCB officer confirmed the development and said that on Wednesday the notice was served to Johar and he has to respond to it by Friday. He need not have to physically come to NCB office and can send his say through someone.NCB in September had received a complaint from Siromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa demanding a probe into the matter, claiming celebrities used drugs at the said party. The central office then forwarded the complaint to its Mumbai zonal unit for further action.“To check the veracity of the video, the notice has been sent to Johar. We have not summoned anyone,” the NCB officer said. HT tried contacting Johar, but he was unavailable for a comment. Text messages sent to his manager went unanswered till the time of going to print.SAD national spokesperson Sirsa had filed a complaint with the NCB chief Rakesh Asthana in the alleged drug party organised at Johar’s house which was attended by several top Bollywood actors. Sirsa on September 25 had also tweeted that the NCB could soon send summons to Johar in the drug-related case. However, NCB never summoned Johar.NCB is already investigating the Bollywood-drug nexus case, after a drug angle surfaced in the investigation linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-ncb-slaps-notice-to-karan-johar-asking-him-to-explain-2019-party-s-video/story-axyiDLm0zE2q2Lh6uJymdP.html
18-12-2020||Mumbai||Avoid tweets on matters that are being heard by court: Bombay HC to Thane resident booked for commenting against CM||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed Thane resident Sunaina Holey, booked for making objectionable tweets and comments against chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and his minister son Aaditya, to refrain from using Twitter over matters that are being heard in the court against her. HC also directed Mumbai, Palghar and Tulinj police to not take any coercive action or file a charge sheet against Holey. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik was hearing Holey’s petition seeking the quashing of the first information report (FIR) against her over her comments on the gathering of people outside Bandra station during the lockdown. Her lawyer Dr Abhinav Chandrachud referred to two judgments of the Supreme Court. One was pertaining to a comment made by a person following the assassination of former prime minister Indira Gandhi and the other in which a Kashmir resident had tried to allegedly instigate citizens of Andhra Pradesh against the Indian Army. Dr Chandrachud submitted that in both cases the Apex court had observed that the comments did not result in any actual disorder and disruption. In light of these submissions, Dr Chandrachud said that Holey’s comments also should be dealt in a similar manner and concluded his arguments.Special counsel for the state Manoj Mohite submitted that he would require an hour to argue against the submissions made by Dr Chandrachud and would do so on December 21. The court allowed the request.Thereafter, Dr Chandrachud requested the bench to direct the police to not take any coercive steps against Holey. Additional public prosecutor JP Yagnik, on the instructions from the three investigating officers from each of the police stations, assured the court that no action would be taken nor would they file a charge sheet against Holey. The officers, however, requested the court to direct Holey to refrain from making any more inflammatory tweets till the petitions were decided. Dr Chandrachud opposed the request and said that it would amount to curtailing his client’s right to freedom of speech. However, he said that he would ask Holey to refrain from making tweets about the court as it was unacceptable.After hearing both sides and perusing the tweets posted by Holey since the court started hearing her petitions, the bench asked Dr Chandrachud to advice his client to refrain from posting comments on the three petitions and also directed the police from taking any coercive action against Holey in the cases till January 12, 2021. The matter is posted for hearing on December 21 at 4.30pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/avoid-tweets-on-matters-that-are-being-heard-by-court-bombay-hc-to-thane-resident-booked-for-commenting-against-cm/story-eCbyRLFEOhR3VKj72w5blM.html

Instead, Indore, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Vadodara and Kolkata will be hosting various domestic teams for the tournament.A few days ago, the secretary of Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) Jay Shah and BCCI treasurer Arun Dhumal had visited Chandigarh and Mullanpur grounds hinting that the Punjab Cricket Association and the UT Cricket Association could jointly host the T20 tournament in January.It has been learnt that due to winter conditions, the northern venues have been exempted from hosting any BCCI matches. Chandigarh, Punjab and Uttarakhand had shown interest in hosting the T20 tournament matches, offering a secure bio-bubble environment. However, due to extreme cold weather and foggy conditions in the month of January, northern state units have been ruled out.The 38 teams have been divided into five elite groups, A, B, C, D and E. The eight new state teams like Chandigarh, Bihar and outfits from the Northeast will be a part of the plate group. Punjab will travel to Bangalore for their matches.UTCA constitutes committeeUTCA president Sanjay Tandon constituted a three-member cricket advisory committee (CAC) which will be responsible for the appointment of support staff as well as equally vital in the selection of players for the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament.Selectors will be directly reporting to the committee which includes former Ranji cricketers Rakesh Jolly, Sharanjit Singh and Daniel Banerjee. Last season, former Indian fast bowler VRV Singh was appointed as head coach of Chandigarh senior men’s team that played Ranji Trophy, Vijay Hazare Trophy and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.

18-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Santacruz-Chembur Link Road extension delayed by 2 years, to cost ₹109 crore more||The under-construction extension to the Santacruz-Chembur Link Road (SCLR) between Kurla and Vakola has been delayed by two years with an increase in cost of ₹109 crore. The extension from Kapadia Nagar on CST Road near Kurla till the Western Express Highway (WEH) near Vakola was expected to be completed by 2020. The work is now expected to be completed by March 2022.According to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which approved the increase in cost in October, the escalation is owing to additional works being undertaken by the contractor, which include relocation of service lines, construction of a retaining wall, widening of the bridge over Mithi river and increasing the length of a span that would be affected owing to the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project.The works were originally awarded to J Kumar Infraprojects Ltd at ₹449 crore in 2016, with an aim to complete the project in 36 months. Owing to increasing bottlenecks at Kurla, the extension was proposed to enable quicker east-west connectivity via SCLR. According to MMRDA, around 55% of the civil construction has been completed as of October 2020. “MMRDA will receive funds to the tune of ₹87 crore from the Mumbai municipal corporation and the National High-Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRCL), to complete the works affected by the proposed bullet train and works along the Mithi river,” read the minutes of the meeting at which the proposal was passed.NHSRCL is implementing the high-speed bullet corridor between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Additionally, MMRDA had approved cost variation of more than ₹100 crore for two packages along the Metro-7 (Dahisar East-Andheri East) corridor. Apart from this, it had also awarded the incomplete Mandale depot works (for Metro-2B) at 14% above the estimated cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumabi-s-santacruz-chembur-link-road-extension-delayed-by-2-years-to-cost-109-crore-more/story-k2mOOQ9BSmUaJCZghsTIKI.html
18-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra reports fewer than 5,000 new Covid-19 cases for 13 consecutive days||Maharashtra recorded fewer than 5,000 new Covid-19 cases for a 13th consecutive day on Thursday as the state’s tally of infections rose by 3,880 to 1,884,773. The state also reported 65 fatalities, taking its toll to 48,499. Of the 65 deaths, 45 were from the past 48 hours, 10 from last week and 10 from the period of before last week. The state’s active caseload stands at 60,905, which is 3.23% of the total infections.Data of the past two months, released by the state health department, revealed that there is improvement in the average daily cases in the state. For the first 17 days of this month, the average daily cases that Maharashtra has recorded are 4,313. During the corresponding period in November, the state had reported 4,377 cases, while in October the figure stood at 11,942.“We are hoping for further improvement in the coming days, but because of the winter season we are concerned of a surge in January. We will have to be careful so that daily cases do not rise,” said a senior health official.Health officials are wary that the downward trend of cases may change and the state could witness a second wave in January. Authorities have been urging people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to avoid a surge in cases. Meanwhile, state health minister Rajesh Tope said the state is planning to initially administer Covid-19 vaccine to around three crore people. “Our micro planning is complete and we are ready to start Covid-19 vaccination drive in the state. We are waiting for the Centre’s approval to authorise administration of the vaccine to people,” Tope said.HT was the first to report on December 13 that the state is planning to administer Covid-19 vaccine to around 3.25 crore people.Tope said health workers, frontline workers (police and fire brigade personnel, conservancy staff, etc) and citizens above the age of 50 and those having co-morbidities will be given the Covid shots first. “Each person will have to register on a designated website to get the shot. They will be sent a text message with the date and vaccination booth details. The vaccinator will administer the shot and the person concerned will be kept under observation for at least half an hour to see if there are any complications,” said Tope. “We will be demanding that the Centre make the vaccination free for all citizens. If they [Centre] decide to charge people, we [state government] may consider making it free.”The state government on Thursday also announced to provide reimbursement against expenses for Covid-19 treatment to all government employees, officials and their family members. The decision will be implemented with retrospective effect from September 2, when the state decided to increase the number of employees in the offices, the health minister said.Currently, government employees get reimbursement against expenses for accidents and 27 serious illnesses, which will now also include Covid-19, said Tope.Mumbai, meanwhile, on Thursday reported 586 Covid-19 cases, highest in the state, taking the city’s case count to 284,990. Of these, 7,024 are active cases. The city also reported 10 deaths, pushing up its toll to 11,013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-reports-fewer-than-5-000-new-covid-19-cases-for-13-consecutive-days/story-SnzOOeyNZ2BD8z9xMniIdN.html
18-12-2020||City||Local SAD leaders upset over constitution of ‘biased’ screening committee for Mohali MC elections||Strong resentment prevailed over most of the former councillors of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) over the appointment of five members of the screening committee for the selection of candidates for the upcoming municipal corporation (MC) in Mohali likely scheduled in February next year. The elections will be held for 50 wards.The former councillors said they didn’t accept the committee and were ready to contest the elections independently.Recently, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal appointed a five-member committee including former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra, political adviser to SAD president Charanjeet Singh Brar, Dera Bassi MLA NK Sharma, former mayor Kulwant Singh, president of SAD (urban), Mohali, Kawaljit Singh Ruby.Badal has also appointed Chandumajra and Brar as observers of Mohali district for the civic body elections.Parvinder Singh Sohana, president of Youth Akali Dal, Mohali, said, “We will not accept Charanjeet Singh Brar as a member of the committee.”Former senior vice-president of SAD (Mohali), Gurmeet Singh Ahluwalia, said, “We don’t accept this committee at all. We will only contest elections under the leadership of former mayor Kulwant Singh or we are ready to contest elections independently.”Another former SAD councillor, RP Sharma, said, “It is a totally biased committee and we don’t accept it. Most of the councillors of SAD are not happy with the members and are ready to contest independently.”When contacted, president of SAD (urban), Mohali, Kawaljit Singh Ruby, and committee member said, “The committee has been appointed by the party high command and we have to follow the instructions. We will hold a meeting with all the councillors and if there is any grievance, will sort it out. Our main aim is to win the elections.”A four-cornered battle will be fought between the AAP, Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Congress and the BJP. The splinter Akali group floated by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa has opted out of the Mohali MC elections and will support Aam Aadmi Party candidates and independents.In the 2015 elections, 27 councillors including 10 from the Azad group, 14 from Congress and two independent councillors elected Kulwant Singh as the mayor, but later in August 2017, he joined SAD.Among the voters, around 25,000 belong to the Scheduled Caste (SC) category: five seats have been reserved for SC candidates. There are 43 general category seats, of which 23 are reserved for women and 20 for men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/local-sad-leaders-upset-over-constitution-of-biased-screening-committee-for-mohali-mc-elections/story-MeY0HG9extvRAf65bEJLqJ.html
18-12-2020||City||33-year-old murdered, body chopped, dumped along railway tracks at Matheran||A 33-year-old man from Worli was allegedly killed by his 55-year-old friend from Neral on Wednesday after the two got into an argument about the accused’s wife. After killing him, the accused chopped up his body and dumped the pieces along the railway tracks at Matheran in three plastic bags. Neral police have arrested the husband and wife under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. According to the police, the victim, Sushil Kumar Sarnaik, a senior relationship manager at a private sector bank, was friends with the accused Charles Nadar and his 27-year-old wife, both residents of Neral. “On Wednesday, Sarnaik visited the Nadars at their home, and they drank alcohol. While drinking, Sarnaik said something objectionable about Nadar’s wife which led to a heated argument between the two. Nadar then attacked Sarnaik with a knife and stabbed him multiple times, killing him,” said KN Sangle, sub-inspector of Neral police station.“Nadar then chopped up his body, put the pieces in three plastic bags and dumped them along the railway tracks behind their house. Some people spotted the bags and informed us,” Sangle said.During the investigation, police discovered CCTV footage showing that Nadar had purchased the bags on Wednesday from a local shop. “We then interrogated Nadar and his wife, and they narrated the entire incident. We arrested both of them on Thursday,” the officer said. The couple was produced before the court and were remanded in police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/33-year-old-murdered-body-chopped-dumped-along-railway-tracks-at-matheran/story-wilKXlCa3YcmxZaNMvX2eN.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Central Vista green approval: Consolidated plan submitted||Criticised by the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee (EAC) for what it termed a piecemeal approach to seeking approvals, the Central Public Works Department has submitted a single proposal for all the buildings under the Central Vista project that will require environmental clearance, although there is no mention of the Prime Minister’s office, which was there in the previous proposal. In the new proposal, total built-up area has been reduced from 18,37,057 sq.m to 17,21, 500 sq.m, and the cost of the redevelopment project has increased by Rs 1656 crore, from Rs11,794 to Rs 13,450 crore.CPWD’s earlier application to amend the terms of reference (TOR) for the project to add several new components of construction was rejected by EAC because CPWD was seeking clearances in a piecemeal manner.EAC observed in the minutes of its meeting published on November 25 that CPWD should refrain from the piecemeal approach for the proposed development and redevelopment of the projects under Central Vista. The TOR is essentially the scope of the project. The grant of TOR is the initial clearance needed for any development project.But independent experts have pointed out that the new proposal which was discussed by EAC on Wednesday for grant of TOR continues to be piecemeal and lacks transparency.Union affairs minister Hardeep Puri, in charge of CPWD, did not respond for comment.Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research, said: “The application has once again just been pieced together in a shallow and casual manner. There is no explanation on why some parts like the Prime Minister’s Office have been removed, whether there will be a separate application and why the costs of the project have gone up.”CPWD officials didn’t comment on why the PM’s office complex is not mentioned in the revised proposal. “The matter came to us today and it was discussed but the decision will be finalised and released in the minutes,” said T Haque, chairman of the EAC The new Parliament building, which has already been granted environmental clearance (this is being challenged in the Supreme Court), the New India garden, the underground transit, the PM’s office were all part of the central vista redevelopment project.Experts say that none of this is reflected in the revised proposal submitted by the CPWD. Anuj Srivastava, spokesperson of LokPATH, (People for Appropriate Transformation of Habitat), a collective of urban development experts and civil society members, said: “Why are they in a rush? Instead of deliberating and discussing this plan in detail, the government is hurriedly getting approval. Our main objection is to their piecemeal approach. There is no transparency in the way the project is being executed.”Urban planners, environmental researchers and activists said CPWD had already tweaked its Central Vista proposal several times.In November, CPWD submitted a conceptual plan for redeveloping the common central secretariat buildings and central conference centre along with the Prime Minister’s office and residence, a Special Protection Group building and the Vice-President’s enclave. The amendment application was made only a day after the environment ministry granted the TOR based on CPWD’s initial proposal to redevelop only the common central secretariat and central conference centre.In its latest proposal, CPWD said the total built-up area will be 17,21,500 sq m and area to be demolished 4,58,820 sq m and that the project is coming up over a total plot area admeasuring 5,48,776 sq m.Experts said the demolition itself will have a massive impact on air quality and public health. “Even from this partial disclosure and information available through media reports it is evident that the project will involve massive demolition and digging activity including that for the underground transit and basements. The application does not even consider it necessary to disclose whether alternatives have been examined, which is a mandatory requirement. Does this mean that there is no other way around uprooting hundreds of trees, diverting already scarce water resources for construction and curtailment of public space to accommodate central government office infrastructure? At present there are no studies to show if this has even been considered,” said Kohli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/central-vista-green-approval-consolidated-plan-submitted/story-atIQuupWAHJhhm8dUbe3FI.html
18-12-2020||City||Maharashtra may bring its own farm legislation; officials to study laws of 3 states||The state is considering to enact its own legislation to “safeguard the interest” of the farmers “concerned” over the laws brought by the Centre. The group of ministers formed to deliberate the clauses of the Centre’s laws have asked state officials to study the legislations enacted by Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh recently and submit a framework of its own law.Headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, the 10-member cabinet sub-committee was constituted to look into concerns and questions raised by various farmer groups against the three farm legislations that have witnessed protests after many political parties and farmers’ organisations have opposed their implementation. Farmers have claimed that they are concerned that the central laws would deprive them of the minimum support price (MSP).To negate the impact of the Centre’s laws, the three Congress states of Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have recently passed their own laws. “Following the three laws brought by the Centre, Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have passed their own laws. The committee today directed the officials to study their laws, identify their pros and cons, see what is there in the existing laws of Maharashtra and submit their detailed report to us,” said food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who is also a member of the cabinet sub-committee.He said the state can bring a separate law but a decision can be taken only after getting a report from the officials.State agriculture department, marketing department and food and civil supplies department will study the laws of other states, officials said.Another member of the sub-committee, state public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan, in his letter to Pawar said the process to bring amended laws on the lines of Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh must start. “Punjab has restricted the limit for storing agriculture produce to ensure a curb on illegal hoarding. It has ensured MSP for agriculture produce and also allowed farmers to approach civil court against cheating. Rajasthan has made a provision of seven-year imprisonment along with a fine of ₹5 lakh against cheating, while Chhattisgarh has made several changes in its agricultural produce market committee (APMC) to facilitate electronic trading platform for transparent auction and online payments for the farmers,” stated the letter.Officials, in the meeting, suggested that the Centre has proposed several amendments in the laws and thus, the state should wait for the results of the negotiations to ascertain its next step. “The Centre has proposed three major changes and assured to provide powers to the states for making legislations: levying market fee for transactions outside market yard; ascertaining eligibility criteria of the buyer, as earlier anyone having a pan card was allowed to buy the produce; and allowing farmers to approach civil court against disputes. Thus, we suggested that let there be a vital decision on this first, so that we can get a clear idea on which way our legislation has to head. In case if we initiate the legislation which is not conducive to the Union laws, then there is a possibility that the Presidential assent will not be given,” said a senior official. “We have also brought to their notice that Punjab and Rajasthan laws talk only about wheat and paddy, while the Chhattisgarh laws talk only about paddy. In the case of Maharashtra, the scenario is totally different. We have major crops which are not food crops which are linked with international markets, such as cotton and soya bean. Also, a large number of our farmers are involved in growing vegetables and perishable fruits, which are not covered under MSP. Hence, our requirement and ecosystem is different from other states,” said another official. Anoop Kumar, principal secretary, state marketing department, said, “We are going to take up the exercise and will also study the consequences of the ongoing negotiations between the Centre and farmers organisations so that we can submit our recommendations to the empowered group of ministers.”All the three ruling parties in Maharashtra — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — have supported the farmers’ demand to repeal the laws. It has also stayed its notification (issued on August 10) for the implementation of the three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-may-bring-its-own-farm-legislation-officials-to-study-laws-of-3-states/story-oB0obWaouTmWHJ6yAro8rN.html
18-12-2020||Mumbai||52.4% fewer Covid deaths in Mumbai in a month: BMC data||The city registered a 52.4% drop in Covid-19 deaths in a month, from 888 between October 19 and November 17 to 423 between November 18 and December 16, according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). This was despite Mumbai seeing only a marginal drop (0.1%) in cases, 154,900 to 144,852, in the same period, HT’s data showed.Doctors have attributed the fall in deaths to the growing awareness among people, leading to early diagnosis and treatment. “Earlier, due to lack of awareness, symptomatic patients would often take flu-related medicines over the counter, which delayed their treatment, dimming their chances of survival. Most of the major hospitals would get severely ill Covid-19 patients. Now, since the past two months, the situation has improved,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “People are consulting doctors earlier, which has helped to provide them treatment on time, without delays,” he added.As known, those above 60 years are considered as the most vulnerable due to their underlying comorbid health issues. Data showed that the deaths in this group have decreased by almost 51% in the same period. Between October 19 and November 17, 651 people in the group succumbed to the infection. However, the number plunged to 317 between November 18 and December 16. Doctors believe that due to the restrictions on movement of senior citizens outside, the overall infection rate among them has decreased. “We have seen that elderly people are more responsible than younger in maintaining all precautionary measures. They regularly wear masks and avoid going out, especially those who have comorbidities,” said Dr Om Srivastava, an epidemiologist who is part of the state’s Covid-19 task force. In the city, till December 16, 11,003 of the 284,404 patients who were diagnosed with Covid-19 have succumbed to the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/52-4-fewer-covid-deaths-in-mumbai-in-a-month-bmc-data/story-UBFEqejV7B8KKg9tqvBPNJ.html

Around 400 students joined the conference virtually.Director of the National Institute of Immunology (NII), professor Amulya K Panda, talked about the challenges in the development of a vaccine and illustrated the major hurdles in its development.Professor R Vardarajan of the molecular biophysics unit, IISC, Bangalore, said the vaccines didn’t elicit a memory response, which could be a hurdle in providing immunity.Professor MRN Murthy of the AstraZeneca chair, Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology (IBAB), Bangalore, gave a talk on the structural biology of coronaviruses and how SARS-Cov-2 was evolving at a drastic fast rate and the transmission rate was relatively faster than other viruses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-in-focus-as-chandigarh-science-congress-begins/story-sWOjeQkhLTWm6Zok9XDsZL.html
18-12-2020||Mumbai||Active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai lowest since May 31, when BMC began maintaining data||The number of active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai is lowest since May 31, when the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started collating data of active infections. The city’s active caseload has dropped to 7,024 with the number of new infections witnessing a dip in the past few weeks. Active cases are the total number of patients who are currently receiving treatment in hospitals and Covid care centres or are home quarantined. The civic body began maintaining record of active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai when the tally was 19,745 on May 31. The active cases count peaked to 34,136 on September 18, the highest so far in the city since the outbreak of coronavirus in March. Mumbai, till October, had the most active infections in the state. However, the situation has improved for the city, while Pune (16,865) and Thane (10,897) continue to have high active Covid-19 caseload.Health experts said the drop in active cases is also because of a better recovery rate in Mumbai. “The city’s recovery rate is 93%, which is better in comparison with several other cities in India. Also, mobility has increased and the transmission of virus has gone down. This is a good sign for the city, but this has to be maintained till the end of December,” said Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health expert.Civic officials said despite the drop in fresh infections and active cases, they will not compromise on Covid preparations and citizens will have to follow all protocols. “Till December 20, we will keep the same level of preparedness – maintain the same level of oxygen supply, bed capacity, medicines and medical staff. We have a festive season coming and people will step out of their homes. The city needs to be prepared for any type of surge in cases in the future. Discussions on night curfew will be held by December 20 and a final decision will be taken on it,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/active-covid-19-cases-in-mumbai-lowest-since-may-31-when-bmc-began-maintaining-data/story-spZFt6eyJ59AJjE5uZqpdO.html
18-12-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Engineering College mulls over establishing centre for data science||In a first, the Punjab Engineering College (PEC) is mulling to establish a centre of excellence in data science at the institution.The proposal for the centre was discussed at the meeting of PEC’s board of governors (BoG) on Thursday; it has already been approved by the PEC senate.A member of the board on the condition of anonymity said, “The proposal has been principally accepted by the board but a detailed proposal will be prepared again before a final call is taken.”According to the proposal, the centre will be a central facility in the institute for state-of-the-art teaching, consultancy and research in the area of data science. Data science is one of the thrust areas identified by the ministry of human resource development (MHRD) under the scheme for transformational and advanced research in sciences (STARS) for promoting translational, India-centric research in sciences. The central facility proposed here will work in synchronisation with the MHRD’s key objectives as defined in STARS.Rationale behind data centreIt has been outlined that PEC is located at the epicentre of various government and industrial establishments and the availability of data in these establishments was in abundance. This data can be utilised by the faculty, research scholars and students of PEC to provide solutions of region-specific problems, if the relevant facilities are available on campus.Several faculty members of the computer science engineering department have shown interest in working at the centre.BoG approves closure of MTech industrial design courseThe members of the BoG on Thursday also approved the closure of the MTech in industrial design course. The PEC senate in September had recommended the same for the 2020-21 academic session.Former vice-chancellor of Panjab University, professor Arun Kumar Grover, who is also a member of the BoG, said, “If it gets introduced in PEC, it would be better for the institution because the students would get better training.

Greater Noida Virendra Kumar had a savings bank account account with the bank’s sector 31 Nithari branch. In 2005, he found that someone had withdrawn ₹35,000 through cheque.He informed the branch claiming that he had not issued the cheque and that his signature was forged and accused the bank of negligence in verifying signatures.In 2006, his complaint with the consumer forum was rejected. He had then appealed to the state commission in 2012 that was also dismissed, following which he sought redressal from the national consumer commission in 2015. That year, however, his advocate moved to file a civil case with the court to recover the amount and withdrew the complaint from the commission.“Civil Judge (Junior Division) Vandana Aggarwal decided the case ex-parte (when a party to a case, in this case, the bank, failed to appear before a court) and directed the bank to pay ₹35,000 along with 6 percent annual simple interest. The order was delivered last week,” Sanjiv Verma, president, District Courts Bar Association said on Thursday.Indian Overseas Bank Sector 31 branch Manager Awakas Sinha said, “We have not yet received court order copy. On getting order copy we will take action as per law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/15-years-after-incident-noida-court-directs-bank-to-pay-35-000-to-customer/story-Vz1pIXbtMLzEM51ys6W1rI.html
18-12-2020||Noida||State bird, technology, connectivity behind Noida International Airport logo||The Uttar Pradesh government and the Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL) on Thursday finalised a logo for the airport that has the imprint of the state bird, the Sarus Crane, in it, amalgamated with the image of a passenger plane. “We have tried to send a message across with the logo of the Noida International Airport by including impressions of a crane, technology and connected world in it. Dhanauri village near the airport site is a rich habitat of the Sarus Crane, the state bird, so we decided to include impressions of the same,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer (CEO) of NIAL.“We included technology as Yamuna Expressway is fast becoming a favourite hub of technology-driven businesses, while a connected world signifies that the airport and industries along the expressway will host diverse communities, cultures and a cosmopolitan society,” he added. Officials at the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) and NIAL said they have taken multiple measures to protect the almost 50 acre-wetland spread across Dhanauri, Thasrana and Amirpur Bangar villages, off the 165 km expressway. The marshland will be developed into a bird sanctuary and a wetland as it is home to the Sarus Crane, said officials. The wetland is home to 198 species of birds and falls under the Sector 16 urban area planned by the authority, which controls the expressway.“We have roped in the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to work on a conservation plan for this wetland located. We included it to send out a message that we need to work on a sustainable development model so that the ecology stays protected while letting developmental projects create opportunities for growth,” said Singh.In its observations, the Union environment ministry had raised concerns about damage to ecology, including to natural ponds, canals and trees, apart from disturbance to wildlife — the airport is coming up near wetlands that are home to the state bird, the Sarus Crane, as well as blackbucks, among others. To protect the ecology, the ministry has said that it wants Yeida and the NIAL to take preventive measures.“It is our commitment to protect the ecology and wildlife. Keeping the Crane in the logo reminds us of this commitment towards the environment,” said Singh, who is also the CEO of the Yamuna Expressway Authority. The receivables Yeida got in 2018-19 were Rs1,213 crore from selling land. In the subsequent financial year, 2019-2020, the receivables increased to at least Rs5,000 crore, due to the authority having managed to sell more land due to the airport project coming up, boosting investors’ sentiment.“Investment is growing in this region ever since the airport work picked up pace. It is happening because we believe in using the latest in technology and connecting people from the world over via business, which is why we kept these two in the logo,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/state-bird-technology-connectivity-behind-noida-international-airport-logo/story-PasqA3yx3hQ9dNPrrTHA2J.html

The administration has identified 73 centres where the vaccination will take place.“We have started maintenance work for cold storage space. We are checking ice-lined refrigerators (which can lower temperatures down to 2 to 8 degrees Celsius) working conditions in primary health centres and logistics required to transport vaccines,” he said. “The process of creating a database has already started. Apart from doctors and paramedics in different government hospitals, we are also reaching out to the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and private hospitals to prepare a list of their staff. These health workers will be the first in line to receive the immunization against coronavirus,” he said. GB Nagar district CMO Dr Deepak Ohri, said, “We have already prepared a list of 21,543 doctors and other medical staff, who will be inoculated. It will be followed by vaccination of employees of the authorities, armed forces and police personnel in the second place. In the third and last phase, people above the age of 50 years will get the shot.” On the storage aspect, he said, “ILRs are used to store vaccines for polio, measles, rubella and other diseases at primary health centres across the district. However, Covid-19 vaccines may require even lower temperatures. We are trying to find a way for that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-district-administration-identifies-13-cold-chain-points-73-centres-for-covid-19-vaccination/story-Zj2GaQQ2CPpbTcAlfrimAN.html

18-12-2020||Mumbai||TRP fraud case: SIT arrests former COO of BARC||The city crime branch on Thursday arrested Romil Ramgarhia, the former chief operating officer (COO) of Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) for his alleged involvement in the television rating points (TRP) fraud.This is the fourteenth arrest made by the special investigation team (SIT) which is probing the case registered based on a complaint filed by BARC through Hansa Research Group.According to Mumbai Police, TRP ratings, which decide which channel gets the biggest share of advertisements, were being manipulated by three channels. Some families at whose houses barometers were installed for collecting data of viewership were being bribed to watch a particular channel to boost its TRP.Crime branch’s probe revealed that some cable operators had used dual landing channel number (LCN) technology, which facilitated the viewing of the same channel on two different channel numbers at one time. Mumbai Police commissioner Parambir Singh in a press conference had claimed that two regional channels and Republic TV are suspected of being involved in this manipulation.While seeking custody of Ramgarhia, the crime branch SIT levelled serious allegations on him in their remand application submitted before the court.SIT said that Ramgarhia, who was COO of BARC from July 2014 to July 2020, used to have all the secret information about the viewership of the channels and he allegedly misused the same to illegally boost TRPs of Republic Bharat and Republic TV of ARG Outlier Media Private Limited.While working as COO, the accused had access to information related to trades of TV viewership, news viewership, channel performance and changes in TV channel revenues. He allegedly used all this information to help Republic TV network to boost its channels’ TRP, the SIT stated.Ramgarhia was also in contact with the director of ARG Outlier Media Private Limited, and chief executive director of Republic TV channels Vikas Khanchandani through WhatsApp. Besides WhatsApp, he also used some emails, and the SIT wants to interrogate him in connection with these emails. His laptop is yet to be scrutinised.In the remand application, SIT stated that it suspects that in exchange for helping Republic TV network boost its channels’ TRP, Ramgarhia made huge profits, and hence, they wish to question him and want to scrutinise his bank accounts.SIT also wished to look into the reason why Ramgarhia left the BARC job in July 2020, and if it has any connection with the alleged TRP manipulations. The court has remanded Ramgarhia in police custody for two days.The spokesperson for Republic TV did not respond to HT’s calls and messages.The SIT recently also arrested Republic TV chief executive officer (CEO) Vikas Khanchandani. He later secured bail in the matter.According to the police, Republic TV employees had contacted cable operators to use LCN and promotional LCN technology to fudge TRPs. Khanchandani was aware of it as he was a part of the channel’s internal WhatsApp group where discussions on LCN took place, police said.Republic TV’s distribution head Ghanshyam Dilipkumar Singh was arrested earlier. Singh had allegedly paid ₹15 lakh monthly for seven months, to a vendor to boost viewership of his channel, claimed crime branch in their remand copy filed before the court. Police also claimed that hawala channels were used for these transactions.Singh’s name cropped up in the investigation while officials were probing the role of Abhishek Kolawade alias Ajit alias Amit alias Mhadik, who worked as a vendor for many channels, and was arrested on October 31.Mumbai Police has previously informed the court that Kolawade’s sustained interrogation revealed that to amplify TRP of Republic TV, he had received monthly payments of ₹15lakh from Singh between January and July.The remand copy further stated that Kolawade gave some part of this money to Ramji Varma, Dinesh Vishwakarma and Umesh Mishra to further pay to the families whose houses were selected for installing barometers, with instructions to watch Republic TV channels.Numerous unlawful financial transactions surfaced during the investigations, which prompted the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to launch a parallel probe to investigate possible money laundering in the TRP manipulation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trp-fraud-case-sit-arrests-former-coo-of-barc/story-QCdMS2GX3REeVYBZ6rpKIM.html

He said that on Thursday, Khan had called a client to meet him at Dadri Tehsil. “The client reached the tehsil in his car and was waiting there.

18-12-2020||Noida||Khaps to spread word on new farm laws in western UP villages||Ghaziabad: Apart from lending support to farmers’ demands, the representatives of various khap panchayats who arrived at UP Gate on Thursday said that they will take up a “jan jagran abhiyan” (public awareness drive) to spread word about issues related to the three new farm laws, over which thousands of farmers have been protesting for about 22 days.The khaps traditionally have a stronghold in villages and have a say in resolution of many disputes before they reach the police or the administration. The representatives of about ten different khaps on Thursday held a Sarv Khap Mahapanchayat at UP Gate which is one of the major protest sites in the ongoing farmers’ agitation related to the new farm laws. “We will conduct a jan andolan abhiyan in villages of western UP and will also make farmers aware about the issues with the three farm laws,” said Dharambir Singh, representative of Deswal Khap. Sudhir Chaudhary, who at UP Gate on Thursday represented the Talan Khap, echoed similar sentiments while referring to the recent call of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to hold “Kisan Sammelans” for creating awareness in villages about the benefits of the three farm laws. “If they conduct panchayats about the three farm laws, we will also hold panchayats and tell people about the repercussions of the farm laws,” he said. Rajbir Singh, state vice president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said that the ongoing farmers’ agitation will benefit them as the khaps hold a lot of influence in villages. “It is a long tradition that villagers pay attention and abide by the decision of khaps leaders. Thursday’s ‘sarv khap panchayat’ was also held to give a message that farmers will not budge by any divisive narratives floating around and will stand together. Besides, the khaps will spread awareness among villagers about the problems with the new farm laws. I am a member of the Khutail khap which has influence over 384 villages in Agra, Mathura and Bharatpur,” he said. The khaps are purely social entities and their directions have no legal sanctity. However, some khaps in the country are known for rolling out bizarre diktats. There have been instances of Khaps allegedly banning women from wearing jeans and using mobile phones and the internet. In earlier instances, some khaps had allegedly banned love-marriages and marriages in the same “gotra” and vowed to punish those who married without their family’s consent. “It could be someone’s personal decision and khaps don’t give such directions. But yes, they try to preserve cultural identity. Khaps have a history of about 1,200 years and provide strength to the society. They were formed by villagers who fought the invaders. Many khap villagers from western UP also laid down their lives during the freedom struggle,” said Rakesh Tikait, leader and national spokesperson of the BKU. Chaudhay said that the society includes a person and also families. “If someone wants to get rid of us, they will show fear of khaps. So, a lot of rumours were spread about khaps,” he added. Virendra Singh, another Khap member, said that even though times are changing, the younger generation “still has respect for our decisions. The khaps try to preserve traditions and culture.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/khaps-to-spread-word-on-new-farm-laws-in-western-up-villages/story-6RuS4gwmgmZJhXrtGSCS2M.html
18-12-2020||Noida||Western UP khaps want government to take ‘two steps back’ to search for middle ground||Ghaziabad: Members of the ‘Sarv Khap Panchayat’ on Thursday said that they are not averse to resuming talks with the government over the farmers’ demands, and said that a “beech ka rasta” (midway) has to be reached so that protests end and the farmers go back home. The representatives and heads of about ten khaps, referred as “chaudharis” in common parlance, arrived at UP Gate from Muzaffarnagar on a call given by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). BKU leaders said that members of various khaps of Baliyans, Ahlawats, Deswals, Malik, Gathwala, Batisa, Rathi, Chugama, Panwar, and Rana were present at UP Gate on Thursday. Naresh Tikait, the head of the Baliyan khap and also the president of BKU, said that the heads of various khaps were “appalled” by the stance of the government against issues raised by the government. He arrived with other khap leaders at UP Gate Thursday afternoon and asked the government to mellow down stance.“The government is not paying heed to farmers’ demands. We are ready to take two steps back and the government should also move two steps back so that some middle ground can be reached. We will abide by the directions of the Supreme Court. It seems that the government is not concerned if farmers die during agitation. They die in more numbers in villages. We want a final decision to be taken respectfully so that farmers can go back home,” He said, adding that matters have now got prolonged and it has become an issue of “maan samman” (respect) of farmers. So far, there have been at least six rounds of talks between farmers and government representatives, but to no avail. Farmers are sticking to their demand of complete rollback of the three new farm laws while the government has given indications for making amendments. “We are ready for talks as discussions resolve issues. The core committee of farmers can take a decision on the matter as they have all rights. The khap tries to resolve tangled issues. We are in the mood to call off our protest but how do we end it? The government should mellow their stance and take back the new laws so that farmers go back home. If the government doesn’t bow down, we have our arrangements made till January 26,” he added. Subhash Baliyan, secretary of Sarv Khaps, said that farmers don’t want a situation of “tang aaye to jung aaye” (if there is impatience, there is war). “We don’t want this situation to happen. The government called us for talks and now it is time they be called here on roads for resumption of talks as farmers are still on roads,” he said. Thousands of farmers have occupied the UP Gate flyover area of the National Highway 9 since November 28. Later they blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the highway on December 3 and have been holding protests at the site ever since.This was the second mahapanchayat held at UP Gate, with the first one called by the BKU on December 3. After members of the khaps arrived at UP Gate, BKU leader and spokesperson Rakesh Tikait announced that the khaps have decided that the government should roll back three farm laws and that amendments would not be acceptable. “The khaps have decided that they will go by the decision of the farmers’ core committee and there should be no amendments but rollback of the three new farm laws. We are ready for talks and are not disrupting any supply chain, besides protesting peacefully. Representatives from about eight-10 khaps could not come as they were stopped by the police in western UP,” he said. Khaps have been traditional social entities in which a group of villages of people of the same group appoint a leader. “Members of khaps who arrived on Thursday have major influence in villages of Saharanpur, Shamli, Meerut and Muzaffarnagar and their decision will be binding,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the BKU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/western-up-khaps-want-government-to-take-two-steps-back-to-search-for-middle-ground/story-hh7IBI4o5JWxWPJixT4ySK.html

At the time, Noida Police had said they were not detaining farmers. Police on Thursday stopped nearly 120 volunteers from the Ambavat faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) near the sector 14A cut around 2 pm. “We only wanted to lend support to our brothers. We are already protesting at the Singhu border but we wanted to also be a part of the protest at the Noida border. But the police here was brutal. They assaulted us and took our brothers into custody. They didn’t let us join our brothers at Chilla. If they think that this will scare us then they are mistaken. We will continue to protest until the government rolls back unjust laws,” said Rak Kumar, tehsil president, BKU Ambawat.Denying any assault, deputy commissioner of police (Zone 1) Rajesh S said: “We were only monitoring the law and order situation. We would not have acted if it was only a peaceful gathering. But the volunteers crossed the median and tried to block the traffic coming from Delhi too. They scared the commuters, and it was only after they tried to create trouble that the group was removed and 22 of them detained.”The detainees were brought to the Surajpur police lines where they were kept for nearly two hours before being released. The group also handed over their memorandum of demands to the central government via the policeBKU (Bhanu) had been camping at the Chilla border for nearly three weeks. On December 1, they had blocked one lane of the Chilla border and later proceeded to block the other too. After negotiations, the protesters relented and allowed traffic from both sides on December 13.Traffic from Noida to Delhi via Chilla continued to be diverted through DND Flyway, affecting commuters during peak hours. Police personnel are awaiting Supreme Court orders on the issue of road blockage by farmers before removing them from the spot.“They can try to intimidate us. But we will not move from here until our demands are met. No amount of threats will deter us from our goals,” Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president, BKU Bhanu.Singh was on a hunger strike since Sunday which he broke on Thursday on the urging of other farmer leaders.“Our brothers are dying in the protest. They are ending their lives, leaving behind detailed suicide notes. But the government remains completely unaffected to our plight. We need to be in best form possible to deal with them,” said Singh on ending his hunger strike.The group camped at Chilla paid homage to their dead brothers and to the farmer that took his own life at Singhu border on Wednesday by observing a two minute silence vigil at noon.Farmers have been staying at the border for nearly three weeks now. Slogans of “jai jawan, jai kisan” are heard sporadically while they continue to wave the cold wave. A group from another faction is stationed at the Dalit Prerna Sthal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-on-way-to-join-campers-at-chilla-detained-by-noida-police-allege-brutality/story-d317NHWCZOyLpqftpZqR4M.html

Noida recorded 4.5°C on Thursday as against around 7°C a day earlier and 8°C on Tuesday. The maximum temperature was 18°C on Thursday against 18.9°C a day earlier. The national capital region (NCR), for which measurements from the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD’s) Safadarjung observatory, recorded a minimum of 4.6°C and the maximum was 15.2°C. The region has been experiencing a cold wave and cold day at the same time since past three days. According to the IMD, these conditions are likely to persist till Saturday but the high wind chill factor, which is the perceived drop in temperature due to cold winds, is likely to persist. “The main reason for the cold wave is the cold winds from the northern states that has had heavy snowfall. On Monday, the wind speed was around 20 kmph. Stronger the winds, higher is the wind chill factor, which directly impacts the minimum temperature and thereby the cold wave,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. “Due to the strong winds, the fog is about 300 to 400 metres above the surface, blocking the sunlight for most of the day.”Cold waves are when the minimum temperatures is 4.5°C below the season’s normal, while the cold day is the condition when even the maximum temperature is 4.5°C below the season’s average. According to the IMD, the minimum and maximum temperatures are likely to hover around 4°C and 18°C for the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/city-shivers-as-cold-wave-continues-noida-suffers-coldest-day/story-BFt0bj10EHFKsEidvB7ZxK.html
18-12-2020||Mumbai||Justify plea to ban Kangana Ranaut’s Twitter account: Bombay HC to man||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday directed a man to justify how his petition, seeking a ban on actor Kangana Ranaut’s Twitter account could be treated as a writ petition and not a public interest litigation (PIL), as his claims of injury were not personal but involved the entire Muslim community. In light of the claims by the petitioner, the state submitted that the petition was misconceived and should be dismissed. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik, while hearing the criminal writ petition filed by advocate Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh, was informed that he had submitted that as the actor has been misusing her social media account to malign and abuse a community and create disharmony between Hindus and Muslims, Twitter India, which was also a respondent to the petition, should be directed to ban her account. Additional public prosecutor JP Yagnik, however, claimed that the petition was vague and did not raise any grievance about any personal injury to the petitioner. He opposed the petition and called for its dismissal. The bench then sought to know from Deshmukh as to why the petition should be allowed when the cause espoused on it was more of public interest and hence, the writ jurisdiction of the court could but be invoked. Deshmukh, however, clarified that though there was no personal injury caused to him by the said objectionable tweets of the actor, as the same were targeted at a particular community which he belonged to, he had filed the petition. The court then directed Deshmukh to explore and study the issue: whether it should be pursued as a writ petition or a PIL, and inform the court about it by December 21. The petition has referred to the Twitter account of Ranaut’s sister, which was suspended by Twitter for the alleged objectionable tweets made by her earlier this year, and sought a similar action against the actor’s account as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/justify-plea-to-ban-kangana-ranaut-s-twitter-account-bombay-hc-to-man/story-q2IpTDuQMDwNbgwIj2fwIL.html
18-12-2020||Noida||Name, logo and design of Jewar airport finalised||The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday gave his approval to the name, design and logo of the airport proposed at Jewar along 165km Yamuna Expressway, which will be the second major airport in Delhi-NCR and has been conceptualised to take the load off Delhi’s almost saturated Indira Gandhi International Airport. The name - Noida International Airport - was finalised during a meeting with the Swiss company- Zurich AG officials in Lucknow.Senior executives and directors of Zurich AG subsidiary - Yamuna International Airport Private Limited - met chief minister Yogi Adityanath during the meeting in which Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Noida International airport Limited, Christoph Schnellmann, CEO of Yamuna International Airport Private Limited , Kiran Jain, COO of Yamuna International Airport Private Limited and other officials were present .“The Uttar Pradesh government has given its necessary approval for the design of the layout of passenger terminal proposed by the Zurich, name and logo. Now, Yamuna International Airport Private Limited will start work accordingly,” said Arun Vir Singh chief executive officer of the Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL), a nodal agency formed by the UP government to monitor the development of this project.The UP government has given its green signal to the name - ‘Noida International airport’ to be used officially. Initially the Swiss Company Zurich had started using the name- Delhi Noida International airport as it helps associate with the national capital, said officials. But the UP government and NIAL had objections to this name because they wanted a name that represented Uttar Pradesh at the international level, said officials of UP government.“Noida is a window city of UP state and well known in international markets. By naming it after Noida, we will help in branding UP as a hub of businesses, opportunities and as a growing market for investors. Noida reminds people of UP therefore the state government has approved this name,” said Singh. The UP government has handed over 1334 hectares of land for the work to be started at the site.

18-12-2020||City||Congress conducts ‘opinion poll’ using technology to select Mumbai chief||Congress is seeking feedback of its Mumbai unit workers to select the new city chief. The party utilised technology to hold an interactive voice response call with its functionaries, as the top brass is looking to handpick a new chief by the month-end. The idea of an opinion poll was to get a sense of what the workers want on the ground, said party functionaries. The leaders, including 227 block presidents and around 270 Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) members, first received a message from HK Patil, the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of Maharashtra, followed by a call to name one leader they want as Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC) chief. According to a Congress functionary, the process to select the chief has been completed. “Messages and calls went to about 500 people, including block presidents and PCC members. They were asked for one name for MRCC chief on the call,” said the functionary. Congress general secretary KC Venugopal said the party would take the inputs given on the calls into consideration while selecting the new city chief. “It [interactive phone call] is not the only input being sought. Patil will also take other inputs as well,” Venugopal told HT. Patil, who met senior Congress leaders in Delhi on Thursday, is expected to submit the final report to Congress president Sonia Gandhi.Former minister Arif Naseem Khan, Bhai Jagtap, along with functionaries Suresh Shetty and Charanjit Singh Sapra are among the frontrunners to bag the post. Party insiders said that the names of Varsha Gaikwad and Priya Dutt are also doing the rounds to strike a balance in the faction-ridden Congress unit.With elections to the civic body a mere 14 months away, the city unit of the party has not had a full-time president for more than a year. The post of MRCC chief is being held by Eknath Gaikwad, a two-time Lok Sabha member and Varsha’s father. He was made the acting president of the city unit in September 2019 after the party leadership accepted the resignation of Milind Deora in July. Deora had replaced Sanjay Nirupam days ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in April 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-conducts-opinion-poll-using-technology-to-select-mumbai-chief/story-gt2Vje7G1lf88O1AhChuiL.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Farmer unions to consult four top lawyers on joining Supreme Court proceedings||The agitating farmer unions at Delhi’s borders on Thursday said that they will consult lawyers on the ongoing proceedings of the Supreme Court —related to their protests against the three farm laws — before taking any decision on whether to “implead” as a party in the matter or not. Addressing a press conference on Singhu border on Thursday evening, farmers leader and coordinator of Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh, KV Biju, said, “All farmer unions had a meeting today and we have decided that we will consult four Supreme Court lawyers — Prashant Bhushan, Dushyant Dave, HS Phoolka and Colin Gonsalves — on the ongoing proceedings in the Supreme Court… We will neither comment on the matter nor announce any decision without consulting these lawyers. We will consult them before taking any decision on whether to implead in the matter or not.”The Supreme Court had stepped in on Wednesday to try and end the impasse between the farmers’ unions and the Centre over the contentious new laws to open up trade in agriculture, observing that the protests will soon become a national issue and that recent events suggest government negotiations with the unions were “bound to fail again.” A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde on Thursday asked the Attorney General of India if the government can commit that the farm laws will not be implemented while the court is hearing the petitions filed against the ongoing protest.The farmer leaders said that they have not received any notice from the Apex court so far. “We have only got to know what is happening in the Supreme Court through the media. We have not received any notice or communication as of now. We will take a legal decision only after consulting these four lawyers,” said another farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, as the agitation at Delhi’s four key borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate, and Chilla – entered into its 22nd day on Thursday. Meanwhile, senior advocate and the president of the Supreme Court bar association Dushyant Dave said that he had offered free legal advice to the farmers on all issues. “If they have decided to take my help, it is a privilege and honour for me. After all, for this country ‘Jai Jawaan, Jai Kisan’ means the most. It’s my duty as a lawyer of the Supreme Court to help them as much as I can… I will be happy to appear for them in the Supreme Court if they ask me.”Senior advocate HS Phoolka also confirmed that the farmer leaders had consulted him and the other three lawyers on the matter. Advocate Prashant Bhushan said that he will be offering legal advice to the farmer associations if they approach him. Advocate Colin Gonsalves said, “The discussion with farmers is in the very initial stage. We might be able to comment on it after a couple of days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmer-unions-to-consult-four-top-lawyers-on-joining-supreme-court-proceedings/story-u4ovQkuv5jku26iILGGhxJ.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Why did Kejriwal notify one of three farm laws if he opposed them, asks BJP in assembly||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators, during the special one-day Assembly session on Thursday, criticised the Kejriwal government for not implementing various farmer welfare schemes of the Central government even as the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) maintained that the Centre should withdraw the three new farm laws.Leader of the opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri asked chief minister Arvind Kejriwal why his government had notified one of the three new laws on November 23 if he was so opposed to the new legislations. He said the new agricultural reform laws will ensure the use of new techniques, and will increase farmer incomes as well as employment opportunities.“The entire country has fully supported the three historic agricultural laws. This is the reason that after the introduction of these laws, BJP won the election in Bihar Assembly and all the eight seats of Gujarat, six out of seven seats of Uttar Pradesh, two seats of Karnataka, 19 seats of Madhya Pradesh and five seats of Manipur in the assembly by-elections all over the country. Not only that, the party also won the district council and panchayat elections in Rajasthan and broke the myth that only the ruling party of the state wins such elections,” Bidhuri told the House. The BJP leader asked Kejriwal why had not implemented the Swaminathan Commission report in Delhi despite making the announcement that he will do so. The commission had submitted five reports, between 2004 and 2006, making recommendations for farmer welfare.Also Read: Kejriwal is ‘new chameleon’, says Meenakshi Lekhi after CM tore copies of farm bills“I also want to know why the Centre’s Kisan Credit Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Crop Insurance Scheme, Soil Health Scheme, Soil Card Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana have not been implemented in Delhi. Similarly, why was organic farming not promoted and institutional loans given to farmers?” Bidhuri said. “They (BJP leaders) have no explanation to give about how the new farm laws will actually benefit farmers and, hence, are talking about matters that are not even remotely relevant to the issue. They are just trying to divert people’s attention from the farm laws,” said AAP leader Jasmine Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/why-did-kejriwal-notify-one-of-three-farm-laws-if-he-opposed-them-asks-bjp-in-assembly/story-QbdBmap0z7fBnPP7aia57K.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||AAP MLAs move high court for permission to protest outside homes of Amit Shah and L-G||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs Raghav Chadha and Atishi on Thursday moved to the Delhi high court, challenging the denial of permission by the Delhi Police to hold a sit-in protest outside the homes of Union home minister Amit Shah and lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal.The two AAP legislators said they wanted to hold a four-people protest at each of the two sites against the alleged misappropriation of funds done by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led North Delhi Municipal Corporation, amounting to over Rs2,500 crore. The plea also sought necessary arrangements to be made for the protest outside Shah’s house, along the lines of what has been permitted outside the residence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, where the three mayors of Delhi have been sitting on a protest for the past 10 days, demanding that the Delhi government release funds to the BJP-led municipal bodies.Appearing for the Delhi Police, advocate Gautam Narayan told the court that sit-ins can only be allowed in designated places and, hence, petitioners cannot be allowed to hold the protest outside the home minister’s or the L-G’s houses.During the hearing, Chawla suggested to the police that the AAP leaders be allowed to hold the protest, subject to whatever restrictions the agency wants to impose on them, as only four persons would be staging the sit-in at each of the two sites.“They will give an undertaking to abide by the restrictions,” the court said while asking the Delhi Police counsel to seek instructions. However, the counsel later told the court that they cannot allow protests in residential areas and cited an earlier Supreme Court.The MLAs, through their counsel Manvinder Vashist (for Chadha) and Satvik Verma ( for Atishi), said on the one hand, the police have allowed the request of BJP councillors to protest and stage a sit-in before the residence of the CM, which is still ongoing, but on the other hand, the police have denied the petitioners the permission to protest outside Shah’s and L-G’s residences.The petition said on December 12, the deputy commissioner of police (DCP), New Delhi, “illegally” rejected their request for holding peaceful protest in an “arbitrary manner” apparently fuelled by a political conspiracy, thereby infringing on their constitutional rights.The plea also said the right to protest constituted a fundamental pillar of democracy and embodies the exercise of a number of indivisible, interdependent and interconnected human rights, in particular the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs, and the right to freedom of thought. The matter will now be heard on Friday.Chadha later told HT, “The matter is subjudice and I will speak through my lawyer in the court but all that I am seeking is equality and parity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-mlas-move-high-court-for-permission-to-protest-outside-homes-of-amit-shah-and-l-g/story-kJLziZof5MY9DFv6XslAGI.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Mayors launch indefinite hunger strike in front of Delhi CM’s residence||Mayors of Delhi’s three municipal corporations — along with 22 other councillors — have gone on an indefinite hunger strike from Thursday outside the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence Flag Staff Road residence to demand the release of Rs 13,000 crore to municipal corporations from the Delhi government. The mayors of the three municipalities have been camping outside the chief minister’s residence since December 7. On Thursday, North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) mayor Anamika Mithilesh, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) mayor Nirmal Jain along with standing committee chairpersons of the three civic bodies and 19 other councillors startedd their fast unto death.Apart from this, the Delhi unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said that nearly 40,000 party workers had observed a one-day fast in support of the mayors and to demand that Rs 13,000 crore be released to the municipal corporations. The BJP workers observed fasts in 250 mandals (zones) under six parliamentary constituencies on Thursday.Jai Prakash, mayor of north corporation, said that was the 11th day of the sit-in protest, but the CM has shown no interest in clearing the dues amounting to Rs 13,000 crore.“We have decided to sit on an indefinite hunger strike outside the CM’s house to demand the due municipal funds. For the last 11 days, we have been sitting on a dharna outside the CM’s residence, but neither has he tried to meet us nor is he ready to listen to us,” Prakash said.SDMC mayor Mithilesh said, “We will brave the cold and all other obstacles and keep sitting on our hunger strike. We will not go anywhere until the state government releases funds to the municipal corporation.”According to municipal functionaries, of the Rs 13,000 crore (approx) dues, the north corporation is to get Rs 6,355 crore, for SDMC is to get Rs 4,125 crore and the EDMC is to receive Rs 2,985 crore from the state government.Adesh Gupta, Delhi BJP chief, on Thursday morning also reached in front of the CM’s house where municipal leaders are sitting on their hunger strike and said that their fight was a fight for the rights of corporation workers.“The mayors and leaders of the three municipal corporations are fighting for the rights of doctors, nurses, health workers, sanitation workers, teachers and every Delhiite, but it seems CM (Arvind) Kejriwal has no concern for the common people,” Gupta said.The BJP leader also alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government was spending funds of municipalities on publicity but not giving it to civic bodies.Hitting back at the BJP, the AAP later said in a statement, “Even the mayors of BJP-ruled MCDs know that their protest is only an excuse by their high-command to harass CM Arvind Kejriwal and distract from the issue of nationwide farmers protests. The mayors are well aware that Delhi government has given all the funds due and it is because of their corruption and inefficiency that the MCDs are facing financial ruin. Since they have decided to only protest rather then govern, it is best that they resign and let AAP run the MCDs. We will run the MCDs efficiently and within the same budget.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mayors-launch-indefinite-hunger-strike-in-front-of-cm-s-residence/story-L4AQ6LI7YBUh00rmS37LJI.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||BJP leaders protest outside Delhi Assembly, demand release of ₹13,000 crore||Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Adesh Gupta, along with party workers and supporters protested outside the Delhi Assembly on Thursday against the “wrong and misleading” policies of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and demanded the release of ₹13,000 crore in allegedly pending funds for the three municipalities. BJP MPs Ramesh Bidhuri, Pravesh Verma along with senior leaders also participated in the protest. They also opposed the special Assembly session called by the government to discuss the alleged “misappropriation of funds” in the civic bodies. Addressing the protesters, Gupta denied any misappropriation of funds in the civic bodies and said that the AAP had been making “baseless allegations” against the municipalities.“Our struggle is that of justice against injustice, truth against lies and against irresponsible CM (Arvind) Kejriwal who is ignoring the demands of corporation leaders sitting on a dharna outside his residence for the past 11 days. The CM neither took any steps to control Delhi’s increasing pollution nor to save Delhiites from the corona pandemic. Under the leadership of (Narendra) Modi government, home minister Amit Shah had to intervene twice to save the people of Delhi,” Gupta said.BJP workers had assembled at Chandgi Ram Akhara on Thursday morning and marched towards the Delhi Assembly. They were stopped by the police near the Assembly. The AAP had earlier this week alleged that there was “misappropriation” of funds worth ₹2,400 crore in the north and south civic bodies. The allegation was denied by the civic bodies on Wednesday.Addressing the crowd, MP Pravesh Sahib Singh Verma said that the AAP was politicising the issue and making false allegations. “AAP leaders have not done any work on the ground so they do not understand the pain of the public. Instead of clearing dues of the municipal corporations, they are politicising the issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-leaders-protest-outside-delhi-assembly-demand-release-of-13-000-crore/story-6QBXCbxOQgS74AM7eIGxYN.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||New farm laws meant to secure poll funding: Delhi CM||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday attacked the Centre and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday, saying the three laws aimed at opening up trade in agriculture had been designed not with the interests of farmers in mind, but to ensure electoral funding for the ruling party. At a special session of the Delhi assembly, Kejriwal tore up copies of the three farm laws in protest against the legislation. The assembly passed a resolution tabled by revenue minister Kailash Gahlot demanding that the Central government repeal the laws immediately.Farmers, mainly from the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have massed at border entry points to Delhi since November 26 in a protest was set off by three laws pushed through by the government in September that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules. Farmers say they promote corporate interests, and not theirs.“What was the hurry to get the farm bills passed in Parliament during the pandemic? It happened for the first time that three laws were passed without voting in Rajya Sabha, even when several members were opposing the move… In the last 6-7 years, the BJP has made elections so expensive. So, much of the money is spent on elections (by political parties). These laws have not been passed for the farmers. These laws have been made to ensure election funding for the BJP,” Kejriwal told the House.After the chief minister’s speech, MLAs of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to the well of the House shouting “jai jawan jai kisan” after which the speaker adjourned the House until 11 am on Friday. A few AAP legislators even burnt copies of the farm laws outside the House. Urging the Central government to withdraw the farm laws, the chief minister said the farmers have been protesting for 20 days now and one farmer has died everyday in the agitation.“How many sacrifices will the farmers have to make to get their voices heard? Today, the Delhi assembly rejects all the three farm laws and appeals to the Central government to take back the legislation. I request the Centre not to be worse than the British,” he said.“Big businessmen will buy produce at throwaway prices from farmers and sell it at high rates in retail {outlets} across the country, which will lead to inflation. It is being said that the farmers are being misguided. Farmers are not being misguided. It is the BJP leaders and supporters who are being misguided,” he said.Kejriwal said that today each protesting farmer had become a Bhagat Singh. He reminded members of the House of a similar movement  Pagdi Sambhal Jatta that took place in Punjab in 1907 against three laws --Bari Doab Act (related to canals), Punjab Land Colonisation Act, and Punjab Land Alienation Act -- of the British era. “At that time also, the British government had suggested some amendments in the laws and they reiterated that they will make some changes in the laws in several rounds of discussions that were held. But the farmers were adamant about revoking and repealing the three laws. In the end, and after nine months, the Britishers had to repeal the three laws…I am in pain while I tear these three farm laws, as I did not intend to do this. But today, when a farmer of the country is sleeping on the road in 2°C temperature, I cannot betray the jawans and kisaans of my country. I am first the citizen of this country, and then the chief minister,” he said.BJP’s New Delhi MP and spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi criticised Kejriwal for his “doublespeak” on the farmers’ issue. “Arvind Kejriwal puts chameleons to shame when it comes to changing colours within seconds. After notifying one of the farm laws in Delhi, he tore the copies of the Acts in Delhi Assembly today. He is the expert of U-turns and a champion of politics of bluff,” she said. Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted, “Yet another hypocrisy of @ArvindKejriwal! He tore off copies of the same farm reform bills today in Delhi Assembly which he had notified in November in the Delhi Gazette.”To this, a government spokesperson said all the three farm laws were brought in and implemented by the Central government and that the state governments had no role to play in it.“The Delhi government not notifying it would not have made any difference in the city. The day the President signed the black farm laws, these laws became effective across the entire country from that day itself. It is no longer in the hands of the state,” the official said.

18-12-2020||Mumbai||Wife sole nominee despite leaving man, upholds Bombay HC||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday upheld the right of a woman to be the sole nominee for the service benefits of her husband, a retired watchman from the maintenance command of the Indian Air Force, despite the fact that she had left behind her husband and three children and eloped with a 19-year-old man. “The allegations of adultery have no relevance in the present case, as the same do not in any manner affect the merits of the claim of Asha (name changed),” said the bench of justice AS Chandurkar and justice NB Suryavanshi, while rejecting an appeal jointly filed by the husband and his second wife. Both of them had moved HC, challenging the 2018 order of a family court at Nagpur, declaring that Asha, being his legally wedded wife, was entitled to be the sole nominee of the watchman for claiming service benefits after him. Declaring that the act of the maintenance command to replace Asha’s nomination from the watchman’s service record by the name of his second wife was illegal, the family court had also directed the maintenance command to add Asha’s name in his record again. The family court had passed the order on the proceedings initiated by Asha in December 2010, after she got to know that her name was removed from the service record of her husband. The watchman had married Asha in July 1979 at Nagpur as per Hindu rites and customs. He said in February 1989, Asha eloped with a 19-year-old man with who continues to live with her even today. Thus, Asha had failed to perform her duties as a wife and mother and has led an adulterous life, claimed the retired watchman. He said being a watchman, he was required to do night duty, leaving his small children at home, and hence he married for a second time in February 1995, and replaced Asha’s nomination with that of his second wife’s. It was argued on his behalf that the change of nomination being a service matter, the family court had no jurisdiction to decide on it or to direct his employer to delete the name of his second wife and re-enter Asha’s name in the record. However, HC refused to accept the contention saying that the declaration in respect of the nomination was been granted by the family court as per clause (d) of the explanation to section 7 (1) of the Family Courts Act, 1984, which confers jurisdiction on the lower court to entertain a suit or proceeding for an order or injunction “in circumstances arising out of a marital relationship.” “Since the nomination and subsequent deletion of the name of Asha was a circumstance arising out of her marital relationship, the family court had jurisdiction to entertain the prayers and grant her relief,” said HC, upholding the family court’s order on the nomination, noting that though Asha lived in adultery, admittedly no competent court had dissolved her marriage with the watchman, and thus she continued to be his legally wedded wife. The bench also confirmed the direction to restore Asha’s nomination, as the judges noted that under the General Provident Fund (Central Services) Rules, 1960, the legally wedded wife ceases to be part of the employee’s family only when the employee proves that she has been judicially separated from him or has ceased to be his wife under the customary law of the community. HC found the allegations that Asha was leading adulterous life and had failed to perform duties of a mother and wife and her desertion had compelled the watchman to perform second marriage “unacceptable” and said the allegations did not further the case of the watchman in any manner, in absence of declaration and dissolution of his first marriage by decree of a competent court. The court also said the watchman’s second marriage cannot be said to be legal and therefore the second wife could not have been nominee of the watchman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/wife-sole-nominee-despite-leaving-man-upholds-bombay-hc/story-Ove3hOycNq1XNGlJpIowVN.html
18-12-2020||Kolkata||Bengal may follow Bihar-model to hold assembly polls amid pandemic||The Election Commission of India (ECI) has expressed concern over the present law and order situation in some districts of West Bengal even as it hinted that the state assembly polls would be held following the Bihar model.Assembly elections in Bihar were held in November when the Covid-19 pandemic was still raging. “Deputy election commissioner Sudeep Jain held a meeting with senior IAS and IPS officers of the state, including the district magistrates and superintendents of police of some districts to take stock. The Chief Electoral Officer of Bihar HR Srinivasa also addressed the meeting and shared the state’s experience on how elections were held during the pandemic,” said a senior poll panel official.The ECI team, led by Jain, is likely to visit north Bengal on Friday to interact with district officials. Officials said that the team has expressed concern over the law and order situation and has asked the state administration to ensure free and fair elections.“The team was concerned about the law and order situation in some districts. The police have been asked to strictly tackle any untoward incidents and ensure that free and fair elections could be held,” said a poll panel official who attended the meeting. Also read: India wants further talks with China for ‘mutually acceptable solution’ to LAC standoff“It is only after the team returns to Delhi and submit their report that we are expecting the full bench of the ECI sometime in January,” said a senior poll panel official.Earlier this week, a BJP delegation from West Bengal met chief election commissioner Sunil Arora in New Delhi, requesting early deployment of Central police forces and enforcement of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) to avoid widespread political violence during the campaign period. The state’s ruling Trinamool Congress, however, has rubbished the fears, saying that the BJP is afraid of the TMC’s influence among voters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-may-follow-bihar-model-to-hold-polls-during-pandemic/story-0BX9w0444sYph45gIUDuLK.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Record 90k tests, Covid-19 positivity rate below 2% for the third day in Delhi||With 90,354 tests for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) conducted on Wednesday, Delhi scaled up testing further, inching close to its goal of 100,000 tests a day. Of the tests conducted, 49,102 (54.3%) were done using the RT-PCR method — the gold standard for coronavirus diagnosis. Experts have warned that if the RT-PCR tests slacken, it could catch the Capital off guard if the outbreak begins resurging.The city recorded 1,363 new cases of the viral infection as per Thursday’s health bulletin. In comparison, Delhi had seen 8,593 new cases in a day on average during the November surge in Covid-19 cases. Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThe high number of tests and fewer cases being reported has led to the city’s positivity rate — proportion of samples that test positive — dropping to less than 2% for the third day in a row. This has happened for the first time since the government started reporting the number of tests and cases consistently. The positivity rate has been below 5% for 15 days now, which experts believe is a sign of the spread of Covid-19 being in control. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had said on Wednesday that according to the World Health Organization the number of tests should be scaled up till a positivity rate of less than 8% is achieved. “A positivity rate of 5% is considered to be optimum, which means sufficient number of tests is being performed. Delhi has had a positivity rate of less than 3% for five days in a row and less than 5% for 15 days in a row. Right now, the positivity rate is about 2% in Delhi. Let us wait and watch how long the 2% positivity rate is maintained,” he said. Should the government still continue to increase the number of tests? Yes, say experts. “We should continue testing as many people as we can and we should continue to increase the number of tests as much as we can. When the positivity rate is about 2% to 3% even with a high number of tests, there is confidence that transmission is not taking place very fast. With fewer tests, the positivity rate can be low either because the transmission is low or the tests are not able to capture the positive cases. As the number of tests is increased, the possibility that we are missing cases is reduced,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research. Delhi also reported 35 deaths due to Covid-19 on Thursday, taking the city’s toll to 10,182. With fewer cases, the cumulative case fatality ratio — proportion of deaths among those who test positive — is 1.66%. In comparison, the national CFR stands at 1.45%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-record-90k-tests-positivity-rate-below-2-for-the-third-day/story-aSybWpxtEOJYBWDiCjlpFM.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: DMRC likely to flag off its first driverless train on Christmas Day||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is likely to run driverless trains from December-end, a senior official in the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) said, and the first driverless train is likely to be operated on the Magenta Line, between Janakpuri West and Botanical Garden (Noida).A senior ministry official, aware of the development, said efforts are being made to start the new system on December 25, when DMRC will complete 18 years of operations in the national capital, and get Prime Minister Narendra Modi to flag off the first driverless train.To allow driverless train operations (DTO), the ministry official said, an amendment in the Metro Railways General Rules, 2015, will be made.The move to introduce driverless trains comes as a step towards switching to the unattended train operations (UTO) mode, using the hi-tech signalling technology called the communication based train control (CBTC).According to DMRC officials, the driverless train technology is already in use in trains running on Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) and Magenta Line (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West), but a driver is present on each train for the time being-- the train is manually started by the driver and thereon its runs on the CBTC signalling system. A senior DMRC official, on the condition of anonymity, said driverless technology was introduced on the Magenta Line and the Pink Line in 2017, but until now, the Metro was conducting rigorous trials to ensure that trains could safely switch over to driverless operations.Officials explained that the driverless train technology has set standards for automation called grades of automation (GoA). In GoA 1, trains are run by one driver and, in GoA 2 and GoA 3, the role of the driver is reduced to operating doors and for taking over in case of emergencies -- the starting and halting of trains is automated. Finally, in the GoA 4, trains are set on a completely unattended train operations mode.“The progression to remove human intervention entirely is done in a phased manner. After isolated trials at first, we have of late been conducting trials during the non-peak hours. The idea is to gain complete public confidence in the system,” the DMRC official said.The official said the present Metro rules do not have the provision of operating driverless trains and to inaugurate this new system, the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs will have to modify the existing rules. The DMRC had initially set a tentative deadline for operations, under GoA 3, for May this year, but these plans were delayed due to the Covid-19 lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-dmrc-likely-to-flag-off-its-first-driverless-train-on-christmas-day/story-qgJDHCPl4OOngXkWnUAeZL.html

A failure to comply with the direction may lead to strict action, including cancellation of excise licence, said a senior government official.The order was issued after the excise department took note of instances flagged by excise teams which found non-functional CCTV cameras at establishments during routine inspections. Excise officials said such defunct cameras were hindering their inspection drives.“Instances have come to the notice of the department that CCTV cameras installed at hotels, clubs and restaurants are found to be non-functional during the inspection,” said the December 7 order which HT has seen.It further said, “In many cases, the hotel and restaurant staff cite non-working cameras to avoid providing footage demanded by inspecting teams to check violations.”The CCTV cameras help to check violations such as serving of alcohol to underage people, serving liquor beyond the permitted hours, consumption of liquor outside the premises, and law and order situations, among other irregularities, for which footage from both inside and outside the premises of restaurants, hotels and clubs are necessary, the official saidDelhi has around 850 restaurants, hotels and clubs that have the licences to serve liquor.The order stated that all hotels, clubs and restaurants are directed to ensure that CCTV cameras are installed at appropriate locations within and outside the licensed premises and record all activities without any break. “Non-compliance of the said order will be viewed seriously and if the CCTV cameras installed at the hotels, clubs and restaurants are found non-functional by the inspecting team of the (excise) department without any justified reason, the same will be treated as wilful (default) and stern action, including cancellation of licences, may be taken against the defaulter,” the order further said.Restaurant owners said they always cooperate with the authorities but in each case, the management of the enterprise should at least be given a fair hearing.Riyaaz Amlani, trustee of the national restaurants association of India, said, “CCTV cameras are also a matter that concerns the safety and security of people. We encourage restaurants, clubs and hotels to ensure that they have CCTV cameras installed and to ensure that these are functional. We welcome the rule, but we urge that it should not be applied in a draconian fashion. In each case, if cameras are found non-functional, the enterprise should be given a fair hearing before any action is taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-have-functioning-cctv-cameras-else-risk-losing-licence-excise-dept-tells-hotels-and-pubs/story-EF1HXnKxfHspAFWog8d1tK.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Unwilling to share food, man stabs another in Delhi, booked||The Delhi Police on Wednesday arrested a 59-year-old man near Old Delhi railway station; he was on the run after stabbing another man.The two men had fought over sharing salad while having dinner together last week in south Delhi’s Fatehpur Beri, police said, adding that the man who survived the attack was stabbed multiple times until his intestines popped out.The man who has been arrested was identified as Riyasat Ali, a homeless man, currently residing at the Old Delhi railway station. Police have also recovered a knife from him that he had used to stab the victim, identified as Pawan Singh, a resident of Fatehpur Beri area.The incident took place on December 8. Police said both Ali and Singh work as labourers at wedding parties and after one such party on December 8 in Faridabad, when they had returned to their godown in Fatehpur Beri they were having dinner with other labourers.“While dining, Singh asked Ali to pass him the onion salad but Ali refused to share it. Singh got up to take the salad on his own but Ali allegedly did not let him. A fight started between them, and Ali picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed Singh multiple times. He even cut his stomach open causing his intestines to bulge out,” said a senior police officer, who wished not to be named.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said Singh was immediately rushed to AIIMS Trauma Centre in critical condition. Ali fled the spot before the other labourers could catch him. The matter was reported to the police and a case of attempt to murder was registered.“Through blurred CCTV camera footage, we had a rough idea about Ali’s build and looks. We learned that Ali is a homeless man. Multiple teams were formed to conduct raids in areas where vagabonds and labourers gather for food or work. After almost ten days of tedious verification of more than 500 labourers and vagabonds, our teams managed zero in on Ali who was spotted on a footpath near Old Delhi Railway station. He was arrested and booked for the crime,” Thakur said.The DCP said Ali confessed to having stabbed Singh following the fight over not sharing of salad. “The knife he had used was also recovered from him. Singh’s condition is said to be stable,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unwilling-to-share-food-man-stabs-another-booked/story-7WZVvRtZzikzy7B9VdbxbP.html

18-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers start cleaning up agitation site at Singhu border after residents complain||After over a fortnight of garbage piling up at the protest site at the Singhu border, farmers started cleaning the roads after residents complained about the mounting litter heaps.Since Tuesday, they have been collecting truckloads of garbage from the protest venue, while urging protesters to ensure that local residents do not remember them “for the wrong reasons”.Those carrying out the sanitation drive said they started it after complaints from several residents about the mess that was being left on the roads and adjacent neighbourhoods.“When we began the cleaning exercise on Tuesday; we brought 500 garbage bags and distributing them to farmers but they were not enough. “On Thursday, we have brought another 1,000 garbage bags,” said Jugraj Singh Jaggi, who belongs to Mundh village in Jalandhar, and heads a group of about 25 people under the banner of Fikr-e-Hond, an organisation that works for farmer welfare in Punjab. These men -- kitted out in blue half jackets and carrying broomsticks, dustpans and extra-large dustbin covers -- begin the cleaning exercise daily at 10am and continue till 5pm.“We realised that we were only organising langars (community kitchens) and doing nothing about the waste. We had made a lot of mess,” said Jaggi’s friend, Snehdeep Kamboj. Rajesh, a municipality sanitation worker from Sonepat, said he was among 20 workers deployed by the government soon after the protests began. “Now only 13 of us are working here. The work is a lot and we are too few hands to clean up everything,” said Rajesh. The drains here have been heavily clogged with decaying food, disposable plates, plastic glasses and all sorts of garbage. The empty plots have been used extensively for defecation and the streets are littered with waste. Sanitation work by civic agencies on the Delhi side is limited to areas not occupied by farmers. Jaggi’s group said they have been collecting at least four truckloads of garbage every day since Tuesday. “We take the garbage to a dump yard, 10km away. Cleaning the place will take a lot of effort and time, but we intend to sanitise the place and leave it better than when we arrived here,” said Kamboj. Jitender Singh, who belongs to Patiala town and calls himself a sewadar, said he was among another group of 15 farmers cleaning the streets from morning to evening. “The electronic media was reporting about the sanitation mess. No one should face problems because of us. So, we are apologising to the public and cleaning up,” said Jitender.He said he and his men have been loading the waste into trolleys and dumping them on empty plots away from the site. “Those empty plots already are filled with waste,” said Jitender whose group is associated with a gurdwara in Ludhiana. Then, there are individual farmers who have joined hands and divided the protest site into zones to ensure no area is left dirty. “We have formed groups of 10 each and assigned a few hundred metres of road to each group to keep clean,” said Palwinder Singh, a farmer from Badwa village in Ropar district, while carrying a large number of brooms that had been donated by a Delhi resident. Some groups are limiting themselves to distributing garbage covers. Dileep Singh of Khalsa Aid, a charitable organisation that is into “dry langar” and provides services such as free foot massages, sanitary napkins and undergarments, among others, said they have been disturbing garbage bins for quite some time now.Local residents, however, were unimpressed by all this and said the sanitation efforts were yet to make a difference to the area. “The farmers may have been cleaning the area where they are camping. But will they clean the adjacent empty plots which have been turned into open toilets for the past 20 days? The neighbourhood around here is stinking,” said Sanjay Sahni, a local trader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-start-cleaning-up-agitation-site-at-singhu-border-after-residents-complain/story-kZvdcNnRARXjF4r40Hc4PO.html
18-12-2020||Delhi||Riots case: During bail hearing, lawyers allude to epics Mahabharata, Ramayana to draw parallels||The Delhi Police on Thursday compared the Hindu epic Mahabharata to the north-east Delhi riots while stating that just like the epic, the riots were also a story of conspiracy, in which the ”Dhritarashtra (the blind king who had conspired to start the epic war)”, is yet to be identified.The submissions were made by special public prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad while opposing the bail plea of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student and Pinra Tod member Natasha Narwal. During the hearing, both the police and the counsel for the accused referred to the two epics of Mahabharata and Ramayana, to argue their cases, while drawing comparisons between the mythological characters and the alleged actors of the riots.Referring to the accused’s contention that the charge sheet was the second biggest document after the Mahabharata, Prasad told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that the WhatsApp group -- Delhi Protest Support Group (DPSG) -- was like the mythological character of Sanjaya, who had narrated the war and the other happenings to the blind king Dhritarashtra.Prasad alleged that DPSG controlled and monitored all protest sites and the intent was not a protest but a disruptive “chakka jam” or blockade, the end result of which was violence.“The accused’s counsel argued that the Mahabharata was 22,000 pages and the charge sheet was 17,000 pages. I would like to point out that Mahabharata was the story of a conspiracy and this case is also that of a conspiracy. In Mahabharata, Sanjaya was the one who was able to see everything, “ Prasad said.“The Sanjaya of this conspiracy was DPSG. Sanjaya was narrating everything to Dhritarashtra. The Dhritarasthra here is yet to be identified. We have seen that their (accused’s) intent was not protest, but a disruptive chakka jam and clear indications that the end result was violence,” the public prosecutor said.Detailing Narwal’s role, the SPP said she was brought on to the DPSG group after she was able to set up the protest site at Seelampur. She was part of the DPSG group which was controlling and monitoring all protest sites. She attended the alleged conspiratorial meeting of February 16 and February 17. The chats have clearly revealed that there was a proposal to incite violence.“She was privy to the principal conspirators. She was coordinating with the Jamia coordination committee. Detailed elaborations are not required on the merits at this point. The prima facie case stands established,” the public prosecutor said.Advocate Adit Pujari, appearing for Narwal, also referred to the Mahabharata and claimed that over the past eight-odd hearings, a “Chakravyuh ( a wheel formation to trap an opponent)” has been prepared by the prosecution, but his client, like the mythological character of Abhimanyu in the Mahabharata, would try to break out of it.“Let’s be very clear that the reason this is being done is because the charge sheet does not really contain a prima facie case,” he said.“This is not going to be a Ramayana where we are going to wait 14 years to see if we can finally come out… It is happening here and now; we are arguing this now,” Pujari said.Pujari said 53 people had died in the riots, but the charge sheet revolved around the deaths of only three persons— head constable Ratan Lal, civilian Rahul Solanki and intelligence bureau officer Ankit Sharma.He further said selective reading of WhatsApp chats by the prosecution was “unfair”.The bail plea will be further heard on December 22.Communal violence had broken out in north-east Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving 53 people dead and around 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/riots-case-during-bail-hearing-lawyers-allude-to-epics-mahabharata-ramyana-to-draw-parallels/story-kDWKWhFWPfjzy3erlAnGmL.html
18-12-2020||Pune||Wedding halls in Pune booked, but owners fail to make profits; couples prefer destination events||Its the last month of the year locked down by the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the virus has not been able to spoil the spirit of weddings in the city. With at least 35 muhurats or auspicious dates listed for weddings this month, couples and wedding planners are prepping up to cash in this opportunity.At least 80 weddings have been planned across wedding halls in the city, however, lawn owners are not happy as their business has not been lucrative with limited people. To stop the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection, various guidelines have been put in place including limited number of invitees and wedding planners have to provide safety measures like masks, gloves, sanitisation, among other things.The wedding planners are leaving no stone unturned to make it memorable for families which includes following Covid-19 protocols, maintaining social distancing, safety and hygiene along with screening it live for those who couldn’t join the event. Shreet Ghatpande and Dhanashree Sant, who will be tying the knot on December 24, are excited, but also find it difficult to curtail the list of invitees. “The only issue we faced while planning our wedding was curtailing the guest list,” said Shreet Deshpande, who is an architect. “Many of the weddings are the ones which had been postponed due to the lockdown and instead of waiting for the vaccine, they simply want to go ahead and get married,” said Mandar Desai, owner of two wedding halls on Karve road. He has his halls booked until January 2021 and people are still coming forward to book it in advance for the next few months. “We are following all the protocols laid down by the government and are making sure that people follow it,” he added.Pratik Jaywant Ghaisas got married on December 10. “We were to get married in May, but the wedding was postponed due to the lockdown, then when the unlock happened, we all thought of going ahead and getting married. Initially, I thought of getting a registered marriage done, but then my parents felt that since the opportunity was provided by the government, we could get married according to Vedic rituals following all Covid-19 protocols. We always wanted a small wedding and unknowingly Covid-19 has been a blessing for us, so we had to curtail the invites,” said Pratik, a travel enthusiast and tour arranger. “It was also difficult to decide how to invite and whom to invite, so instead we did a Facebook live for those who couldn’t join us,” he added.Shreyas Banquets ring in with tunes of shehnai as a wedding continues with 50 invitees on Thursday. “The bookings have started picking up now that the unlock has started. However, people are keen to have the capacity of 50 people be increased as 50 is a very small number for Indian functions. We are very strict about following the protocols. We tell the hosts about maintaining the numbers and also tell them to ask all their guests to wear masks. We sanitise the common surfaces frequently and conduct thermal checks of all the guests while all servers and staff members also follow the guidelines and wear masks, gloves and shields all the time,” said Radhika Chitale, managing the banquets.An average wedding package with food costs Rs 30,000 for 50 people and Chitale says that it is not possible to reduce the amount as they incur same costs to upkeep the hall and electricity.Kishore Sarpotdar, of Poona Guest House is busy. He caters to not just six wedding halls, but also has additional orders for Mehendi, Sangeet and other days pre-and post wedding ceremonies. “April and May 2021 are going to be very busy with as many 80 muhurats are on the calendar. Even though, the pandemic is still around, we are busy. The business is only to helping us break even as there is no profit catering for 50 people.” Many of the couples are also looking at destination weddings near Pune, Dhepe Wada and Fort Jadhavgadh which has been booked for the entire month for weddings.Sayali Ponkshe, an environmentalist preferred a destination wedding and said, “Due to Covid-19, we decided to opt for a very closed knit wedding of 50 people and that is when Dhepe Wada became a very prominent option. It was nearby, was built in nature and since I was getting married in another caste, we thought it would be a great opportunity to relive my culture one last time in the fullest way possible,” said Sayali.“We are a luxury wedding destination and enquiries have been great and are coming in constantly where families are now preferring to book the entire property for themselves. All Covid-19 guidelines are in place and followed sincerely by both the staff and the guests as they don’t want their functions to suffer. Having huge lawns and banquets has been a boon for us,” said Biswajit Biswas, general manager, Fort Jadhavgadh.Nitin Dhepe, owner Dhepe Wada, said, “A lot of people have preferred Dhepe Wada this year and we are full on many days till March 2021. People want to enjoy their wedding here in the traditional format while following all Covid-19 precautions. Unfortunately many bookings which had been made by overseas guest got cancelled/ postponed due to Covid-19.”Speaking about finances, he added that even though it is the wedding season, the halls are not making enough to even tide over the months they had to keep their business shut. According to Radhika Chitale, they had kept the margins less and have tailored the packages to suit 50 people. “It is hardly 10% of the revenue that we earn. Last year, in November-December, we would ideally host 50 weddings catering to 1,000 to 2,000 people unlike now, which are around 30 weddings in November-December with only 50 guests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/wedding-halls-booked-but-owners-fail-to-make-profits-couples-prefer-destination-events/story-aNAunOagUtYzgZUyzU5AEJ.html

18-12-2020||Pune||Maharashtra ready to start Covid-19 vaccination from January if Centre gives approval||The coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine will be administered to people in Maharashtra only on the basis of strict invitation where the recipient will receive a message or phone call post which he will have to ascertain his identity, said Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday. Tope said that at least 3 crore people, including healthcare workers, police and co-morbid patients will be administered Covid-19 vaccine from January, if the Centre gives the approval by the end of this month. “The government has made micro-level arrangements for vaccination. We plan to implement vaccination programme similar to the election process where a person will have to ascertain his identity and only then, he/she will be given the vaccine. We plan to either call or send a message to that person on the same day that he/she is likely to be vaccinated. This is to avoid any confusion and discrepancies,” said Tope while speaking to reporters. According to the minister, three crore people have been identified for vaccination in the first phase. “If the Centre approves the vaccine this month, we can start the drive from January,” said Tope. On the question of pricing, Tope asserted that the central government must give the Covid-19 vaccine to the people free of cost. However, if the Centre is not in a position to do so, then the state would think about distributing the vaccine for free. Meanwhile in Pune, the civic body identified about 1.34 lakh people in the city who have various comorbidities and who will now be prioritised for the Covid-19 vaccination under the phase three vaccine roll out programme by the central government. These comorbid patients have been identified during the state survey of ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ of the 33.4 lakh people who were inspected. The civic body is now focusing on storing close to eight-10 lakh vaccine doses which could be stored in its ice laced refrigerators. As per information from PMC’s health department, the survey was conducted between October 14 and October 24, about 9.91 lakh households were inspected in which 33.40 people were checked. Of those inspected, the survey found 1,34,465 people were found to have reported various comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension and obesity. Those with comorbidities have been preferred to get the vaccination as the fatality rate among this group is the highest. PMC department health chief, Dr Ashish Bharti, said, “Although we do not have a walk-in cold storage facility, we have around 55 ice-laced refrigerators and 35 deep freezers which can totally store about three-five lakh doses. Also the state’s storage facility is located in Pune itself which will be helpful for us. Most of the vaccines need a storage temperature similar to other Universal Immunization Programme vaccines which is 2⁰ to 8⁰ C.” As per the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) which has been constituted with representatives from across the country, the vaccination roll out would initially take place in three phases. The NEGVAC has prioritised health care workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW) and persons with different age-groups for Covid-19 vaccination. HCWs include healthcare providers and workers in healthcare settings, FLWs includes personnel from state and central police department, armed forces, home guard and civil defense organisations including disaster management volunteers and municipal workers (excluding HCWs) and the prioritised age group would be people above age of 50 years and persons below 50 years with associated comorbidities. The above 50 years of age group is further sub-categorised into those above 60 years of age and those aged between 50 and 60 years of age. Modalities for data collection of those below 50 year of age with age considered as on January 1, 2021, and those associated with any comorbid conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/maharashtra-ready-to-start-covid-19-vaccination-from-january-if-centre-gives-approval/story-aZ8BrSaC7x24J12Wfng4lN.html
18-12-2020||Pune||50 per cent of women in Pune district are anaemic: NHS||The National Health Survey (NHS), sections of which have been released this week, has found that 50 per cent of women in Pune district are anaemic. Also, 58 per cent of children between the ages of six months and 59 months are found to be anaemic in the district, as per the survey. Across Maharashtra, 21 per cent of men are also found to have an iron deficiency, causing anaemia. The scenario is equally bad in urban areas where anaemia affects over 50 per cent the women in the state. Dr Nina Mansukhani, a city-based gynaecologist, said that anaemia can be caused by deficiency of iron and B12. “In case of pregnant women, anaemia can lead to underweight newborns. Moreover, in India the maternal mortality rate is also high. And one of the major reasons for that is anaemia among pregnant women. During labour, women lose a lot of blood which leads to complications and even death. All of this can be simply stopped by getting a full check-up done before pregnancy. If there are any deficiencies it can be addressed,” said Dr Mansukhani. She highlighted that often, in rural areas, women do not eat properly, which leads to an iron and B12 deficiency. “In urban areas, women do not consume nutritional food and do not have a healthy balanced diet. This causes a B12 deficiency which leads to anaemia. Proper healthy diet and exercise is a must for women who want to conceive,” said Dr Mansukhani. Dr Mahendra Dadke, general physician with Jupiter Hospital in Pune, said that because of iron deficiency, the red blood cells (RBC) reduce in size and because of B12 deficiency, RBCs tend to increase in size. “Because of anaemia, organs can be affected in different ways. Hence, a healthy balanced diet is important. During the pandemic, we have realised the importance of strong immunity and a healthy lifestyle. It is imperative to maintain a good lifestyle to keep all sorts of infections, including Covid at bay,” said Dr Dadke. He added that general symptoms of anaemia are fatigue, exertion, inability to concentrate, swelling of the feet, giddiness and irritability. “This not only affects your personal life but reduces your productivity in work as well. In case you have low iron and low haemoglobin, you may suffer from breathlessness when you are Covid positive,” added Dr Dadke. Green leafy vegetables can help increase iron levels. “Along with that, you may include dates and jaggery. If your diet is vegetarian, then focusing on your B12 levels is important,” said Dr Dadke.

18-12-2020||Chandigarh||Kashmir ki kani: How a small village revived a dying craft||Many art forms die and are forgotten, but in Kanihama, which is being given the special status of ‘handloom village,’ the spectacularly beautiful ‘kani’ shawls, now GI (geographical indication) tagged, have been restored to life through the untiring efforts of a man named Ghulam Mohammad Kanihama.Once you enter the picturesque village with 400 households on the Srinagar Gulmarg highway you come across a group of artisans who have been busy for months weaving delicate pashmina yarn with hundreds of spools (or kani) that come together to form delightful patterns of flowers, leaves and birds on the finest of shawls. A GI tag is indicative of the specific geographical origin of a quality product. More than 50 years ago, the quest to revive the kani shawl began from the Wani House here with 10 villagers getting special training in weaving. “Our family has followed the tradition of weaving this style of shawl for generations. It is in our bloodline. Official estimates put the number of shawls produced in the village from 500 to 700 a year. The weaving is a meticulous process that takes about six months to two years to complete,” says Sajjad Wani, who has around 15 looms in the village. Starting with a small loom Ghulam Mohammad Kanihama, Wani’s father, was a member of the Jammu and Kashmir legislative assembly from Beerwah in Budgam district. “Almost all the weavers had stopped making these shawls in the 18th century after heavy taxes were imposed on this trade. Somehow it survived in our family. Being a weaver himself, my father set up a small loom in the house and hired an artisan to train young men from the village,” says Wani.Luckily, Kanihama had preserved some old designs from his forefathers and a few graphics of the weaving process which helped with the training, says Wani.“So great was his love for the kani shawl that my father sold a portion of his land to pay the weavers.Till his death in 2001, my father used to sit with weavers at the looms and discuss new designs,” says Wani, showing antique shawl designs preserved in his family for generations.Calling love for the art form “a gift from our forefathers, which we are passing to future generations,” Wani says, “In our family every person knows how these shawls are made, their designs and the yarns to be used. My young daughters who are studying are also well versed with this craft.” The villagers are proud of the fact that the tradition has not just been revived in their village, but that it has been adapted in other parts of Kashmir as well, especially in the neighbouring villages of Batapora, Mazhama and Roshanabad. “Two of our weavers were selected for national awards for producing the finest shawls on spools. Here you will find original products in the price range of Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh and nobody can challenge the quality of the shawls,” says Farooq Ahmad, a weaver from Batapora.The products have become a major source of income for villagers, says field officer, handloom development department, Syed Qadri. “Weavers, makers of spool and looms or dyers today have an income because of the shawls. The government initiative to declare Kaniwami as a handloom village has also given a boost to shawl making.” Things are changing for the better. “Besides giving money for setting up of new looms, the government under the scheme will be establishing a trade facilitation centre here for the weavers to display and sell their products with live demonstrations of shawl making, especially for tourists,” says Qadri.GI tagged villageDirector handicrafts Kashmir, Massratul Islam, says a handloom village status is for promoting art and craft, heritage and culture. “Once a gate is created marking Kanihama as a handloom village, tourists and art lovers will stop here to find out how the shawl is woven. Kashmir is the only place in the world where these shawls are made, woven through spools where the design is embedded in the weaving process. It has great potential in the international market.” Officials say that under a Centrally funded scheme Rs 5 crore will be given to the village where houses will be painted a uniform colour and weavers provided solar lights and work stations.A modern cafeteria will also be set up here.The villagers also feel the government should do more to help. “ I have taught my son this craft in spite of the fact that he is completing his postgraduate studies while weaving. For the last 47 years I have survived on the money I made from the shawls, but the government should do more to make our lives better. Other villages should get the handloom tag too,” says Ghulam Mohammad Reshi, an expert weaver and member of the Gul-e-Anar Cooperative Society established here years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kashmir-ki-kani-how-a-small-village-revived-a-dying-art/story-O2TPtJ78iZCTn4hWRZSomL.html
18-12-2020||Pune||One held, three other family members booked in Pune for assaulting Delhi police officials||PUNE: A Delhi police official has lodged a complaint against four members of a family residing at Chikhali, for assault. The police later arrested one and booked three family members. The complaint was lodged by sub-inspector Narendrakumar Nandlal Sahrawat (39) of New Delhi working with the Delhi police. He was accompanied by a staff member identified as Sanjeev, according to the complaint. The two Delhi police officials were on a lookout for a man named Deepak Sable who allegedly has a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against him issued by a local court in Delhi. The NBW is issued in a case of cheating, forgery, and criminal conspiracy registered against him in 2019. The four accused were identified as Sandeep Ramdas Sable, Kamal Ramdas Sable, Sunita Sandeep Sable and Sarita Deepak Sable, all residents of Ramdasnagar in Chikhali area of Pune. “They did not allow the policemen to enter the house located in a colony.

The papers said Jin’s employer is based in San Jose, California, which is where Zoom is headquartered.A spokesman for Zoom said the company is reviewing the complaint. Jin is not in US custody and a lawyer for him could not immediately be identified.“Jin willingly committed crimes, and sought to mislead others at the company, to help (Chinese) authorities censor and punish U.S. users’ core political speech merely for exercising their rights to free expression,” Acting US Attorney Seth DuCharme in Brooklyn said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-charges-china-based-zoom-executive-with-disrupting-tiananmen-video-commemorations/story-PiWxg8HnT1IX3uRD0Xp90L.html
18-12-2020||World||US Supreme Court throws out challenge to Donald Trump census immigrant plan||The US Supreme Court on Friday threw out a lawsuit seeking to block President Donald Trump’s plan to exclude immigrants living illegally in the United States from the population count used to allocate congressional districts to states.The 6-3 ruling on ideological lines, with the court’s six conservatives in the majority and three liberals dissenting, gives Trump a short-term victory as he pursues his hard-line policies toward immigration in the final weeks of his presidency. However, his administration is battling against the clock to follow through on the vaguely defined proposal before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan 20. The justices left open the possibility of fresh litigation if Trump’s administration completes its plan.The unsigned decision said that “judicial resolution of this dispute is premature” in part because it is not clear what the administration plans to do.“At present, this case is riddled with contingencies and speculation that impede judicial review,” the ruling said. The decision noted that the court was not weighing the merits of Trump’s plan.Challengers led by New York state and the American Civil Liberties Union said Trump’s proposal would dilute the political clout of states with larger numbers of such immigrants, including heavily Democratic California, by undercounting state populations and depriving them of seats in the US House of Representatives to the benefit of his fellow Republicans.“If the administration actually tries to implement this policy, we’ll sue. Again. And we’ll win,” said Dale Ho, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who represents the challengers.The administration has not disclosed what method it would use to calculate the number of people it proposed to exclude or which subsets of immigrants would be targeted. Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall told the justices during the Nov. 30 oral argument in the case that the administration could miss a Dec. 31 statutory deadline to finalize a Census Bureau report to Trump containing the final population data, including the number of immigrants excluded.During the oral argument, Wall told the justices that it is “very unlikely” the administration would amass data to exclude all immigrants in the country illegally. Instead, Wall said, it may propose excluding certain groups, such as the fewer than 100,000 in federal detention, and the total number may not be high enough to affect apportionment.Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in a dissenting opinion that the government can currently try to exclude millions of individuals, including those who are in immigration detention or deportation proceedings, and the some 700,000 young people known as “Dreamers” who came to the U.S. illegally as children. “Where, as here, the government acknowledges it is working to achieve an allegedly illegal goal, this court should not decline to resolve the case simply because the government speculates that it might not fully succeed,” Breyer added.There are an estimated 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally. The challengers have argued that Trump’s policy violates both the Constitution and the Census Act, a federal law that outlines how the census is conducted. The Constitution requires apportionment of House seats to be based upon the “whole number of persons in each state.” Until now, the U.S. government’s practice was to count all people regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. By statute, the president is required to send Congress a report in early January with the population of each of the states and their entitled number of House districts. The challengers have argued that Trump’s plan could leave several million people uncounted and cause California, Texas and New Jersey to lose House seats. A three-judge panel in New York ruled against the administration in September. The Supreme Court in June 2019 ruled against Trump’s effort to add a citizenship question to the census. Critics said the question was intended to frighten immigrants from taking part in the population count and artificially reduce population numbers in heavily Democratic areas, also to benefit Republicans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-throws-out-challenge-to-donald-trump-census-immigrant-plan/story-VxchsmqorIDnjbyDc4xdyL.html

Technology that helps with the production of the most-advanced chips -- those 10 nanometers or smaller -- face the “presumption of denial,’’ Commerce said. Other items will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.The decision comes barely a month before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.

The UK has already entered a tiered system with restrictions in place to minimise damage to the economy, jobs and livelihoods. However, the government has changed some social contact restrictions for a short period of time to let people celebrate the holidays with their friends and family. The government said that if anyone decides to form a Christmas bubble, the person can do so from December 23 to December 27 with people from no more than three households.Also Read | Another lockdown in England possible after Christmas, warns PM Boris JohnsonHere’s all you need to know about Christmas bubble:If a person chooses to form a Christmas bubble, there are some main rules to be followed to minimise the spread of the coronavirus. The person forming the Christmas bubble should remain in only one bubble and cannot change it midway. The bubble should not include people from more than three households.It is important that the person keeps the Christmas bubble as small as possible and those who are self-isolating must not form such a bubble. People should stop unnecessary social contact outside their immediate household as soon as possible and for at least five days before they meet other households in their bubble. The UK government said that if necessary, people can travel between tiers and UK nations to meet their Christmas bubble. However, they can meet their Christmas bubble only in private homes or in their garden, places of worship, or public outdoor spaces. They can meet people who are not in their Christmas bubble only outside their home, depending on the rules in the tier they have planned the meeting. They are not allowed to meet their Christmas bubble in any other indoor setting, such as a pub, hotel, shop, theatre, or restaurant.Meanwhile, the UK is witnessing a worrying rise in Covid-19 cases and related deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday said that a third lockdown cannot be ruled out in England due to the continued rise in new Covid-19 cases.

Behind the scenes, the talks are progressing, and such negative language is to be expected at this stage, both as a negotiating tactic and to manage expectations at home, they said. The discussions are continuing and, by Friday morning, Johnson had softened his rhetoric.‘Door Is Open’“Our door is open, we’ll keep talking,” he said in a pooled TV interview. “We hope that our EU friends will see sense and come to the table with something themselves.”Dozens of officials from both sides are in Brussels, ready to finalize an agreement over the next 48 hours. Talks between Barnier and his British counterpart, David Frost, restarted shortly around 3 pm after the Frenchman and his team consulted with national capitals on how far they are willing to compromise on fishing.On Thursday, the UK rejected the EU’s latest offer: that the bloc would give up about 23% of the fish it catches in British waters after a transition period of seven years, the people said. This marked movement on the European side -- it had previously offered to cede up to 18% after a 10-year transition period -- but is still far from the British demand of 60% after three years.The other major obstacle is the level competitive playing field for business. For months it looked like this was what could break the negotiations and while the issue isn’t completely resolved, the two sides are much closer to a solution, according to officials on both sides.For some weeks, the UK has objected to the EU’s plan to exempt central bloc financing, including its 750 billion-euro ($920 billion) pandemic relief package, from any restrictions on state aid, according to a British official.‘Every Effort’In a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday, Johnson said the UK was “making every effort to accommodate reasonable EU requests on the level playing field, but even though the gap had narrowed, some fundamental areas remained difficult.”Johnson said that the EU’s position on fisheries was “simply not reasonable and if there was to be an agreement it needed to shift significantly,” according to a statement from his office. “The UK could not accept a situation where it was the only sovereign country in the world not to be able to control access to its own waters for an extended period.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-gives-boris-johnson-fishing-ultimatum-as-brexit-reaches-climax/story-apeQ2n0PRoGWRsgFO8OIsK.html

In a press conference in Abu Dhabi on Friday, Qureshi said Islamabad had “credible information” that New Delhi was planning such a move.Qureshi told the media that New Delhi was trying to seek “tacit approval” for the strike from its “partners”. He didn’t share any details. In the press meet, which was held at the end of Qureshi’s two-day visit to the UAE, the Pakistan foreign minister said that he has shared his country’s concerns on this front with the UAE leadership.“An important development has cropped up… I’ve learned through our intelligence forces… that India is planning a surgical strike against Pakistan,” said Qureshi.He then claimed that India was already “trying to seek tacit approval” from what he called “important players who they consider to be their partners”. The Pakistan foreign minister claimed that India was facing an internal crisis because of what he called failed policies of the government. Qureshi criticised the Indian government’s handling of multiple issues, pointing to the situation in Kashmir, the farmers’ protest, the coronavirus pandemic, and the state of religious minorities in India.He also claimed that Pakistan has revealed that India was “sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan” in a dossier that it shared with the international community.The Pakistan foreign minister mentioned a recent report by EU DisinfoLab that claimed to have exposed a concerted Indian disinformation network of “fake websites and fake NGOs that they had launched with a sole objective to malign Pakistan”. Pakistan was “fully prepared to respond to and defeat India’s designs”, he said.The Pakistan foreign minister said the information of an imminent strike against Pakistan had been shared with relevant governments, who had briefed about India’s plans and Pakistan’s readiness to respond to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-planning-surgical-strike-against-us-seeking-approval-from-partners-pak-foreign-minister-sm-qureshi/story-AMQ7jMkwrZOHkrrHfS4dDI.html

18-12-2020||World||Mike Pence gets televised vaccination to show confidence in shot||Vice President Mike Pence received the coronavirus vaccine in a televised event at the White House on Friday in a bid to encourage Americans to get the shot.Pence received the first of two doses of Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine at an office building on the White House compound. Second Lady Karen Pence and Surgeon General Jerome Adams also received the vaccine.“History will record that this week was the beginning of the end of the coronavirus pandemic,” said Pence, who chairs the White House’s coronavirus task force. “But with cases rising across the country, hospitalizations rising across the country, we have a ways to go.”The US distributed about 2.9 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine this week, the first since its approval for use. More than 300,000 Americans have died from the virus, and new cases and current hospitalizations have reached record levels this month. Moderna Inc.’s vaccine could receive an emergency use authorization within hours, Pence said.Recent polls have shown that confidence in the vaccine is increasing but that many Americans still harbor doubts. Adams made a specific plea to the African American community to get the vaccine -- acknowledging lingering mistrust of the medical community after episodes such as the Tuskegee syphilis study, in which Black men were told they were receiving free health care from the government but were instead given placebos and other ineffective treatments for the illness.“Lack of trust, especially in communities of color, is not without good reason,” Adams said, pointing to the Tuskegee experiment and also the case of Henrietta Lacks, an African American woman who unwittingly donated cancer cells at Johns Hopkins Hospital, creating the first immortalized human cell line. Lacks was never asked to consent to her cells being reproduced for research.“As the U.S. Surgeon General and a Black man, I am equally aware of the symbolic significance of my vaccination here today,” Adams said at the event on Friday. “It would truly be the greatest tragedy of all if disparities in Covid outcomes actually worsened because the people who could most benefit from the vaccine can’t get it or won’t take it.”Trump has said he will take the vaccine, but hasn’t said when. Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Tuesday declined to set a timeline, or to commit to him getting it while still in office.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, hailed the milestone but warned that the pandemic won’t end quickly.“We all hope, and I think this is doable, that by the time we get to several months into this year, we will have enough people protected that we can start thinking seriously about the return to normality,” Fauci said.Pfizer’s vaccine requires two doses, meaning Pence and Adams will need to receive a second shot in three weeks.“I didn’t feel a thing,” Pence said of the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-gets-televised-vaccination-to-show-confidence-in-shot/story-gUKgIx0ZivK4eD1MWIQD3I.html

The rest will come from PA- or donor-funded vaccine purchases, the PA says.PA Health Minister Mai Alkaila estimated that the PA could receive an initial vaccine shipment by March. She did not say from whom.New coronavirus cases have spiked in recent weeks in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, which Israel keeps under a blockade citing threats from the coastal enclave’s Islamist rulers Hamas.The WHO says it is working with UN agencies to secure vaccines and medical equipment for Gaza. But some rights groups said it was Israel’s responsibility to ensure that Palestinians living in territory it captured in a 1967 war receive vaccines.“Israel is obligated to protect the health and safety of all people living under its control, including by ensuring that the vaccine is available in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza,” the Israeli rights group Gisha said.Deputy Israeli Health Minister Yoav Kisch said Israel would consider assisting the PA if “we see that Israel’s needs have been met and we have additional capacity.“There is also a significance and benefit in terms of preventing entry (of carriers) to our (side), in this matter. But Israel’s citizens come first,” Kisch told Kan radio.Gaza, whose densely concentrated and mostly poor population of 2 million is vulnerable to contagions, has logged 237 deaths and more than 32,000 cases of the coronavirus.The West Bank, home to 3 million Palestinians, has seen 86,594 cases and 846 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-scramble-for-covid-19-vaccines-as-israel-prepares-rollout/story-1F63i17KHfyZsyb64ceXaI.html
18-12-2020||World||Another lockdown in England possible after Christmas, warns PM Boris Johnson||A third lockdown in England cannot be ruled out after the Christmas period due to the continuing rise in new Covid-29 cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday, as Wales and Northern Ireland announced post-Christmas lockdowns to curb Covid-19 transmission.Relaxation in curbs across the UK during the Christmas period from December 23 to 27 is expected to lead to spikes in cases and deaths, with the British PM, ministers and health officials repeatedly urging Britons to act responsibly during the celebrations.Some hospitals in London, Leicester and Northampton have reported shortage of beds for Covid-19 patients. There have been two lockdowns so far this year. A three-tier alert system is currently in place to deal with the virus, with London among places in the top Tier 3 with the toughest curbs.Asked during a visit to Greater Manchester if he would rule out another lockdown in England after Christmas, Johnson said, “We’re hoping very much that we will be able to avoid anything like that. But the reality is that the rates of infection have increased very much in the last few weeks.”Urging people to “think about our elderly relatives” to “avoid spreading the disease” over Christmas, he added, “Keep it short, keep it small, have yourselves a very little Christmas as I said the other night - that is, I’m afraid, the way through this year.“Next year, I have no doubt that as we roll out the vaccine and all the other things that we’re doing, it will be very, very different indeed.”John Edmunds, epidemiologist and UK government adviser, said restrictions were likely to be tightened after Christmas, with current measures failing to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.He told Sky News, “At the moment, it doesn’t look like the tier system is holding the epidemic wave back, unfortunately. So I think we are going to have to look at these measures and perhaps tighten them up, we really will. It’s a horrible thing to have to say, but we are in quite a difficult position.”There were 35,383 new cases as of Thursday evening – seven times the peak of April-May – and 532 deaths. There were 18,009 Covid-19 patients in hospitals, including 1,340 on ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-lockdown-in-england-possible-after-christmas-warns-pm-boris-johnson/story-WnAP5T1VPKrSm7BH6WVCUP.html

18-12-2020||World||US vice president Mike Pence, wife Karen administered Covid-19 vaccine||Vice President Mike Pence was vaccinated for Covid-19 on Friday in a live-television event aimed at reassuring Americans the vaccine is safe.Pence’s wife Karen and Surgeon General Jerome Adams also received shots.President Donald Trump’s administration helped deliver vaccinations against the coronavirus earlier than even some in his administration thought possible, launching Operation Warp Speed — the government campaign to help swiftly develop and distribute vaccines — this spring with great fanfare in the White House Rose Garden.But five days into the largest vaccination campaign in the nation’s history, Trump has held no public events to trumpet the rollout. He hasn’t been inoculated himself. He has tweeted only twice about the shot. Pence, meanwhile, has taken center stage — touring a vaccine production facility this week and receiving a dose himself on live television Friday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell both said Thursday that they will get vaccinated in the next few days.Pence, along with his wife, Karen, and Surgeon General Jerome Adams, received their shots Friday morning in an office suite in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building from three medical technicians from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.Trump’s relative silence comes as he continues to stew about his defeat in the Nov. 3 election and embraces increasingly extreme efforts to overturn the people’s will. He’s pushed aside the plans of aides who wanted him to be the public face of the vaccination campaign, eschewing visits to labs and production facilities to thank workers, or hosting efforts to build public confidence in the shot, according to people familiar with the conversations.The sheepish approach has been surprising, especially for a president rarely shy to take credit, said Lawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown Law who focuses on public health.“The President’s relatively low profile on the Covid response since the election is curious and counter to Mr. Trump’s own interests,” he said. Gostin, who has criticized Trump’s handling of the pandemic in the past, said that he “deserves a great deal of credit” for Operation Warp Speed and placing a bet on two vaccines that use groundbreaking mRNA technology.“Having exhibited leadership in the vaccines’ development, he should take great pride in publicly demonstrating his trust in Covid vaccines,” he said.Trump did appear at a White House “summit” ahead of the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the Pfizer vaccine last week. That event included an introductory video highlighting the past comments of those — including top government infectious-disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci — who doubted a shot would be ready this year.But many Trump aides are puzzled by his low profile now that the vaccine is actually being injected. They see it as a missed opportunity for the president, who leaves office at noon on Jan. 20, to claim credit for helping oversee the speedy development and deployment of the vaccine that is expected to finally contain the virus that has killed more than 310,000 Americans.Trump himself has tried to minimize any credit that might go to his successor, President-elect Joe Biden, who will preside over the bulk of the nationwide injection campaign next year. Biden expects to receive his shot as soon as next week.“Don’t let Joe Biden take credit for the vaccines,” Trump has told reporters. “Don’t let him take credit for the vaccines because the vaccines were me, and I pushed people harder than they’ve ever been pushed before.”Despite Trump’s claims, FDA scientists were the ones who came up with the idea for Operation Warp Speed, the White House-backed effort through which millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines and treatments are being manufactured even as they are still being evaluated. And much of the groundwork for the shots was laid over the past decade, including through research on messenger RNA, or mRNA, used in the vaccines developed by both Pfizer and Moderna. Pfizer developed its vaccine outside Operation Warp Speed but is partnering with the federal government on manufacturing and distribution.Trump’s low-key approach could have an impact on public health. Fauci told NBC News this week that 75% to 85% of the nation needs to be vaccinated to achieve “herd immunity,” making the public education campaign about the vaccine’s safety all the more pressing.A survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that only about half of Americans want to get the vaccine as soon as possible. Another quarter of the public isn’t sure, while the remaining quarter say they aren’t interested. Some simply oppose vaccines in general. Others are concerned that the injections have been rushed and want to see how the rollout goes.As Trump sat on the sidelines, some of his favored commentators, including Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, were questioning the safety of the vaccine.White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern said Trump “will continue to update the country through a variety of means while giving medical professionals and hardworking staff at OWS the space to do their jobs and save lives.”While senior officials are beginning to make plans to receive the vaccine in public to help build public confidence, Trump, who was hospitalized with Covid-19 in October, is taking his time.According to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is not yet enough information to determine whether those who have had Covid-19, like Trump, should get the vaccine. Still, Fauci recommended that Trump take it publicly without delay.“Even though the president himself was infected, and he has, likely, antibodies that likely would be protective, we’re not sure how long that protection lasts. So, to be doubly sure, I would recommend that he get vaccinated as well as the vice president,” Fauci told ABC News.It was not clear whether first lady Melania Trump, who came down with Covid-19 at the same time as her husband, would be vaccinated.“The last thing I would say to every American is be confident that we have cut red tape, but we’ve cut no corners when it comes to the development of this vaccine,” Pence said this week at an Indiana vaccine production facility.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters this week that Trump, who has previously spread misinformation about other vaccines, was trying to send a message about priorities by delaying his own inoculation.“The president wants to send a parallel message which is, you know, our long-term care facility residents and our front-line workers are paramount in importance,” she said.Gostin disagreed. ”It will be enormously damaging to public trust in the vaccine if President Trump isn’t visibly enthusiastic, including getting his shot on national television,” he argued. “It simply isn’t good enough to have Vice President Pence as a proxy.”Presidents and their family members have often made a display of their vaccinations to boost public confidence. President Dwight Eisenhower highlighted that one of his grandchildren was among the first wave of American children vaccinated for polio. In 2009, President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, vaccinated both their young daughters, who were in a higher risk group, for the swine flu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vice-president-mike-pence-wife-karen-administered-covid-19-vaccine/story-ysrYqc0nr1PJCTV0QVxywI.html
18-12-2020||World||Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine ‘overwhelmingly approved’, distribution to start soon, says US President Trump||President Donald Trump said Friday that the United States has authorized a second coronavirus vaccine, jumping the gun on regulators who have yet to give it the formal green light.“Moderna vaccine overwhelmingly approved. Distribution to start immediately,” he wrote on Twitter.This follows a recommendation by an expert panel on Thursday to grant emergency use approval for Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine in the United States.The Food and Drug Administration is expected to issue formal approval Friday. This would make Moderna’s vaccine the second to be approved in a Western country following the one developed by Pfizer-BioNTech.Trump’s announcement came as US Vice President Mike Pence and his wife received the Covid-19 vaccine live on television, in a public display designed to boost national confidence in the measure.Pence indicated that formal approval for Moderna would be a matter of hours.Moderna vaccine overwhelmingly approved. Distribution to start immediately.“We have one, perhaps within hours two, safe and effective coronavirus vaccines,” he said.Thursday’s hearing came as the number of deaths from the coronavirus quickly approaches 310,000 in the country with the world’s biggest Covid-19 outbreak, which this week began vaccinating health care workers and long-term care residents with the Pfizer vaccine.Both of the frontrunner vaccines are based on cutting-edge mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology, which had never been approved prior to the pandemic, and both are two-dose regimens. The US, which has recorded more than 17 million cases of the virus, will probably become the first country to approve the Moderna vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine-overwhelmingly-approved-distribution-to-start-soon-says-us-president-trump/story-wZO6k2JCYyya8Y8wVsXAiN.html
18-12-2020||World||Winter travel raises more fears of coronavirus spread||Tens of millions of people are expected to travel to family gatherings or winter vacations over Christmas, despite pleas by public health experts who fear the result could be another surge in Covid-19 cases.In the US, AAA predicts that about 85 million people will travel between Dec. 23 and Jan. 3, most of them by car. If true, that would be a drop of nearly one-third from a year ago, but still a massive movement of people in the middle of a pandemic.Jordan Ford, 24, who was laid off as a guest-relations worker at Disneyland in March, said he plans to visit both his and his boyfriend’s families in Virginia and Arkansas over Christmas.“It is pretty safe — everyone is wearing a mask, they clean the cabin thoroughly,” said Ford, who has traveled almost weekly in recent months from his home in Anaheim, California, and gets tested frequently. “After you get over that first trip since the pandemic started, I think you’ll feel comfortable no matter what.”Experts worry that Christmas and New Year’s will turn into super-spreader events because many people are letting down their guard — either out of pandemic fatigue or the hopeful news that vaccines are starting to be distributed.“Early on in the pandemic, people didn’t travel because they didn’t know what was to come,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious-disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco, “but there is a feeling now that, ‘If I get it, it will be mild, it’s like a cold.’”The seven-day rolling average of newly reported infections in the US has risen from about 176,000 a day just before Thanksgiving to more than 215,000 a day. It’s too early to calculate how much of that increase is due to travel and gatherings over Thanksgiving, but experts believe they are a factor.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says “postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19.” People who insist on travel should consider getting tested for the virus before and after their trip and to limit non-essential activities for seven days after travel with a negative test result and 10 days if they don’t get tested.Other countries have imposed restrictions ahead of the holidays. Last month, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland agreed to permit a maximum of three households to mix between Dec. 23 and Dec. 27, regardless of what local restrictions are in place.In Latin America, a few countries have imposed some restrictions to try to keep people from traveling or meeting during the holidays, but others advised people only to practice social distancing and skip parties.Panama has some of the strictest measures, including a curfew through Jan. 4 and a prohibition on leaving home at all from Dec. 25 to 28 and Jan. 1 to 4 unless it’s for essential activities such as buying food or medicine. Peru, one of the region’s hardest-hit countries, has banned the use of private cars on Christmas Eve and Day and New Year’s Eve and Day in hopes of discouraging people from traveling.In the US, Rachel Watterson delayed her New Year’s Eve wedding because her fiance’s family can’t travel to the United States from their home in Germany. Instead, the couple plans to elope and will fly from their home in Chicago to Hawaii with her parents, her brother and a friend. They picked Hawaii because of requirements that include coronavirus testing before arrival and a rapid test at the airport.“We felt this was one of the very few safe choices we can make if we are going to travel,” Watterson said.Tim Brooks, a 37-year-old engineer in Long Beach, California, canceled a trip to Grand Cayman because of a ban on international visitors, then scrapped a Christmas visit to his parents in North Carolina as infections spiked in California and around the country.“If it were just us, it wouldn’t be so bad, but we have older parents and we are trying to keep them safe,” Brooks said.Airports and planes will be far less crowded this year in what is normally a high travel season. So far in December, air travel in the United States is down 67% from last year. If Thanksgiving is any indication, the number of travelers will rise the rest of the month, but airlines are warning that bookings have slowed down since the latest surge in Covid-19 cases.The nation’s top four airlines now show December and January schedules that are anywhere from 33% to 46% smaller than a year earlier, according to figures from Airline Data Inc.Last week, the average flight within the US was only 49% full compared with more than 80% full a year ago, according to the trade group Airlines for America.The short-term outlook remains grim for other travel-related businesses, including those that rely on winter tourism.In Vermont ski country, the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe is usually sold out during Christmas week, but only half the 96 rooms were booked by last week. It was a similar story at the nearby Lodge at Spruce Peak. Operators of both lodges blamed travel restrictions, especially quarantine requirements that are triggered by crossing state lines.“It is frustrating as a business to basically be forbidden to do your job and to not be able to support your employees or your community,” said Sam von Trapp, executive vice president of the family’s lodge. “At the same time we understand that there is very good intention behind all these restrictions.”Cruise ships often command their highest prices at Christmas and other holidays when kids are off school, but few ships are sailing this season. Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and Disney have all cancelled US sailings through Feb. 28. Voyages in other parts of the world have mostly been delayed.Florida, which relies heavily on winter tourism, is also taking a big hit. The two-week period around Christmas is normally the busiest time of year for Walt Disney World in Orlando, says Len Testa, the president of TouringPlans.com, which forecasts park attendance. But this year, the Magic Kingdom has capped park attendance at 35%, so Testa only expects around 32,000 people on those days.Testa also expects crowd levels to be lower than usual from January through March, with many visitors rescheduling their trips to May or later.“Many families will put off their Spring Break trips until they’re vaccinated,” he said.Tara Kelley had planned to drive seven hours from her home in Milligan, Florida, to Orange City, Florida, to visit her mother and stepfather for Christmas. But Kelley’s wife recently had surgery and spent a day at a hospital where there was a risk of exposure to the coronavirus, so they called off the trip.“We had literally been planning this since February,” Kelley said. “It’s a blow.”Theresa Medina, a 55-year-old retiree from South Boston, is still deciding whether she and her husband will visit his mother in the Dominican Republic this winter. She’s 80% sure they will, and she’s already packing a box to ship ahead of their arrival. But the couple plans to discuss it with her husband’s doctor in January.If they go, Medina said they will get coronavirus tests and wear protective gear, including face shields and masks.“We may look silly on the plane, but precautions are precautions,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/winter-travel-raises-more-fears-of-coronavirus-spread/story-mJ1n9usmHPl20ZFOmDmktI.html
18-12-2020||World||US does not use CAATSA for punitive actions against allies: Cooper||A tough US law which authorises the administration to impose sanctions on countries that purchase major defence hardware from Russia is not aimed at taking punitive actions against friends and allies, a senior American diplomat has said.Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs R Clark Cooper’s remarks on Thursday came after the US on Monday imposed sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act or CAATSA on its NATO ally, Turkey, for procuring Russia’s advanced S-400 missile defence system. The US law known as CAATSA is aimed at pushing back on Russian influence. It primarily deals with sanctions on Russian interests such as its oil and gas industry, defence and security sectors, and financial institutions, following Moscow’s military intervention in Ukraine in 2014 and its alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. “The CAATSA sanctions are not designed to be punitive to a partner and ally that has got a sustainment issue or an operation or maintenance issue. We’re certainly not looking to disrupt that. Why? Well, we don’t want a partner’s sovereign defence capabilities to be degraded to put their readiness at risk,” Cooper told reporters during a conference call.He was responding to a question on the possibility of sanctions on India under CAATSA because of the purchase of S-400s from Russia.In October 2018, India signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, notwithstanding warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanction.In view of the evolving security scenario in its neighbourhood, India recently requested Russia to explore the possibility of advancing the supply of the interceptor-based missile systems which can destroy incoming hostile aircraft, missiles and even drones at ranges of up to 400 km.Last year, India made the first tranche of payment of around USD 800 million to Russia for the S-400 missile systems.Cooper said CAATSA is designed to address new significant acquisitions, procurements of Russian systems that would put at risk anything that would be interoperable with US systems or NATO systems.“I would say that one thing, too, from an Indian perspective in particular, which is why I raised the legacy issue, CAATSA’s not, again, designed to take punitive action in that space. It’s to mitigate and prevent the significant addition of high-level, high-tech Russian systems,” he asserted.Cooper said CAATSA sanctions are of a global nature. They are not limited to a particular state or region, and there is no timeline.“There had been questions posed to me and to other colleagues as to we thought sanctions weren’t going to be issued to Turkey because nothing had been done in the last few months. That’s to just remind that there’s no clock (timeline) on the US government applying them, and there’s also no blanket waiver either. I know some states have thought or sought that either Congress or the Executive Branch would apply a waiver on sanctions, and I just would offer that is definitely not the case,” Cooper said.On sanctions on Turkey, he said, “This was for their knowingly engaging in transactions of a significant nature with Russia. This is particularly with the Rosoboronexport, Russian main arms export entity. This is for the procurement of the S-400. It’s a surface-to-air missile system.” The Defence Industry Presidency or SSB is a Turkish government procurement entity that purchases defence equipment and has the responsibilities for the defence industrial development of Turkey. This was the target of the CAATSA sanctions, Cooper said.“This was a very hard but necessary choice. And because Turkey has status not only as a bilateral ally with us but as a NATO member and an ally, the US undertook exhaustive efforts to engage diplomatically with the Turkish government at every level to provide an offramp from the S-400 acquisition,” he said.NATO or the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is an intergovernmental military alliance between 30 European and North American countries.Cooper said the US made it very clear to Turkey at the highest levels and on numerous occasions that its purchase and pursuit of the S-400 system would endanger the security of US military technology and personnel and provide substantial funds to Russia’s defence sector.“This is to get even more granular about this, this is also in the frame of Russia’s access to Turkish armed forces and defence industry. Nevertheless, Turkey did decide to move ahead with procurement and the testing of the S-400 system. And this decision resulted in both Turkey’s suspension from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme and now sanctions under CAATSA,” he said.Turkey procured and tested the S-400 despite the availability of the alternative, Cooper said.That alternative was the NATO interoperable systems that are available, particularly the US-made Patriot battery system. “This was made available to meet Turkey’s defence requirements. Further, this step should send a clear message globally: CAATSA is designed to impose costs on Russia in response to its malicious cyber activities, its unacceptable behaviour in Ukraine, and other malign activities worldwide,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-does-not-use-caatsa-for-punitive-actions-against-allies-cooper/story-8DiruT9FJsT0qAdtrJcAAP.html
18-12-2020||World||‘Unbelievable’ snowfall blankets parts of the US Northeast||The Northeast’s first whopper snowstorm of the season buried parts of upstate New York under more than 3 feet (1 meter) of snow, broke records in cities and towns across the region, and left plow drivers struggling to clear the roads as snow piled up at more than 4 inches (10 centimeters) per hour.“It was a very difficult, fast storm and it dropped an unbelievable amount of snow,” Tom Coppola, highway superintendent in charge of maintaining 100 miles (160 kilometers) of roads in the Albany suburb of Glenville, said Thursday. “It’s to the point where we’re having trouble pushing it with our plows.”The storm dropped 30 inches (76 centimeters) on Glenville between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. Thursday, leaving a silent scene of snow-clad trees, buried cars and laden roofs when the sun finally peeked through at noon.“If you do not have to be on the roads, please don’t travel,” said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who declared a state of emergency for 18 counties. He said there were more than 9,000 power outages, 600 accidents and two fatalities by midmorning Thursday.In New Rochelle in Westchester County, where a foot of snow was recorded, the roof of a Mavis Discount Tire store partially caved in but no injuries were reported, according to CBSN New York.In Broome County, where the regional center of Binghamton got a record 42 inches (107 centimeters) of snow, County Executive Jason Garnar said snow fell at a rate of 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12 centimetres) per hour.“This is the fastest rate of snowfall I’ve ever encountered,” he said.In Ithaca, it took Fred Cullin, 23, more than an hour and a half to dig out of his steep, lakeside driveway that was packed with nearly 3 feet of snow piled up by plows.“It was pretty crazy,” Cullin said. “Shoveling uphill, on ice, was definitely interesting.”Much of Pennsylvania saw accumulations in the double digits.Boston had more than 9 inches (23 centimeters) of snow early Thursday morning, breaking the previous record for the date of 6.4 inches (16.3 centimeters) in 2013. In Boston’s Seaport neighborhood, the streets were mostly empty except for an army of workers blowing sidewalks clear in front of luxury apartment buildings, stores and office towers.“It’s been a while since we have had this,” said Mark Pusung, a 33-year-old Seaport resident walking his Shar-Pei dog Muffin. “I wanted my dog to experience it because he could run around.”Xicheng Cai, 28, a consultant who lives and works in Seaport, was decked out in what he called his full polar gear including boots, windproof pants and ski goggles.“Wonderful,” he said of the snow. “This is what Christmas should look like.”A few blocks away, Sara Boxell, 33, who lives in South Boston, was in the middle of her 4-mile run.“I love it,” she said. “Luckily, I’m working from home so I don’t have to drive anywhere.”Massachusetts’ transportation chief said it could take longer than usual to clear snow-clogged highways and streets because the coronavirus pandemic has knocked one in 10 plow drivers out of action.Parts of northern New England saw as much as 7 inches (18 centimeters) of snow per hour, said Margaret Curtis, meteorologist for the National Weather Service. A rate of 1 inch per hour is typically enough to make it hard for snowplow trucks to keep up.Snow totals topped 3 feet across a wide swath of New Hampshire, and Maine’s southernmost county saw 1 to 2 feet.Hazardous roads caused dozens of crashes in New Hampshire, Connecticut and eastern New York. New York State Police said a snowmobiler was struck and killed by a tractor-trailer on Interstate 787 in downtown Albany at 2:30 a.m.In Maine, snowboarder Fletcher Moffett grabbed a few runs at the Sunday River ski resort before reporting to work as a bartender.“Being outside is keeping me sane” during the pandemic, he said.The overnight snowfall eclipsed the entire amount recorded for all of last winter in New York City, where 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of snow covered Central Park — much less than the initial predictions of up to 12 inches (30 centimeters). Snowplows were careful to avoid damaging outdoor dining spaces erected for the pandemic at Manhattan restaurants, where dining was to resume Thursday night.In a lighthearted moment at a daily briefing by Mayor Bill de Blasio, the official in charge of snow removal, Edward Grayson, cautioned: “It’s not a night to wear your good shoes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unbelievable-snowfall-blankets-parts-of-the-us-northeast/story-UqECu107XT09lqIBBoKndI.html

The explosion took place around 2pm where the Holy Quran was being recited, said the Interior Affairs Ministry’s spokesman Tariq Arian. So far, no group has taken the responsibility for the blast. “Explosion at the recitation of the Quran. Around 2 o’clock today, a car full of explosives exploded in one of the houses located in Aghojan area of Gilan district of Ghazni, where the recitation of the Holy Quran was taking place. Unfortunately, 15 of our civilian compatriots were martyred and 20 others were injured. We will share the details of the completion later,” tweeted Arian in Pashto. A similar incident took place in another residential house in Aghojan area of Gilan district of Ghazni province killing four and wounding five on Friday morning. The Interior Affairs Ministry said the explosion took place at the end of the Quran at around 9am, full details to be released later. د قرانکریم په ختم کې چاودنهنن شاوخوا ۲ بجې د غزني ولایت د ګیلان ولسوالۍ د اغوجان سیمې اړوند په یوه استوګنیز کور کې چې د قران شریف ختم روان و، له چاودېدونکو توکو ډک زرنج چاودلی. په خواشینۍ سره زموږ ۱۵ تنه ملکیان شهیدان شوي او ۲۰ تنه نور ټپیان دي. بشپړ جزییات وروستهThe attacks come amidst increasing Taliban-caused violence in the country and in the background of Afghan peace talks.Earlier in the afternoon, the Taliban destroyed part of roads in Delaram Nimroz district that connects the Herat-Kabul highway.

18-12-2020||World||1 in 5 prisoners in the US has had Covid-19, 1,700 have died||One in very five state and federal prisoners in the United States has tested positive for the coronavirus, a rate more than four times higher than the general population. In some states, more than half of prisoners have been infected, according to data collected by The Associated Press and The Marshall Project.As the pandemic enters its 10th month — and as the first Americans begin to receive a long-awaited Covid-19 vaccine — at least 275,000 prisoners have been infected, more than 1,700 have died and the spread of the virus behind bars shows no sign of slowing. New cases in prisons this week reached their highest level since testing began in the spring, far outstripping previous peaks in April and August.“That number is a vast undercount,” said Homer Venters, the former chief medical officer at New York’s Rikers Island jail complex.Venters has conducted more than a dozen court-ordered Covid-19 prison inspections around the country. “I still encounter prisons and jails where, when people get sick, not only are they not tested but they don’t receive care. So they get much sicker than need be,” he said.Now the rollout of vaccines poses difficult decisions for politicians and policymakers. As the virus spreads largely unchecked behind bars, prisoners can’t social distance and are dependent on the state for their safety and well-being.Donte Westmoreland, 26, was recently released from Lansing Correctional Facility in Kansas, where he caught the virus while serving time on a marijuana charge. Some 5,100 prisoners have become infected in Kansas prisons, the third-highest Covid-19 rate in the country, behind only South Dakota and Arkansas.“It was like I was sentenced to death,” Westmoreland said.Westmoreland lived with more than 100 virus-infected men in an open dorm, where he woke up regularly to find men sick on the floor, unable to get up on their own, he said.“People are actually dying in front of me off of this virus,” he said. “It’s the scariest sight.” Westmoreland said he sweated it out, shivering in his bunk until, six weeks later, he finally recovered.Half of the prisoners in Kansas have been infected with Covid-19 — eight times the rate of cases among the state’s overall population. Eleven prisoners have died, including five at the prison where Westmoreland was held. Of the three prison employees who have died in Kansas, two worked at Lansing Correctional Facility.In Arkansas, where more than 9,700 prisoners have tested positive and 50 have died, four of every seven have had the virus, the second-highest prison infection rate in the US.Among the dead was 29-year-old Derick Coley, who was serving a 20-year sentence at the Cummins Unit maximum security prison. Cece Tate, Coley’s girlfriend, said she last talked with him on April 10 when he said he was sick and showing symptoms of the virus.“It took forever for me to get information,” she said. The prison finally told her on April 20 that Coley had tested positive for the virus. Less than two weeks later, a prison chaplain called on May 2 to tell her Coley had died.The couple had a daughter who turned 9 in July. “She cried and was like, ‘My daddy can’t send me a birthday card,’” Tate said. “She was like, ‘Momma, my Christmas ain’t going to be the same.’”Nearly every prison system in the country has seen infection rates significantly higher than the communities around them. In facilities run by the federal Bureau of Prisons, one of every five prisoners has had coronavirus. Twenty-four state prison systems have had even higher rates.Prison workers have also been disproportionately affected. In North Dakota, four of every five prison staff has gotten coronavirus. Nationwide, it’s one in five.Not all states release how many prisoners they’ve tested, but states that test prisoners broadly and regularly may appear to have higher case rates than states that don’t.Infection rates as of Tuesday were calculated by the AP and The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization covering the criminal justice system, based on data collected weekly in prisons since March. Infection and mortality rates may be even higher, since nearly every prison system has significantly fewer prisoners today than when the pandemic began, so rates represent a conservative estimate based on the largest known population.Yet, as vaccine campaigns get underway, there has been pushback in some states against giving the shots to people in prisons early.“There’s no way it’s going to go to prisoners ... before it goes to the people who haven’t committed any crime,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis told reporters earlier this month after his state’s initial vaccine priority plans put prisoners before the general public.Like more than a dozen states, Kansas’s vaccination plan does not mention prisoners or corrections staff, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a non-partisan prison data think tank. Seven states put prisoners near the front of the line, along with others living in crowded settings like nursing homes and long-term care facilities. An additional 19 states have placed prisoners in the second phase of their vaccine rollouts.Racial disparities in the nation’s criminal justice system compound the disproportionate toll the pandemic has taken on communities of color. Black Americans are incarcerated at five times the rate of whites. They are also disproportionately likely to be infected and hospitalized with Covid-19, and are more likely than other races to have a family member or close friend who has died of the virus.The pandemic “increases risk for those who are already at risk,” said David J. Harris, managing director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School.This week, a Council on Criminal Justice task force headed by former attorneys general Alberto Gonzalez and Loretta Lynch released a report calling for scaling back prison populations, improving communication with public health departments and reporting better data.Prison facilities are often overcrowded and poorly ventilated. Dormitory-style housing, cafeterias and open-bar cell doors make it nearly impossible to quarantine. Prison populations are sicker, on average, than the general population and health care behind bars is notoriously substandard. Nationwide, the mortality rate for Covid-19 among prisoners is 45% higher than the overall rate.From the earliest days of the pandemic, public health experts called for widespread prison releases as the best way to curb virus spread behind bars. In October, the National Academies of Science, Medicine, and Engineering released a report urging states to empty their prisons of anyone who was medically vulnerable, nearing the end of their sentence or of low risk to public safety.But releases have been slow and uneven. In the first three months of the pandemic, more than 10,000 federal prisoners applied for compassionate release. Wardens denied or did not respond to almost all those requests, approving only 156 — less than 2%.A plan to thin the state prison population in New Jersey, first introduced in June, was held up in the Legislature because of inadequate funding to help those who were released. About 2,200 prisoners with less than a year left to serve were ultimately released in November, eight months after the pandemic began.California used a similar strategy to release 11,000 people since March. But state prisons stopped accepting new prisoners from county jails at several points during the pandemic, which simply shifted the burden to the jails. According to the state corrections agency, more than 8,000 people are now waiting in California’s county jails, which are also coronavirus hot spots.“We call that ‘screwing county,’” said John Wetzel, Pennsylvania’s secretary of corrections, whose prison system has one of the lower Covid-19 case rates in the country, with one in every seven prisoners infected. But that’s still more than three times the statewide rate.Prison walls are porous even during a pandemic, with corrections officers and other employees traveling in and out each day.“The interchange between communities and prisons and jails has always been there, but in the context of Covid-19 it’s never been more clear,” said Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, a professor of social medicine at UNC-Chapel Hill who studies incarceration and health. “We have to stop thinking about them as a place apart.”Wetzel said Pennsylvania’s prisons have kept virus rates relatively low by widely distributing masks in mid-March — weeks before even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began recommending them for everyday use in public — and demanding that staff and prisoners use them properly and consistently. But prisoners and advocates say prevention measures on the ground are uneven, regardless of Wetzel’s good intentions.As the country heads into winter with virus infections on the rise, experts caution that unless Covid-19 is brought under control behind bars, the country will not get it under control in the population at large.“If we are going to end this pandemic — bring down infection rates, bring down death rates, bring down ICU occupancy rates — we have to address infection rates in correctional facilities,” said Emily Wang, professor at Yale School of Medicine and co-author of the recent National Academies report.“Infections and deaths are extraordinarily high. These are wards of the state, and we have to contend with it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-in-5-prisoners-in-the-us-has-had-covid-19-1-700-have-died/story-kyaN29AMQnuBhKpaHn9B9H.html

Here’s why||After the United States tried to block the appointment of Nigeria’s ex-finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the chief of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in October, the Trump administration has suggested that it wants the race for the leadership reopened. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Wednesday told BBC that the WTO needs “someone with real experience in trade”, adding that the organisation dealing with international trade “is massively in need of reform.”The deadlock at the WTO comes at a time when the global trade is struggling to overcome the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The WTO plays an important role as a negotiating body and regulating international trade. The Appellate Body of the organisation, comprised of seven persons, hears appeals from reports issued by panels in disputes brought on by WTO members. However, the Trump administration has been vetoing the appointment of new judges to the Appellate Body as well.Also Read | Australia to challenge China at the WTO amid worsening diplomatic relationsWhy the US wants the WTO leadership race reopened?WTO nominations committee had recommended the members to appoint Okonjo-Iweala, who enjoys widespread support from other countries, as the next Director-General. She would be the first woman and first African to lead the organisation. However, the office of the US Trade Representative lent its support to South Korean trade minister Yoo Myung-hee as the next WTO Director-General.In a statement critical of the WTO, the US Trade Representative office had said that there have been no multilateral tariff negotiations in 25 years. It complained about the dispute settlement system, saying it has gotten “out of control”. It also lamented that many of the WTO members have failed to fulfil “basic transparency obligations.”“The WTO is badly in need of major reform. It must be led by someone with real, hands-on experience in the field,” the statement read.The Trump administration believes minister Yoo is a “bona fide trade expert” and has all the skills necessary to be an “effective leader” of the organisation. The appointment process is likely to be delayed for several months if the new WTO Director-General is not appointed before the inauguration of US President-elect Joe Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-adminstration-wants-wto-leadership-race-reopened-here-s-why/story-zAuYDiv8WM1R7sjiQVdbYI.html
18-12-2020||World||EU says post-Brexit trade talks with UK face ‘last attempt’ to fix fish||The European Union’s chief negotiator said Friday that the bloc and the United Kingdom are starting a “last attempt” to clinch a post-Brexit trade deal, with EU fishing rights in British waters the most notable remaining obstacle to avoid a chaotic and costly changeover on New Year.Michel Barnier told the EU parliament he “can’t say what will come out during this home straight of the negotiations,” which have already come a long way in nine months of talks. He called it “a very serious and somber situation” with the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people at stake.The EU parliament has set a Sunday night deadline on the talks since it still will have to approve any deal ahead of year-end, when a transition period following the Jan. 31 departure of Britain from the bloc will expire.“It’s the moment of truth,” said Barnier. “We have very little time remaining — just a few hours.”A failure to reach a post-Brexit deal would lead to more chaos on the borders at the start of 2021 as new tariffs would add to other impediments to trade that are enacted by both sides. The talks have got bogged down on two main issues over the past days — the EU’s access to U.K. fishing waters and assurances of fair competition between businesses.“We have reached the hard nuts to crack,” said Barnier.He said the EU understood and respected the U.K. desire to rule its own waves, but said that “a credible period of adjustment” had to be given, if EU boats are to be kicked out of British waters despite centuries of tradition of sharing them.On top of that, the more London denies access to its waters, the more the EU can impose duties and tariffs.“The European Union also has to maintain its sovereign right to react or to compensate,” Barnier said, highlighting that the U.K. seafood industry is extremely dependent on exports to the 27-nation bloc. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made fisheries and U.K. control over its waters a key demand in the long saga of Britain’s departure from the EU.The European Parliament issued a three-day ultimatum to negotiators to strike a trade deal if it’s to be in a position to ratify an agreement this year. European lawmakers said they will need to have the terms of any deal in front of them by late Sunday if they are to organize a special gathering before the end of the year.If a deal comes later, it could only be ratified in 2021, as the parliament wouldn’t have enough time to debate the agreement before that.A trade deal would ensure there are no tariffs and quotas on trade in goods between the two sides, but there would still be technical costs, partly associated with customs checks and non-tariff barriers on services.Britain’s Parliament must also approve any Brexit deal, and the Christmas break adds to the timing complications. Lawmakers are due to be on vacation from Friday until Jan. 5, but the government has said they can be called back on 48 hours’ notice to approve an agreement if one is struck.Though both sides would suffer economically from a failure to secure a trade deal, most economists think the British economy would take a greater hit, at least in the near-term, as it is relatively more reliant on trade with the EU than vice versa.Both sides have said they would try to mitigate the impact of a no-deal, but most experts think that whatever short-term measures are put in place, the disruptions to trade will be immense.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-says-post-brexit-trade-talks-with-uk-face-last-attempt-to-fix-fish/story-R9vfsqzKCLCYS8ZZQ06xuK.html
18-12-2020||World||Google says Australian law on paying for news is unworkable||A Google executive said on Friday that a proposed Australian law to make digital platforms pay for news was unworkable and its proposed arbitration model was biased toward media businesses.Google Australia and New Zealand Managing Director Mel Silva made her first public comments on the details of the proposed legislation since it was introduced to Parliament last week.The so-called News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code would force Google and Facebook to compensate Australian news media for the journalism that they link to.“It forces Google to pay to show links in an unprecedented intervention that would fundamentally break how search engines work,” Silva said in a statement.If a platform and a news business couldn’t agree on a price for news after three months of negotiations, a three-member arbitration panel would be appointed to make a binding decision for payment.Silva said “binding arbitration within the code could be a reasonable backstop — so long as the arbitration model is fair.”However, the proposed arbitration model was “skewed to the interests of one type of business only,” Silva said, referring to media.Google said it had provided a better model with Google News Showcase. Google is paying participating publishers to provide paywalled content to News Showcase users through the model that it launched in October.“By imposing final-offer arbitration with biased criteria, it encourages publishers to go to arbitration rather than reaching an agreement,” Silva said of the government’s model.Swinburne University media lecturer Belinda Barnet said Google was pushing its own model because it wanted more power in negotiations than media businesses.“It’s a cynical ploy by Google,” Barnet said. “They tried the misinformation campaign, that didn’t work, and now they’re saying: ‘We can do it better. We’re already doing it better.’”News Showcase “benefits the major players,” while the Australian government wanted payment for news to be “fair and across the board,” Barnet said.Details of the draft legislation will be scrutinized by a Senate committee before lawmakers vote on it next year.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who introduced the legislation to Parliament, said in a statement that Google could make a submission to that committee before it releases its finding in February.Breaches of the code, such as failure to negotiate in good faith, would be punishable by a fine of 10 million Australian dollars ($7.4 million) or the equivalent of 10% of annual turnover in Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-says-australian-law-on-paying-for-news-is-unworkable/story-Ui6pHZV9AAdDk1OdpclivO.html
18-12-2020||World||Chinese firm behind Hambantota port project gets first contract in Sri Lanka’s Port City||One of China’s largest state-run firms that was behind the controversial Hambantota port project has bagged the first contract in Sri Lanka’s planned $13-billion Port City, weeks after the US criticised the Chinese government for acting as a “predator” in the island nation. The China Harbor Engineering Company Limited (CHEC), a subsidiary of state-run behemoth China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC), signed a $1-billion agreement on Thursday with Browns Investments, an arm of Sri Lankan conglomerate LOLC Group, for developing the Colombo International Financial Center (CIFC). The signing ceremony in Colombo was attended by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and China’s envoy to Sri Lanka, Qi Zhenhong. “Attracting foreign direct investment is a priority of our government. This unique project is a powerful example of Sri Lanka’s return to the business world,” Rajapaksa was quoted as saying by the media. Rajapaksa tweeted that the financial centre will be the first FDI project within Port City and that “this landmark project is a strong indicator that [Sri Lanka] is now back in business”. China Harbor Engineering Company was also the firm involved in the controversial Hambantota Port Development Project. After struggling for years to pay off debts related to the project, Sri Lanka handed over the port and 15,000 acres around it to China for 99 years in December 2017. There was no immediate response from Indian officials on the development. Five subsidiaries of CCCC were among 24 Chinese companies added to a blacklist by the US commerce department on August 26 this year for “helping the Chinese military construct and militarize the internationally condemned artificial islands in the South China Sea”. Two months later, during a visit to Sri Lanka, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo cautioned the island nation’s leadership about Chinese investments and influence. A strong and sovereign Sri Lanka, he said, could be a “beacon for a free and open Indo-Pacific”, and this was a “contrast from what China seeks”. “We see from bad deals, violations of sovereignty and lawlessness on land and sea that the Chinese Communist Party is a predator, and the US comes in a different way, we come as a friend, and as a partner,” Pompeo told a news conference after meeting President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Pompeo’s comments were swiftly rejected by the Chinese embassy, which tweeted that Beijing was only promoting cooperation with Colombo. The Port City, to be built on 660 acres reclaimed from the sea on Colombo’s seafront, is back in the limelight since the Rajapaksa family returned to power and reports suggest China will have the main role in building it as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. While responding to criticism that Sri Lanka is again giving a key role to China in infrastructure projects despite the debacle of Hambantota port, Sri Lankan officials have argued that the US and others were not offering enough financial support to the country. “We turned to all our friends, including the World Bank and India...The one entity that came to our assistance hastily was China,” Palitha Kohona, who recently took over as Sri Lanka’s ambassador to China, was quoted as saying by The Wall Street Journal last month, while talking about Sri Lanka’s efforts to garner financial backing for projects such as Port City.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-firm-behind-hambantota-port-project-gets-first-contract-in-sri-lanka-s-port-city/story-bGzGjICQniSsMTohF8abmO.html
18-12-2020||World||Afghanistan fears lenient sanctions against Taliban will adversely affect peace process||Afghanistan has said that the Taliban have increased their levels of violence and continued relationship with global terror groups, asserting that any leniency on the sanctions against the insurgent outfit, without real progress and reciprocity from them, will be counter-productive and detrimental to the peace negotiations.Afghanistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Adela Raz, speaking at the United Nations Security Council Briefing on the ‘Situation in Afghanistan’ on Thursday, said that the work of the Monitoring Team assisting the 1988 Afghanistan Sanctions Committee is invaluable in tracking the Taliban’s activities, especially in overseeing the fulfillment of their commitments for peace, including their pledge to end all relations with Al-Qaeda and all other terrorist groups.“We need to make sure that these commitments are reflected in the Taliban’s actions and that the Taliban are not engaged in any terrorist activity and are not working with or supporting any international terrorist group,” she said.Raz added that unfortunately, this is not the case and the reports from Afghan security and intelligence agencies, as well as the Monitoring Team state otherwise.“The Taliban have increased their levels of violence and continued their relationship with international terrorist groups. As such, any leniency and flexibility on the sanctions against the Taliban, without real progress and reciprocity from them, will be counter-productive and detrimental to the peace negotiations,” she said.The Security Council has extended the mandate of the Monitoring Team assisting the 1988 Afghanistan Sanctions Committee for another year.Last week, the 193-member General Assembly adopted the resolution ‘The situation in Afghanistan’ by a recorded vote of 130 in favour. Russia voted against the resolution while Belarus, China and Pakistan abstained.Through the resolution, the General Assembly pledged its continued support to the government and people of Afghanistan as they rebuild a stable, secure and economically self-sufficient State, free of terrorism, narcotics, transnational organised crime, including trafficking in persons, and corruption, and strengthen the foundations of a constitutional democracy as a responsible member of the international community.Raz said it was a landmark resolution in underlining the immediate need for a permanent ceasefire and support for the desire and wishes of every Afghan, a long-lasting peace, stability and prosperity in Afghanistan.“These commitments are of particular importance in the overall progress of the peace process, but the international community must remain vigilant on the direct role that it plays. Particularly, I would like to highlight the imperative of caution in making any changes to the existing sanction mechanisms on the Taliban. These mechanisms should be seen not as incentives for peace, but rather as reflections on the realities on the ground,” she added.Raz noted that as clearly outlined in the Secretary-General’s Report, the security situation in Afghanistan remains highly volatile for civilians. Despite progress towards peace, the situation is indeed “worsening”.The Report of the Secretary-General notes 10,439 security-related incidents during the reporting period, representing an 18 per cent increase against the same period in 2019.Raz said it must further be stressed that “anti-government” elements conducted 92 per cent of all security related incidents and 95 per cent of armed clashes.“The Taliban are engaging in targeted killings, attacks against public infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and bridges and have deliberately used people as human shields – actions that are in clear violation of international humanitarian and human rights law. This is unacceptable and reinforces the urgency of the government’s call and Secretary General’s call, for a comprehensive and immediate ceasefire,” she said.Recent high-profile attacks have shown the lack of humanity that is exhibited by terrorist groups in Afghanistan, including the Taliban, she said, adding that young men and women should not have to wake up with the fear of losing their lives while working to achieve their dreams for a better future.She said that the increased violence by the Taliban is happening amidst the worst humanitarian crisis in decades, driven by violence, natural disasters, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.Citing the latest Global Humanitarian Overview, she said 18.4 million Afghans are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.“The Afghan government is fully committed to doing everything within its limited resources to address the needs of every girl, boy, woman, and man within our borders. We ask the international community to help us overcome these challenges and fully fund the Humanitarian Response Plan for Afghanistan, requiring 1.3 billion dollars,” she said.Raz said peace discussions in Doha have continued positively as reflected by the recent agreement on principles and procedures that will guide the peace negotiations. Talks will resume on January 5 and the government is ready to start discussions on agenda items, she added.UN Special Representative Deborah Lyons, who also heads the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, told the virtual meeting of the Security Council that “unrelenting violence” in Afghanistan continues to put lasting peace at risk and that violence will be a top priority when the peace talks resume in early January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-fears-lenient-sanctions-against-taliban-will-adversely-affect-peace-process/story-Q5UxMMcxgOuwi4aRqhU0tM.html
18-12-2020||World||Russian investigators resume probe into Nazi death squad’s WWII atrocities||Russia’s prosecution office for the Kuban region announced on Friday that it was resuming, after a 48-year suspension, the probe into Nazi Sonderkommando’s massacres of civilians, committed in the region during World War II, in which former Schutzstaffel (SS) interpreter Helmut Oberlander could be involved.“Upon an initiative of the prosecutor general’s office, the order to suspend the preliminary investigation into the criminal case over mass murders of Soviet citizens by members of Hitler’s punitive body Sonderkommando SS-10A was revoked,” the regional prosecutors said in a press release.The previous probe, conducted by the Soviet Committee for State Security, established that members of this death squad conducted mass executions of civilians in mobile gas chambers in the period between 1941 and 1943 in the Krasnodar region and the Rostov region, located in the broader region of Kuban.Back in the Soviet times, materials related to the crimes were submitted to the German side, and some malefactors, including Sonderkommando chief Kurt Christmann, were sentenced. However, a criminal probe against three members of the Sonderkommando was closed. Therefore, in 1972, the Soviet Union suspended the investigation “due to failure to identify other persons involved in the atrocities.”The decision to resume the probe is due to the fact that the fate one of the seven interpreters who fled the Soviet Union (Helmut Oberlander) was established.“Apart from that, we have received information about some other individuals’ involved in the crimes under investigation. However, a legal assessment of their actions is yet to be made,” the Russian prosecutors added.Oberlander, aged 96, was recently stripped of Canadian citizenship for failing to disclose information about his service for the Nazi death squad. According to Russian investigators, Oberlanmder is complicit in the WWII shooting of 27,000 people in the Rostov region alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-investigators-resume-probe-into-nazi-death-squad-s-wwii-atrocities/story-FzvMa2B4fx2siA2DUapqpO.html

The by-elections were overdue in two constituencies of the National Assembly (Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and six of the provincial assemblies of Sindh.These include three provincial assembly constituencies in Sindh and one each in the three other provinces besides one each National Assembly constituency in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.The two National Assembly constituencies where by-elections are to be held are NA-75 Sialkot and NA-45 Kurram Agency. The provincial assembly seats awaiting by-polls are: PS-52 Umerkot, PS-88 Malir, and PS-43 Sanghar in Sindh, PP-51 Gujranwala in Punjab, PK-63 Nowshera in KP, and PB-20 Pishin in Balochistan, reported Dawn.The Commission asked the provinces to ensure strict observance of SOPs during the electoral process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-hold-by-elections-in-8-constituencies-of-national-provincial-assemblies-amid-covid-19-surge/story-q5OwTHOJD6V8jWVMWTu4XP.html
18-12-2020||World||YouTube faces complaints of lax approach on overseas election misinformation||After facing heavy criticism for not doing enough to stem misinformation ahead of the US presidential election, YouTube announced last week it would remove videos that alleged fraud had changed the outcome of the contest.But half a world away in Myanmar, which held a general election just five days after the US vote and faced a tidal wave of online misinformation including unfounded claims of voter fraud, the new rules do not apply. Social media researchers and civil society groups in Myanmar say the uneven standard is emblematic of YouTube’s comparatively hands-off approach to election misinformation globally at a time when rival Facebook is taking a more aggressive country-by-country measures. “It looks like 2020 might be YouTube’s equivalent of Facebook’s 2016, holding on to hope that a universal approach might work, even when it’s clear that it’s not going to be the case,” said Evelyn Douek, a Harvard Law School lecturer who researches online speech. Experts, including Douek, warn that this issue will only escalate for Alphabet’s YouTube in other elections worldwide, until it creates policies that account for its role for potentially volatile situations.“With other platforms, there’s at least starting to be a recognition that universal rules just aren’t going to cut it. For the US and Myanmar elections, Facebook tried to learn from the criticisms it received and roll out distinctive policies,” she told Reuters.YouTube did not respond to those criticisms but said it consistently enforced its guidelines and had deleted more than 1.8 million channels for policy violations in the third quarter of 2020, including more than 54,000 for hate speech.Facebook, which faced accusations that it helped incite genocide in Myanmar in 2017, launched an unusual Myanmar-only civic misinformation policy ahead of the recent election, allowing it to remove false claims that could lead to voter suppression or otherwise damage the electoral process.The temporary policy, a first for Facebook on election misinformation, followed previous Sri Lanka-specific measures on curbing misinformation that could lead to violence that was eventually expanded worldwide.The company also built partnerships with civil society organisations in Myanmar, who say that the platform’s performance during the election, while imperfect, improved. Alphabet’s YouTube, by contrast, chose a light-touch approach and only appeared to block false election claims that people complained about, or if the material otherwise violated its broader guidelines on hate speech and harassment, researchers said.“When it comes to hate speech and disinformation in Myanmar, YouTube is the new frontier,” said Victoire Rio, an adviser at the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network (MTAN), a consortium of civil society organisations that study risks on social media. Rio told Reuters the video-sharing site was unprepared and didn’t make the investments needed to mitigate risk in Myanmar, calling for it to do a human rights impact assessment. Rio and fact-checking organisations say purveyors of misinformation joined YouTube in large numbers in 2020, as video streaming usage skyrocketed thanks to cheaper data plans, with more than half of Myanmar’s population now online. A review by Reuters found more than a dozen recently created YouTube channels that promoted Myanmar election-related misinformation while posing either as news outlets or political programmes. Myanmar fact-checking organisations say hundreds of such channels appeared in 2020.The reach of those channels varied, with the popular ones accumulating millions of views, far more than most accredited media. A November video falsely stating the ruling party had already picked a new president had more than 350,000 views.Half of the channels had their corresponding Facebook pages deleted by Facebook for content rules violations in the last two months. But YouTube links from the same banned creators were still widely shared on Facebook. PROBLEMATIC CONTENTYouTube states in its guidelines that it removes political misinformation only when it pertains specifically to false claims about a voting process, or if it violates other rules.“Our Community Guidelines prohibit spam, scams, or other manipulated media, coordinated influence operations, and any content that seeks to incite violence,” a YouTube spokeswoman told Reuters.She said YouTube had “terminated” a number of channels for violating its hate speech and harassment policies, but did not comment on whether the platform had a Burmese-language team or a local “Trusted Flaggers” programme that allows recognised groups to flag problematic content.YouTube has argued in blog posts that it also reduces the spread of misinformation by pushing people to authoritative sources.But democracy advocates say that is not enough. A recent YouTube search for the word “fraud” in the Burmese language revealed as the third result a channel full of videos that allege, without evidence, that the ruling party committed fraud in the Myanmar election.Other searches for election related terms showed other channels containing political misinformation in top results. Yatanar Htun, a director of the Myanmar ICT for Development Organization (MIDO), which monitors online hate speech, told Reuters that YouTube videos had been used in fake emails to voters that spoofed emails from Myanmar authorities to allege fraud and foreign interference. Facebook deleted the original page sharing the videos, but YouTube was slow to act, Htun said. YouTube took down one of the videos linked in the emails after it was asked for comment by Reuters and removed a channel for harassment. But another channel used to allege fraud remains on the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youtube-faces-complaints-of-lax-approach-on-overseas-election-misinformation/story-Crhopc75p9HiA28hJ2Jo8L.html
18-12-2020||World||US to blacklist dozens of Chinese firms including SMIC: Report||The United States is set to add dozens of Chinese companies, including the country’s top chipmaker SMIC, to a trade blacklist on Friday, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.The move, which has not previously been reported, is seen as the latest in President Donald Trump’s effort to cement his tough-on-China legacy. It comes just weeks before Democratic President-elect Joe Biden is set to take office on Jan. 20.In total, the United States is expected to add around 80 additional companies and affiliates to the so-called entity list, nearly all of them Chinese. The designations by the Commerce Department are expected to name some Chinese companies that Washington says have ties to the Chinese military, including some helping it construct and militarize artificial islands in the South China Sea, as well as some involved in alleged human rights violations, the sources said.The Trump administration has often used the entity list - which now includes more than 275 China-based firms and affiliates - to hit key Chinese industries. These include telecoms equipment giants Huawei Technologies Co and 150 affiliates, and ZTE Corp over sanction violations, as well as surveillance camera maker Hikvision over suppression of China’s Uighur minority.SMIC, the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, has already been in Washington’s crosshairs. In September, the Commerce Department mandated that suppliers of certain equipment to the company apply for export licenses after concluding there was an “unacceptable risk” that equipment supplied to it could be used for military purposes.SMIC, the Commerce Department and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.Last month, the Defense Department added the company to a blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies, effectively banning US investors from buying its shares starting late next year.SMIC has repeatedly said that it has no relationship with the Chinese military. The entity list designation would force SMIC to seek a special license from the Commerce Department before a US supplier could send it key goods, part of a bid by the administration to curb its access to sophisticated US chipmaking technology.Commerce is also expected to add numerous SMIC-affiliated companies to the entity list, the sources said. SMIC is the largest Chinese chip manufacturer but trails Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the industry’s market leader. It has sought to build out foundries for the manufacture of computer chips that can compete with TSMC.Ties between Washington and Beijing have grown increasingly antagonistic over the past year as the world’s top two economies sparred over Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong and rising tensions in the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-blacklist-dozens-of-chinese-firms-including-smic-report/story-zgOOQzqob1T2cmR6thRClN.html
18-12-2020||World||Russia hack confronts Trump with decision that echoes Obama’s||A massive hack on the federal government presents President Donald Trump with the same choice Barack Obama faced in the waning days of his tenure: whether to impose sanctions on Russia, and how severe to make them. So far, Trump has shown little willingness to impose costs.Confronted with evidence that Vladimir Putin’s government orchestrated cyberattacks aimed at interfering with the 2016 election, Obama levied sanctions against Russia’s intelligence services and expelled 35 diplomats.Now, it’s Trump’s turn to decide whether to call out and punish the Kremlin, as Obama did, or go easy on the Russian president and leave it to President-elect Joe Biden to formulate a response to a hack so serious it prompted National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien to cut short an overseas trip and return to oversee daily crisis meetings at the White House.Government agencies and hundreds of Fortune 500 companies are still assessing the damage done by the cyberattack, which involved code embedded in updates for a widely used network-management software made by SolarWinds Corp.Unlike in 2016, the latest attack didn’t involve election interference, but there’s little doubt it was a serious strike. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Thursday called it a “grave risk” to federal, state and local governments, as well as critical infrastructure and the private sector. SolarWinds said 18,000 customers downloaded the tampered software update.Security experts familiar with the hack said that even if evidence is still being gathered, it’s important to come out with a swift condemnation and set about taking measures to establish some sort of deterrence.“The one thing you can say is the Trump administration has basically given the Russians a green light by not calling them out,” said James Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “That’s what you want to watch for: Does the Trump administration take any action even if it’s just symbolic? And so far the answer is no.”Although Obama has been criticized for reacting too slowly to the Russian election meddling, the sanctions he eventually imposed sparked one of the most notorious episodes of the Trump era: the decision by Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to privately urge Russia not to respond to Obama’s sanctions. Trump last month pardoned Flynn after he was convicted of lying about the conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador on the matter.Trump and many of his top aides have repeatedly tried to shift the spotlight to China as America’s biggest national security threat, sometimes downplaying Russian actions in comparison. Ending his presidency by going after Russia would contradict that strategy.According to one person familiar with the president’s thinking, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations, Trump has never let go of the belief that he could leverage personal ties with President Putin to improve relations with Russia. That would make it much harder for his staff to discuss punishment for fear that Trump would reject it out of hand.Issues of cybersecurity seem to be particularly fraught for Trump’s aides. In his 2017 book “Fear,” Bob Woodward recounts an episode when Trump’s homeland security adviser at the time, Tom Bossert, tried to approach the president.In an opinion piece in the New York Times on Thursday, Bossert suggested an idea that’s likely to find a better reception from the Biden team than Trump’s. He said the US must call out Russia but also work with allied nations to pressure Russia.Although Trump has yet to say anything about the hack, Biden echoed Bossert’s argument in a statement Thursday, vowing to united with allies and impose “substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks.” He promised to make cybersecurity a “top priority at every level of government.”There are many ways for Trump’s administration to respond -- new sanctions on Russia’s intelligence services, for example. Yet one challenge officials face is that such actions, as the current episode proves, clearly have failed to deter Russia in the past.Another issue that Trump -- and later Biden -- will have to confront is that no one knows the true extent of the hack and what the hackers will do with the information they gleaned. Snooping on an adversary’s networks is something countries routinely do to each other and, as brazen as the hack may be, might provoke only a moderate response, in keeping with what past administrations have done.But if the hackers use the breach for more nefarious ends -- shutting down electrical grids, for example, or wiping out people’s bank accounts or exposing sensitive information publicly -- that could provoke a more serious response.“Sanctions are probably the most politically expedient option,” said Lauren Zabierek, executive director of the Cyber Project at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. “That’s probably the minimum that we can expect out of this from this administration, but I honestly don’t know what they’re going to do especially given their response to previous Russian actions.”Indeed, top advisers including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo have played down the hack. In a recent interview, Pompeo portrayed it as more of the same from Russia.“The Russian efforts to use cyber capabilities against us here in the United States is something that’s been consistent certainly for – goodness, I guess I was in Congress six years and now four years in the administration,” Pompeo said on the Ben Shapiro Show.Given that Russia is unlikely to be deterred, experts argue that the best result will have to be a fundamental rethinking of cyber issues, something that will require new money and more time than the Trump team has left before Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration.“We’ve been talking about this for 25 years, and we’re not there,” said Christopher Painter, who was the State Department coordinator for cyber issues before Trump shut down his office in 2017.“The way you do that is you make this whole area much more of a mainstream national security priority and not treat it as this little boutique-y tech issue, which I think in large part it has been relegated to,” Painter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-hack-confronts-trump-with-decision-that-echoes-obama-s/story-TMW5T19fvRDraC8Rk3LAPL.html
18-12-2020||World||Biden suggests ‘foul play’ in political efforts to target son||Joe Biden said Thursday that he believed efforts to use his son as a political cudgel amounted to “foul play” amid a federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s tax matters and Republican calls for a special counsel investigation into his foreign dealings.“We have great confidence in our son,” Biden said in an interview with CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert. “I’m not concerned about any accusations that have been made against him, it’s used to get me. I think it’s kind of foul play but -- look, it is what it is.”CBS News originally reported that Biden had called the federal investigation itself “foul play.” But the Biden campaign denied that characterization and released a fuller transcript of the exchange, saying the president-elect was describing broader efforts to politically exploit his son’s business dealings.“There has indisputably been ‘foul play’ of that exact kind,” Biden spokesman Andrew Bates tweeted, referring to people who use Hunter Biden as a “cudgel” against his father. “Trump got himself impeached engaging in it.”The comments were some of Biden’s most extensive since the disclosure earlier this month of the investigation into his son’s tax dealings.The probes include one led by the Delaware US Attorney’s office into whether Hunter Biden violated tax laws, and another by the US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania concerns his activities in Ukraine and potential money laundering, according to a person familiar with the matter who discussed the sensitive inquiry on condition of anonymity. At least one of the probes has been ongoing since 2018, a third person said.But the effort has been clouded by President Donald Trump’s precedent-shattering public demands for an inquiry into Biden’s son. As recently as Sunday, Trump complained that Attorney General William Barr did not disclose the federal tax inquiry before Election Day.Trump, in a tweet earlier Thursday, denied playing any role in decisions regarding the investigation.Barr announced Monday that he plans to resign before Christmas. He made the announcement shortly after Trump criticized him in an interview with Fox News and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told the network the president was “frustrated” Barr hadn’t done more to highlight the Hunter Biden case to voters.Republican lawmakers -- including Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- have also seized on the probe, calling for the appointment of a special counsel.Colbert asked Biden about his relationship with Graham, a longtime friend, in light of Graham’s support for Trump’s efforts to overturn the election results. “Lindsey’s been a personal disappointment because I was a personal friend of his,” Biden said.Biden also said he would reach out to Republicans -- even those who attack him -- “if it benefits the country.”The investigation into Biden’s Ukraine work began based on information provided by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, spurring tensions between Justice Department officials over how credible the allegations were.Hunter Biden confirmed that the investigation into his taxes is continuing. It’s wasn’t clear if the Ukraine-related investigation is still ongoing.U.S. officials also have conducted a counterintelligence assessment related to Hunter Biden’s activities, the person said.The Bidens have repeatedly insisted no wrongdoing was committed, and the president-elect on Thursday again voiced support for his son.“As long as he’s good, we’re good,” Joe Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-suggests-foul-play-in-political-efforts-to-target-son/story-uh12fA3cNDQKnARgFVGmGN.html

18-12-2020||World||Iran begins construction of underground nuclear facility amid US tensions||Iran has begun construction on a site at its underground nuclear facility at Fordo amid tensions with the US over its atomic program, satellite photos obtained Friday by The Associated Press show.Iran has not publicly acknowledged any new construction at Fordo, whose discovery by the West in 2009 came in an earlier round of brinkmanship before world powers struck the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran.While the purpose of the building remains unclear, any work at Fordo likely will trigger new concern in the waning days of the Trump administration before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. Already, Iran is building at its Natanz nuclear facility after a mysterious explosion in July there that Tehran described as a sabotage attack.“Any changes at this site will be carefully watched as a sign of where Iran’s nuclear program is headed,” said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies who studies Iran.Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The International Atomic Energy Agency, whose inspectors are in Iran as part of the nuclear deal, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Construction on the Fordo site began in late September. Satellite images obtained from Maxar Technologies by the AP show the construction taking place at a northwest corner of the site, near the holy Shiite city of Qom some 90 kilometers (55 miles) southwest of Tehran.A December 11 satellite photo shows what appears to be a dug foundation for a building with dozens of pillars. Such pillars can be used in construction to support buildings in earthquake zones.The construction site sits northwest of Fordo’s underground facility, built deep inside a mountain to protect it from potential airstrikes. The site is near other support and research-and-development buildings at Fordo.Among those buildings is Iran’s National Vacuum Technology Center. Vacuum technology is a crucial component of Iran’s uranium-gas centrifuges, which enrich uranium.A Twitter account called Observer IL earlier this week published an image of Fordo showing the construction, citing it as coming from South Korea’s Korea Aerospace Research Institute.The AP later reached the Twitter user, who identified himself as a retired Israeli Defense Forces soldier with a civil engineering background. He asked that his name not be published over previous threats he received online. The Korea Aerospace Research Institute acknowledged taking the satellite photo.Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the US from Iran’s nuclear deal, in which Tehran had agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Trump cited Iran’s ballistic missile program, its regional policies and other issues in withdrawing from the accord, though the deal focused entirely on Tehran’s atomic program.When the US ramped up sanctions, Iran gradually and publicly abandoned the deal’s limits as a series of escalating incidents pushed the two countries to the brink of war at the beginning of the year. Tensions still remain high.Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran agreed to stop enriching uranium at Fordo and instead make it “a nuclear, physics and technology center.”“This location was a major sticking point in negotiations leading to the Iran nuclear deal,” Lewis said. “The US insisted Iran close it while Iran’s supreme leader said keeping it was a red line.”Since the deal’s collapse, Iran has resumed enrichment there.Shielded by the mountains, the facility also is ringed by anti-aircraft guns and other fortifications. It is about the size of a football field, large enough to house 3,000 centrifuges, but small and hardened enough to lead US officials to suspect it had a military purpose when they exposed the site publicly in 2009.As of now, Iran is enriching uranium up to 4.5%, in violation of the accord’s limit of 3.67%. Iran’s parliament has passed a bill that requires Tehran to enrich up to 20%, a short technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The bill also would throw out IAEA inspectors.Experts say Iran now has enough low-enriched uranium stockpiled for at least two nuclear weapons, if it chose to pursue them. Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful.While Iranian President Hassan Rouhani opposed the bill, the country’s Guardian Council later tweaked and approved it. The bill seeks to pressure European nations to provide relief from crippling US sanctions.Meanwhile, an Iranian scientist who created its military nuclear program two decades ago recently was killed in a shooting outside of Tehran.

It has also moved into cloud computing, bricks-and-mortar retail and delivery services, as well as an overseas expansion.The Trump administration has imposed an escalating series of US sanctions against Huawei over alleged digital collusion with Chinese state security and has hinted at applying pressure on other companies, possibly including Alibaba.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-alibaba-eliminates-ethnic-tag-that-identifies-uighur-muslims/story-KBewIknY2GyrYSMEKXSr5I.html

It has approved a fourth, from CanSino Biologics Inc, for military use.The SCMP report said Chinese officials have been asked to complete the first 50 million doses by Jan. 15 and the second by Feb. 5.The mass inoculation for high-priority groups aims to reduce the risks of the spread of the disease during the annual week-long holiday, the report added.The high-priority group includes health workers, police officers, firefighters, customs officers, cargo handlers, transport and logistics workers.China’s Sichuan province could start vaccinating the elderly and people with underlying conditions at the beginning of next month, after it completes inoculations for priority groups, officials have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-vaccinate-50-million-people-for-lunar-new-year/story-S7xWZEEfl77iEZ1k8SaUMK.html
18-12-2020||World||Thailand eases curbs on US, Japan tourists before peak travel||Thailand is easing travel restrictions on visitors from 56 countries, including the US, Japan and Singapore, ahead of the peak holiday season to boost the nation’s ailing tourism sector.Tourists are allowed to enter Thailand without prior visas but will need to carry a health certificate to prove they are free of Covid-19 and undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arrival, according to Taweesilp Witsanuyotin, a spokesman for the Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration. Visitors will also undergo three virus tests while in quarantine, an increase from the two mandated earlier, Taweesilp said.Thailand is relaxing curbs on foreign tourists after a special long-term visa program unveiled in September evoked lukewarm response and authorities were forced to suspend a successful travel subsidy program for local tourists to probe allegations of corruption. More frequent tests for visitors during the quarantine might help the government shorten the isolation period to 10 days from next month, Taweesilp said.The quarantine will help authorities prevent visitors from spreading the virus locally and is seen as a more effective strategy than limiting access to tourists from the so-called low-risk countries amid a fresh surge in cases worldwide, Taweesilp said.“The definition of which countries are low risk or high risk changes every day. So let’s allow them all to enter, but put them into quarantines upon arrival,” Taweesilp said at a briefing on Thursday.Travelers from the designated 56 countries, which also include Australia, Italy, and France, will be allowed to stay for up to 30 days for tourism activities as part of Thailand’s unilateral agreements since before the pandemic. Citizens from five countries -- Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and South Korea -- can stay in Thailand for 90 days, according to the Covid-19 panel. But the country will not issue any visas-on-arrival, or allow 14 days free travel for those from Cambodia and Myanmar until the virus outbreak improves, it said.“These are new processes and models for travel that we must adjust to in the new normal,” Taweesilp said.Thailand is betting on a revival in its tourism industry to exit a recession, with the central bank forecasting it may take at least two years for Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy to return to the pre-pandemic growth levels. Foreign tourist arrivals generated more than $60 billion in revenue from about 40 million visitors in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-eases-curbs-on-us-japan-tourists-before-peak-travel/story-yLtIhBPkLkto4AyePu6BOK.html

Pompeo spoke this week with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to discuss the December 14 imposition of sanctions by the United States on our NATO Ally Turkey for its procurement of the Russian-made S-400 missile defence system, as required under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA),” said Principal Deputy Spokesperson, State Department Cale Brown.Brown said that Pompeo has “made it clear” to Foreign Minister Cavusoglu that “Turkey’s purchase of the S-400 system endangers the security of US personnel and military technology and allows Russian access to the Turkish armed forces and defence industry.”“The Secretary stressed that the goal of the sanctions is to prevent Russia from receiving substantial revenue, access, and influence, and they are not intended to undermine the military capabilities or combat readiness of Turkey or any other US Ally or partner,” Brown added.Pompeo also urged Turkey to resolve the S-400 issue in a manner “consistent with our decades-long history of defence-sector cooperation” adding that Turkey must recommit itself to its NATO obligations to obligations to purchase NATO-interoperable weaponry.This comes after the United States on Monday (local time) imposed sanctions on Turkey for purchase of S-400 surface-to-air missile system from Russia and urged Ankara to resolve the problem “immediately in coordination with the US”.The US has imposed full blocking sanctions and visa restrictions on Ismail Demir, the president of SSB; Faruk Yigit, SSB’s vice president; Serhat Gencoglu, SSB’s Head of the Department of Air Defense and Space; and Mustafa Alper Deniz, Program Manager for SSB’s Regional Air Defense Systems Directorate.According to an official statement issued by the State Department, the US has imposed sanctions on the Republic of Turkey’s Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB) pursuant to Section 231 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for knowingly engaging in a significant transaction with Rosoboronexport, Russia’s main arms export entity, by procuring the S-400 surface-to-air missile system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-s-purchase-of-s-400-defense-system-will-endanger-us-military-mike-pompeo/story-AWJnCPoBLbHKZKRYYb741M.html
18-12-2020||World||Asia trounces US in Health-Efficiency Index amid pandemic||As a pandemic ravaged the world, Asian economies led by Hong Kong and Singapore topped a ranking of most-efficient health care systems.The Bloomberg Health-Efficiency Index, first conducted in 2013, tracks life expectancy and medical spending to determine which health-care systems have the best outcomes. This year’s results include the impact of Covid-19 on mortality and gross domestic product in 57 of the world’s largest economies.These measures helped many Asian territories improve their standing on the list since their generally aggressive coronavirus responses kept cases and deaths relatively low. Brazil and Russia joined the US in the bottom tier, reflecting relatively low life expectancies along with high Covid-19 mortality and weaker economic outlooks.“Efficient health systems are often in places that have limited natural resources and therefore prioritize policies that rely on people potential,” said Pisonthi Chongtrakul, a professor in the Faculty of Medicine at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok.“Success in combating Covid-19 has come in places that coordinated among government bodies and were willing to let health experts call the shots, which helped create a clarity of public messaging,” he said.To measure efficiency during the pandemic, two adjustments were made to the original ranking formula: the 2020 table includes the one-year change in GDP based on an October forecast by the International Monetary Fund, as well as the Covid-19 toll on each economy.For example, a 2020 GDP contraction of 6% led to a 6 point subtraction from the total score, while a death toll or new confirmed cases of 100,000 deducted 11.5 points.The US ranks among the bottom 10% under this method as well as the formula used before Covid-19, which simply measured spending against life expectancy. America’s low scores reflect a middling average lifespan, the world’s biggest outlays on medical care along with the largest Covid-19 caseload.Using the formula adjusted for the pandemic, eight of the world’s 10 most-efficient health systems are in Asia Pacific. Singapore and Hong Kong top the list, while Taiwan, New Zealand, South Korea and Thailand leapfrogged many territories based on their Covid-19 statistics.“The pandemic has underscored the fact that economic health is dependent on public health, which is in turn dependent on adequate public spending on health,” said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the World Health Organization’s South-East Asia director, in a Dec. 12 report.“In ordinary times, every dollar invested in health yields an average return of between $2 to $4, which can be up to 20 times higher in low- and middle-income countries,” Singh said.The rankings of France, Spain and Peru tumbled most among the 57 economies in Bloomberg’s 2020 adjusted-formula survey, which includes only those with average lifespans of at least 70 years, GDP per-capita exceeding $5,000 and a minimum population of 5 million. India doesn’t meet the minimum metrics, though it is among the nations hardest hit by the pandemic.China, the world’s most-populous territory, ranked 25th using the pre-pandemic formula, but jumped to No. 12 when adjustments for Covid-19 were incorporated. The epicenter of the virus was also the place that used some of the most draconian measures -- ranging from controlling peoples’ movements to mandatory testing -- to limit cases and mortality.All but two of the 57 economies in this index are expected to shrink in 2020, according to forecasts by the International Monetary Fund, with only China and Taiwan projected to post year-on-year growth.The average lifespan in the US is 78.5 years, having decreased for several consecutive years, according to the latest data. That is at near-parity with those in the UAE and Cuba, where per-capita spending on health care is less than a tenth of the US’s $10,246. Only Switzerland’s $9,956 expenditure is close -- yet the average Swiss lives five years longer than their American peers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asia-trounces-us-in-health-efficiency-index-amid-pandemic/story-gSRGDozPddBQInrk2b8tKP.html

18-12-2020||World||Biden advisor Cedric Richmond tests positive for coronavirus||One of President-elect Joe Biden’s closest advisors tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday, according to his transition team.Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, who is set to resign from Congress to join the incoming Biden administration as a senior adviser, tested positive two days after travelling to Atlanta to attend a campaign rally that Biden headlined for Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, Biden transition spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said in a statement.Bedingfield said Richmond was not in close contact with Biden, Ossoff or Warnock, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She added that Biden underwent Covid-19 testing on Thursday, and the virus was not detected.Biden has stayed close to home since last month’s election, and the rally marked just the second time since Election Day that he’s left his home state of Delaware.Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, voting rights activist Stacey Abrams and US Rep.-elect Nikema Williams also attended the rally but did not come in CDC-defined close contact with Richmond, either, Bedingfield said.Richmond, 47, first began experiencing symptoms on Wednesday, the transition said.He was a key figure in helping Biden leverage his own long-standing relationships with Congressional Black Caucus members.The congressman, who was first elected in 2010 when Biden was President Barack Obama’s vice president, was especially important in outreach to younger lawmakers who, like him, came to Washington later in the 78-year-old president-elect’s career.Richmond will take on a public engagement role in the Biden administration that will allow him to deal with Congress while focusing on the Black community and other minority groups. Richmond’s role will be like that of Valerie Jarrett in Obama’s administrations.A former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Richmond was among Biden’s earliest high-profile supporters and served as his campaign co-chair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-advisor-cedric-richmond-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-qvxKmfmQyZomfhInpM8dKP.html

McConnell, R-Ky., is not in the line of succession, but as majority leader, he is in charge of running the Senate.In a statement Thursday, Pelosi said: “We must all continue to embrace testing, tracing, treatment, mask wearing and social distancing as the vaccine is being distributed. It is imperative that we ensure that the vaccine will be free and delivered in a fair, equitable manner to as many Americans as soon as possible and that we accelerate its manufacture, including by invoking the Defense Production Act.”McConnell said that as a polio survivor, he is especially aware of the “extraordinary promise of hope” vaccines offer. He said he’ll continue to wear a mask and follow other health guidelines.Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the Capitol physician, sent a letter to lawmakers urging them to make appointments with his office to be vaccinated.“Once we have completed the vaccination of the Members, we will follow a process to identify the continuity-essential staff members,” Monahan said, adding that his office would continue with appointments “until the small vaccine supply is exhausted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-mitch-mcconnell-to-get-vaccine-urge-congress-members-to-do-same/story-8EDwYqYuH9iYgqPVFo84IN.html
18-12-2020||World||Joe Biden names key members of his climate team||US President-elect Joe Biden has announced his climate and energy team, which the transition said is ready on day one to advance his agenda and lead the world to confront the undeniable, accelerating and punishing reality of climate change. The nominees are Congresswoman Deb Haaland as Secretary of Interior, Jennifer Granholm as Energy Secretary, Michael Regan as administrator for Environmental Protection Agency and Brenda Mallory as Chair of the Council of the Council on Environmental Quality. Biden on Thursday also announced the appointment of Gina McCarthy as his National Climate Advisor and Ali Zaidi as his Deputy National Climate Advisor. Zaidi is the highest-ranking Pakistani-American appointed by Biden in his administration. “This brilliant, tested, trailblazing team will be ready on day one to confront the existential threat of climate change with a unified national response rooted in science and equity. They share my belief that we have no time to waste to confront the climate crisis, protect our air and drinking water, and deliver justice to communities that have long shouldered the burdens of environmental harms,” Biden said in a statement. “Together, on behalf of all Americans, they will meet this moment with the urgency it demands — and seize the opportunity to build back better with good-paying union jobs, climate-resilient infrastructure and a clean energy future that benefits every single community,” he said. Biden is scheduled to be inaugurated as the 46th US President on January 20. He has vowed to rejoin the Paris climate deal on the first day of his presidency. The Trump administration last month formally withdrew from the Paris accord, a decision originally announced three years ago. The deal committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C above pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. Trump argues that the agreement is disadvantageous for the US, while it gives benefits to countries like China, Russia and India. According to him, it could be economically detrimental and cost 2.5 million Americans their jobs by 2025. Observing that the undeniable, accelerating, punishing reality of climate change is exacting an incalculable toll on lives and livelihoods in every community across the country, the transition said the team knows that science demands they address climate change immediately and that the response must be grounded in science. The team will turn the climate crisis into an unprecedented opportunity to create millions of good paying union jobs in communities across the country; powering the economy with clean energy and positioning the US as an exporter of 21st century products; and making the economy stronger and more resilient. They will work closely with communities who bear the outsized burden of environmental injustice, including Tribal Nations and communities of colour, and young Americans who will live with the long-term consequences of climate change, the transition said. Haaland is currently serving as Vice Chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources. If confirmed, she will make history as the first-ever Native American Cabinet secretary. Granholm is a two-term Governor of Michigan whose work during and after her tenure has centred on creating clean energy jobs in America. Her leadership was instrumental in rescuing the US auto industry, saving one million jobs, and preparing Detroit for a clean energy future. Nominated to serve as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Regan is the current Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. He has served in the EPA under both Democratic and Republican presidents and has a distinguished track record of bringing people together across the public, private and non-profit sectors to advance environmental justice and seek solutions to environmental and climate challenges. An accomplished public servant and environmental lawyer, Mallory is former General Counsel to the Council on Environmental Quality and current Director of Regulatory Policy at the Southern Environmental Law Centre. If confirmed, she would be the first African American to hold the position since its creation more than half a century ago. McCarthy will serve as the first-ever National Climate Advisor, heading up the newly formed White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, where she will drive an “all of government” approach to combating climate change. A leading voice on climate and environmental issues for more than 30 years, McCarthy was a driving force behind the Obama-Biden administration’s groundbreaking Clean Power Plan during her tenure as EPA Administrator. Zaidi, a leading climate expert and longtime advisor to the president-elect, will serve as Deputy National Climate Advisor. He had helped draft and implement the Obama-Biden Administration’s Climate Action Plan and negotiate the Paris accord. Zaidi immigrated from Pakistan and grew up in the Rust Belt outside Erie, Pennsylvania. “...our climate crisis is a grave and growing threat to the American people and the planet...President-elect Biden and I proposed one of the most ambitious climate plans in history. The team we are announcing today will help make that plan a reality,” Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said. “They are the team the American people need and deserve to help protect our communities — and our planet — for generations,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-names-key-members-of-his-climate-team/story-Aq5ArIxyqI7Y5sJIx6RaiI.html
18-12-2020||World||UK says Brexit trade talks ‘in a serious situation’ and no deal very likely||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office said on Thursday that trade talks with the European Union were in a “serious situation” and that no agreement would be reached unless the bloc changed its position substantially.During a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Johnson said “time was very short and it now looked very likely that agreement would not be reached unless the EU position changed substantially”, his office said in a statement.“The prime minister underlined that the negotiations were now in a serious situation.”Johnson said Britain had tried to accommodate the EU’s “reasonable” requests on the so-called level playing field, but although the gap had narrowed, fundamental differences remained.He said on fisheries, another major sticking point, Britain could not “accept a situation where it was the only sovereign country in the world not to be able to control access to its own waters for an extended period” nor quotas which harmed its own fishing industry.“The EU’s position in this area was simply not reasonable and if there was to be an agreement it needed to shift significantly,” the statement said.“The prime minister repeated that little time was left. He said that, if no agreement could be reached, the UK and the EU would part as friends, with the UK trading with the EU on Australian-style terms.”Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU and the bulk of their trade is on World Trade Organization terms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-says-brexit-trade-talks-in-a-serious-situation-and-no-deal-very-likely/story-GfcHSn0yyzb6f1duovcsBK.html
18-12-2020||World||US FDA chief says ‘rapidly’ working to issue Moderna vaccine authorization||The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informed Moderna Inc that it will rapidly work towards the finalization and issuance of emergency use authorization (EUA) for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, commissioner Stephen Hahn said late Thursday.Earlier in the day, a panel of external advisers to the FDA overwhelmingly endorsed emergency use of Moderna vaccine candidate, virtually assuring a second option for protecting against Covid-19 for a pandemic-ravaged nation.The US Food and Drug Administration’s advisory panel, comprising external experts, has given an emergency use approval to Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, making it the second drug after Pfizer to receive such an authorisation in less than a week.FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), made up of independent scientific and public health experts, at its meeting on Thursday voted 20-0 with one abstention to recommend Emergency Use Authorization for the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine mRNA-1273.The FDA on Friday allowed the emergency use of the country’s first Covid-19 vaccine developed by American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech to combat the disease that has killed over 310,000 people in the country.Commissioner of Food and Drugs Stephen Hahn said that following the positive advisory committee meeting outcome about the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, the FDA has informed the company that it will rapidly work toward finalisation and issuance of an emergency use authorisation.The agency has also notified the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Operation Warp Speed, so they can execute their plans for timely vaccine distribution, he said.“We were grateful for the opportunity to present the clinical data package for our mRNA vaccine against Covid-19 to the FDA’s advisory committee today. We thank the committee for their review and for their positive recommendation in support of Emergency Use Authorization,” said Stéphane Bancel, CEO of Moderna.“We have been working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Operation Warp Speed to prepare for the distribution of mRNA-1273, if the FDA chooses to grant an Emergency Use Authorization. We look forward to getting our vaccine to people in the US to help address this ongoing public health emergency,” he said.The VRBPAC based its recommendation on the totality of scientific evidence shared by the Company, including a data analysis from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical study announced on November 30. The primary efficacy analysis conducted on 196 cases indicated a vaccine efficacy rate of 94.1 per cent, it said.Moderna has expanded the handling guidance for mRNA-1273 to include local transport under controlled conditions in a liquid state at 2-8°C (36° to 46°F). In some cases, this may be the only practical means of distribution from clinics and for remote locations.This important update will help facilitate distribution to the final site of administration. Recognising that shipping and handling of the product can be a barrier to vaccination, Moderna remains committed to supporting efficient distribution, the company said.Dr. Michael Kurilla, director of the Division of Clinical Innovation at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, was the only expert who abstained from the voting process.“I abstained because I’m very uncomfortable with the language. I think in the midst of a pandemic, and with limited vaccine supply available, that blanket statements for individuals 18 years of age and older is just too broad,” he said in a statement.“I’m not convinced that for all of those age groups, the benefits do actually outweigh the risks, and I would prefer to see it more targeted towards people at high risk of serious and life-threatening Covid disease,” he said.“I would have preferred to have seen, rather than an emergency use authorisation route -- an expanded access programme. I think it would have given us a lot more opportunities to continue to collect the data,” Kurilla said.Congressman Ross Spano said that 150 hospitals in Florida are preparing to receive 300,000 to 400,000 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, which is set for approval later this week.“This is great news for our community and another victory for Operation Warp Speed,” he said.The US is the worst-hit country from the pandemic with 17,195,926 Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-chief-says-rapidly-working-to-issue-moderna-vaccine-authorization/story-yDvfNSth7T0zmijn9gSDbP.html
18-12-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine update: Pfizer applies for EUA in Japan, FDA to approve Moderna candidate||The global search for a vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has reached a critical stage as several countries have started giving vaccine shots for emergency cases. The Pfizer Inc-BioNTech SE’s vaccine is being used in countries like the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, while several other countries have given emergency use authorisation (EUA) to it. Various other vaccine candidates, meanwhile, are at different stages of trials across the globe and it is likely many others will be given the nod in the coming days.Here are some latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccine development front:1. Pfizer on Friday applied for EUA of its vaccine in Japan as well. The Japanese government has signed a deal with Pfizer for 120 million doses of the vaccine. Japan hopes to vaccinate all its citizens in the first half of 2021, cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato said prior to Pfizer’s announcement.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage2. The United States’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which recently endorsed Moderna’s vaccine candidate, decided to grant EUA to it on Thursday, news agency Reuters has reported quoting the Financial Times. This comes after FDA, earlier in the day, informed Moderna it would “rapidly work towards the finalisation and issuance of the EUA of the vaccine candidate,” the report said.Also Read | Oxford says Covid-19 vaccine has good immune response with 2-dose regime3. Oxford University on Thursday said early data from the late-stage trials of its candidate, Covishield, shows it has a better immune response when a two full-dose regime is given, rather than a full-dose followed by a half-dose booster. Oxford is developing Covishield in collaboration with AstraZeneca.4. Johnson & Johnson on Thursday announced it has “fully enrolled” participants for the late-stage trials of its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine candidate. The trials, which are called ‘ENSEMBLE,’ will comprise about 45,000 participants. The company also said it plans to apply for EUA in the US in February 2021 if the candidate is found safe and effective.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-pfizer-applies-for-eua-in-japan-fda-to-approve-moderna-candidate/story-IQOWRy3eq1HhRE5SUIAbYL.html
18-12-2020||World||Japan to develop longer-range anti-ship missiles||Japan on Friday said it will develop new “stand-off” anti-ship missiles that can target warships at greater distances around its southwestern Okinawa island chain, including near disputed islets in the East China Sea that China also claims.“The security environment around our southwestern islands has become harsh. We have to respond to that in an appropriate way,” Japanese Minister of Defence Nobuo Kishi said at a press briefing.The missiles would allow Japan to expand a strategy known as anti-access area denial (A2AD), that is meant to stop foreign forces from operating freely in waters close to its home territory.The first major defence policy decision by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga comes as Japan acquires air-launched missiles that could be used to hit missile sites in North Korea and is considering other strike weapons such as cruise missiles that could reach ground targets in China.Japan has become increasingly concerned about Chinese activity in the East China Sea, including incursions into waters around the disputed islands know as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China.The Okinawa islands are part of a chain stretching from Japan down through to the Philippines that acts as a barrier to Chinese expansion.“Defending Japan’s southwestern islands requires longer-range systems because the islands cover a large area and Japan needs overlapping fields of fire,” said Zack Cooper, a research fellow at the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute.Japan said its new stand off missile will be based on a 200-km (124-mile) range truck-mounted anti-ship version already deployed on the Okinawa islands.The ministry did not say what range it will have or when they will be deployed.Japan also said on Friday it planned to put new powerful Aegis radars with at least three times the range of older Aegis systems on two new warships in order to reinforce defences against any ballistic missiles fired by North Korea.Deploying the new Aegis radars on ships could cost twice as much and take three years longer to complete than two ground-based versions it cancelled in June, a source with knowledge of the proposal told Reuters earlier.

Deb Haaland as interior secretary, according to two people familiar with the decision, a historic pick that would make her the first Native American to lead the powerful federal agency that has wielded influence over the nation’s tribes for generations.Tribal leaders and activists around the country, along with many Democratic figures, cheered Haaland’s selection after urging Biden for weeks to choose her. They stood behind her candidacy even when concerns that Democrats might risk their majority in the House if Haaland yielded her seat in Congress appeared to threaten her nomination.With Haaland’s nomination, Indigenous people will for the first time in their lifetimes see a Native American at the table where the highest decisions are made — and so will everyone else, said OJ Semans, a Rosebud Sioux vote activist who was in Georgia on Thursday helping get out the Native vote for two Senate runoffs. “It’s made people aware that Indians still exist,” he said.Haaland, 60, is a member of the Laguna Pueblo and, as she likes to say, a 35th-generation resident of New Mexico. The role of interior secretary would put her in charge of an agency that has tremendous sway not only over the nearly 600 federally recognized tribes, but also over much of the nation’s vast public lands, waterways, wildlife, national parks and mineral wealth.After news of Biden’s decision became public, Haaland tweeted that “growing up in my mother’s Pueblo household made me fierce.“I’ll be fierce for all of us, our planet, and all of our protected land,” she said.Her selection was confirmed by two people familiar with the decision who wasn’t authorized to speak about it publicly and spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Thursday.The pick breaks a 245-year record of non-Native officials, mostly male, serving as the top federal official over American Indian affairs. The federal government often worked to dispossess Native Americans of their land and, until recently, to assimilate them into white culture.“You’ve got to understand — you’re taking Interior full circle,” said Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, chair of the House Natural Resources Committee and a champion of Haaland for the job. “For years, its legacy was the disenfranchisement of the Native people of this country, of displacement, of cultural genocide.”With Haaland’s nomination, “that in itself is a huge message,” Grijalva said.Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez called it “truly a historic and unprecedented day for all Indigenous people.”“I am SO ELATED,” the head of progressive Democrats’ Sunrise Movement, Varshini Prakash, tweeted. “This will be the first time an Indigenous person - and a badass climate champion woman at that - will hold any presidential cabinet position. Congratulations to @JoeBiden for making history.″Get-out-the-vote activists believe their efforts, and the Native vote, helped flip Arizona in particular for Biden and secure the presidency.“There’s a feeling something is changing,” said Ashley Nicole McCray, a member of the Absentee Kiowa tribe of Oklahoma and of an indigenous environmental coalition. “Finally, we’ve come to this point where Indigenous sentiment is no longer being silenced.”But Biden’s pick could further deplete, at least temporarily, the narrow majority Democrats maintain in the House. Biden has already selected several lawmakers from the chamber, including Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond and Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, to serve in his administration.Some on Biden’s transition team had expressed concerns about dipping further into the already thinned Democratic House majority for another senior administration posting. But Biden decided that the barrier-breaking aspect of her nomination and her experience as vice chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources made her the right pick for the moment.The president-elect has been methodically filling the posts in his Cabinet, adding North Carolina environmental official Michael Regan as his nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, according to two people familiar with the selection process. Earlier this week, Biden introduced former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg as his transportation secretary, and he intends to make former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm his energy secretary.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made it clear Wednesday that Biden had her blessing to choose Haaland, saying she would make an “excellent choice” as interior secretary. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House and a close Biden ally, also supported Haaland for the job.Haaland, one of the first two Native American women in the House, said she could see the difference her position made for ordinary Native Americans who came to her with business before the federal government.“They felt comfortable just launching into the issues they wanted,” Haaland told the AP in an interview before her appointment. They would say, for example, “Oh, we don’t have to explain tribal sovereignty to you,” meaning tribes’ constitutionally guaranteed status as independent nations.Haaland previously worked as head of New Mexico’s Democratic Party, as tribal administrator and as an administrator for an organization providing services for adults with developmental disabilities.Born to a Marine veteran father and a Navy veteran mother, Haaland describes herself as a single mother who sometimes had to rely on food stamps. She says she is still paying off student loans after college and law school for herself and college for her daughter.New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall, who is retiring after 22 years in Congress and was initially considered the front-runner for interior secretary, congratulated Haaland on her selection, calling it “momentous and well-earned.’’Previously, the highest-ranking administration official known to have Native American heritage was Charles Curtis, who served as Herbert Hoover’s vice president and whose mother was one-quarter Kaw tribe.___Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Wilmington, Del., and Matthew Daly in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ap-sources-biden-to-pick-rep-haaland-as-interior-secretary/story-C5eNOQfpAmsTuy6MOn0MlK.html
18-12-2020||World||Key Joe Biden aide Cedric Richmond tests positive for Covid-19||One of President-elect Joe Biden’s closest advisers tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday, according to his transition team.Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, who is set to resign from Congress to join the incoming Biden administration as a senior adviser, tested positive two days after traveling to Atlanta to attend a campaign rally that Biden headlined for Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, Biden transition spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said in a statement.Bedingfield said Richmond was not in close contact with Biden, Ossoff or Warnock, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She added that Biden underwent COVID-19 testing on Thursday, and the virus was not detected.Biden has stayed close to home since last month’s election, and the rally marked just the second time since Election Day that he’s left his home state of Delaware.Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, voting rights activist Stacey Abrams and U.S. Rep.-elect Nikema Williams also attended the rally but did not come in CDC-defined close contact with Richmond, either, Bedingfield said.Richmond, 47, first began experiencing symptoms on Wednesday, the transition said.He was a key figure in helping Biden leverage his own long-standing relationships with Congressional Black Caucus members.The congressman, who was first elected in 2010 when Biden was President Barack Obama’s vice president, was especially important in outreach to younger lawmakers who, like him, came to Washington later in the 78-year-old president-elect’s career.Richmond will take on a public engagement role in the Biden administration that will allow him to deal with Congress while focusing on the Black community and other minority groups. Richmond’s role will be like that of Valerie Jarrett in Obama’s administrations.A former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Richmond was among Biden’s earliest high-profile supporters and served as his campaign co-chair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-adviser-cedric-richmond-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-KT7WCypyCED8haYgb7ln6I.html
18-12-2020||World||Drug overdose deaths in US rise during Covid-19||The Covid-19 pandemic has fuelled a rise in fatal drug overdoses in the United States, officials said Thursday, stressing that essential medical services have to remain accessible despite coronavirus disruptions.More than 81,000 drug overdose deaths were recorded in the US in the year to May, the highest number ever in a 12-month period, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).It said the latest data showed an acceleration of overdose deaths since the pandemic took hold at the start of the year.“The disruption to daily life due to the Covid-19 pandemic has hit those with substance use disorder hard,” said CDC director Robert Redfield.“As we continue the fight to end this pandemic, it’s important to not lose sight of different groups being affected in other ways. We need to take care of people suffering from unintended consequences.”More than 500,000 Americans have died of opioid overdoses -- both prescription and non-prescription -- since 1999.Corporate drugmakers such as Purdue Pharma have been taken to court on criminal charges over their drives to push unnecessary sales of prescription opioids, which stoked a nationwide addiction crisis.Illicitly manufactured fentanyl has been the primary cause of the recent increase in overdose deaths, the CDC said.On Wednesday, Canada said it had also seen a jump in opioid deaths this year.Experts said opioid users faced increased risk in part because of unemployment and homelessness during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drug-overdose-deaths-in-us-rise-during-covid-19/story-GTqvdRyqHaKAuSqrxtfJhN.html
18-12-2020||World||UK’s Johnson rules out tougher Christmas coronavirus curbs||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday resisted calls to tighten coronavirus restrictions over Christmas, as London faced stricter measures and concern grew about rising case numbers.The government has been under mounting pressure to toughen proposals allowing up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day festive window from December 23, as European neighbours curb their easing plans amid surging infections.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Health Service Journal (HSJ) on Tuesday warned the UK-wide move could lead to the state-run National Health Service (NHS) being overwhelmed.But Johnson insisted it would be “inhuman” to “cancel Christmas” now, arguing people should think hard about their plans and “exercise extreme caution” while still being allowed to gather.“Have yourselves a merry little Christmas,” Johnson said at a press conference. “And I’m afraid this year I do mean little.”After talks with leaders of the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the British leader said the rules should be seen as “a maximum not a target”.“We are keeping the laws the same -- but we all want to send the same message: a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas, and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas.”Johnson said there had been “unanimous” agreement between London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast not to change the policy, after a tough year of social distancing and lockdowns.But Wales’ First Minister Mark Drakeford announced that only two households in the country should mix indoors during the five-day period.“The fewer people we mix with in our homes, the less chance we have of catching or spreading the virus,” he told a regular briefing.England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said there was widespread acknowledgement that the Christmas easing would lead to more cases, hospitalisations and deaths.But he added such decisions were a “balance” of risks, while echoing the calls for caution.“Keep it small, keep it short, keep it local and think of the most vulnerable people,” Whitty said, flanking Johnson in Downing Street.Body blow Britain has been one of the worst affected countries in the pandemic, registering some 65,000 deaths from about 1.9 million positive cases, according to government figures.Spiralling infection rates in London and parts of southeast England have triggered concerns about a further rise in January, similar to those after the US Thanksgiving holidays.Also Read: Not so Merry Christmas looms for coronavirus-hit EuropeLondon moved into the highest level of restrictions early Wednesday, forcing theatres, pubs and restaurants to close again, and banning household mixing indoors.Takeaway food outlets can still operate, and people can meet in groups of up to six in public places outside. Schools will also remain open.The move is another body blow for the beleaguered hospitality and entertainment sectors, which have suffered huge losses in revenue and jobs since the start of the pandemic.Cases were doubling every seven days in some areas, according to officials, a more downbeat assessment after hopes of a breakthrough were raised last week with the start of a vaccination programme.The roll-out has seen nearly 138,000 people receive their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine since last Tuesday, the government said.Compliance with existing guidelines is an issue, and concerns have been raised about higher rates of infection among secondary school children aged 11-18.Increased testing in the worst-hit areas in and around London has been introduced.England only emerged from a four-week lockdown earlier this month, and the government introduced a targeted three-tier regional system of restrictions to try to cut infection rates.London had been placed in “Tier 2”, which means non-essential shops and services can open, but it currently has one of the highest infection rates in the country.Under Tier 3, shops and hairdressers can also still stay open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-johnson-rules-out-tougher-christmas-virus-curbs/story-GL0m3u8mxhjk3F2BXKXzCI.html
18-12-2020||World||US to revise Covid vaccine guidance after allergic reactions||The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Thursday it was working with Pfizer to revise a fact sheet for recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine after two people had allergic reactions.The two people, both health workers, were vaccinated in Alaska and one of them had a serious or “anaphylactic” reaction resulting in hospitalization.Doran Fink, deputy director of the FDA’s division of vaccines said: “All of these individuals were treated with appropriate medical intervention and thankfully, all are recovered or recovering.“We anticipate that there may be additional reports, which we will rapidly investigate.”He added that US authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were investigating the two cases and working with Britain to better understand two similar cases that occurred there.“While the totality of data at this time continues to support vaccinations under the Pfizer EUA (emergency use authorization), without new restrictions, these cases underscore the need to remain vigilant during the early phase of the vaccination campaign,” Fink said.To this end, he said, “FDA is working with Pfizer to further revise the fact sheets and prescribing information for their vaccines to draw attention to CDC guidelines for post vaccination monitoring and management of immediate allergic reactions.”The revision will include the current warning for people who have a history of allergic reactions to the vaccine’s ingredients to avoid getting the shot for now.It will also include the warning that facilities where vaccines are being administered should ensure that medical treatment for managing serious allergic reactions is immediately available.Fink added that should Moderna receive an emergency use authorization, it will come with similar warnings. Both these vaccines are based on mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology, which had never before been approved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-revise-covid-vaccine-guidance-after-allergic-reactions/story-8GGjvDTKDG3x0j2P9LaqFN.html
18-12-2020||World||Google sued by states for abuse of search-market dominance||A bipartisan coalition of states sued Alphabet Inc.’s Google Thursday alleging broad antitrust violations in the online search market, marking the third US case against the search giant in two months.The lawsuit, led by Colorado, Iowa and other states, marks the latest escalation of the antitrust battle against Google. It comes a day after 10 Republican state attorneys general led by Texas sued the company for anticompetitive practices, and follows an October complaint by the Justice Department.“Combined with the other recent lawsuits filed against Google, never before have so many states and the federal government come together to challenge a company with such power,” Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said a statement. “Google has more data on consumers, and more variety of information, than perhaps any entity in history.”The lawsuit, filed by 38 attorneys general, accuses Google of illegally monopolizing internet search and search advertising through a series of anticompetitive contracts and conduct, hurting consumers and advertisers in the process.The Justice Department and 11 Republican state attorneys general sued Google on Oct. 20 in the most significant monopolization case in more than two decades. That case focuses on Google’s agreements with Apple Inc. and other device makers and partners to provide Google search as a default to users.The Texas-led case focuses on Google’s control over the technology that delivers display ads across the web. It alleges that Google had reached an illegal deal with Facebook Inc. to maintain a chokehold over the lucrative digital advertising market.Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said during a virtual press conference Thursday that the new case goes beyond the Justice Department’s complaint. Unlike the US complaint, the states target Google’s conduct in specialized search services, such as Yelp Inc., saying the company cut off competition from those competitors and made it harder for users to access information from them. Weiser said that the states will move to consolidate the suit with the federal case.“Probably the most comparable case is 20 years ago, the Microsoft case,” Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson told reporters during the press conference. “We’re in a new time, a new era.”The antitrust case against Microsoft Corp., which began in 1998 and focused on deals to distribute its software and operating systems, helped set the terms for competition in the emerging tech industry.Antitrust actions against large technology platforms have escalated dramatically in the final weeks of the year. Last week, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of more than 45 states led by New York filed a pair of lawsuits against Facebook alleging the social-media giant thwarted competition to protect its monopoly. The suits sought court orders to unwind Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.Critics have accused Google of using its dominance of the online search market to steal other companies’ content for its own results and starve competitors of vital traffic. They also claim it has made acquisitions in online ads and video that reduced competition, and locked up key distribution channels on browsers and mobile operating systems.Google says that its search engine is popular and free, that rankings are driven by consumer needs and that prior deals passed regulatory scrutiny. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest case by states.Google has said that the US-led search case is “deeply flawed” and called Wednesday’s filing “meritless” and “inaccurate.” The search engine says that platforms’ agreements for prime placement before consumers are common in many markets and don’t prevent users from switching to competitors.Google also says it faces stiff competition from companies including Amazon.com Inc. for the most profitable searches, which show consumer intent to purchase goods and command greater advertiser dollars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-sued-by-states-for-abuse-of-search-market-dominance/story-k9vC35kFWhth3UKUbENIwJ.html

18-12-2020||India||SC relief for senior Bengal BJP leaders||New Delhi :The Supreme Court on Friday granted protection from arrest to senior leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – national vice president Mukul Roy, state -vice-president Arjun Singh and national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, along with Pawan Singh and Saurav Singh – after they complained to the court that the West Bengal government was preventing them from entering the state where elections are due next year by foisting false cases against them. In petitions before the top court, the leaders contended that cases were lodged against them by West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) soon after they left the party and joined the BJP. Arjun Singh, who is a BJP Member of Parliament from Barrackpore said that 64 cases under petty offences were registered against him at various places in the state starting from March 2019, which was when he left the TMC.The two political parties are in the middle of a pitched battle ahead of next year’s assembly polls, in which the BJP is gunning to wrest power from the TMC and its two-term chief minister Mamata Banerjee.Appearing for Singh, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi told a three-judge bench headed by justice SK Kaul that the cases registered against other petitioners -- Mukul Roy, Pawan Singh and Saurav Singh -- followed the same pattern, as the cases were lodged soon after they joined the BJP. Pawan Singh is the son of Arjun Singh and is a member of West Bengal legislative assembly; Arjun Singh’s nephew Saurav Singh is a councillor in the Bhatpara Municipality in the state which falls under the Barrackpore parliamentary constituency.Rohatgi also said that 17 cases were filed against former MP Mukul Roy since he left the TMC on September 22, 2017 after a falling out with CM Banerjee. Roy joined the BJP on November 3, 2017. Two years ago, the Calcutta high court quashed of the 12 cases filed against Roy.The petitions demanded that these FIRs be investigated by an independent agency, preferably the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Representing Vijayvargiya, his lawyer Prashant Kumar, argued that though he is an MP from Madhya Pradesh and does not stay in West Bengal, yet cases have been lodged against him in order to prevent him from visiting the state to perform his party responsibilities. Rohatgi contended that the TMC government has a pattern of foisting false cases against political opponents. He referred to the case of former officer of the Indian Police Service (IPS) Bharati Ghosh, who joined BJP last year, eventually approached the Supreme Court for protection after 11 FIRs came to be registered against her ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.“Let there be an order that no coercive steps shall be taken against us or else they will succeed in their plans to keep us away from elections scheduled for February-March next year,” Rohatgi submitted.The bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, after holding discussions, said that the petitioners need to be protected in the interim. “Till the next date of hearing there will be no coercive steps in any of the cases against the petitioners,” the court ruled, while issuing notices on each petitions to the West Bengal government, the TMC, the West Bengal director general of police, the state home secretary, the Union of India, and CBI.The matter has been posted for hearing in the week commencing January 3.TMC leaders refused to comment, saying it is a judicial matter. Roy and Singh welcomed the ruling, saying their stand has been vindicated. “We have been saying for a long time that the West Bengal police press charges against BJP leaders and workers to serve their political masters. We stand vindicated,” Roy said after the ruling came.“The only job of the West Bengal police is to register new cases against me. This has been happening ever since Mamata Banerjee realised that she is on the verge of losing power,” said Singh. Columnist and political commentator Suvashis Maitra said, “The court probably took into the account the elections in Bengal. This is indeed a good ruling. Leaders from all parties should be free to take part in political exercise. The investigations can continue.”Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson and former TMC leader Kabir Bose also approached the top court seeking similar relief against the state government, stating in his petition that TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee was seeking his arrest after he filed for annulment of marriage with Banerjee’s daughter in 2015 and joined BJP. On December 6, Bose’s car was attacked and he was unlawfully restrained from moving out of his house. The court separated Bose’s petition from the rest of the matters, and issued a separate notice on Bose’s petition. It also directed the CISF’s Special Security Group to submit the Special Incident Report of December 6 on the next date of hearing in a sealed cover. The court said it will take a call on granting protection from arrest to Bose after going through the report.TMC Lok Sabha member and lawyer Kalyan Banerjee was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-relief-for-senior-bengal-bjp-leaders/story-wDt7Aj46vPwdZmxXdHIuvO.html

The accused, Farooq Ahmed, was booked for attempt to murder, besides other sections of Indian Penal Code and also under Arms Act. “Steps are being taken to cancel his revolver licence and an inquiry has been ordered into the incident,” in-charge district superintendent of police V Satyanarayana told reporters. According to the SP, the incident happened at the Thatiguda area in Adilabad town. Preliminary inquiry revealed that old rivalry between two groups was the reason behind the incident. “However, the immediate provocation for the incident was a clash between two teams of youngsters while playing cricket. Following the clash, Farooq Ahmed came to the spot and entered into an altercation with the rival group. In a fit of rage, he opened fire at the other group. Later, he also tried to attack the rivals with a knife,” Satyanarayana said. Three persons received bullet injuries. While two of them - Zameer and Moteshan - were immediately shifted to Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) at Adilabad, the third person - Mohsin, who was grievously injured - was shifted to Hyderabad for better treatment. Farooq had earlier served as deputy chairman of Adilabad municipality and is currently president of the AIMIM Adilabad district unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aimim-leader-arrested-after-he-opens-fire-in-group-clash-injures-3/story-CI3pOKjtigxEPMlw0yNK0N.html

People familiar with the development said the amount involved in the fraud was even higher than what Nirav Modi owes to India banks. Modi is currently facing extradition proceedings and is lodged in a UK jail. Transstroy, which was into construction of highways, bridges, irrigation projects, metro-related work as well as in the business of oil and gas, is currently under liquidation process as per an order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in September 2019. Apart from Transstroy and Sridhar, the CBI has named as accused Rayapati Sambasiva Rao (additional director in the company) and Akkineni Sathish (additional director) in the FIR registered at its Bengaluru unit. Agency teams on Friday carried out raids in Hyderabad and Guntur at the premises of accused persons and recovered documents related to the fraud, officials said. CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said that Transstroy had availed credit facilities on multiple banking arrangements from a consortium formed with other banks led by Canara Bank. “It was further alleged that the accused was involved in falsification/fabrication of books of accounts, fudging of stock statements, tampering of balance sheets, round tripping of funds, etc. It was also alleged that the accused misappropriated bank’s funds and diverted the loan amount sanctioned by the banks and caused a loss of Rs 7,926.01 crore (approx) to Canara Bank and other member banks. The account had become NPA (non performing asset) and the fraud was reported,” Gaur said. Transstroy’s legal or company representatives could not be located by HT for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-books-hyd-firm-for-bank-fraud/story-iqwR0Rtb56ES3cYTFwic2H.html

This is not new but a rare infection and affects people who are under medication or are suffering from some illness as their immunity remains in a compromised state.Here is all you need to know about this:1. It can occur in almost any part of the body. It can affect the sinuses or the lungs if the fungus enters through inhaling. It can also enter the skin through a cut, burn or ay other type of skin injury.2. If not detected early, the infection – Mucormycosis also known as black fungus – can kill half the patients and lead to loss of vision or jaw in others. 3. How does it affect the eyesight? It enters through the nose and then spreads to the eyes, paralyses the muscles around the pupils which might lead to blindness. It may also cause meningitis if it spreads to the brain.4. This is not contagious. 5. The connection between Covid-19 and Mucormycosis is the weakened immunity response.6. Many Covid-19 patients are given steroids and other drugs that might lower their immunity further, said Dr. Shaloo Bageja, senior eye surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram hospital.7.

Special Armed Force constable Jyoti Prasad Sharma, 45, and his wife Neelam, 43, residents of Rukmani Nagar, were found dead at their house on Thursday morning. Indore deputy inspector general (DIG) HN Mishra on Friday said, “The girl and her 20-year-old friend Dhananjay Yadav were arrested from Mandsaur on Thursday late night while they were trying to run away to Rajasthan after the crime. Police recovered some documents and cash of Rs 1 lakh from their possession.” “The accused confessed to their crime. The girl said her parents used to object to her friendship with Dhananjay. A few days ago, her father saw her with Dhananjay and the father beat them up. Her mother also used to scold her for the friendship,” Mishra said. “On Wednesday night, the girl mixed a sedative in the food of her parents. On Thursday early morning, the girl called Dhananjay to her home. Dhananjay first killed Neelam with a sharp-edged weapon then he attacked Jyoti Prasad. Jyoti Prasad fought back and screamed aloud for help but the girl went outside and told neighbours, who came out of their houses after hearing the screams of Jyoti Prasad, that her parents were fighting with each other. After killing the couple, Dhananjay asked the girl to write a letter against her father and make false accusations,” said the DIG. They stole Rs 1 lakh and locked the house from outside before running away from Indore, said the police. The girl’s elder brother Rishabh Sharma and her paternal grandmother Shreedevi Sharma, who lives in the neighbourhood, broke the lock to enter the house. They saw the couple in a pool of blood and informed the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-year-old-girl-her-friend-arrested-for-killing-parents-in-mp-s-indore/story-0YLOuPFICmqb2TE9h0N8mJ.html
18-12-2020||India||India dismisses reports of UN vehicle being targeted across LoC||Claims made by the Pakistan Army and Foreign Office that a UN vehicle was targeted by Indian troops on the Line of Control (LoC) are false and factually incorrect, people familiar with developments said on Friday.The Pakistani military’s media arm and Foreign Office had both claimed that a vehicle carrying two officers of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) was “specifically targeted” by Indian troops from across the LoC. Pakistani military spokesman Major General Babar Iftikhar had tweeted photos of a UN vehicle with apparent damage to its windows and chassis, and contended the SUV was the target of “unprovoked fire” in Chirikot sector of the LoC. One of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity: “The reports emerging from the Pakistani side regarding an attack on a UN vehicle are completely false and factually incorrect.”The person added: “There was no firing from the Indian side in this sector on Friday. Since movements of UN vehicles are known in advance, the question does not arise of any such firing. The allegations are baseless.”The Indian side doesn’t recognise UNMOGIP, which has offices in Srinagar and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Chaudhri had described the purported firing on the UN vehicle as a “new low”. He said the incident occurred at 10.45 am when the UNMOGIP officers were on their way to Polas village in Chirikot sector to meet people affected by ceasefire violations on the LoC. The UN vehicle was damaged but the officers were unhurt, Chaudhri said.There have been intense exchanges of fire between Indian and Pakistani troops along the LoC in recent months. The Indian side has said it responds to unprovoked firing by Pakistani troops that is meant to provide cover to terrorists trying to sneak across the LoC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-dismisses-reports-of-un-vehicle-being-targeted-across-loc/story-SSIZsVwFPLwVe3rn7iVP2M.html
18-12-2020||India||Air quality dips in Mumbai as cold wave continues in northern India||The ongoing cold wave in north-western India had an impact on the air quality in Mumbai on Friday, with many parts of the city reporting poor to very poor quality of air. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator—of 218 on Friday, falling in the poor quality category. The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. This is the poorest quality of air the city has had since December 5 when the AQI shot up to 225. SAFAR categorizes AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. Bandra Kurla Complex recorded the poorest air quality with an AQI of 362, followed by Navi Mumbai where an AQI of 329 was recorded—both in the very poor category. SAFAR has predicted that air quality will remain poor on Saturday as well. “The poor air quality is primarily because of the cold wave which is likely to continue for at least two-three days. At the same time, now the air flow has changed and more wind is coming in from the land, rather than the sea. The air quality from the land is poorer,” said a spokesperson for SAFAR. While north-western India is reeling under a severe cold wave, temperatures in Mumbai were relatively high. Colaba recorded a maximum temperature of 31.6 degrees Celsius, only 0.7 degrees below the normal temperature. The Santacruz station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a maximum temperature of 32.9 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature at the Colaba station was 22 degree Celsius and at Santacruz was 21.2 degree Celsius. KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD, said that temperatures are likely to drop in the last week of December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-quality-dips-in-mumbai-as-cold-wave-continues-in-northern-india/story-wss9UDMjwdfOrViBjyXEsI.html
18-12-2020||India||BJP, Cong leaders voiceless, only BJD can fight for Odisha’s interests: Naveen Patnaik||Even as the Trinamool Congress in neighbouring Bengal faces massive challenges from the BJP ahead of assembly polls next year, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday invoked regionalism while launching an attack on both BJP and Congress leaders accusing them of being remote-controlled by their Central leadership.Addressing the first executive body meeting of the Biju Yuva Janata Dal, the youth wing of the party through the virtual route, Patnaik said only a regional party can fight for the interest of the state.“The Congress government in the state was remote-controlled from Delhi. The BJP governments in other states also follow the direction of the national leadership. National parties are bound to compromise on the distinctive requirements of a state for gains in the larger national context. State leaders of national parties neither have the voice to insist on protecting our unique heritage nor do they have the intent to do so in a hierarchical centralized national party structure. BJD is the only regional party that is working hard to preserve and promote the unique identity of Odisha,” Patnaik said.“We are not a drop in the ocean, we are the ocean. Remember my words! Only a regional party will do justice for aspirations of the youth and preserve the state’s unique identity. Otherwise, the mainstreaming national parties will make you a small drop in their vast ocean,” he said, alluding to massive poaching of TMC leaders by BJP in Bengal.Patnaik said for Odias the Odia language was more important than Hindi. “Mahanadi is more sacred than any other river, Odissi music is a classical art form, Kosali and Ho are mainstream languages, the rich diversity of our tribal population is our pride and Sambalpuri handloom is world-class. Our mineral wealth is bountiful and unmatched. The diversity and richness of tribal culture is our strength. All these do not matter to a national party or their branches in states,” he said.Patnaik said the primary objective of national parties is to win elections and have power to form government at the Centre. “They (leaders of national parties) have to basically impress the national headship so that they can get crucial posts or become ministers. The state leaders of national parties neither have the voice to insist on protecting our unique heritage nor do they have the intent to do so in a hierarchical centralized national party structure,” the CM said.Continuing his tirade against BJP, Patnaik said his government has been urging the Centre for ‘Special State’ status for Odisha as the state faces natural disasters every year, “Both the national parties – BJP and Congress had kept Special Category Status as their number one point in the manifesto of the 2019 general elections. But like always, they forgot it conveniently after the polls. On the other hand, BJD will continue to fight for it and keep reminding national parties about their step motherly treatment of Odisha. The very purpose of forming a separate state is to preserve, protect our unique identity and continue to fight for the people of Odisha,” said Patnaik.BJP in its reaction said the chief minister’s tirade showed BJD does not have any agenda to develop the state. “Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan is working hard to ensure development of Odisha and the voice of the state is now being heard in Delhi. The Centre had suggested resolving the Mahanadi issue by amicable discussions. But BJD is resorting to agitations and it doesn’t have any intent to protect the interests of the state. After BJP led by PM Narendra Modi came to power, Odisha has been getting what it deserves which was not possible during the UPA regime,” said Golak Mohapatra, senior BJP leader.Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee president Niranjan Patnaik said Patnaik’s speech was to play down speculations over the BJD- BJP nexus. “BJD is trying to show that they are do not support the ideology of the BJP by raking up the stepmotherly treatment by the Centre only to save its own image before the people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-cong-leaders-voiceless-only-bjd-can-fight-for-odisha-s-interests-naveen-patnaik/story-CjV4tPE6yS3HY0IRScnAaI.html

The Vice Chief of Army staff cautioned that the increasing interest of “extra regional forces” and the existing challenges of piracy, human trafficking, illegal fishing have all made the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) volatile and a potential “global battlefield”.India has significantly expanded its deployment of warships and submarines in the Indian Ocean Region in the last few months following its border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh, ostensibly to send across a message to Beijing.Lt Gen Saini identified preserving and facilitating the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) as among key challenges, adding inadequate arrangements for equitable and peaceful harnessing of natural resources were also important aspect of the overall scenario. “These concerns have been further accentuated by unilateral actions by some of the nations which have not only questioned the rights of the IOR nations to utilise their exclusive economic zones but have also challenged their sovereignty over some of the strategically located Islands itself,” he said. In his address at the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies (CENJOWS), the Vice Chief of Army Staff said such actions to change the “well-established equilibrium” has resulted in “immense turbulence and an intense superpower rivalry” in the region.“India’s dominant position at the geographical centre of the IOR, a robust economy and a global standing as an upholder of law and democratic values, places it well to play a vital role in the quest for peace and stability in the region,” he said.Lt Gen Saini said India has been increasingly engaging with all nations of the IOR and its outreach towards the East through the doctrine of SAGAR or ‘Security and Growth for All’ has been a pillar of its overarching foreign policy.“India recognises and believes that to harness the vast potential of the Indian Ocean for economic development, adherence to rule of law, transparency, respect for all nations and peaceful resolution of disputes will be inviolate and non-negotiable aspects,” he said.“It would be appropriate to say that our role as a net security provider in the region is now a strategic obligation and no longer a matter of choice. India, therefore, requires to formulate a well defined IOR strategy and follow a robust capability development road map to live up to its potential in this region,” he said.Lt Gen Saini said the unfolding diplomacy in the IOR is a clear indicator that the world powers want to forge partnerships with India to ensure peace and development in the region. The Vice Chief of Army Staff reiterated that the geographical factors coupled with the slow and steady shift of power from the West to the East, have resulted in the IOR becoming a hub of global geopolitical rivalry.The discussion was organised to get the defence forces, Indian industry, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders into a common platform in order to understand the complexities of changing dynamics in the Indian Ocean Region and to evolve coherent policies to address the future challenges. ‘||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/well-positioned-to-undertake-vital-role-in-indian-ocean-region-army-vice-chief-saini/story-Eb6uWE2COm4CcIqrELursK.html

MNM which was formed in 2018 contested in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections under the battery-torch symbol. MNM “has filed a writ petition” for “directing the Election Commission of India to allot the battery-torch’ symbol in its favour and to restrain MGR Makkal Katchi from using the same”, said a statement from the party on Friday. Last week, the Election Commission of India (ECI) allotted symbols to political parties in the run- up to the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry in 2021. MNM was allotted the battery-torch symbol only for Puducherry and failed to get it for Tamil Nadu. In the state, the symbol went to MGR Makkal Katchi for all 234 assembly constituencies. MNM has stated in its prayer that it is entitled to the symbol as per provisions of the Election symbols (Reservation and Allotment) order, 1968. Haasan will contest in the assembly elections due in early 2021 and losing the ‘battery-torch’ could be a setback for the party which has campaigned with this symbol. Haasan recently concluded his four-day campaign across six districts including Madurai and Thoothukudi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamal-haasan-s-party-mnm-moves-madras-hc-seeks-battery-torch-symbol/story-KlqTXAAPh5xnKDtd6ffILK.html

He said by December, the national transporter had already achieved 97% of last year’s loading.Yadav said the railways has suffered massive losses in passenger revenue due to the suspension of train services because of the coronavirus pandemic.“It is not possible to give a definite date for the resumption of normal train services. The general managers have been in discussion with the state governments and we will resume the services when and where we get the go-ahead. Even now, the situation is not normal.“So far, our earnings from passenger revenue are Rs 4,600 crore and by the year-end, our aim is to take our total earnings from the passenger segment to Rs 15,000 crore. In the last fiscal, our earnings from this segment were Rs 53,000 crore. This makes our earnings 87% less than the last year,” Yadav said.He pointed out that even the trains that are currently in operation are witnessing around 30-40% occupancy on an average, reflecting that the fear of the pandemic is still there.Yadav said the railways is currently operating 1,089 special trains, while the Kolkata Metro is running 60% of its services, the Mumbai suburban is running 88% trains and 50% of the Chennai suburban services are in operation.Yadav said senior railway officials are closely monitoring the situation and normal train services will be resumed “slowly” in a phased manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-possible-to-give-date-for-normal-service-resumption-railway-board/story-CCCafEjTjhuNgGS3eGsWBN.html

18-12-2020||India||CBI books Hyderabad company for loan fraud, amount bigger than Nirav Modi case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a case against a Hyderabad based company, Transstroy (India) Ltd, for allegedly cheating a consortium of banks of Rs 7,926 crore, officials said on Friday. People familiar with the development said that the amount involved in the fraud is even higher than what fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi owes to banks in India. The 49-year-old is currently facing extradition proceedings and is lodged in a UK jail. He owes some Rs 7,700 crore to Indian banks. Transstroy, which deals in construction of highways, bridges, irrigation projects, metro related work and is also in the business of oil and gas, is currently under liquidation process as per an order by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in September 2019. Apart from Transstroy and its CMD Cherukuri Shridhar Sridhar, the CBI has named as accused Rayapati Sambasiva Rao (additional director in the company) and Akkineni Sathish (additional director) in the FIR registered at its Bengaluru unit. The agency teams on Friday carried out raids in Hyderabad and Guntur at the premises of accused persons and recovered documents related to the fraud, officials said. CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said that Transstroy had availed credit facilities on multiple banking arrangements from consortium formed with other banks led by Canara Bank. “It was further alleged that the accused had involved in falsification/fabrication of books of accounts, fudging of stock statements, tampering of balance sheets, round tripping of funds etc. It was also alleged that the accused misappropriated bank’s funds and diverted the loan amount sanctioned by the banks and caused loss of Rs 7926.01 crore (approx) to Canara Bank and other member banks. The account had become NPA (non performing asset) and the fraud was reported,” Gaur said. Transstroy’s legal or company representatives could not be located by HT for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-company-booked-for-fraud-scam-bigger-than-nirav-modi-case/story-sH8ZaWMhVhAx93sqaezweJ.html
18-12-2020||India||Kerala HC asks govt to return Rs 10 crore it got from Guruvayur temple for flood relief||The Kerala High Court on Friday ordered the state government to return Rs 10 crore it had received from the Guruvayur Devasom Board towards the CM’s relief fund. In the order the court said the temple fund was meant to develop the shrine and its allied services and it was not proper to divert it for other reasons. A devotee N Nagesh had approached the court saying that the presiding deity was the sole proprietor of the temple fund and the board has no right to divert the shrine fund. The temple board had contributed Rs 10 crore to the CM’s relief fund after two consecutive floods in the state, 2018 and 2019. Earlier, a single bench of the High Court had asked the government to return the money but the government approached a division bench which also upheld the single bench verdict. In May this year, Guruvayur Devasom Board chairman K B Mohandas had handed over the fund to the Thrissur district collector saying the contribution was part of the temple’s social responsibility. Many Hindu bodies had decried the decision saying it was unlawful. But the board justified its decision saying it was done earlier also. “Matters such as contributions towards disaster relief fund do not fall under the preview of the Devasom Board. It can protect the temple wealth but has no right to pass it on to someone else,” the court said in its order. Many organisations including the Hindu Aikya Vedi lauded the verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-asks-govt-to-return-rs-10-crore-it-got-from-guruvayur-temple-for-flood-relief/story-QOrerPuVJ07i05tSfajhnI.html

The 2621 page long charge sheet filed in court of the special judge under several sections of Indian Penal Code, Information Technology Act, Arms Act, Assam Police Act and Prevention of Corruption Act pertains to leakage of question paper of the written exam to recruit sub-inspectors in Assam Police. The case was registered on the basis of an FIR lodged in September by Pradeep Kumar, the then chairman of the police recruitment board. Those named as accused include retired IPS officer Prasanta Kumar Dutta, senior police officer Kumar Sanjit Krishna and BJP leader Dibon Deka. The written exam to select 597 sub-inspectors to Assam Police was cancelled on September 20 after the question paper got leaked. Dutta and Deka had allegedly fleeced many candidates for the SI post by assuring jobs in lieu of cash. Deka is alleged to have procured the question paper ahead of the written test. Police investigation revealed that a day ahead of the test, many candidates had taken a mock exam in a Guwahati hotel. Nearly 70 of these candidates were staying at one of the five hotels Dutta owns in Guwahati. Krishna is accused of having played a role in leaking the question paper. As per the charge sheet filed in 87 days of the first arrest in the case, during investigation police teams seized Rs 6.26 crore in cash, 32 mobile phones, 11 digital video recorders, 5 laptops and 10 vehicles from 24 crime scenes spread across four districts. The charge sheet names 183 persons as prosecution witnesses. Confessional statements of 5 accused persons and statements of 32 witnesses have been recorded by judicial magistrate. The written exam to recruit sub-inspectors was conducted again in November and the results declared this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-assam-ex-ips-officer-bjp-leader-among-36-accused-named-in-charge-sheet-in-police-job-scam/story-Iix9Caq9XOriGGP7cHTPUI.html
18-12-2020||India||Jagan govt accused of ignoring order on local body polls, faces contempt||Andhra Pradesh state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar on Friday filed a contempt of court petition in the state high court against the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government for its non-cooperation with the commission in conducting local body elections in the state. In the petition, Ramesh Kumar charged the state government with not honouring the high court’s order dated November 3, directing it to extend necessary cooperation to the State Election Commission (SEC) to hold panchayat raj elections in February 2021. “The state government’s refusal to comply with the high court directions is contemptuous in nature,” Kumar said in the petition, in which he mentioned chief secretary Neelam Sawhney and principal secretary, panchayat raj Gopala Krishna Dwivedi as respondents. He said despite writing several letters to the chief secretary and the principal secretary of the panchayat raj department for initiating the process for conducting the elections in February, there had not been proper response from them till date. Ramesh Kumar further said the government was not releasing necessary funds to the SEC as per the budgetary allocations to enable it to take up the election process. It was also not filling up existing vacancies in the SEC, which was essential to conduct the elections despite the court orders, he alleged. Ever since the SEC decided last month to hold the elections to the panchayat raj bodies in February, the state government has been strongly resisting the same on the ground that the state was yet to overcome the severity of the coronavirus pandemic. The government stonewalled the attempts of Ramesh Kumar to hold video conferences with district collectors to discuss the preparedness for local body elections, forcing him to move the high court. On Tuesday, the state government filed an affidavit in the high court stating that it would not be possible to conduct the elections to local bodies in February, as the official machinery would be busy with the coronavirus vaccination programme. The government argued that as per the central government guidelines, the vaccination programme will be taken up in January and February. Not only the police department, but the employees of various other departments would be engaged in the vaccination programme, it said. However, the SEC filed a counter on Thursday stating that the conduct of local body elections would in no way affect the vaccination programme. “Moreover, it will take at least three to six months for the vaccination programme to commence in the state,” he said. The SEC also brought to the notice of the high court that elections were held in Bihar, Rajasthan and Hyderabad without any issue amid the coronavirus pandemic. “The situation in Andhra Pradesh is conducive for holding elections to local bodies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-govt-accused-of-ignoring-order-on-local-body-polls-faces-contempt/story-4bFKC8r38jolREeHZKXSVN.html
18-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest: Solution hopefully before year ends, says Tomar | 4 key points||The day farmers’ ongoing protest completes the 23rd day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually addressed a farmers’ conference in Madhya Pradesh which made it clear that the government is ready for more talks, leading to probable amendments, but repealing the laws is not quite on its table. The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that it won’t interfere with the protest at this moment as long as the protest is peaceful. It has also proposed a committee of experts to broker peace between farmers and Centre.Here are the major takeaways of the 23rd day of the protest:Main protest gaining strength: The protest gains strength as the All India Kisan Sabha has now extended support to the protesting farmers. Thousands of farmers will start from Nashik on December 21 to come and join the protest in Delhi.A group comprising 20 Indian doctors from the USA has delayed its return to provide medical services at Tikri border.Chipko movement leader Sundarlal Bahuguna has extended his support to farmers.Informal talks with farmers going on, says ministry: Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar in an interview to PTI said solution is likely before this year ends. Though official talks between the Centre and the farmers have not furthered after five rounds, informal talks are going on, Tomar said. “Farm leaders, who are concerned about welfare of farmers, should discuss peasants’ problems. Why should it matter if the acts are repealed or not?” Tomar said.Farmers have previously objected to Centre parallelly talking to a few groups of farmers organisations.Farmers our top priority: PM Modi’s messageExplaining the benefits of the new farm laws, Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a one-hour long address to Madhya Pradesh farmers where he appealed to farmers with folded hands. His appeal was to not believe in the rumours allegedly spread by the opposition parties. However, if the farmers have concerns, the government is ready to address all, PM Modi said, as farmers are the top priority. BJP ministers addressing farm issuesOn Friday, several BJP ministers addressed the issue of the ongoing farmers’ protest, training their guns on the opposition. “The opposition says that the one who made the bills isn’t a farmer. The one who talks of producing 40-inch potato is he a farmer? Is Sonia Gandhi a farmer? The one who actually did something for farmers is PM Narendra Modi,” Smriti Irani said in Meerut. “Failed political players who have been rejected repeatedly by the people are acting under their depression of defeat and misleading the farmers,” Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.Meanwhile, the mortal remains of Sikh preacher Sant Ram Singh, who was supporting the protest against the farm laws and allegedly committed suicide near the Singhu border unable to bear the “pain of farmers”, were consigned to flames in Karnal on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-solution-hopefully-before-year-ends-says-tomar-4-key-points/story-WDoM1LK9oxq4leQxWuOjuM.html

18-12-2020||India||Dissenting voices against ex-Trinamool leaders’ likely entry into BJP||Hours after Trinamool Congress MLA Jitendra Tiwari resigned as chief of Asansol Municipal Corporation and from the party on Thursday, top BJP leaders from the state made it clear that he may not be welcome in the party.At least four TMC legislators have resigned from the party in the last 48 hours. While Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, a former minister, has already expressed his interest in joining the BJP, speculations abound that Suvendu Ahikari, another former TMC minister, may join the BJP too on Saturday. Top BJP leaders have already welcomed Adhikari. But as far as other TMC names are concerned some BJP leaders and workers have expressed their reservations. Tiwari, one among the four Trinamool leaders who have quit the party, may not find it easy to switch over to the rival BJP camp. Those against him are Asansol MP Babul Supriyo and BJP’s mahila morcha president Agnimitra Paul.“What my Top Bosses decide is a different thing but I will try my very best with all my might & honesty to ensure that NO #TMC leader who tormented, tortured (both Physically & Mentally) my grass root level BJP colleagues in Asansol, don’t get an entry in BJP,” union minister Babul Supriyo said in a Facebook post. A senior BJP leader said that Supriyo hasn’t named anyone in his post. “Whatever I did in the past, was for the party (TMC). But as I was the MLA, I take the responsibility,” Tiwari said, adding, “I am not going to BJP. I never said that I would be joining BJP. I may go back to my former profession. I was a lawyer. But before that I want to spend some time with my family.” Agnimitra Paul too echoed Supriyo and took a dig at Tiwari, but said that the BJP’s top leadership would take the final decision. “People of Asansol don’t like him. He had heckled Supriyo and had opposed him in every possible way. He didn’t say a word over the past nine and half years and now that elections are just five months away he is saying that Asansol has been deprived because of the TMC. Everyone knows why he is doing this. Some TMC leaders are eager to join the BJP and he may be one of them,” said Paul. “Everyone is welcome. But what is important is what role or responsibility he would get in the BJP,” she added.Meanwhile, at Bishnupur assembly constituency in Bankura district, some BJP workers raised slogans against former Trinamool minister Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. “Suvendu Adhikari is my leader. I am joining the BJP with him,” Mukherjee told reporters after quitting the TMC. BJP leaders maintained that party leadership will decide on the matter. “We have not been intimated from either by the party leadership whether Mukherjee would be joining the party. But when we came to know that he may join, we have informed the state leadership that the people of Bishnupur are peeved with the news that Mukherjee may join BJP. Now the party will take the call,” said a BJP leader from Bishnupur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissenting-voices-against-ex-trinamool-leader-s-likely-entry-into-bjp/story-glW58yRQNn2aOPoWu3nH2N.html

The FAQs, released by the health ministry on Thursday, range from answering which groups will be administered the Covid-19 vaccine in the first phase, preventive measures that need to be followed even after receiving the vaccine dosage and the potential common side- effects people should watch out for after taking the drug. Here are the FAQs for health care providers and frontline workers:- Why am I being chosen for Covid-19 vaccine?Government of India has prioritised the most at risk/high risk groups which will get the vaccine first. Healthcare providers have led the battle against Covid-19 from the front. The government wantsyou to be able to continue your work, without the fear of risk associated with the virus. Therefore, healthcare and frontline workers are among the first group of people to be vaccinated in the country.- What are the groups to be vaccinated in the first phase?Based on the potential availability of vaccines the Government of India has selected the priority groups who will be vaccinated on priority as they are at higher risk. The first group includes healthcare workers because they are at high risk of contracting the infection and protecting them helps to sustain essential health services. The vaccination of frontline workers will help in reducing the societal and economic impact by reducing Covid-19 mortalities. The next group to receive Covid-19 vaccine will be persons over 50 years of age and persons under 50 years with comorbid conditions because there is high mortality in this category.The reason for including more than 50 years of age group for vaccination is that it will be able to cover 78% of persons having co-morbidities and thereby reduce mortality on account of Covid-19. More than 50 years of age group is divided into two sub groups. One sub group is 60 years and above, they will be vaccinated first. Second subgroup is between 50 to 60 years age group, they will be vaccinated after the first sub group is covered.The vaccination may not be sequential. It can go in parallel for all beneficiaries depending on the availability of the vaccine.- Will my family members also be given the vaccine?Due to the limited vaccine supply in the initial phase, it will first be provided to people who are at higher risk of contracting Covid-19. In subsequent phases the Covid-19 vaccine will be made available to all others in need of the same.- Is this vaccine safe?Yes. Safety and efficacy of vaccine will be ensured through various phases of vaccine trials and only then a vaccine will be introduced.- Does one need to follow preventive measures such as wearing a mask, hand sanitization, social distancing after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine?Even after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, we must continue taking all precautions like use of face cover or masks, hand sanitization and maintain distancing (6 feet or Do Gaj). These behaviours must be followed both at the session site and in general.- Are there any common side effects of this vaccine?The Covid-19 vaccine will be safe and effective but may have minor side effects like fever, pain, etc. at the injection site. These effects can happen in any vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-am-i-being-chosen-for-covid-19-vaccine-and-5-other-faqs-for-frontline-workers/story-wirLcYs11fOb6EtRINhpIN.html

He said that the electoral college of the Congress, All India Congress Committee (AICC) members and Congress workers and members would be involved in the procedure. “Party will soon start the procedure to elect a new party president. Electoral college of Congress, AICC members, Congress workers & members will choose who’s best suited. 99.9% of people including me want Rahul Gandhi to be elected as party president,” he said. The grand old party will be electing its new President ahead of the crucial polls of West Bengal, Kerala, Assam and Tamil Nadu. The party’s recent poor performances in the state assembly elections of Bihar and Maharashtra have turned several of its eminent leaders into dissenters. Current party president Sonia Gandhi has called for a strategy meet on Saturday and some of these dissenters are expected to be present. The group includes eminent names like the leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and former Union minister Shashi Tharoor. The party has even sought advice from block- and district-level leaders for suitable candidates for the top posts in states. The move is mainly aimed at checking infighting in states and uniting warring factions, a Congress functionary who did not wish to be named said. The youth wing of the Congress have scrapped the internal polling system that was started by former President and current favourite to take over the party presidency Rahul Gandhi in 2008. The Youth Congress devised a new format that is based on membership enrolment to elect its state unit chiefs. This system was adopted in the Himachal Pradesh selection and will be used for the selection process in Gujarat, Telangana and Mumbai. However, the selection in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh will follow the old procedure. Congress had a dismal showing in the recently contested Bihar Assembly Elections, winning only 19 seats after contesting for 70.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/99-9-congress-members-want-rahul-gandhi-as-president-randeep-surjewala/story-UF9fOsBH0QymqCT0TdPmzL.html

Shetty who belongs to Congress has refused to step down despite the BJP with 31 members and JD(S) with 14 members apart from the support of an independent in the 75-member house being determined to oust him.Citing procedural lapses in the no-confidence motion against him, Shetty had refused to entertain the notice given by the ruling party in the state. Shetty now has asked the council secretary why he was prevented from entering the council chamber in violation of rules. He has also asked for an explanation why the deputy Chairman belonging to the JDS was allowed to preside over the proceedings and also to explain the sequence of events that culminated in the house being adjourned. Shetty has accused the council secretary of dereliction in her duty and has sought a detailed report.CM Yediyurappa had strongly condemned the behaviour of Shetty as well as Congress members and said that in spite of not having the backing of the house, he had adjourned it sine die without the no-confidence motion being taken up. Former CM and leader of opposition in the assembly Siddaramaiah had hit back saying “While it is true that we may not have had a majority, there are established rules and regulations on how the house should be run. Since the BJP chose to violate them, we were left with no choice.”A delegation of BJP-JDS leaders has petitioned the Governor to intervene and the Congress has said that Shetty will not resign and is ready for a legal battle.

18-12-2020||India||4 UP govt offices reduce carbon footprint, show how it’s done||A set of government offices in the Agra division of western Uttar Pradesh have significantly reduced their carbon footprint by cutting electricity consumption and by planting trees outdoors and keeping potted plants indoors. National Savings offices at Agra, Mainpuri, Mathura and Firozabad districts have made carbon neutrality their mission, thereby playing their part in reducing global warming. Carbon neutrality refers to achieving net zero carbon dioxide emissions by balancing or removing CO2 emissions. “Power generation and power consumption, fossil fuel burning and reduction of plants are major contributors to carbon emission that leads to global warming,” says Prabhat Mishra, deputy director, National Savings, Agra division.In February, Mishra sent out a circular to the four offices reporting to him to cut power bills and increase the green cover in the office premises. It worked.For instance, Agra office’s power bill in August 2019 was Rs 3,259, which was brought down to Rs 2,525 for the same month this year.“Normally, power bills gradually increase every year, but we have reduced it by a conscious effort,” says Mishra, who, despite being a government official, also runs an environment protection movement called the Red Tape movement. The movement began with tree protection by red-taping trees more than a decade ago.The carbon neutrality mission is also inspired by 17-year-old Greta Thunberg, the Swedish environmental activist known for challenging world leaders to take immediate action against climate change. Greta follows the Red Tape movement on Twitter.“She is the biggest carbon neutrality activist in the world. We thought of making a beginning in the direction. What we did is just a baby step, but if all government offices, institutions, households follow our model, together it can make a huge difference,” says Mishra.The four National Savings offices removed bricks from the paved outdoor areas at their office premises and planted large surface area leafed trees in those spots. Every office planted five to a dozen trees, besides crotons and aloe vera plants-- known as indoor air purifiers-- in pots. Apart from this, the Mathura office roped in savings agents—they promote the habit of money-saving among people—to double up as carbon neutrality agents.“Now, of the 600 agents in Mathura, nearly 100 have also become carbon neutrality agents. When they go out in the field to promote savings, they also tell people to reduce their power consumption, fossil fuel consumption, plant trees, and have air-purifying potted plants indoors,” says Mishra. The movement is growing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-up-govt-offices-reduce-carbon-footprint-show-how-it-s-done/story-Ntyg8bVdeUp56pceWmhwDN.html
18-12-2020||India||Climate change-led migration in India could treble by 2050: Report||Over 62 million South Asian people may have to migrate from their homes due to slow onset climate disasters such as sea-level rise, water stress, crop yield reductions, ecosystem loss and drought by 2050, according to a new report by Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA) and Action Aid International.In India, an estimated 14 million people may have migrated this year due to slow onset climate change events according to the report. This number is expected to more than treble if current nationally determined contributions are not enhanced and the world heads for 3.2 degrees C warming over pre-industrial levels.The research was undertaken by Bryan Jones, one of the authors of the World Bank’s Groundswell Report on internal climate migration in 2018. He uses a model that projects future changes in the spatial distribution of the population, from which estimates of climate change led migration is drawn. Ecosystem loss and drought have been added as new drivers of climate migration, along with water and agriculture sectors that were included in the Groundswell report.Also read | ‘India will achieve targets, exceed expectations’: PM Modi at UN Climate Ambition SummitThese numbers do not include migration caused by sudden climate disasters such as flooding and cyclone and the report also assumes that countries will start taking action towards meeting their pledges and targets under the Paris Agreement. Some examples of sudden climate disasters that have led to large scale migration in the recent past include cyclone Sidr in 2007 that caused damages to USD1.5 billion in Bangladesh; Amphan earlier this year caused losses worth USD13 billion and 118 lives; cyclone Bulbul, again in West Bengal last year, damaged crops across almost 1.5 million hectares of land, triggered fishery damage worth USD100 million, and killed 13, 286 livestock. However, in India, over 60% of agriculture is rain-fed. The region’s rural communities are thus highly sensitive to crop-destroying climatic shocks and 99.3% of south Asia’s agricultural workers are informal labour which makes them more vulnerable.“Slow-onset climate impacts could cause countries in South Asia to lose nearly 2% of their GDP by 2050, rising to a loss of nearly 9% by 2100, without counting for the losses due to extreme weather events,” the report released on Friday has said. Some climate hot spots will experience displacement due to uninhabitable rising temperatures, eroding rivers and rising seas like the Sundarbans or the Mahanadi delta.In their study of migration patterns, the report found that the poor in south Asia often sell their belongings and take loans at predatory interest rates to fund their migration. Forced movement often takes people to urban areas nearby and then to megacities where they are forced to take poorly waged unskilled jobs. Most of the internal movement within South Asia is considered as seasonal or circular migration, where some members of families migrate for a period of the year to another rural area or urban centre, falling agricultural incomes, rural communities across South Asia is also leading to a combination of incomes from agriculture and remittance sent by migrated members of their family.“Political failure to limit global warming to below 2 degree C, as per the Paris agreement goal, is already driving 18 million climate migrants from their homes in 2020. New analysis, released today, estimates climate migration will treble in South Asia alone, a region badly affected by climate disasters including floods, droughts, typhoons and cyclones, a statement by CANSA said.Harjeet Singh, global climate lead at Action Aid said that the migration patterns emerged from the 2011 census have been used to model impacts of climate change on movement of people for the report. “The Indian government hasn’t woken up to the reality of climate change yet. It doesn’t know how badly people and livelihoods are going to be impacted. We need to take various climate scenarios into account for the policies we develop which isn’t happening. The rich countries have historical responsibility but we have to prepare ourselves for the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-change-led-migration-in-india-could-treble-by-2050-report/story-RbSV0Dl7mzEMN8fhftBCnL.html

The helicopter replica in silver weighs a little over a kilogram.Defending the move to offer the chopper replica in silver, Shivakumar said that religion and beliefs is an individual matter and is between the believer and God.According to people close to Shivakumar, the KPCC president who is an adherent of astrology and rituals believes that some of the setbacks including being jailed by the ED in a disproportionate assets case were because of this violation of temple custom. Therefore on their advice, he visited the temple and gifted the silver helicopter model. Later, Shivakumar visited and took blessings of Dingaleshwar Mutt Swami in Shirahatti taluk of neighbouring Gadag district. The panchayat polls which are being fought without a party symbol will have their results declared on December 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kpcc-chief-dk-shivakumar-offers-silver-helicopter-replica-at-bellary-temple/story-ClOKyGDc1bIiJyWIzyQApN.html

A final decision on the exact date from which road passage will be blocked will be taken in a meeting on December 20 in Roorkee. Chaudhary Padam Singh Rod, state president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rod), said, “It’s time to intensify the agitation and in our union meeting, we will decide the date and points of protest as well as blocking the entry roads into Dehradun. Both the Central and state BJP-led government has taken an anti-peasant stance and are playing in the hands of the corporates which we will not tolerate any cost.” While other major farmer unions Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait), BKU (Ambawat) and BKU (Tomar) are also opposing the three farm laws, they have not decided to carry out road or rail blockade in any part of the state. Farmer leader and ex-legislator Ambrish Kumar said that despite braving inclement weather conditions, farmers’ agitation has spread in the country. Major trade unions of Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (BHEL) and industrial sector of SIIDCUL have also extended their support to the ongoing agitation of farmers. BHEL Majdoor Trade Union, Devbhoomi Shramik and Inqalabi Majdoor Trade union have also assured their support to the agitating farmers in the district against the farm laws. BHEL Majdoor Trade Union representative Brajraj said labour unions have extended support to farmers’ fight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-bharatiya-kisan-union-rod-warns-of-blocking-road-entry-to-dehradun/story-XWWFUMOy9gKs0ljFvBWhdI.html
18-12-2020||India||Self-regulation in social, traditional media needed: Vice President||Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Friday said there was need to ensure “sanity” in the use of the rapidly expanding social media platforms, given the implications for social harmony, common good, peace and national security.He said the freedom of expression does not mean unfettered outburst of anger and hate against each other that may lead to chaos in society.Journalism by nature, the vice president said, is supposed to be critical of the order of the times based on facts and supported by evidence. But he emphasised that this should not slip into “complete negativity”.Media should use a standard set of reporting and analytical tools that captures the changing narrative without imposing respective positions, and should not be seen by the public as discrediting the changes taking place, the vice president said.Pointing out that advertisement revenue is key to the viability of any media organisation, Naidu said with the mushrooming of media outlets and the shrinking revenue pie, the traditional norms and principles of journalism are being forced to be compromised with serious consequences.Speaking at the 6th MV Kamat Memorial Endowment Lecture on ‘Journalism: Past, Present and Future’, he said the disruption caused by technology has resulted in a serious crisis for the media and appropriate revenue sharing models need to be evolved for the survival of traditional media.“Technology giants have emerged as the algorithmic gate keepers of information and the web has emerged as the main vehicle of distribution of information and news. We are witnessing the consequences,” the vice president said.According to the the text of his speech made available by his office, Naidu said while the democratisation and decentralisation that followed the rapid expansion of social media enabling freedom of expression is welcome, the world is witnessing the downside of it in the absence of self-regulation and protocols.In this era of saturated information and over abundance of news, the very news is getting devalued, he felt.While the traditional print media is “sincerely endeavouring” to adapt to the technological disruption by going online, it is struggling to come out with viable revenue models, he pointed out.“The information and reports generated by the print media at substantial cost is being hijacked by the social media giants. This is unfair. Some countries are taking measures to ensure revenue sharing by the social media giants with the print media. We too need to take a serious look at this problem and come out with effective guidelines or laws to enable print media get their share from the huge revenues of the technology giants,” Naidu said.Over a period of time, media in our country has acquired a certain orientation which is broadly termed by the commentators as “left leaning and liberal”, Naidu said. “Nobody can make an issue out of this. But the problem arises if the media is keen to stick to the perspectives acquired earlier and stayed with them for long and refuses to acknowledge the changing narrative,” he said.“I am not suggesting media to be like a chameleon. Media should use a standard set of reporting and analytical tools that captures the change without imposing respective positions. Media should not be seen by the public as discrediting the change that is happening since such a change is contrary to their long held positions,” he noted.The vice-president said while journalism by nature is supposed to be critical of the order of the times based on facts and supported by evidence, “this should not slip into complete negativity”. “I am not suggesting that media is completely cynical. We have opted for parliamentary democracy for negotiated socio-economic transformation and nation building. As a bridge between the people and the governments, media need to focus on the development taking place on various fronts.” “Governments are the principal catalysts of this change for the better. Development journalism does not mean beating the trumpet of the governments. It is about examining and reporting on the triggers of change, partnerships built and participation of people and other stakeholders, challenges faces and the way they were overcome this kind of positivity reinforces the trust of the people in the institutions of our body polity,” he said.Till the advent of modern media, print media played an important role in furthering the cause of independence by promoting the spirit of nationalism and nation building through socio-economic transformation subsequently, he said.The country is committed to uphold the Constitutional values of liberty, equality, fraternity and justice for all, he said, adding that the changes happening in the country over the last few years are within the framework of the Constitution.Discredited media is nobody’s interest, he opined, adding that the norms of objective journalism demand that personal views and positions should not impact reporting of events and issues.“Viewers and readers too should not look for only such information and reports that suits them,” he said.A newspaper or any other media outlet should report the facts as news, present different perspectives on a debatable issue besides conveying their own view appropriately. The aim shall be to leave it to the reader or the viewer to take his own position without seeking to influence his mind, be said. “News and views should be strictly separate. One can’t masquerade as the other,” Naidu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/self-regulation-in-social-traditional-media-needed-vice-president/story-sb4SoXpd9wBFTii9S20HfO.html

It has the world’s second highest number of cases after the United States, though the gap between them is now widening as India is reporting fewer cases since a mid-September peak.The government says it could take more than one year to administer two doses of vaccines - 28 days apart - to most of India’s 1.35 billion people.“The government of India is geared to launch a vaccine for Covid-19 soon,” the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in a public advisory.“Vaccination for Covid-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of Covid-19 vaccine.”It also said that even those who have been infected by the virus should be vaccinated.India plans to deploy its vast election machinery to deliver 600 million doses of the vaccines to the most vulnerable people in the next six to eight months through conventional cold chain systems, a government expert told Reuters last week.The country already runs one of the largest immunization programmes in the world, catering to more than 26 million newborns and 29 million pregnant women a year.“The programme mechanisms are being strengthened/geared up to effectively cater to the country’s large and diverse population,” the health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-says-ready-to-soon-start-voluntary-covid-19-vaccination/story-2JZzxwLYUUvMlyYSAF13rL.html

It is a world war against Covid-19,” a Supreme Court bench comprising Justice Ashoke Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah said. Calling for more vigilance and surveillance, the bench said if the authorities decide to impose curfew or lockdown, it must be announced in advance so that people may make provisions for their livelihood.

The bench also observed that there shall be more and more testing and the focus should be to declare correct facts and figures. “One must be transparent in number of testing and declaring the facts and figures of the persons who are Corona positive. Otherwise, the people will be misled and they will be under impression that everything is all right and they will become negligent,” the bench noted.India says ready to soon start voluntary Covid-19 vaccinationCurfew on weekends/night may be considered by states where it is not in place. However, any decision to impose curfew or lockdown must be announced long in advance so that the people may know and make provisions for the livelihood, like ration, the Supreme Court said.“Another issue is the fatigue of the frontline healthcare officials.

18-12-2020||India||No signs of breakthrough after latest India-China WMCC meeting||India and China on Friday held another round of diplomatic talks on the standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) after a gap of more than two months though there were no indications of an immediate breakthrough. The virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs was co-chaired by Naveen Srivastava, joint secretary (East Asia) of the external affairs ministry, and Hong Liang, director general of the department of boundary and oceanic affairs of China’s foreign ministry. The last meeting of WMCC held on September 30 too had failed to take forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation along the LAC. Also read | China’s new road cuts travel time to Karakoram Pass, raises red flags in DelhiThe external affairs ministry said in a statement that the two sides reviewed developments on the LAC since the last meeting of WMCC and agreed to “continue to work towards ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector at the earliest”, in line with the guidance from senior leaders and agreements reached by the two foreign ministers and Special Representatives on the boundary issue. The two sides also noted the seventh and eighth round of meetings between senior army commanders held on October 12 and November 6 had held in-depth discussions that had “contributed to ensuring stability on the ground”. “Both sides agreed to maintain close consultations at the diplomatic and military level. They agreed that the next (9th) round of Senior Commanders meeting should be held at an early date so that both sides can work towards early and complete disengagement of troops along the LAC in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols, and fully restore peace and tranquillity,” the statement said. A readout from the Chinese embassy said the two sides had a “candid and in-depth exchange of views on the situation” along the LAC and agreed to continue dialogue and consultation via diplomatic and military channels. The readout added the two sides had decided to hold the 9th meeting of senior army commanders “as soon as possible”. The Chinese embassy’s readout further said the two sides had “agreed to earnestly implement the five-point consensus reached between the foreign ministers of both countries” when they met in Moscow on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in September. Friday’s meeting also “focused on the disengagement of frontline troops” and “concrete measures to deal with the issues on the ground to further deescalate the border situation”, the readout said. The two sides “spoke highly of the outcomes of the 8th round of Senior Commanders Meeting” and also agreed to “properly deal with the outstanding issues on the ground, and jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas”, the readout added. Tens of thousands of troops from both sides have dug in along the LAC in sub-zero conditions after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks failed to take forward the disengagement process at key friction points in Ladakh sector. People familiar with developments in Beijing said the focus of Friday’s negotiations was on troop disengagement. The WMCC meeting was held on the same day that China’s foreign minister Wang Yi is scheduled to address an online event organised by Mumbai-based Asia Society Indian Centre. Wang is expected to talk on the crisis in Sino-India ties triggered by the eight-month standoff. Between September 30 and now, the two sides held military talks, which too failed to take the disengagement process forward. India on Thursday had called for further discussions with China to reach a “mutually acceptable solution” on complete disengagement at all friction points on the LAC. “It is our expectation that further discussions will help both sides to achieve an agreement on a mutually acceptable solution for ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western sector and full restoration of peace and tranquillity as early as possible,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. At the end of the last virtual WMCC meet on September 30, both an Indian statement and a readout from China’s foreign ministry had said the two sides “positively evaluated” the outcome of the sixth military commanders’ meeting on September 21. Army commanders of the two sides last held military talks on November 6, an indication that neither side is willing to budge from their respective positions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-signs-of-breakthrough-after-latest-india-china-wmcc-meeting/story-NTLHe7LmLPreTYjsN7zhpK.html

18-12-2020||India||Over 4.5 crore in India will be forced to migrate from homes by 2050: Report||Over 4.5 crore people will be forced to migrate from their homes in India by 2050 due to climate disasters including floods, droughts and cyclones, three times more than the present figures, according to a new report. In 2020, the number of people displaced in India is 1.4 crore, it said.The report  ‘Costs of climate inaction: displacement and distress migration’ assessed climate-fuelled displacement and migration across five South Asian countries -- Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- and calculates a devastating likelihood of over 6 crore people being homeless and displaced by 2050 in South Asia alone.It is based on a study conducted by International agencies ActionAid International and Climate Action Network South Asia.Quoting figures, the report claimed that 4.5 crore from India will be forced to migrate from their homes by 2050 due to climate disasters.“Political failure to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius as per the Paris agreement goal is already driving 18 million climate migrants from their homes in 2020,” the report said.The report released on Friday, estimates that climate migration will treble in South Asia alone, a region badly affected by climate disasters, including floods, droughts, typhoons and cyclones.The research was undertaken by Bryan Jones, one of the authors of the inaugural Groundswell Report on internal climate migration in 2018.The report called for strong leadership and ambition from developed countries to cut emissions and support for developing countries to adapt to climate change and recover from climate disasters.  It recommended a holistic approach that places the onus on rich countries to provide support and urges developing countries to scale up efforts to protect people from climate impacts.Harjeet Singh, Global Climate Lead at ActionAid, said, “We are facing melting glaciers in Nepal, rising seas in India and Bangladesh, cyclones and inhospitable temperatures. Climate change is increasingly forcing people to flee their homes in search of safety and new means to provide for their families.“Rich countries need to take greater responsibility to reduce their emissions and support South Asian countries in cutting emissions and dealing with climate impacts. The human cost of inaction is too high,” he said.The research reveals that in all five countries, women are left dealing with the negative fallout from climate migration. “They are left behind to take care of household chores, agricultural activities, look after children and elderly and manage livestock. Women who migrate to urban settlements are often then forced to take up work in precarious settings where workers’ rights violations are rife,” it said.Sanjay Vashist, Director, Climate Action Network South Asia said, “South Asia is geographically vulnerable to climate disasters and is regularly lashed with floods and cyclones, but poverty and environmental injustice are also determining factors in this climate migration crisis.“South Asian leaders must join forces and prepare plans for the protection of displaced people. They must step up and invest in universal and effective social protection measures, resilience plans and green infrastructure to respond to the climate crisis and help those who have been forced to move,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-4-5-crore-in-india-will-be-forced-to-migrate-from-homes-by-2050-report/story-kLUxJe23ms47rZvGQjdakL.html
18-12-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccination is voluntary, says health ministry||Vaccination against Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as part of national vaccination drive is voluntary, reiterated Union ministry of health and family welfare in its recently released document to answer public queries in the form of frequently asked questions (FAQs). “Vaccination for Covid-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of Covid-19 vaccine for protecting oneself against this disease and also to limit the spread of this disease to the close contacts including family members, friends, relatives and co-workers,” says the government document.A senior health ministry official, in the know of things, who did not wish to be named, said, “The government never said it was mandatory to take the vaccine shot; it is absolutely on voluntary basis even for the population group. However, the government is ensuring that whatever choice people make is informed, which is why a lot of effort is being directed towards awareness generation.” While ideally, the government would like to cover everyone in phases, the priority group for Covid-19 vaccine delivery in phase 1 is being drafted keeping in mind vaccine availability. Also read | China to vaccinate 50 million people for Lunar New YearOn phase 1 priority list are people at higher risk. The first group includes healthcare and frontline workers. The second group to receive Covid-19 vaccine will be persons over 50 years of age and persons under 50 years with comorbid conditions such as hypertensive, diabetic, people with chronic liver and kidney disease, as per the recommendation of technical experts handling Covid-19 vaccine management.The reason for including the more than 50 years of age group for vaccination is that it will be able to cover 78% of persons having comorbidities and thereby, reduce mortality on account of Covid-19.The eligible beneficiaries will be informed through their registered mobile number regarding the health facility where the vaccination will be provided and the scheduled time for vaccination, to avoid any inconvenience in registration and vaccination.On getting all doses of Covid-19 vaccine, the beneficiary will receive a text on their registered mobile number, informing about completion of the process. A QR code-based certificate will be sent to the registered mobile number of the beneficiary.However, the vaccine is not advisable for people who are presently infected with Covid-19. “Person with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection may increase the risk of spreading the same to others at vaccination site. For this reason, infected individuals should defer vaccination for 14 days after symptoms resolution,” says the document.Those recovered from the disease can take the shot. “It is advisable to receive complete schedule of Covid vaccine irrespective of past history of infection with Covid-19. This will help in developing a strong immune response against the disease,” the document says.Two doses of vaccine, 28 days apart, need to be taken by an individual to complete the vaccination schedule. Protective levels of antibodies are generally developed two weeks after receiving the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine.To allay safety concerns among people regarding the vaccine, the document says, “Vaccines will be introduced in the country only after the regulatory bodies clear it based on its safety and efficacy.”The safety and efficacy data from clinical trials of vaccine candidates are being examined by the national drug regulator before granting the license for its use on public at large. Hence, all the Covid-19 vaccines that receive license will have comparable safety and efficacy. However, it is necessary that the entire schedule of vaccination is completed by only one type of vaccine as different Covid-19 vaccines are not interchangeable. Any of the following identification details with photo can be produced at the time of registration: driving license, health insurance, smart card issued under the scheme of labour ministry, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) job card, official identity cards issued to MPs/MLAs/MLCs, PAN card, passbooks issued by bank, post office, passport, pension document, service ID issued to government employees, and Voter ID. Those vaccinated will have to rest at the vaccination centre for at least half an hour after taking the Covid-19 vaccine. In case of any discomfort or uneasiness, they will have to inform the nearest health authorities, auxiliary nurse midwife, accredited social health activist.“As is true for other vaccines, the common side effects in some individuals could be mild fever, pain, etc. at the site of injection. States have been asked to start making arrangements to deal with any Covid-19 vaccine-related side-effects as one of the measures towards safe vaccine delivery among masses,” says the document.People will have to continue following key Covid appropriate behaviours, such as wearing of mask, maintaining hand sanitisation and physical distance, even after vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccination-is-voluntary-says-health-ministry/story-Xma7WplbVH9XktqoINh1FM.html

18-12-2020||India||UP: Sambhal administration scraps Rs50 lakh notices for farm protests||The Sambhal district administration in western Uttar Pradesh has decided to scrap the notices issued to the national president and five other office bearers of Bhartiya Kisan Union(Asli), or BKU (Asli), wherein they were asked to submit personal bonds of Rs50 lakh each on the charge of inciting farmers against the three new farm laws. The sum was later revised to Rs50,000 each, but now the notices would be withdrawn altogether, an official said.Notices to over a dozen farmers seeking personal bond of Rs5 lakh each are also being scrapped. Sambhal sub-divisonal magistrate (SDM) Deependra Yadav issued the notices on December 12 and 13 for personal bond of Rs50 lakh each to BKU (Asli) president Harpal Singh, youth wing state in charge Rishabh Chaudhary, divisional general secretary Sanjeev Gandhi, Sambhal district president Rajpal Singh Yadav and two others on charges of inciting farmers to participate in the movement. Likewise, over a dozen other farmers were issued notices of Rs5 lakh each on similar charges. SDM Yadav said he issued notices to 20 to 25 farmers on the basis of reports submitted by different police stations amid the farmers’ agitation.“We first revised the amount, but eventually decided to scrap all the notices after farmers’ written assurance that they would carry out their protest peacefully,” SDM said.Also read | Will bow my head in front of farmers, will discuss every issue, says PM ModiHowever, BKU(Asli) president Harpal Singh said, “We were protesting peacefully since the beginning and no farmer has given anything in writing. They are scrapping it (notices) to save their skin.”Additional superintendent of police, Sambhal, Alok Kumar Jaiswal also confirmed that notices issued against the farmers would be scrapped.SDM Yadav said issuing notices during a protest was a routine exercise, but it was blown out of proportion in this instance. He accused the farmers of blocking roads, caused inconvenience to people.Reacting to SDM’s comment, BKU (Asli) national vice-president Surendra Singh held the administration and the police responsible for road blocks. “We wanted to go to Delhi to join the ongoing farmers’ movement. They (police) stopped us, compelling us to sit on the roads,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-sambhal-administration-scraps-rs50-lakh-notices-for-farm-protests/story-7YyLCgT35zali9szJVQWHP.html
18-12-2020||India||‘Request with folded hands’: 10 things PM Modi said on farm laws, protest||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday requested all the political parties to stop misguiding farmers on the farm laws cleared by the government in September this year and said that games are being played for political gains.PM Modi also said that by clearing the farm bills, he just wants to ease the life of farmers. He was addressing a state-level ‘Kisan Kalyan’ event in Madhya Pradesh’s Raisen district, wherein Chief Minister Shivraj Singh will transfer the relief amount of Rs 1,600 crore into the bank accounts of nearly 35.50 lakh farmers for the damaged kharif crops.The prime minister’s address comes amid staunch rejection of three farm laws by thousands of farmers who have erupted in protest in and around the national capital. The farmer’s claim that the laws cleared by the government will reduce their earnings and give a leverage to corporations.As the protests enter their 22nd day, there has been no signs of resolution in the standoff between farmers and government even after five rounds of talk.Here are the 10 things PM Modi said on the laws and agitated farmers:- I am happy that farmers all over the country have not only embraced the new agricultural reforms but are also rejecting those who are spreading. I will ask the farmers who still have a little apprehension to think once again.- I say this with confidence that there is no reason for mistrust in the recently introduced agricultural reforms, there is no room for lies.- Our government did the work of implementing the report by Swaminathan Committee. If we had to remove the MSP, then why would the Swaminathan Committee report be implemented?- Our government is so serious about the MSP that it announces MSP every time before sowing. This makes it easier for the farmers because they also learn first about the MSP of their crop.- The previous government had purchased about 1,700 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from farmers in its five years. Our government has purchased 3,000 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from farmers in its five years at MSP.- Our government has not only increased MSP, but has also bought a lot from farmers on MSP. Its biggest advantage has been that more money has reached the farmers’ account than ever before.- Another example of how the people who used farmers for politics is farming of pulses. Recall the time of 2014, how the country faced a pulses crisis. Pulses used to be sourced from abroad amidst chaos in the country.- Today, farmers growing pulses are also getting more money, pulses prices have also come down, which has directly benefited the poor. Those who could not give MSP to the farmers, nor could buy it on the MSP, they are misleading the farmers on the MSP.- Another lie related to agricultural reforms is being spread about the APMC i.e. our mandis. What have we done in law? We have given freedom to farmers in the law, a new option. In the new law, we have only said that whether the farmers sells in the market or outside, it is their choice. Now, the farmers can sell their produce only where they get profit.- Swaminathan Commission report is biggest proof of how ruthless these people can be. These people sat on Swaminathan Commission report recommendations for 8 long years. They ensured that their government doesn’t have to spend much on farmers, so they kept the report under wraps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/request-with-folded-hands-10-things-pm-modi-said-on-farm-laws-protest/story-k0dQRiOOi3mOgQ13P8HSmO.html
18-12-2020||India||PM Modi says Oppn intentionally did not work on Swaminathan Commission recommendations||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday requested political parties with “folded hands” to keep all the credit for their “old election manifestos” which had reportedly promised agriculture sector reforms and urged them to stop misguiding the farmers over the new farm laws. “I request all political parties with folded hands, please keep all the credit. I am giving credit to all your old election manifestos. I just want ease in the life of farmers, I want their progress and want modernity in agriculture,” said PM Modi while addressing farmers at the ‘Kisan Kalyan’ event in Raisen through video conferencing.“Political parties should stop misguiding farmers. It’s been six to seven months since farm laws were implemented. But now suddenly, games are being played to plough one’s own political land through a web of lies,” he added.The Prime Minister further said, those who have started this movement in the name of farmers, when they had a chance to run the government or become part of the government, what they did back then, the country needs to remember.“Swaminathan Commission report is the biggest proof of how ruthless these people can be. These people sat on Swaminathan Commission report recommendations for 8 long years...They ensured that their govt doesn’t have to spend much on farmers, so they kept the report under wraps,” said PM Modi.“Today, I want to bring their deeds in front of countrymen and farmers,” PM Modi said. “I assure every farmer of the country that like MSP was given earlier, it will continue to be given, MSP will not be ended. Those who could not give MSP to farmers, they are misleading farmers over MSP,” he added. In the new farm laws, Centre has only stated that whether the farmer sells his produce in the market or outside, it will be his will, PM Modi stated.“The previous government had purchased about 1700 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from farmers in its five years. Our government has purchased 3000 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from farmers in its five years at MSP,” he said. “Another lie related to agricultural reforms is being spread about the APMC i.e. our mandis. What have we done in law? We have given the freedom to farmers in law, given them a new option,” said PM Modi. Not a single market has been closed after the new laws, the Prime Minister asserted. “Then why is this lie being spread? The truth is that our government is spending more than 500 crore rupees on modernising APMC, computerisation of them. Then where did this thing about the closure of APMC come from?” asked PM Modi. “Another big lie about new agricultural reforms is about the farming agreement. Is there anything new in the farming agreement in the country? No. The farming agreement has been in operation in our country for years,” he added. The Prime Minister assured that there is no reason for mistrust in the recent agricultural reforms we have done, there is no room for lies. PM Narendra Modi’s statement comes at the time when farmers have been protesting on different borders of the national capital since November 26 against three newly enacted farm laws- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-says-oppn-intentionally-did-not-work-on-swaminathan-commission-recommendations/story-6uch4FL6L6anIVvv19yjgK.html

18-12-2020||India||‘You can keep all the credit’: PM Modi attacks opposition over farmers’ protests||Prime minister Narendra Modi on Friday accused the opposition parties of creating distrust between the farmers and the government and also of instigating them against the laws which the Centre believes will bring reforms to the agricultural sector. PM Modi was addressing farmers in Madhya Pradesh virtually during the Kisan Kalyan event.PM Modi told the opposition parties that they can keep all the credit when these recently passed farm laws will bring reforms to the agricultural sector. He also said that the opposition parties can take the credit as their old election manifestoes mentioned these agriculture promises. He said, “I request all political parties with folded hands, please keep all the credit. I’m giving credit to all your old election manifestos. I just want ease in the life of farmers, I want their progress and want modernity in agriculture.”HT EXCLUSIVE| Those who believe in status quo can’t make history: Narendra Singh TomarModi also accused the opposition parties of using the farmers as a vote bank and political tool. He said that the opposition parties are spinning a web of lies to misguide farmers as the implementation of these laws have been in discussion for the last several years. The prime minister also reiterated that the system of MSP will remain unaffected by these new laws.Taking a jibe at former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath, the prime minister said that the farm loans were not waived as was promised before the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections. He said, “Those who’ve started this movement in the name of farmers, when they had a chance to run the govt or become part of govt, what they did back then, the country needs to remember.

He said that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had also wished to bring these laws but lacked the willingness to do so. He said, “Those who believe in status quo cannot create history. Even the UPA wanted to make these reforms but they couldn’t.”A PTI report quoting government sources was released in early December where it was seen that Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar had wanted states to implement the APMC Act in order to increase farmers’ incomes by allowing private players to take steps to reform the agricultural sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-can-keep-all-the-credit-pm-modi-attacks-opposition-over-farmers-protests/story-glmR8UoCTPMe5S6aQuyYNI.html

Amid the standoff with China, Rajnath Singh stated that “Challenges at our (northern and western) borders at this time also present a challenge to our resources. I am confident that our government, our Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make sure that there is no lack of resources at the borders.” Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat also spoke at the event. He said DRDO has helped the armed forces to become self-reliant to face the emerging challenges while adding that the country will win the future war with indigenously-developed weapons.General Rawat said, “For the past few years, DRDO has helped the armed forces to become self-reliant to face the emerging challenges ahead of the country. Currently, we are facing several challenges at the northern and western borders.

18-12-2020||India||Odisha didn’t profit from ecotourism fest, reveals RTI; ‘it’s fine’, says govt||Billed as eastern India’s first ‘Glamping’ festival or glamorous camping, the Marine Drive-Eco Retreat spread out on a kilometre-long stretch of Ramchandi Beach near Sun temple at Konark went on for almost 2 months between December 2019 and February 2020.The Eco-retreat camp, advertised as an attraction for high-end tourists, offered double occupancy tents priced between Rs 6,000 to Rs 22,000 per night that covered for private dining area, spa as well as non-alcoholic minibar facilities apart from several other water sports activities.Closely modelled on the annual Rann Utsav held at Rann of Kutch, where the Gujarat government organises tented accommodation for tourists, the Marine Drive-Eco Retreat plans to showcase the best of Odisha’s food and culture for high-end tourists.However, an RTI application filed into the expenditure incurred on last year’s eco-retreat festival has revealed that the government has not made any profit on its maiden eco-retreat venture. RTI activist Pradip Pradhan, who had filed an application seeking details of the expenditure on the first-ever eco-retreat camp, was told by the tourism department that the government spent at least Rs 4.5 crore on paying the event management company Lallooji & Sons while it got Rs 3.8 crore as revenue.The tourism department however, was silent on the total amount of money spent on the festival, though an amount of Rs 12.13 crore was sanctioned for the purpose. The RTI activist alleged that the government’s loss from the festival is likely to be higher and that’s why the tourism department did not specify how much more was spent apart from the money paid to the event management company.Though the tourism department did not make any profit from last year’s eco retreat camp at Konark, similar camps are being held at 4 more places including at Konark, Satkosia, Bhitarkanika, Daringbadi and Hirakud this month.Director of Odisha tourism department, Sachin Ramchandra Jadhav, said not much should be read into the losses incurred by the government in holding such events. “While hotels in Puri last year did not see much occupancy, we saw more than 70% occupancy. These events are essentially promoting the state’s tourism potential. It would take 7-8 years to break even and make money. Even in Gujarat, where the Rann of Kutch festival started, they did not make money for 7-8 years. After seeing our success, even Jharkhand has decided to hold similar eco-retreat camps,” said Jadhav.Also Read: Odisha seeks forced retirement of top forest officer with over 400% unaccounted wealthJadhav said the criticism that the government was spending money ‘unnecessarily’ in such festivals was a bit unwarranted as it was the responsibility of the government to promote the state’s tourism potential.“How many tourists would come to places like Daringbadi and Satkosia and spend Rs 9,000 a day if such events are not organised? High-end tourists who visit such places would help the local economy as they would hire vehicles from local travel operators. Through such programmes, the interiors of Odisha are being promoted,” he said.JK Mohanty, president of hotel and restaurant association of Odisha said it is important to make a noise in the tourism circuit and the government is taking the right step. “The pandemic has affected the tourism industry adversely. Through such events, the tourism and travel industry in Odisha would get a leg up,” said Mohanty.In 2019-20, 15.5 lakh domestic tourists and a little more than 1 lakh foreigners had visited Odisha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-didn-t-profit-from-ecotourism-fest-reveals-rti-it-s-fine-says-govt/story-3cBZ0HHvVIAwSNs3xJOrtN.html

Four upper caste men Sandeep, Luvkush, Ravi and Ramu, who are in judicial custody now, have been charged with gang-rape and murder. The court has taken cognisance of the chargesheet, Munna Singh Pundir, lawyer for the accused, told news agencies.The chargesheet has been filed under Sections 354, 376 A, 376 D and 302 of IPC and SC/ST Act. The Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital during treatment, and was cremated in the dead of night near her home on September 30. Her family alleged they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites. Local police officers, however, said the cremation was carried out “as per the wishes of the family”.The incident, and the subsequent action of local police in alleged attempt to hush the case, sparked protests and outrage across the country. Facing flak over the handling of the case, the Uttar Pradesh government recommended CBI probe into the case. The central agency initiated the probe in October. The CBI looked into the role of the four men who were also put through different forensic tests at the Forensic Science Laboratory in Gandhinagar.Investigators had also met doctors at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital, where the victim was treated after the alleged gangrape on September 14, before she was brought to Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-woman-was-gang-raped-killed-says-cbi-names-four-in-chargesheet/story-A0QFpQxXyvNxIZRiErLndL.html
18-12-2020||India||Goa Liberation Day 2020: All about its history and significance||Goa Liberation Day is observed on December 19 every year in India and it marks the day Indian armed forces freed Goa in 1961 following 450 years of Portuguese rule. The Portuguese colonised several parts of India in 1510 but by the end of the 19th-century Portuguese colonies in India were limited to Goa, Daman, Diu, Dadra, Nagar Haveli and Anjediva Island. The Goa liberation movement, which sought to end Portuguese colonial rule in Goa, started off with small scale revolts.On August 15, 1947, when India gained its Independence, Goa was still under the Portuguese rule. The Portuguese refused to give up their hold over Goa and other Indian territories. Following a myriad of unsuccessful negotiations and diplomatic efforts with the Portuguese, the former prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, decided that military intervention was the only option. The 36-hour military operation, conducted from December 18, 1961, was code-named ‘Operation Vijay’ meaning ‘Operation Victory,’ and involved attacks by the Indian Navy, Indian Air Force and Indian Army.According to the Indian Navy website, Indian troops reclaimed the Goan territory on December 19 with little resistance and the deposed governor general Manuel António Vassalo e Silva signed the certificate of surrender thus bringing Portuguese rule in the region to an end. This made India completely free from foreign rule. “The War Memorial at Indian Naval Ship Gomantak was constructed in memory of seven young gallant sailors and other personnel who laid down their lives on 19 Dec 1961 in the “Operation Vijay” undertaken by the Indian Navy for the liberation of Anjadip Island and Territories of Goa, Daman and Diu,” the website said.Goa Liberation Day is marked by an abundance of events and festivities in Goa though this time because of the pandemic the celebrations are expected to be muted. A torchlight procession is ignited from three different locations in the state, eventually all meeting at the Azad Maidan. This is where a tribute is made to those who lost their lives in the takeover of Goa. Various cultural programs like Sugam Sangeet — an Indian musical genre with poetry in the Kannada language — are also held to mark the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-liberation-day-2020-all-about-its-history-and-significance/story-2NhWxIZfOP2l6SBeC8pEeN.html

However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of the vaccine for protecting one-self against this disease and also to limit the spread of this disease to the close contacts including family members, friends, relatives and co-workers,” the ministry said in response to a question on if it is mandatory to take the shot. The ministry said that vaccine trials are under different stages of finalisation. The government is geared to launch a vaccine for Covid-19 soon, it said. Six vaccines- one developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR, second one developed by Zydus Cadila, third one by Gennova, Oxford vaccine, trial of which is conducted by Serum Institute of India, Sputnik V vaccine which is being manufactured by Dr Reddy’s Lab, Hyderabad, in collaboration with Russia’s Gamaleya National Centre and the sixth one manufactured by Biological E Ltd, Hyderabad, in collaboration with MIT, USA are undergoing clinical trials in India.On whether a vaccine will be safe as it is being tested and introduced in a short span of time and what can be the possible side-effects, the ministry said vaccines will be introduced in the country only after the regulatory bodies clear it based on its safety and efficacy. “Covid-19 vaccine will be introduced only when the safety is proven. As is true for other vaccines, the common side effects in some individuals could be mild fever, pain, etc. at the site of injection,” the ministry said in the FAQs.It said states have been asked to start making arrangements to deal with any vaccine-related side-effects as one of the measures towards safe vaccine delivery.Two doses of vaccine, 28 days apart, need to be taken by an individual to complete the vaccination schedule, it stated. The ministry said anyone taking medicines for illnesses like cancer, diabetes, hypertension etc, can take the Covid-19 vaccine as persons with one or more of these comorbid conditions are considered high-risk category and they need to get vaccination.In response to a question on whether the vaccine will be given to everyone simultaneously, the ministry said that based on the potential availability of vaccines, the government has selected priority groups to be vaccinated as they are at higher risk. In the initial phase, Covid 19 vaccine will be provided to the priority group- health care and front-line workers. The 50 plus age group may also begin early based on vaccine availability. The eligible beneficiaries will be informed through their registered mobile number regarding the health facility where the vaccination will be provided and the scheduled time. This will be done to avoid any inconvenience in registration and vaccination of beneficiaries, the ministry said in the FAQs.On why healthcare providers and frontline workers are being chosen for receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, the ministry said the government has prioritised the most at risk/high risk groups which will get the vaccine first. Healthcare providers have led the battle against Covid-19 from the front. The government wants them to be able to continue your work, without the fear of risk associated with the virus. “Therefore, healthcare and frontline workers are among the first group of people to be vaccinated,”‘ it said.The ministry said registration of a beneficiary is mandatory for vaccination for Covid-19. Only after registration the information on the session site to visit and time will be shared.Following online registration, beneficiary will receive SMS on their registered mobile number on the due date, place and time of vaccination. ID with Photo such as driving license, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) job card, PAN Card, passbooks issued by Bank/Post Office, passport • Pension Document , service identity card issued to employees by Central/ State Govt./ Public Limited Companies and voter ID may be produced at the time of registration.On getting due dose of vaccine, the beneficiary will receive SMS on their registered mobile number. After all doses of vaccine are administered, a QR code based certificate will also be sent to the registered mobile number of the beneficiary, the ministry said.On preventive measures and precautions, the ministry said, “We request you to rest at the vaccination centre for at least half an hour after taking the Covid-19 vaccine. “Inform the nearest health authorities/ANM/ASHA in case you feel any discomfort or uneasiness subsequently. Remember to continue following key Covid Appropriate Behaviours like wearing of mask, maintaining hand sanitization and physical distance,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-would-need-registration-says-centre/story-kwfyPDfkDDtTTOPhjtiBVO.html

18-12-2020||India||High Court issues notice to Delhi Police after AAP MLAs denied permission to protest||Delhi High Court on Friday issued notice to the city police over pleas filed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders Raghav Chadha and Atishi who were denied permission by the department to protest outside the residences of Union home minister Amit Shah and Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal over alleged misappropriation of funds by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC).The two AAP MLAs had moved the court on Thursday after they were denied permission by Delhi Police to stage a sit-in protest at each of the two sites against the alleged misappropriation, which amounts to over Rs 2,500 crore. Chadha and Atishi were among four leaders who were detained on December 13 after they tried to stage a protest outside Shah’s residence.Advocate Gautam Narayan, appearing for the Delhi Police, argued during the hearing on Friday that by an order of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority ( DDMA) of September 30, all political activities are banned in the national capital. This order has been extended till December 31.Responding to this, the counsel for the AAP’s MLAs said they want to hold a peaceful protest with limited people for a limited period of time, without any tents or loudspeakers. On argument by the Delhi Police counsel that Jantar Mantar and Ramlila Maidan are the only two designated protest sites in the city, the MLAs’ counsel said, “with utmost respect,” the place where farmers are protesting is also not a designated place of protest.The AAP’s lawyer was referring to protests by farmers, most of whom are from Punjab, on the borders of Delhi which have going on for more than three weeks now against the three farm laws passed by the Centre in September. This has emerged as yet another flashpoint between the BJP, which is in power at the Centre, and the AAP, with the Arvind Kejriwal-led party extending its support to the agitation. At a special session of the Delhi assembly on Thursday, Kejriwal and AAP MLAs had torn copies of the three laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-issues-notice-to-delhi-police-after-aap-mlas-denied-permission-to-protest/story-EYRRv4uuRKshLvhBv7fUmJ.html

Singh had left behind a note, which was read out along with some pages of his personal diary during the last rites. His followers claimed that Ram Singh was writing about the farmers’ unrest after he visited the protesters on December 9 for the first time.Akali leaders and a large number of his followers paid their last respects to him at his gurdwara in Karnal on Thursday.Also Read: Farm laws have not been introduced overnight, says PM Modi addressing Madhya Pradesh farmersHaryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar termed the 65-year-old preacher’s death as ‘an irreparable loss’. Khattar’s Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh also expressed grief over Sant Ram Singh’s death.A handwritten note in Punjabi, purportedly left behind by the deceased, said he was unable to bear the “pain of farmers” who have been protesting against the Centre’s agriculture reform laws. The note is being verified by the police.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other states have been protesting near Delhi’s borders for over three weeks, demanding that the Centre’s new farm laws be repealed.Many recalled that Sant Ram Singh dedicated his life to serving humanity and used to organise ‘satsangs’ (prayer meetings) and ‘langars’ (community kitchen) for thousands of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sikh-preacher-baba-ram-singh-s-mortal-remains-cremated-in-karnal/story-Csdx79FfUC7i0FUKQAQpoK.html
18-12-2020||India||Will bow my head in front of farmers, will discuss every issue, says PM Modi||In an hour-long address to the farmers of Madhya Pradesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday reiterated his government’s commitment to the welfare of farmers and explained how the three farm laws against which several thousands of farmers are protesting for the last three weeks are a step towards making farmers’ lives better. The laws in question have not been passed in Parliament in hurry; there have been decades of discussions, PM Modi said beginning his speech. Towards the conclusion of his speech, PM Modi said the welfare of the farmers is the utmost priority of the government. Farmers should not believe the lies being spread over the new farm laws. “But still after all these, if our farmers have any concern, we will bow our heads in front of them and will listen to what they have to say. Their benefit is our utmost priority,” he said concluding his address.PM Modi says Oppn intentionally did not work on Swaminathan Commission recommendationsIn between, he slammed the opposition, debunked the rumours around the farm laws and compared his government’s agriculture report card with that of the previous government.“Farmers of India can’t be left behind while other countries are moving towards new technologies. Now, a lot of discussions are going on over farm laws. These should have been done long ago. And these have not been introduced overnight. Our farmers have been demanding these for decades. If today we see the past manifestoes of the political parties, we will find the same promises,” PM Modi said.Taking a swipe at the opposition parties for “misleading” farmers for gaining back the lost political ground, PM Modi said, “I don’t think they have a problem with the farm reforms. They have problems with the fact that what they promised and could not deliver has been now done by Modi. I am folding my hands in front of all political parties. Please, take all credit you want. I will give credit to the manifestoes of the political parties.”“When they were in power, they junked Swaminathan Commission report. We dug out the report and implemented the recommendations,” PM Modi said adding that Madhya Pradesh farmers are well aware of Congress’s false promises. “You know better as they had promised loan waiver to Madhya Pradesh farmers. But have all of you got that?” he said.Congress’s promise of farm loan waiver never includes small farmers who can’t even go to banks and loan waiver was only applicable to a few big farmers, PM Modi said.Reiterating the government’s commitment towards the MSP system, PM Modi said, “Had we actually wanted to do away with MSP, why would we implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission? The laws came into force few months ago. But MSP system is continuing. There can be no bigger lie, bigger conspiracy than this that we are abolishing MSP. This system will not end.”Comparing the minimum support prices on various crops between now and the previous government, PM Modi said, “The previous government used to give an MSP of Rs 1,400 per quintal of wheat and Rs 1,310 per quintal of paddy. Our government offers an MSP of Rs 1,975 per quintal of wheat and Rs 1,870 per quintal of paddy.”“If I start telling you what all our government has done for the welfare of farmers, I may run out of time. But I am quoting these figures so that you can understand the commitment of this government towards farmers,” PM Modi said.Debunking “lies” spread regarding agriculture laws, PM Modi said, “After MSP and APMC, the third greatest lie regarding laws is farming agreement. We are not doing anything new. What we did is we brought a provision for farmers’ security. We have made it sure that sponsors won’t be able to escape their responsibilities. So many cases are now coming up that farmers are approaching SDMs and are getting their dues. The agreement is only on the produce. The agreement is not for land.”“The agreement has provisions that if there is more benefit than that was agreed upon in the contract, farmers will get share of the additional benefit. And also it is on the farmers whether they want the contract or not. A farmer can also end the contract whenever he wants,” PM Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-have-not-been-introduced-overnight-says-pm-modi-addressing-madhya-pradesh-farmers/story-A08hwK5P5o4bvoNhVgr51H.html

There’s nothing more festive than cracking open a box of walnuts with family and ensuring good health for them all. A handful of these nuts are packed with plant-based omega-3 fatty acid ALA,  protein and fibre - more than any other nut.  Walnuts are an easy choice with nutrients to support the heart, brain and gut and healthy immune system. Walnuts are loaded with nutrients and can be consumed daily to meet the necessary nutrition. California Walnuts’s campaign Making Everyday Healthy is here to make people aware about the myriad benefits that this wonder nutpossesses. With their combination of excellent nutrients, its no surprise that walnuts can make everyday healthy. They are an exceptionally nutritious nut and eating a handful of them daily is imperative for optimum health.Ishi Khosla, Nutritionist says, “Walnuts have a unique distinction of being rich in a valuable fat - the omega-3 fats. They also contain a number of potentially neuro-protective compounds like vitamin E, folate, melatonin, polyphenols and antioxidants. What’s interesting is that they delay ageing. Perhaps, it’s shaped like the brain is no coincidence.” Crunchy yet dense, and with a mildly sweet flavour, they add bite, creaminess and earthiness to both sweet and savoury dishes. Often eaten as a snack, chopped walnuts are also added to sweets, breakfast cereals, baked products, soups, pasta and salads to enhance their flavour.. Garima Bhandari, Yoga, wellness and fitness influencer and expert, says, “ It’s true, nuts play a role in the body’s healing and recovery owing to its protein content. Incorporating walnuts into meals and snacks is a simple, tasty and convenient way to add important nutrients to your diet.” Besides flavour and texture, walnuts offer a host of health benefits for the brain and heart and overall gut health of the body. Dr TS Kler, chairman, Fortis Memorial Research Institute and medical advisor, SeekMed, says, ”Walnuts have a unique type of acid called ellagic acid which gets converted by intrinsic enteric flora into compounds with antioxidant power, which may help reduce the risk of various cancers. They help in building resistance for insulin, control blood glucose levels and lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.”He adds, “Walnuts are rich in biotin, thereby, preventing hair fall, improving hair texture and strengthening them. Also, eating walnuts makes you feel full, which reduces appetite and helps with weight management.”The nut has been linked to a stronger immune system, a happier mood, increased energy, and other aspects of physical, mental and emotional well-being, sounds just like the superfood of this year. California Walnuts presents HT CITY Spotlight In conversation with Nutritionist, Ishi Khosla, cardiologist and chairman, Fortis Memorial Research Institute,medical advisor, SeekMed , Dr TS Kler and Yoga, wellness and fitness influencer and expert, Garima Bhandari.

18-12-2020||India||‘No coercive steps against BJP leaders’: SC notice to Bengal govt, police||The Supreme Court on Friday protected BJP leaders Arjun Singh, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Pawan Singh, Mukul Roy and Saurav Singh from any coercive steps to be taken by the West Bengal Police in FIRs registered against them which are pending investigation. The 3-judge bench headed by Justice SK Kaul issued notice on petitions filed by the senior BJP leaders who claimed that false cases were being foisted on them in order to prevent them from entering the state ahead of assembly elections early next year. All the cases followed a similar pattern where criminal cases were lodged against most of these petitioners after they left the ruling Trinamool Congress and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party. BJP leader Arjun Singh listed 64 criminal cases lodged against him in 2019 which were related to petty offences of breaking public order and causing injury. The apex court dealt separately with the case of Kabir Bose, who is the BJP spokesperson and who was earlier with TMC. He sought for a report from CISF against an incident where he was arrested as an accused in an attempt to murder case. Bose claimed that he was protected by CISF’s Special Security Group and thus called for the report submitted by CISF, SSG to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Supreme Court directed the report to be placed before it in a sealed cover on the next date of hearing fixed in January. Senior Advocate Mukul Rohtagi appeared for the four BJP leaders including BJP vice president Kailash Vijayvargiya while senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalaani represented Kabir Bose. Except in Kabir Bose’s petition, in the rest of the matters the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, said, “Till the next date of hearing, no coercive steps in any cases should be registered against the petitioners.”The notice has been sent to the West Bengal government and the West Bengal police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-coercive-steps-against-bjp-leaders-sc-notice-to-bengal-govt-police/story-2HGOLAtDvHBfUtSk0fCAyK.html
18-12-2020||India||China’s new road cuts travel time to Karakoram Pass, raises red flags in Delhi||Satellite imagery and communication intercepts along the 3,488 kilometre Line of Actual Control (LAC) shows that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is undertaking a significant road and building infrastructure upgrade across Karakoram Pass and Aksai Chin to ramp up military capacities and capability against India.It is quite evident from the surveillance data available to conclude that despite Beijing’s verbal commitments of mutual military disengagement and de-escalation from friction point on Ladakh LAC, the PLA has no intentions of troop or equipment withdrawal from the area.While the government is tight-lipped about the developments, the number of military vehicles and troop hutments have increased along the 597-km Ladakh LAC with a number of fresh dug-outs indicating that the PLA is prepared for a long haul with Indian Army.Indian officials said what was a matter of serious concern was that China has built an alternative 8-10 metre wide road to Karakoram Pass that would shorten the distance to the strategic gateway into Daulet Beg Oldi sector by two hours.Also Read: India, China to resume diplomatic talks on Friday over Ladakh disengagement“Nearly all the kutcha (unmetalled) roads have been surfaced in the Aksai Chin area with the axis being widened for bigger vehicles carrying heavy equipment,” said a senior military commander.The Chinese infra building activity has also increased in depth areas with a new logistics depot that will have an underground petroleum and oil storage facility coming up at Golmud. The new depot is nearly 1,000 km from the LAC but is linked to Lhasa via Tibet Railway. It will enhance the capacity and capability of the PLA to deploy in Tibetan border with India for a long time and feed the troops in case of a worst-case scenario.While there is continuous activity on Sikkim border, the new concern is the building of two new underground facilities at the Pang Ta air base across Arunachal Pradesh. The PLA uses underground tunnels inside mountains for housing aircraft rather than blast pens on the air bases. A similar tunnel park has been noticed at Lhasa Gonggar air base with an increase in the number of military aircraft.The 1962 Xinjiang military command town of Kangxiwar across Karakoram Pass and on the banks of Karakash River is being revived with a direct highway connectivity to Hotan, a critical air base of PLA Air Force for dominating the restive Uighurs and a launch pad of fighter operations in case of a worst case scenario in East Ladakh. Hotan is located 320 kilometres from the Ladakh LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-new-road-cuts-travel-time-to-karakoram-pass-raises-red-flags-in-delhi/story-Ye3F9fgGmLzQ1NgZLXsqeO.html

18-12-2020||India||India, China resume diplomatic talks over Ladakh disengagement||India and China have resumed diplomatic dialogue on Friday, December 18, after a gap of nearly 11 weeks to resolve the ongoing border standoff in the Ladakh sector.Diplomats from both sides are holding a virtual meeting under the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on Border Affairs (WMCC) where they are likely to discuss disengagement of troops, thousands of whom have dug in on either side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in sub-zero conditions.The last WMCC meeting was held on September 30 – the 19th overall since the mechanism was set up in 2012 -- which had failed to take forward the negotiations focussed on troop disengagement.Confirming the Friday talks, diplomatic sources in Beijing said the focus of the negotiation will be on troop disengagement.Also Read: China’s new road cuts travel time to Karakoram Pass, raises red flags in DelhiThe latest round of WMCC talks will coincide with a virtual address to be delivered by Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, at an online event organised by the Mumbai-based Asia Society Indian Centre.Wang is expected to talk on the ongoing crisis in Sino-India bilateral ties, triggered by the eight month-long military standoff.Between September 30 and now, the two sides have held military-level dialogues, which too failed to take the disengagement process forward.India on Thursday had called for further discussion with China to reach a “mutually acceptable solution” on complete disengagement at all friction points on the LAC.“It is our expectation that further discussions will help both sides to achieve an agreement on a mutually acceptable solution for ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western sector and full restoration of peace and tranquillity as early as possible,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing.Also Read: India wants further talks with China for ‘mutually acceptable solution’ to LAC standoffAt the end of the last virtual WMCC meet on September 30, both the Indian statement and a readout in Mandarin from China’s foreign ministry said the two sides “positively evaluated” the outcome of the sixth military commanders’ meeting on September 21. “They emphasised the need to implement the steps outlined in the joint press release issued after the last meeting of the senior commanders so as to avoid misunderstandings and to maintain stability on the ground,” the Indian statement said.

Stalin condemned the statement of the government that those protesting against the farm laws are anti-nationals and said he supports the farmers. “The central government said that those protesting against the farm laws are anti-nationals. We condemn it,” the DMK president said while addressing a gathering. “The central government led by the BJP have passed three laws against farmers. The farmers are protesting continuously for 23 days against it. We took the decision to support protesting farmers. As a part of it, we are doing fasting and protest today,” he said.’Also Read: Late to join but Khaps of western UP pledge a mega push to farmers’ protestThe leader also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and AIADMK of passing laws that were not in favour of the people and said the coronavirus pandemic was used as an excuse to pass the three farm laws in a hurry. “The central government is not thinking about farmers or people. The BJP and AIADMK governments pass laws against them. They use Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse and passed them in a hurry. Especially the three farm laws,” he told the gathering. “They don’t care for the people and only support and give subsidies to the corporates,” he said.“Everybody in India is in an agitative mode, particularly those in Delhi. They (the BJP) are doing drama in the name of discussion,” he said, adding that he welcomed all his party members and alliances to participate in the protest and observe a two-minute silence for the farmers who lost their lives in the protest.Also Read: Farmers in UP get Rs 50 lakh notice over protests, sum revised to 50,000Thousands of farmers are protesting against the three laws - Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 - that were passed in Parliament in September.(with inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmk-allies-observe-one-day-fast-in-support-of-agitating-farmers/story-WfET1VVaYs563FCUNz6fNK.html

18-12-2020||India||Late to join but Khaps of western UP pledge a mega push to farmers’ protest||The ongoing farmers’ movement against the three Central farm laws is likely to intensify in western UP after the heads of Khaps or caste panchayats extended support to the agitation and decided to join the protests in large numbers in two weeks time after the current wheat-sowing season ends.On December 17, heads of these Khaps with several of their clansmen, marched to Delhi, where farmers from UP, Punjab, Haryana and other places are protesting against the laws and seeking their repeal.Subhash Baliyan, secretary of Sarv Khap, claimed that “hundreds of farmers accompanied the Khap heads in their march on Thursday and they held a mahapanchayat at Ghazipur border led by BKU chief Naresh Tilait, who is also the head of Baliyan Khap, with clansmen in 84 villages in Meerut region”, said Baliyan. Western UP has been known to be the cradle of farmer movements under the leadership of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) stalwart, the late Mahendra Singh Tikait. However, the region has been late to galvanise against the farm laws passed in Parliament earlier this year.Manvendra Verma, divisional coordinator of the Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sangharsh Samanvaya Samiti, suggests the delay in extending support to the agitation in western UP was due to the farmers’ affinity for the BJP, especially after the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013, which saw former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh’s son Ajit Singh and grandson Jayant Choudhary lose polls on their home turf of Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat in the 2019 parliamentary elections. “The BJP’s Hindutva card worked and farmers, mainly the Jats, voted for the party. Initially, it was difficult for farmer leaders and people of the region to accept that the BJP could bring laws against their interest. It took them time to rise to protect their interests as farmers,” Manvendra Verma said.Also Read: In a letter to farmers, Narendra Singh Tomar reiterates assurance on MSP BKU divisional general secretary Naresh Chaudhary said it took time for farmers to understand the disadvantages of the new laws. Now, more than 80% farmers and villagers were convinced that these laws were brought to benefit the corporate sectors, he added.Subhash Baliyan said that before convening a meeting of the heads of Khaps at the Sarv Khap Chaupal at Soram village in Muzaffarnagar district on December 14, he sent a request for the government to convene a high-level meeting with the Khap leaders. “We received no response and, after waiting for over a week, the meeting was convened at Soram,” said Baliyan.He said residents of 84 villages in the region owed their allegiance to the Baliyan and Deshwal Khaps. Similarly, 52 villages were loyal to the Gathwala Khap. Other Khaps also have their followers and clan members in different villages.“They will join the movement in large numbers after completing the sowing of wheat,” said the farmer leader.Currently, the farmers in the region were providing milk, vegetables and other essential items to the agitating farmers on the Delhi border.Chaudhary Diwakar Singh, national vice president of BKU (Bhanu), has been leading the protest in Amroha district since its beginning. He said western UP had a population of over 10 crore and sugar was the main industry of the region and farmers were busy reaping the sugarcane crop to clear farmland so that they could sow wheat.“Over 80% farmers of the region have small land holdings. They sow wheat only after harvesting sugarcane. The sowing of wheat would conclude in next two weeks and farmers (would) join the movement in big numbers thereafter,” Singh said.Meanwhile, farmers associated with BKU (Bhanu) blocked traffic on the Delhi-Noida border at Chilla on Wednesday. Its state president Yogesh Pratap blamed the government and a section of the media for misleading farmers by spreading fake news about their movement.“We cleared one lane for the convenience of commuters and misleading news was spread that we have withdrawn our movement,” said Pratap who has been on a hunger strike at the Chilla border since December 14. “I have given up food and am surviving only on water,” he said. He alleged the government was not allowing farmers to join the protest and their leaders were being placed under house arrest or taken to police stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/late-to-join-but-khaps-of-western-up-pledge-a-mega-push-to-farmers-protest/story-Y1mkUy6rzA9KKNXwaE3HYL.html

Such apprehensions emanating from your one time associate for long, call for retrospective reflections and correctional therapy to uphold constitutional values and rule of law,” Dhankhar wrote to Banerjee on Thursday.Adhikari had submitted his resignation from MLA’s post on Wednesday and he quit the party the next day.The buzz is that he may join the BJP on Saturday at Union home minister Amit Shah’s rally. A few other TMC leaders close to Adhikari have also expressed their disgruntlement against the party’s top leadership. While a few have sent their resignations, some have warned of quitting the party. “The Governor can send multiple letters to the CM. But it is not right to upload each and everything on social media,” said minister and TMC spokesperson Tapas Roy. Dhankhar has uploaded both his letter to the CM and Adhikari’s letter to him on social media. Adhikari’s letter on Wednesday sought Dhankhar’s intervention as the constitutional head so that police don’t implicate him in politically motivated cases. “Surely political bonhomie with the ruling party or dispensation cannot be essential requisite for enjoying liberty and human rights, as is the situation presently,” Adhikari, who spent more than two decades with the TMC, wrote in his letter to Dhankhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-that-suvendu-adhikari-isn-t-implicated-in-false-cases-wb-governor-urges-mamata/story-TKzgLlEZOcZFGxJ7xYlrnM.html

They have been organising protests in the district over the Centre’s three contentious farm legislations. “We’ve got a report from the Hayatnagar police station that some persons are inciting farmers and there can be breach of peace, and they should be asked to fill personal bonds of Rs 50 lakh each,” Subdivisional Magistrate Deependra Yadav said. The farmers said the amount was too much, following which the police station incharge gave another report and they were asked to submit personal bonds of Rs 50,000 each, according to Yadav. The notices have been issued under Section 111 ((magistrate order against any person who is likely to commit breach of peace) of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the basis of a report submitted by police, the official said. “We’ll not fill the bonds come what may,” BKU (Asli) leader Rajpal Singh Yadav said. “They can hang us or send us to jail. We’re fighting for the rights of farmers.” BKU (Asli) division president Sanjeev Gandhi said none of them or their family members had signed on the bonds. “We’re doing peaceful protests, not any crime,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-in-up-get-rs-50-lakh-notice-over-protests-sum-revised-to-50-000/story-m3OWCH9xsPRul5xUu2cVIJ.html

And Pulwama has a big share in that. At one time, we used to import the wood for pencils, but now, Pulwama is making the country self-reliant in this field,” he had said.Mann Ki Baat is the Prime Minister’s monthly radio programme to the nation and is aired on the last Sunday of every month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-focus-on-this-year-2021-on-his-mann-ki-baat-on-dec-27/story-MnY3WhMKjZUqXR4otIxqqK.html
18-12-2020||India||Case against Kangana Ranaut for ‘showing RLSP leader Kushwaha in bad light’ through re-tweet||The Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) has lodged two cases against Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut for allegedly portraying its national president and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha in a bad light through a picture which she had retweeted. The cases have been lodged at Patna and Gaya civil court under different sections of IPC and IT Act.“The case against Ranaut has been lodged by our legal cell state president Awadh Bihari Singh in the court of CJM on Friday,” said RLSP national general secretary Fazal Imam Mallick. A similar case was lodged by a party worker at Gaya civil court on Thursday. The original tweet, which came from the Twitter handle of one YOYO Funny Singh, used Kushwaha’s election meeting photo and showed Kushwaha as Azad Kashmir while the other people, posing with him, were marked as Liberal, Jihadi, Urban Naxals and Khalistani. Ranaut re-tweeted it on December 3. “Ranaut’s tweet was re-tweeted by nearly 5,000 people; 6,000 people reacted to it and more than 37,000 people saw it. This has presented a wrong picture of our leader Kushwaha and is an attempt to spread hatred in the society and country,” alleged Mallick. Kushwaha also objected to the re-tweet and wondered whether such activities will help her get an entry in politics. He also tagged the Bihar and Maharashtra DGPs, requesting them to take strong action against all those involved in it. Mallick said though police of both Maharashtra and Bihar as well as Twitter India officials were aware of the matter, no cognizance had been taken in the matter. “We were left with no option but to lodge a complaint in this regard. The tweet shows her mindset and is an attempt to get cheap publicity,” said Mallick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/case-against-kangana-ranaut-for-showing-rlsp-leader-kushwaha-in-bad-light-through-re-tweet/story-z67aCbJ7hhOjQKeIfV7nlI.html

Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla sent a letter in this regard to West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay and DGP Virendra on Thursday evening, they added.The meeting has been scheduled for 5pm, according to officials.

18-12-2020||India||Parliamentary panel questions Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra for failing to ensure women’s safety||The Parliamentary panel on home affairs on Thursday came down heavily on the Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu government for failing to ensure the safety of women in the state, people familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times. “Questions were asked why the governments had failed to reduce the number of atrocities against women and children,” a person familiar with the matter said. “The panel also wanted to know why so little of the fund earmarked for the safety of women had been used so far.” Chaired by Congress MP Anand Sharma, the panel will convene again on Friday to adopt a report on the management of the Covid-19 pandemic. The person mentioned above added that the Maharashtra government had failed to respond to the increase in the number of cases of missing women. The question, people familiar with the matter said, was raised by BJP MP Rakesh Sinha. “Sinha pointed out that the number of cases of missing women went up from 27,316 in 2016 to 33,964 in 2017,” said the person mentioned above. “This clearly shows that the police have failed to ensure women’s safety. These missing women are often trafficked within the country or abroad. The menace has to be stopped.” Also read | Row over Rahul Gandhi’s walkout from House panel meeting escalatesThe panel also emphasised that nearly 100,000 sex workers are illegally operating in Tamil Nadu, with 14,000 working out of Chennai alone. “Yet, barely any action has been taken,” the person mentioned above said. Concerns regarding women’s safety came to the fore again as the Covid-19 pandemic set in. The country saw an increase in the number of cases of domestic violence lodged with the National Commission for Women during the lockdown period. Reports also indicated that there had been a rise in the number of children trafficked during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliamentary-panel-questions-tn-maharashtra-govts-on-women-s-safety-in-states/story-XkrUgEq4wyEtsk9erqZ7lI.html
18-12-2020||India||Harsimrat Kaur Badal slams Kejriwal for insulting farmers’ struggle with ‘cheap theatrics’||Former Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Thursday hit out at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for insulting the farmers’ struggle with “cheap theatrics by tearing copies of the farm laws” which he was among the first to notify in the country.In a statement here, Badal said the Delhi Chief Minister was known as a “dramabaaz” but this time he had indulged in unparalleled hypocrisy by tearing the same laws in the Vidhan Sabha which he had notified on November 23.Asking Kejriwal to have mercy on the farmers, she said it was strange that the Delhi CM had only suddenly discovered that farmers were sitting out in the open in cold wave conditions and that more than twenty farmers had passed away. “The Delhi chief minister is only shedding crocodile tears in a desperate bid to wipe away the blot he has put on his name by rushing to notify the farm laws on the directions of the central government. These dramas however will not help. Farmers know that Kejriwal and AAP have never supported their struggle and that Kejriwal has always danced to the tune of the central government”.The Bathinda lawmaker said asserted that it was not the first time that Kejriwal had tried to “befool” farmers. “Earlier also the Delhi Chief Minister first notified the hated farm laws secretly and when this fact came out in the open he tried to win the sympathy of farmers by going in for a farcical inspection of a few toilets near the Singhu border. This latest antics of tearing copies of the farm laws has also been done to save AAP’s sinking ship in Punjab where the party has been thoroughly discredited and become redundant. Such low-level tactics will not help. Punjabis have seen through AAP and will never trust the party every again”, she added. While tearing the copies of the three recently enacted farm laws in the special assembly session, Kejriwal on Thursday had accused BJP of bringing these laws to get funds for elections. “BJP has made the elections very costly in the last few years. The farm laws have been made by the BJP for getting funds for elections,” he had said.Hundreds of farmers are protesting at the borders of Delhi since November 26 against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harsimrat-kaur-badal-slams-kejriwal-for-insulting-farmers-struggle-with-cheap-theatrics/story-qvdYUIsha9pE5EtB8dvQCI.html

Encroaching on the rights of states by attempting to transfer police officers to Centre just before elections, is an assault on federalism and an attempt to destabilize.”Earlier on December 12, in a move conveying its concern over the attack on BJP president JP Nadda’s convoy on December 10, the MHA had summoned three IPS officers, at the level of ADG, DIG and SP, from West Bengal to serve in the central deputation.Government sources had said that the three officers were called for central deputation for the alleged lapse in providing security to Nadda during his two-day visit to West Bengal.Sources said the Centre can call central services officers on central deputation and they may also face some serious disciplinary action for any lapses.They said the state has no role as cadre controlling authority of these IAS and IPS officers is the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) and MHA respectively.The convoy of Nadda was attacked on December 10 and several BJP leaders including Kailash Vijayvargiya were injured when protesters pelted stones at their vehicles at Diamond Harbour in West Bengal.The MHA had earlier summoned state Chief Secretary and Director General of Police (DGP) over the law and order situation in the state. However, the West Bengal government decided not to send them.The MHA had yet earlier sought a report from West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar over the law and order situation in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-slams-centre-over-transfer-of-ips-calls-it-assault-on-federalism/story-CxiLJR2c2Hs10oK07ayQNM.html

18-12-2020||India||26 wild rusty-spotted kittens reunited with mothers across Maharashtra farms over 6 years||After numerous examples of leopard cubs being reunited with their mothers in the wild in Maharashtra, a team of researchers and wildlife rehabilitators managed to successfully reunite 26 rusty-spotted kittens with their mothers over a period of six years (2014-2019) in the Junnar forest division of the state.The achievements of the team, part of wild animal conservation group Wildlife SOS, were published in a research paper in the Journal of Threatened Taxa on December 14.This is the first report from India on multiple reunion efforts for this cat species. Prior to this, a report in 2007 was the only one that highlighted a natural reunion.All reunions were carried out with the Maharashtra forest department. “There is a large population of rusty-spotted cats across Junnar, Ambegaon and Shirur due to the favourable habitat for these species home to sufficient water and hiding places in sugarcane fields. In 2020, we rescued and reunited three such kittens with their mothers,” said JR Gowda, deputy conservator of forest, Junnar.Authors of the study included wildlife veterinarians and researchers Ajay Deshmukh, Yaduraj Khadpekar, Mahendra Dhore, and MV Baijuraj, some of whom have spent almost two decades in leopard conservation and conflict management in Junnar.Endemic to India, Sri Lanka and areas along the Indo-Nepal border, the rusty-spotted cats are the smallest cat species in the world protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and listed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. With no specific conservation action plan for the habitat of these cats in India or an official census, IUCN estimates a 75% decline in their habitat over the next 10 years.Kittens are generally separated from their mothers during the night considering their nocturnal activity pattern, during sugarcane cutting, their mothers stray in search of food or human disturbances. All kittens were examined for injuries followed by a medical check before the reunion process.The study concluded that such reunion protocols could be replicated for kittens or cubs of other wild cat species. “The rusty-spotted cat is very rare to spot in the wild and is a hidden jewel in Indian biodiversity. We have had the opportunity to successfully rescue and reunite these kittens with their mothers and have utilised the same reunion model that we follow for reuniting leopards cubs with their mothers,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder, Wildlife SOS.All 26 kittens found in sugarcane fields, aged between 30 and 60 days, were reunited through 18 reunion events with three cases reported every year from 2014 to 2019 during early summer or early winter months of the sugarcane harvesting season. “Locals from these areas are aware about these cats and how they are different from domestic ones. We are ensuring their protection with the help of around 300 village volunteers across Junnar, Ambegaon and Shirur that inform the forest department after any sighting,” said Gowda, adding that a population estimation exercise had not yet been planned.The key to successfully reuniting the mother and kittens is to ensure it is done as quickly as possible after separation, the paper read. “All reunions happened on the evening of the same day as the mother cats were in the vicinity where the kittens were found, and presumably returned on hearing the kittens’ mewing sounds,” one of the authors said.Among all the reunion efforts, the maximum time gap between finding a kitten and taking it back for reunion, was around six hours and 45 minutes. After the kittens were brought to the location for the reunion, the minimum time for completion of a reunion was an hour and five minutes, while the maximum was four hours and 20 minutes. No kitten was lost to predation. If a reunion fails, the displaced young animal is either moved to zoological park or a rescue centre where it is hand-raised in captivity. For example, in September, two three-week-old rusty spotted kittens, a male and a female, were brought to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in Mumbai after a failed reunion with their mother at Daund, Pune. SGNP presently has five rusty spotted cats. These cats have a lifespan of 12 to 14 years in captivity but their lifespan in the wild is unknown.Independent experts have appreciated the reunion efforts and their parallel documentation over six years. “This is also an example of identifying these species abundantly present in croplands and not forests due to the presence of rodents as their prey. This shows how adaptable these species are, and also calls for focused research in these areas,” said Vidya Athreya, wildlife biologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society-India.The world’s smallest catIts common name is rusty-spotted cat and scientific name is Prionailurus rubiginosus. It resembles a domestic cat but is smaller in size with the average weight of 1kg. In India, it is under severe threat and it is feared that the species may lose a large portion of its population and 75% of its current habitat over the next 10 years. In India, it is found in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Jammu-Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/26-wild-rusty-spotted-kittens-reunited-with-mothers-across-maharashtra-farms-over-6-years/story-LSvXVhJYm3DA67p6mk5tMN.html
18-12-2020||India||Odisha seeks forced retirement of top forest officer with over 400% unaccounted wealth||In its first ever recommendation of compulsory retirement for an all-India service officer, the Odisha government has recommended the Centre for the compulsory retirement of 1987-batch IFS officer Abhay Kant Pathak, who is accused of amassing disproportionate assets worth several crores, terming him ‘very corrupt and high-flying’.Pathak, who served as the additional principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), plan, program and afforestation, would have become the next principal chief conservator of forests of Odisha in June next year as per his seniority.However, it all changed when the vigilance officials raided his residence and other premises last month to find he had amassed disproportionate assets worth Rs 9.35 crore, which was 435 % of his total income. The vigilance department also found cash deposits worth Rs 17 crore in the bank accounts of his engineering graduate son Akash Pathak, who is also behind bars for impersonation, forgery and cheating of youths with the promise of jobs in Tata Motors.A case under several sections of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018, has been registered against both Pathak and his son, Akash.“Pathak was making cash deposits of his ill-gotten wealth in his son Akash Pathak’s bank accounts and further helping his son in fraudulently posing as MD of Tata Motors,” stated the CM in his recommendation letter to the centre.In September last year, the Naveen Patnaik government had issued a circular saying the service records of employees who reach 50 years of age will be reviewed and premature retirement order will be handed out to employees if he/she is clearly lacking in integrity. Since then dozens of state government employees have been handed out premature retirement, but this is the first time a central government official would be given such a punishment. Pathak would however get pension if he is handed out compulsory retirement after Centre’s approval.Also Read: Maoists, opposing road construction in Odisha, kill contractorDuring lockdown when regular commercial flights were not allowed, the father-son duo along with former BJD minister Pradeep Panigrahy, junior Pathak’s prospective father-in-law, took 14 chartered flights to various cities in the country. They also stayed in star hotels at least 15 times this year with room rents going beyond Rs 2.3 lakh per day. Akash Pathak, who posed as the managing director of Tata Motors passengers division, reportedly defrauded more than a hundred youths promising them jobs in the company where he never worked. Though he kept insisting that he worked in Tata Motors, two days ago he finally confessed the truth to CID officials.The biggest-ever disproportionate assets case in Odisha has come at a time when the Naveen Patnaik government is stressing on accountability in government works through a fancy slogan of 5T( Teamwork, Transparency, Technology leading to Transformation in Time). It also started the Mo Sarkar programme on Gandhi Jayanti last year to bridge the trust deficit between government officials and common people due to large-scale corruption in government offices over the last decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-seeks-forced-retirement-of-top-forest-officer-with-over-400-unaccounted-wealth/story-svMF9SbLUsUTvD1AA4tmcN.html

18-12-2020||India||Lord Ram the key theme as Chhattisgarh’s Congress govt celebrates two years in office||Amid tribal protests in Bastar, the Bhupesh Baghel government in Chhattisgarh marked its two years in office with a four-day bike rally and a Rath Yatra that ended on Thursday. Interestingly, the event culminated in Raipur’s Chankhuri town, the birthplace of Lord Ram’s mother Kaushalya, amid allegations that the Congress was politicising the deity.The government started Paryatan Rath Yatra and a bike rally on December 14 from Sitamarhi-Harchaika in Koriya district in north of the state and Ramaram in Sukma district, covering a distance of 1,575 kilometers.“Lord Ram spent most of his time in Chhattisgarh and hence, we have decided to develop those places...It is part of our culture and identity and people of the world should know this,” said Baghel, addressing the event in Chankhuri. “ … Nowadays, people who want to collect money and votes also take the name of Lord Ram... No one can teach us about Lord Ram, He is of the poor and farmers,” said Baghel. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the party was dividing Lord Ram for political gains. “The Congress is dividing Ram as ours and theirs for political gains. It is the same Congress which rejected the presence of Lord Ram. It is a welcome move that now, they have accepted that they cannot move ahead without Lord Ram’s blessings,” state BJP president Vishnu Deo Sai said.In August this year, the state government had launched an ambitious Ram Van Gaman tourist circuit project in the state in which nine sites were selected for the first phase.The sites are: Sitamarhi-Harchaika (Koriya), Ramgarh (Ambikapur), Shivrinarayan (Janjgir-Champa), Turturiya (Baloda Bazar), Chandkhuri (Raipur), Rajim (Gariaband), Sihawa-Saptarishi Ashram (Dhamtari), Jagdalpur (Bastar) and Ramaram (Sukma).The December 14 rally was organised to collect soil from these cities for the plantation work in Chankhuri town to mark two years of Congress government.The rally was opposed by tribal leaders in Sukma and Kanker district of Bastar region, who claimed that the development of these under the Ram Van Gaman project was against their customs.“Bastar comes under PESA hence no one can collect soil or anything without the permission of locals. Secondly, the development of these sites will encourage the entry of outsiders who will, over time, dominate tribal culture. We don’t want anyone to interfere with our customs and culture,” said Sohan Potai, former Member of Parliament and leader of Sarv Adivasi Samaj, Kanker district.Responding to the allegations, chief minister’s advisor Vinod Verma said, “There is some misinformation.. We are developing the places which are already there and trying to encourage tourism in the area. Secondly, there are ancient Hindu temples in Bastar which suggest that Hinduism isn’t new to the region... Both Hindu and tribal culture have existed for ages.” Political commentators said that Congress is trying to project Lord Ram as a religious symbol to connect with the majority. “Besides being a religious symbol to help the Congress present a majority-friendly face, Ram has become a sort of economic exigency for the fund-starved government in Chhattisgarh. The state has got more landmarks and mythological footprints of Ram and other characters from Ramayan than any other state,” said Parivesh Mishra, a political commentator based in Chhattisgarh.Mishra added that the prospects of religious tourism makes economic sense for Chhattisgarh. “The subject has the potential of becoming the USP (Unique Selling Proposition) for tourism. It is not a coincidence that Dandakaranya forest -- where Ram is believed to have spent most of his time during the 14-year exile -- is the core area of Maoist activities. The development of tourism will perhaps be the most non-intrusive vehicle of development in the area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lord-ram-the-key-theme-as-chhattisgarh-s-congress-govt-celebrates-two-years-in-office/story-tNKgWoqrmtWEpyDsT3b6wI.html

The BJP, having re-elected Dilip Ghosh as Bengal party chief, is aiming to ready a booth-level party structure to bolster its electoral strategy, party leaders said.“While BJP party leaders from across the country would be tasked with ‘Mission Bengal’, it’s in UP where the BJP successfully engaged with two influential caste groups, Dalits and OBCs, ahead of the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls, as well as before 2017 UP polls. In West Bengal, too, the BJP is attempting to connect with fishermen and Matuas, a Dalit refugee group with origins in Bangladesh and whose influence is spread over 50 assembly seats in the state,” said a party leader, who didn’t wish to be named. Maurya, an OBC leader, is likely to visit at least 30 assembly segments in West Bengal, including key regions like Howrah, Serampore, Arambagh and Uluberia.Leaders from Uttar Pradesh handling political assignments in the crucial eastern state are expected to report to BJP chief JP Nadda, home minister Amit Shah and senior RSS leader, currently in the BJP, BL Santosh, party leaders said.Also Read: BJP, GNLF join hands for Bengal polls During his visit this month, Union home minister Amit Shah had set a target for BJP winning 200 of the 294 assembly seats in the Mamata Banerjee ruled state.

18-12-2020||India||World Arabic Language Day: Theme, significance, history||The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) observes December 18 as the World Arabic Language Day every year, honouring a language that is spoken by more than 290 million people around the world. World Arabic Language Day commemorates the role Arabic played in promoting the dissemination of the sciences and philosophies of ancient civilisations such as the Greeks and the Romans, and in giving birth to the European Renaissance.Arabic is a strongly pronounced language, which manifests in particular in the 15th letter of its alphabet Ḍād. The sound does not exist in any other language around the world and this is why Arabic is called the language of Ḍād. The language of the Quran, Arabic does not only hold a symbolic value among Muslims but is spoken in many churches in the Arab world. A significant part of Jewish history was also originally written in Arabic.The event was established by Unesco in 2010 seeking “to celebrate multilingualism and cultural diversity as well as to promote equal use of all six of its official working languages throughout the organization”. Unesco has celebrated the day since 2012. December 18 was chosen as the date coincides with the United Nations General Assembly’s decision in 1973 to adopt Arabic as the organization’s sixth official language.This year the theme of World Arabic Language Day is “Arabic Language Academies: Necessity of Luxury?” Audrey Azoulay, Unesco’s director general, will deliver a message on the international day describing Arabic as a “bridge between cultures and across borders,” according to an official statement. Unesco has also expressed its concern about the gradual decline of the use of Arabic in the academic field against global languages such as French and English, prompting the organization to call on academies to preserve the language.In order to address the issue and celebrate World Arabic Language Day, Unesco will organise a webinar meeting with academics and professionals in the Arabic language to discuss the role of academic figures in preserving the language.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-arabic-language-day-theme-significance-history/story-4aTQ5BJe7IXHpsaG9B9DdO.html

Strong tremors were felt in Delhi and surrounding areas for several seconds. The earthquake struck at 11:46pm at a depth of 7.5km from the surface. There was no report of any damage to life or property as earthquakes of magnitude four or below hardly cause any damage.The epicentre of the earthquake was Haryana’s Rewari, according to India’s National Center for Seismology(NCS). “Earthquake tremors in Delhi NCR. Tremors felt in Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad. As per the National Centre for Seismology, the epicentre was suggested to be 48 kilometres southwest of Gurugram,” Skymet Weather tweeted. As per the National Centre for Seismology, the epicentre was suggested to be 48 kilometres southwest of #Gurugram.The #earthquake measured 4.2 on the Richter scale https://t.co/VwHjewLsqiDelhi, which lies close to a faultline, is susceptible to big earthquakes, geologists say. The city falls in seismic zone IV - a very high-risk zone.In June, an earthquake of magnitude 2.1 was detected near Delhi. It was the eleventh minor earthquake recorded in and around Delhi since May. On 15 May, a quake of magnitude 2.2 on the Richter Scale hit 13km NW of New Delhi. On May 10 a magnitude 3.4 earthquake shook the national capital, epicentre in Wazirpur area of NCR, which was the strongest this year until the earthquake reported on Thursday. On April 12 and 13 also there were quakes of magnitudes 3.5 and 2.7 respectively in Delhi region.These recent earthquakes have triggered discussions on the possibility of increased seismicity around Delhi, and fears of an impending big earthquake sometime soon. None of these apprehensions has any scientific basis as rarely has Delhi been the epicentre of any earthquake. Delhi experiences tremors even when an earthquake occurs as far as in Central Asia or the Himalayan ranges, that are seismically the most active regions and because of large population and high density, an earthquake in Delhi sets an alarm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-mild-earthquakes-since-june-delhi-feels-strong-tremors-again/story-sm0uCBJKRYfHzQCHgDdTcL.html

While senior officials of the poll body are already in West Bengal,a team would visit Tamil Nadu next week, people familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times. Deputy election commissioner Sudip Jain is already in Kolkata and EC secretary general Umesh Sinha and deputy election commissioner Ashish Kundra will leave for Chennai next week. They will assess the preparedness of the states, which are among the five that will go to polls next year. The other states where elections are scheduled are Kerala and Assam, and the Union Territory of Puducherry.The officials will conduct consultations with various stakeholders, including meetings with all state level EC officials who will be briefing the poll panel on the preparations. After the success in conducting the elections to the 243-member assembly in Bihar amid the Covid-19 pandemic, election commissioner Sushil Chandra had told Hindustan Times that the other five poll bound states would vote on schedule.

The minimum temperature data for today will be updated by India Meteorological Department (IMD) at 9am.There is a wind speed of 11 kmph. Though cold wave conditions haven’t been recorded, day temperature is likely to be below normal today.Both cold day and cold wave conditions are likely to persist over pockets of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, West Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan and Delhi for the next two days. The minimum temperature is likely to rise by 2-3 degrees C after that and 5-6 degrees C in maximum temperatures during the subsequent three days, according to IMD.Minimum temperature is likely to fall by 3-5 degrees C over East Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh and by 4-6 degrees C over east India during the next three days. Most parts of the western region are likely to record a fall in minimum temperature by 2 to 3 degrees C.Dense fog is likely over pockets of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram during the next three days.On Thursday, the day temperature fell to only 15.2 degrees C, 7 degrees below normal, categorised as a severe cold day by IMD.

Cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degree C in the plains. Witnessing a cold day and cold wave together means the gap between day and night temperatures was lower than normal.Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are very likely in some pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, west Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan during the next three days and decrease thereafter, according to IMD’s bulletin. Cold day to severe cold day conditions are likely in some pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, north Rajasthan and northwest Uttar Pradesh during the next two days and decrease thereafter.

18-12-2020||India||BKU chief Naresh Tikait asks Centre to call all party meet to resolve farmers’ stir||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief and head of Baliyan Khap Naresh Tikait advised the Union government on Thursday to resolve the issue of farmers’ stir over three farm laws by calling an all party meeting. Tikait was interacting with mediapersons after a meeting with khap heads in Baraut area of Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh. He later left for Delhi to attend the BKU’s Mahapanchayat at Ghazipur border on Thursday. Tikait said that the government should resolve the issue of protests over the farm laws through dialogue instead of adopting a stiff attitude. He added that since six rounds of talks between farmers and the government had yielded no results, the government should call an all party meeting to resolve the impasse. The farmer leader accused the government of a stubborn attitude while farmers were braving acute cold under the open skies since the past 21 days. He said that the government wanted a confrontation between different groups of farmers. “They are farmers who want a solution for their problems, not confrontation, either with the government or with each other,” he said and explained that the farmers might be associated with different organizations but they had a common goal. Tikait’s comments come at a time when Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar has reached out to protesting farmers with an open letter, saying a “misunderstanding” has been created among some farmer unions and “white lies” are being spread on the issue of minimum support price for crops.Also Read: ‘Talk to each other’: Supreme Court allows farmers protest to go onProtesting farmers fear the new farm laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the ‘mercy’ of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.Hundreds of farmers have been protesting on different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bku-chief-naresh-tikait-asks-centre-to-call-all-party-meet-to-resolve-farmers-stir/story-yW0YTTuRQTLQXJFZIDQd8I.html
18-12-2020||India||Supreme Court to decide on contempt proceedings against Kunal Kamra today: All you need to know||The Supreme Court will on Friday pronounce its order over a clutch of petitions seeking initiation of contempt of court proceedings against stand-up comic Kunal Kamra for his tweets “mocking” the top court and, especially Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and justice DY Chandrachud. A three-judge bench, comprising justice Ashok Bhushan, justice RS Reddy and justice MR Shah, had reserved its order on Thursday.Here’s all you need to know about the case:1. The controversy pertains to Kamra posting a series of tweets on November 11 after a two-judge bench, comprising justice Chandrachud and justice Indira Banerjee, granted interim bail to Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami in a 2018 alleged abetment to suicide case.Also Read | Will Kunal Kamra face contempt proceedings for his tweets? Supreme Court to decide tomorrow2. The same day, law student Skand Bajpai wrote to Attorney General KK Venugopal, seeking his consent that contempt proceedings be initiated against Kamra. In a tweet on November 12, Bajpai posted on Twitter a letter from AG, in which Venugopal gave his consent. In reply to my letter dated 11.11.2020, the Ld. Attorney General for India has given kind consent to initiate criminal conttempt of court against @kunalkamra88. @barandbench @LiveLawIndia @legaljournalist @scconline_ @Talwarious @manuvichar @answeringlaw pic.twitter.com/p0Y9RGCpyG3. In the letter, Venugopal wrote that he had gone through Kamra’s tweets and found these insinuated that the “Supreme Court is not an independent and impartial institution and so too its judges, but is, on the other hand, a Court of the ruling party, the BJP.” The insinuation, Venugopal wrote, was “gross.”4. Reacting to this, Kamra refused to apologise. In a statement on Twitter, he said, “The tweets I recently put out have been found in contempt of court. All that I tweeted was from my view of the Supreme Court of India giving a partial decision in favour of a Prime Time Loudspeaker.”5. “My view hasn’t changed because the silence of the Supreme Court of India on matters of other’s personal liberty cannot go uncriticized. I don’t intend to retract my tweets or apologise for them. I believe they speak for themselves,” Kamra added.6. Days later, AG Venugopal gave fresh consent to initiate contempt proceedings against Kamra, this time over a November 18 tweet in which the stand-up comic allegedly mocked CJI Bobde.7. A total of eight petitioners, including law students and lawyers, have sought initiation of contempt proceedings against Kamra in the two cases, as per Bar and Bench.8. Under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, consent of AG or that of the solicitor general, is needed for initiating contempt proceedings against a person.9. Kunal Kamra is a vocal critic of Arnab Goswami. In January, Kamra had confronted Goswami on a flight, following which he was barred by several airlines, including IndiGo, on whose Mumbai-Lucknow flight the incident took place.10. Kamra moved Delhi High Court challenging the flight ban. The court, however, declined to entertain his plea, disapproving his behaviour on the flight and noting that such behaviour can’t be allowed on an airline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-decide-on-contempt-proceedings-against-kunal-kamra-today-all-you-need-to-know/story-ynZVU9IAYbheHGkYI9mAQI.html

This comes a day after hundreds of farmers from the state started a foot march from Morena in support of the agriculturists who have been protesting in Delhi for three weeks now against the controversial farm laws implemented in September.“PM Modi will address the farmers of the state around 2 pm through video-conference and explain to them in detail the beneficial provisions of the new agricultural laws,” an official of the Madhya Pradesh public relations department on told news agency PTI on Thursday.The PM’s address will be telecast live across 23,000 villages of the country and at all the district headquarters of Madhya Pradesh, the official said. Rs 1,660 crore will be transferred to the accounts of 35 lakh farmers by the state government to compensate for crop loss, he added.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will also attend the programme from Raisen. “The previous Congress-led state government did injustice with the farmers by not transferring relief funds into their accounts. The previous Congress government did not even deposit the premium of Fasal Bima Yojna. But BJP is determined to work for the welfare of farmers. We have already deposited the premium of Fasal Bima Yojna and are now going to transfer relief funds,” the chief minister said.The Kisan Kalyan programme is being organised in four levels — gram panchayat, block, district and state. Nearly 20,000 farmers will take part in the state-level programme in Raisen.The PM’s address comes in the backdrop of thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana protesting at Delhi borders since November 27, demanding that the three farm laws -- The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- be scrapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-address-mp-farmers-today-amid-protests-against-farm-laws/story-uPM8qu40ey2wdhFRZYEqlO.html

18-12-2020||India||‘Talk to each other’: Supreme Court allows farmers protest to go on||The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed farmers amassed at Delhi’s borders to continue their protest against the three contentious laws that seek to open up trade in agriculture, emphasising that to protest against a law was a fundamental right.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde shot down a plea by the Centre as well as some petitioners, refusing to restrain the farmers as long as the protests are non-violent and do not result in damage to the life and property of other citizens.At the same time, the bench implored the farmers and the government to “talk to each other”, as it underscored that every protest must also pave way for a “meaningful discussion” between the two sides.“We clarify that this Court will not interfere with the protest in question...We are of the view at this stage that the farmers’ protest should be allowed to continue without impediment and without any breach of peace either by the protesters or the police,” ordered the bench, which included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.The order came after senior advocate Harish Salve argued on behalf of a Delhi resident that blockades by protesters have held the entire national capital hostage and violate other citizens’ fundamental right of movement.Salve contended no right was absolute, and the right to protest cannot extend to deny others their right to move freely or the right to life, given the farmers have come in droves and increased the risk of infection by the coronavirus. He added that the prices of commodities had also gone up due to restrictions on the free movement of the goods vehicles.“We are all Indians and we are familiar with their problems. We are also sympathetic to their cause. But you (farmers) need to alter your way of protest. And we can tell you that we will see to it that a discussion through an independent and impartial committee takes place. We will have experts from the field of agriculture in this committee,” the bench said.But due to the absence of most of the farmers’ unions spearheading the protests, the bench could not proceed with the constitution of a committee of representatives of both sides to discuss and resolve the dispute.Later on Thursday, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar tried to dispel the protesting farmers’ misgivings in an impassioned letter to the them, reiterating his commitment to resolve issues and a written assurance on state-set minimum support prices. He said confusion had been created by some political forces to derail the reforms.“I belong to a farmer’s family and since childhood, I have experienced the tough life of farmers. It is very satisfactory that after implementation of the law, MSP procurement has set a new record this time,” Tomar wrote.The farmer unions said in a media briefing at the Singhu border protest site that they would consult senior lawyers on the Supreme Court proceedings before taking any decision on whether to “implead” as a party in the matter.“All farmer unions had a meeting today and we have decided that we will consult four Supreme Court lawyers – Prashant Bhushan, Dushyant Dave, HS Phoolka and Colin Gonsalves – about the ongoing proceedings in the Supreme Court… We will neither comment on the matter nor announce any decision without consulting these lawyers,” the coordinator of Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh, KV Biju said.In the Supreme Court, attorney general Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, drew a parallel with a “war-like situation” while complaining that the protesters had blocked all major entry points to the Capital.“They need to disband, go back to their villages and we can talk to their leaders. The damage done in last 22 days is enormous. Worst of it all, they are here, brushing shoulders despite the Covid situation. When they will go back to their villages, they will be spreading the infection in Punjab, Haryana, etc. They will be a danger to themselves and others too,” Venugopal told the bench.In a bid to end what it called a “stalemate”, the bench observed: “A protest has to have a purpose. You cannot just sit on a protest and then do nothing. We understand it is a perfectly constitutional protest. It has a purpose; a goal but that goal cannot be achieved by simply sitting in protest. They have to talk to each other; doesn’t matter even if it fails. And we want to facilitate this.”The court adjourned the hearing until after a fortnight to wait for the farmers’ unions to show up and present their views. It also sought comments of the other parties regarding the constitution of the committee while making it clear in its order that “the pendency of these matters will not prevent the parties from resolving the issue amicably”.The proceedings witnessed a reluctance on the part of the government to promise suspension of the laws in view of the pendency of the matter before the SC. When asked by the court if the government is willing to assure that the operation and the executive actions under the new laws can be put on hold, both the attorney general and solicitor general refrained from offering such commitments.“We cannot do so (suspend the laws). Also, if we do it, farmers will not come to talk,” said Venugopal. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said “it will be tough” to give an assurance such as this.The attorney general rued that the unions’ demand is to repeal the laws and they insist that they do not want to discuss them clause by clause. “They (unions) or the committee (to be set up by the court) should discuss the clauses so that we can identify what exactly is the problem. It cannot be like repeal all laws or nothing,” he said.The bench responded that it was constrained to observe a day ago that the negotiations between the government and the farmers’ unions are bound to fail again in view of recent events.When Venugopal said the issue was not being resolved because of the farmers’ “adamant stand”, the bench replied: “They will think you are adamant.”The court also told Venugopal and Mehta that till the time this protest is constitutional and does not turn violent, the police should be equally bound not to use any violent means. “You (police) cannot initiate violence nor can you blockade the city,” it added.Meanwhile, advocate AP Singh, representing a faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, (BKU-Bhanu), demanded that farmers should be allowed to enter Delhi and be allowed to protest at Ramlila Maidan.But this plea was quickly shot down by the bench: “Who is here in the court or on the spot to guarantee there won’t be injury to anyone or destruction of properties if they are allowed? Is it not for the police to decide these issues based on relevant inputs as a law-and-order situation? Courts don’t have the wherewithal to control a mob that goes on a rampage. This is for the police to decide.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talk-to-each-other-supreme-court-allows-farmers-protest-to-go-on/story-orBcjQQ5JGnaUirRvJdi0L.html
18-12-2020||India||Are we undercounting India’s women workers?||India needs more women to join the workforce. According to the latest Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), only 25.9% of women between the ages of 15 and 49 were either working or looking for work. This number is 78.3% for men. Unless the gender gap in employment is bridged, the economy will not able to exploit the full potential of its young workforce. This has a direct bearing on per capita income levels. An HT analysis of per capita worker incomes and per capita incomes in China and India showed that India’s gap with China was much larger when it came to per capita incomes than per worker incomes. According to World Bank data, China’s per capita GDP was 2.4 times that of India in 2016. In terms of per worker GDP, this ratio was just 1.7. The gap between China’s lead over India in terms of per capita GDP and per worker GDP has been increasing over the past three decades.While there can be little doubt about the need for bringing more women into the workforce, two government reports suggest that there is significant ambiguity about the number of women workers in the country. PLFS seems to be a large underestimate of working women in many states Last week, the ministry of health and family welfare released summary statistics for 17 states and five union territories for the 2019-20 National Family and Health Survey (NFHS). The state-wise fact sheets give information on the share of women of age 15-49 years who worked in the last 12 months and were paid in cash. For seven out of the 17 states for which the 2019-20 NFHS findings have been published, this number is greater than not just the female work force participation rate (WPR) but also the labour force participation rate (LFPR) in the 2018-19 PLFS for the same age group. LFPR is defined as the share of population which is either working or looking for a job, while WPR is the share of population which actually employed. Unemployment rate is the difference between LFPR and WPR. In states like Bihar, the number reported by the NFHS is more than three times the female WPR in the PLFS. To be sure, the NFHS number for states such as Himachal Pradesh is much lower than the PLFS stats.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();The mismatch between PLFS and NFHS numbers is not new. The 2015-16 NFHS says that 25.6% of women worked and were paid in cash in the last one year. The 2017-18 PLFS puts the LFPR and WPR of women at 24.8% and 23.1%. What explains the discrepancy between NFHS and PLFS estimates? There could be two possible explanations. By focusing on cash, the NFHS might be excluding workers who are paid in kind or not salaried at all Because the NFHS factsheets publish the share of women who were paid in cash in the last one year, it should exclude women workers who were paid in kind or not paid at all. The economic census (2013-14) shows that more than 70% of economic enterprises in the country did not even have one hired worker. A women worker working in a household enterprise might not be recorded in the NFHS estimates of working women earning cash.

For example, the usual status criterion of work requires that a person should have worked for majority of the past 365 days. The current weekly status of work tracks a person’s activity in the last seven days preceding the survey. If a woman took up some paid work for less than six months, months before the PLFS was conducted, she might not get counted in the PLFS as employed but could show up in the NFHS numbers as having worked for cash payment. This could explain why the NFHS numbers are higher than the PLFS numbers. A 2018 report by the Azim Premji University reported a finding from a survey in West Bengal which found that non-availability of work in the area was the biggest reason why women did not take up paid employment. Data from the 2011 census shows that gender gap worsens for women as distance to workplace increases (https://bit.ly/3pcX0R5).  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/are-we-undercounting-india-s-women-workers/story-u8C3cjGpr62UMAkig7osDL.html
18-12-2020||India||‘Unity sphere’, tech dome in New India garden plan||The New India Garden or Nav Bharat Udyan proposed to be built on the bank of the river Yamuna as part of Centre’s plan to extend the Central Vista axis from India Gate till the river will house a “sunflower plaza”, a “Growth Plaza” representing all states and UTs of India, a “sphere of unity,” a “techno dome” an open air theatre and a maze showcasing the “journey of India” apart from an “iconic structure” as the new symbol of the Capital, according to a presentation by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), reviewed by HT.The Nav Bharat Udyan will also have an entrance inspired by the Martand Sun Temple, the famous ruins of which are in the Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir.The complex is being built as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project. The Nav Bharat Udyan will come up on 20.22 acres on the western bank of Yamuna. It is expected to be unveiled to the public by August 15, 2022, when India turns 75.A government official familiar with the plans said the garden will be iconic, represent the values of a new India, and that it can be experienced through hi-tech. “At the entrance gate we will have a digital layer, where you can pair your smart watch and go through various levels of the complex. After the entrance you will see the ‘sphere of unity’ where ‘India @75’ is being inscribed in different languages. The bronze sphere will be mounted on a ‘mandal’, then you will go through the ‘milestone walkway’ depicting each year of Independence with its most significant achievements highlighted.”The government in November announced that the length of the Central Vista axis which extends from the Rashtrapati Bhawan, through the North and South Blocks, over Rajpath and to India Gate, would double from 2.9km to 6.3km – right up to the riverbank.“At the centre is the Sunflower plaza is where the iconic tower or structure, a new symbol of the Capital is being planned. This falls on the axis of the Central Vista. Along this will be a ‘growth plaza’ with 36 columns representing each state and UT of India. There will also be a maze depicting the ’journey of India’, focusing on the past, present and future – who we were, are and what we aspire to be as a nation,” the official added.On November 12, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) announced a design competition to construct an “iconic structure” on the bank of the river Yamuna as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project to commemorate 75 years of independence. A total of 98 entries have been received from which the final design will be chosen.CPWD’s proposal dated November 12 said the structure so built must “realise the grand vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), symbolising emerging New India with equitable growth opportunities, rooted in values of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas, Sabka Vishwaas (with everyone; for everyone’s progress; and trusted by everyone – one of the mottos of the government) and representing the aspiration of clean India, free from poverty, corruption, terrorism, communalism and casteism”.The CPWD proposal mandated that only such material and technology should be used to build the structure that would endure like “Ashoka’s edicts, the Iron Pillar in Qutub Minar complex etc.” This was in reference to a competition called by the CPWD to design the “iconic structure.”“The structure should be iconic in design and represent the national capital. For example, India Gate erected by the British in the Central Vista in the early 20th century prominently signifies Delhi. The proposed iconic structure being built in the independent India should now become a new symbol of the national capital,” CPWD’s proposal said.The Central Vista redevelopment plan, being handled by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, also involves having a new Parliament building in place by India’s 75th Independence Day in 2022, while the entire project is slated to be finished by 2024.Meanwhile, Centre has also narrowed down on five construction firms for the next phase of the Central Vista redevelopment project – the redevelopment and restructuring of the Central Vista Avenue, which includes the majority of the Rajpath stretch and the row of government offices that are parallel to it, HT reported on December 14.The work on the second phase of the project comes at a time when the apex court last week directed the Centre to immediately stop all construction and ancillary activities in the historically significant Central Vista area of New Delhi where a new Parliament, Central Secretariat and union ministries’ offices are planned to be built. The Supreme Court allowed the government to proceed with the foundation stone laying ceremony on December 10, and paperwork.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unity-sphere-tech-park-in-new-india-garden-plan/story-y0nCLHdkKB0XYGvPrmnhpI.html
18-12-2020||India||At Delhi airport, automated immigration process on anvil||Delhi’s international airport on Thursday began a pilot programme to automate immigration clearance for passengers travelling out of the country through gates that will scrutinise them and their documents without any human intervention — a move the authorities hope will cut down travel time and address staffing issues.The facility, called the Trusted Travelers Program (TTP), has been designed on the lines of the US’s Global Entry Program, which allows pre-approved immigration clearance for low-risk travellers.Experts, however, warned that without proper awareness, the facility could lead to congestion at the gates instead. An officer involved in the process said on condition of anonymity that to get immigration clearance at the “e-gates”, passengers will need to scan their passports and boarding passes themselves.“After reading that the passport and the boarding pass are genuine, a camera attached to the scanner will click a picture of the passenger’s face. The passengers will also require recording their biometrics by scanning their fingerprints. Within seconds, this information will be matched with a database of the prohibited or blacklisted passengers. Once found cleared, the e-gates will open, allowing the passenger to proceed,” the officer said. An IB official, who asked not to be named, said: “Yes there is a plan to have technology-based immigration centres, which usually have long queues due to shortage of manpower in immigration.”On Thursday, a team of officials from the ministry of home affairs visited the Indira Gandhi International Airport, where four such e-gates have been installed on a trial basis for three months. Another officer said the initiative will be made fully operational in three phases.In the first phase, the e-gates will be used by diplomats, government officials and foreign dignitaries. In the second phase, it will be made available for all Indian passengers, and in the third, foreign passengers will be able to use the facility. The first phase is likely to begin by March 2021, the official added.On average, the immigration clearance process currently takes about 1.5 minutes for a passenger at counters staffed by immigration officials at the Delhi airport. “This is the time taken at the counter, not inclusive of the time taken in the queue. With the e-gates in place, as manual intervention will be zero, a passenger will be able to gain immigration clearance within 30-40 seconds. Initially, there will be staff present to assist the passengers in the process,” the officer said. The passengers’ data will also be recorded with the bureau of immigration for future usage, he added.However, aviation expert Mark D Martin said the concept works well at airports in Singapore, Dubai and in European countries. He added that e-gates for India at this juncture is premature. “E-Gate is excellent for frequent flyers and airline crew but offering such a service to a country that has a large expat worker diaspora will be a handing nightmare, with the clearance time exceeding more than 10 minutes per passenger...,” Martin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-delhi-airport-automated-immigration-process-on-anvil/story-Ib1mTy98aKgC6QgNZVdHWP.html
18-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Wednesday, December 16, the world saw 715,068 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to worldometers.info. The seven-day average of daily cases on the day was 637,090, the highest to date. The world saw 13,450 deaths from Covid-19 on December 16; and the seven-day average of deaths was 11,285, again, the highest to date. The discovery of vaccines that can prevent the disease, their approval in some countries, and imminent approval in some others, and frenetic preparations by governments everywhere to source vaccines, set up infrastructure to store and transport them, identify who will be the first to receive doses, and train those who will be administering the shots, has pushed news of the pandemic itself to the background; but the bad news is that, almost out of sight, it is raging.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageIn India, especially, it’s easy to overlook this because our own numbers are so much better. India saw 28,415 new cases of Covid-19 on December 16. The seven-day average of cases was 27,672. India also saw 356 deaths on December 16; the seven-day average of deaths was 382. The case numbers are almost 70% lower than peaks seen in September; the death numbers, 67% lower than peaks seen in September. All India numbers are from the HT dashboard. Sure, India remains among the 10 most affected countries currently, according to data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center (the US, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, the UK, Germany, Italy, France, and Ukraine are the other nine). And it is among the six countries in this list where the average of daily cases is trending down (it is trending up only in Turkey, Russia, the UK, and Germany). The only reason the US isn’t in that list of countries where cases are trending up is because of a statistical anomaly, a blip that will likely correct itself as the week goes by.On Wednesday, according to the New York Times, the US saw 244,365 new cases, the highest in a day in any country in the world (in fact, no other country has even crossed the 100,000 cases-a-day mark). The country also saw the most daily deaths on Wednesday with 3,607. That’s roughly 40% of the daily cases around the world, and a little over a fourth of all deaths, so it is clear which country is driving the global numbers. The only good news for the US in the dark days ahead will be that it can soon be among the few countries in the world to start keeping another count – the number of those vaccinated. The third wave of the pandemic has ravaged the country, though, and will likely continue doing so till the end of the month – hospitalisations are at an all-time high (a little over 100,000), and critical care units are filling up fast.It isn’t just the US that is pushing up case numbers though. With a seven-day average of around 42,000 daily new cases, Brazil is seeing a strong second wave of infections; with a seven-day average of around 22,000 daily new cases, Germany’s second wave, which seemed to be coming under control in the second half of November, has only strengthened in intensity, forcing the country to declare a lockdown between December 16 and January 10; and the UK, which seemed to have seen off the second wave in early December, is seeing a spike in daily new cases (up to a seven-day average of around 20,000). Mexico, too, is seeing a strong second wave, with the seven-day average of daily new cases rising to over 10,000. And while Italy, France, and Spain would appear to be past the second wave, they are still seeing a substantial number of daily cases (a seven-day average of close to 10,000 in France, 8,000 in Spain, and over 15,000 in Italy).As India exhales during its current welcome respite, it would do well to keep an eye on these numbers – if only to remember how quickly things can turn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-y2IMoXxPeBMIBCBV4ySq5M.html
18-12-2020||India||Supreme Court rejects UP plea against Kafeel Khan’s release after detention under NSA||The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed an appeal by the Uttar Pradesh government that sought to overturn a Allahabad high court order releasing Dr Kafeel Khan from detention under the stringent National Security Act (NSA), but observed that the criminal cases against Khan will be decided on merits without being influenced by the observations made in the high court’s judgment.On September 1, the Allahabad high court put an end to the continued detention of Khan since January 29 over a speech given last December at Aligarh Muslim University on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.Kafeel Khan thanked the court and said that he “will continue to raise voice against injustice done to anyone anywhere”.The state accused him of disturbing public order and creating an atmosphere of fear and insecurity among the residents of Aligarh. He got bail in the case on February 10, but before his release, the charge under NSA was added against him and on February 13, and the District Magistrate ordered his preventive detention under this Act. Appearing for the state, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, “The high court observations are exonerating him even in the criminal prosecution pending against him. We are only on this limited concern.” The bench headed by CJI SA Bobde said, “We see no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order passed by the high court. Accordingly, the special leave petition (by Uttar Pradesh government) is dismissed. However, we make it clear that the observations in the judgment [by the Allahabad High Court] will not determine the outcome of the prosecution. The criminal cases will be decided on their own merits.”Senior advocate Indira Jaising who appeared for Khan’s mother Nuzhat Perveen, insisted that the latter part of the order was not required. However, the bench refused to alter its order. “SC has dismissed Uttar Pradesh government SLP to quash my Allahabad court order... Bench was of the view that it is a good order and there is no reason to interfere with it... I’ll continue to raise voice against injustice done to anyone anywhere,” he tweeted.Khan was the nodal officer of the Acute Encephalitis ward at Gorakhpur’s Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College where more than a hundred children died reportedly due to shortage of oxygen in 2017. He was suspended, and later arrested after the deaths but was released on bail. A state government probe cleared him of all major charges. Khan had alleged that an institutional failure led to the deaths of the children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-up-plea-against-kafeel-khan-s-release-after-detention-under-nsa/story-09tDVYULmzFCFmKSYvKZCJ.html
18-12-2020||India||Vijayvargiya comment on fall of Congress govt in Madhya Pradesh fans row||A political row erupted on Thursday over a statement by BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya linking PM Narendra Modi to the collapse of the then Congress government in Madhya Pradesh earlier this year, even as the senior leader clarified that he was only joking. At a farmer’s meet in Indore on Wednesday, Vijayvarigiya said, “I am telling you something, don’t disclose it to anyone... If someone played an important role in dethroning Kamal Nath’s government, it was Prime Minister Modi... not Dharmendra Pradhan.” Vijayvargiya laughed aloud after the statement. On Thursday, Vijayvargiya clarified that he cracked a joke and that even before the government fell, Congress leaders were already under pressure because of the “excellent work” of PM. “I was talking about the Congress MLAs resigning because of the good work done by the PM.” But the Congress insisted it was clear that BJP leaders hatched a conspiracy against the government. MP Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “We’ll take legal action so that nobody will think of shaming democracy in this way.”The BJP rejected this statement and said Nath was only to blame for his partymen deserting the government. Party spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Kailash Vijayvargiya has already cleared what he said. And it was a duty of Kamal Nath to save the then state government. The MLAs and ministers left the party for the development and to fulfil the promises made to voters, not for any other reason.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijayvargiya-comment-on-fall-of-congress-govt-in-madhya-pradesh-fans-row/story-uEiNKS3gNLLzaQgmbX5gyM.html
18-12-2020||India||Top court takes exception to selective disclosures by media in criminal trials||The Supreme Court on Thursday took serious exception to “selective disclosures” by the media in a criminal trial, pointing out that it ends up affecting the rights of both the accused and the victim.The apex court was hearing a case related to the suicide of a doctor in Agra on August 6, following which her father registered a dowry harassment case against her husband and in-laws on August 7. Within a couple of days of the death, the alleged suicide note was published in local newspapers.While examining the issue, the three judge bench of justices DY Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee said the investigating officer had a duty to investigate when information about the commission of a cognisable offence is brought to their attention. Unfortunately, this role is being compromised by the manner in which selective leaks take place in the public realm, it said.“The sequence in this case appears to follow familiar patterns. Immediate publicity was given to the alleged suicide note. These examples are now becoming familiar. Selective disclosures to the media affect the rights of the accused in some cases and the rights of victims’ families in others.”The bench found this “selective leak” to be a disturbing trend and found it proper to transfer the investigation of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-takes-exception-to-selective-disclosures-by-media-in-criminal-trials/story-OIKS1yJR5WZWLS1DisceUN.html
18-12-2020||India||PM Modi writes to Nawaz Sharif, condoles his mother’s death||Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote a letter to former Pakistani premier Nawaz Sharif to extend condolences on the death of Sharif’s mother last month, according to Pakistani media reports on Thursday. The letter was forwarded by chargé d’affaires Gaurva Ahluwalia at the Indian high commission in Islamabad to Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz on December 11 with a request that it should be conveyed to her father, who has been living in the UK since last year. Shamim Akhtar, the mother of Nawaz Sharif and Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) president Shehbaz Sharif, died in Britain on November 22. Her body was brought to Pakistan for burial at the family’s estate at Jati Umra in Lahore. Modi’s letter dated November 27, which was accessed by Dawn News TV channel, stated: “I am deeply saddened to learn about the demise of your mother Begum Shamim Akhtar on 22 November in London. My heartfelt condolences are with you in this hour of intense grief.” Addressing Sharif as “Mian Sahib”, the name usually used in Pakistan’s political circles for the former premier, Modi wrote: “Her simplicity and warmth was indeed very touching. In this moment of profound grief, I pray to the Almighty to bestow strength upon you and your family to bear this irreparable loss. May the departed soul rest in peace.” This is perhaps Modi’s first outreach to a Pakistani leader since ties between the two countries hit a low following the terror attack on Pathankot airbase in January 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-writes-to-nawaz-sharif-condoles-his-mother-s-death/story-qY7IaDg5vT6D2ltbXlRY8N.html
18-12-2020||India||Chilly spell in Delhi-NCR intensifies, no relief till Dec 21: IMD||The cold spell in Delhi further intensified on Thursday, as the maximum temperature dropped to 15.2 degrees Celsius, seven degrees below normal, which was exacerbated by fast icy winds blowing through the day, leaving city residents shivering.A departure of seven degrees from normal meant that the India Meteorological Department (IMD) categorised Thursday as a “severe cold day”. This was the fourth consecutive “cold” or “severe cold day”, with weather scientists predicting no relief over the weekend.Minimum temperature of the day was recorded around 8.30am on Thursday — 4.6 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal. This means that the gap between maximum and minimum temperature on Thursday was only around 10 degrees Celsius.Scientists say temperature numbers alone are not able to capture the bitter chill most people are experiencing through the day because the “perception of the temperature” is likely even lower due to the icy cold winds. For example, the “feels like” temperature of Thursday’s minimum temperature is around two-to-three degrees Celsius. “The ‘feels like’ temperature is much lower because of the icy cold winds that are blowing at 15 to 20 kmph. We don’t expect relief from the bitter cold till December 21. A western disturbance is approaching around that time which will not have much impact on the plains. But the relief will be marginal, an increase of only one-to-two degrees Celsius,” explained Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate change and meteorology at Skymet Weather.The ‘feels like’ temperature takes into account wind speeds and humidity to assess how the human body actually feels temperature. “For example in winter a strong wind can feel much colder than the measured temperature would indicate. Conversely on a humid day in summer it can feel uncomfortably hotter than the air temperatures would suggest on their own,” explains the UK Met Office.Many stations in northwest India recorded extremely low minimum temperatures on Thursday — Churu recorded 2.2°C; Bikaner 3.1°C; Mt Abu -1°C; Sikar 0.5°C; Bareilly 3.3°C; Delhi Ridge 3.5°C; Narnaul 2.6°C; Ranichauri -1.4°C; and Gulmarg -11°C. Day temperatures were also unusually low — on Wednesday (maximum temperature data has been tabulated for Wednesday) Jammu recorded 14.4°C; Kathua 10; Keylong 3.3; Dalhousie 1.5; Amritsar 8.2; Bathinda 10; Hisar and Karnal at 15; Churu 16; Ganganagar 13.4.“Icy winds are blowing from the snow-clad mountains towards Delhi now. Around December 15 to 20 climatologically also we see a sharp fall in temperatures as sun rays are falling slightly slanted and not vertical. There is also uplifted fog in some regions over northwest India which is also not allowing the surface to warm up during the day. Overall the icy winds due to heavy snow cover over Himalayas are the primary driver for extremely cold days,” explained Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.IMD had warned on Wednesday that “cold wave” to “severe cold” conditions may have a number of serious impacts on health that shouldn’t be ignored. There is an increased likelihood of various illnesses like flu, stuffy nose or nosebleed, shivering which is a first sign of the body losing heat. Prolonged exposure to extreme cold can cause frostbite, which leads to the skin turns pale, hard and numb and eventually black blisters appear on exposed body parts such as fingers, toes, nose and or earlobes. Severe frostbite needs immediate medical attention and treatment.The impact-based warning issued by IMD for cold wave recommends that people wear insulated shoes, moisturise skin, increase vitamin C intake, limit outdoor activities, maintain ventilation while using heaters, avoid drinking alcohol as it reduces body heat etc.Some of those exposed to dense fog could also suffer health impacts. Dense fog contains particulate matter and other pollutants which can get lodged in the lungs leading to episodes of wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. Those with asthma and bronchitis are particularly vulnerable.According to IMD, a “cold day” or “severe cold day” is considered based on two parameters — a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees Celsius and maximum temperature that is 4.5 degrees Celsius or 6.4 degrees Celsius below normal respectively.A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. Cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degree C in the plains. Witnessing a cold day and cold wave together means the gap between day and night temperatures was lower than normal.“Cold wave to severe cold wave” conditions are very likely in some pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, West Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan during next three days and decrease thereafter according to IMD’s bulletin. “Cold day to severe cold day” conditions are likely in some pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, north Rajasthan and northwest Uttar Pradesh during next two days and decrease thereafter. Dense fog is likely in some pockets over Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram during next three days.“There was heavy and widespread snowfall in the Western Himalayas from December 11 to 13 and then dense fog started being recorded in many places which has led to cold day conditions. Due to extremely chilly winds, we have issued an impact-based warning for the first time which tells people what to do during cold wave and cold day conditions,” added RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chilly-spell-in-delhi-ncr-intensifies-no-relief-till-dec-21-imd/story-OhxknXZvwYkYUNlIeHAaxJ.html
18-12-2020||India||Ahead of PM Modi’s address, AMU faculty calls for unity||The Aligarh  Muslim University (AMU) administration bolstered security and senior faculty members called for unity on Thursday after some campus student groups opposed Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the chief guest of the institution’s centenary celebrations on December 22. On Wednesday, AMU vice chancellor Professor Tariq Mansoor announced that Modi will attend the online function with Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank via video conference on December 22. Extending gratitude to the Prime Minister, Mansoor said that the outreach will help in the growth and development of the institution.Modi will be the first PM to address an AMU event since Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1964. He will be speaking to the university and its members for the first time. The PM is also expected to release a commemorative stamp on AMU’s centenary year during the interaction.  But some groups on campus opposed the announcement, prompting the administration to step up vigilance and senior professors to appeal for calm. “We need to work together in the interest of the university. We appeal to everyone to celebrate the centenary programme above politics…centenary celebrations are to be kept above differences,” read a statement signed by 12 of the senior most faculty members. The university has also taken steps to ensure that the programme is not disrupted, and avert any disturbance on campus.  “It would be an online programme with links issued through NIC (National Information Center) and participants from AMU would be at registrar office,” stated Shafey Kidwai, the public relation officer for AMU. The faculty members requested protesting students to come on board. “We must not lose sight of the fact that the centenary is a great landmark achievement in the history of any university. Our unity on the occasion will bring greater confidence among various university units and alumni associations, who are engaged in organising programmes with illustrious people as the guests,” they wrote.This came after former AMU Students’ Union (AMUSU) vice-president Nadeem Ansari, now a Samajwadi Party leader, opposed invitation to PM Modi. “Vice Chancellor Tariq Mansoor’s vested interest will be served through PM Modi’s participation. If anything goes wrong, the V-C will be responsible,” said Ansari. Other student groups also pointed out that the Centre opposed the university’s minority status appeal in the Supreme Court. The university and its students hit the headlines in recent years for opposing several government moves, including the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).Last year, on December 15, the university turned into a war zone as protesting students clashed with security forces, resulting in several injuries||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-modi-s-address-amu-faculty-calls-for-unity/story-qXdKSW9FZ3ufNFYWZacbHK.html
18-12-2020||India||Lucknow diocese moves HC on Sherwood College control||In a new twist to the controversy over control of Nainital’s famous Sherwood College, the Diocese of Lucknow has moved the Uttarakhand High Court on Thursday stating that it is the real legal guardian of the institute, not the Diocese of Agra. Rakesh Sobti, the legal advisor of Bishop Vijay Mantode, bishop of Church of India, Lucknow Diocese, said: “The Diocese of Agra is trying to take charge of the college illegally by posting an interim principal. They are not the legal guardians of the college. We have now kept our stance in front of the Uttarakhand High Court and our management committee is the only registered committee.” He added that Allahabad High Court in 2010 ordered that the bishop of Church of India is the legal guardian of the management of the College and “this order is valid today also”. The Uttarakhand High Court will hear the matter on Tuesday along with other parties, the Diocese of Agra and current principal of the Sherwood College, Amandeep Sandhu. The storied college’s alumni include actors Amitabh Bachchan, Kabir Bedi,and Ram Kapoor, and legendary soldier Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw . Over the weekend, police were deployed in the college campus after newly appointed interim principal, Peter Emmanuel, went to take charge but was denied entry by college staff. In October, Amandeep Sandhu was suspended by the college’s management over various issues including a pending inquiry into allegations of lapses in statutory compliances; and Emmanuel was appointed as interim principal. Sandhu challenged the appointment in the local court saying the Agra diocese has no powers to remove the principal and only chairman of the college society has appointment powers.The Sherwood Diocesan College Society is run by the Diocese of Agra, (Church of North India) since 1976. Emmanuel was appointed as an interim principal by the chairman of the Sherwood Diocesan College Society.The dispute started in 1976 after the Lucknow diocese was divided into two parts, Lucknow and Agra, with the latter covering western Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The college came under the diocese of Agra, a claim disputed by Lucknow diocese. Speaking about the new controversy, Emmanuel said, “The Diocese of Lucknow was divided in 1976 and since then the Diocese of Agra has been managing the college. It was decided then and all legal procedures have been followed since then. The claim that they are making now is illegal and the court will decide it on Tuesday.”Sandhu, the current principal of Sherwood College said, “We will follow the Hon’ble Court’s orders. All parties have been called for hearing on Tuesday and everyone will present their points to the court; and whoever is declared as the legal chairman of the college, we will hand over the managerial work of the college to them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lucknow-diocese-moves-hc-on-sherwood-college-control/story-K4vUvm0b1cCjFd7U78gNiI.html
18-12-2020||India||Global push: Centre recognises yoga as competitive sport||The government on Thursday offered official recognition to yoga as a competitive sport, preparing the ground for the ancient discipline’s inclusion in national, state and university level championships organised in the country.Yoga sporting leagues on the lines of the Indian Super League, which is the professional football league, may also be introduced as part of an effort to boost yoga’s popularity. The government’s ultimate aim is to push for yogasana to be made a part of the Olympic Games. The ministries of Ayush and sports have worked in collaboration towards making it happen with the aim of spreading awareness about yoga, the benefits it offers and the discipline’s spiritual background among the young. The ministries are also working together to ensure yogasana is recognised as a competitive sport globally.“Now that yogasana has been formally declared a competitive sport by the government, it will be made a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Khelo India initiative that will ensure states will work towards organizing sports events including for yogasana in an organized manner, like it happens for other sports,” said Kiren Rijiju, minister of state for youth affairs and sports.“Yoga has already been popular enough so the next step was to recognize it as a competitive sport. The ultimate goal is to make it a part of the Olympic Games. To begin with, a pilot national-level traditional yogasana championship has been proposed in February next year, and later in the year there is a plan to conduct a World Yogasana championship that India will host,” the sports minister added.India also recently established the National Yogasana Sport Federation of India (NYSFI) for the development of yoga as a competitive sport.Extensive consultations over the past 3-4 years preceded the official recognition of yoga as a competitive sport.“The necessary work on this initiative has been going on for long, and this year in August NYSFI was established for the purpose on the lines of other sports federations active in the country under the ministry of sports. In November this year, the sports ministry also formally recognized the federation,” said Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, secretary, Ayush ministry.Rijiju explained that like other federations, NYSFI will also now be eligible for financial assistance from the sports ministry.“Now that Yogasana has been formally declared a sport, its federation, like other national sports federations, will also get financial assistance from the sports ministry for preparing their annual training and calendar that will have an idea on what all they plan to organize during the coming calendar year. We want to produce quality athletes performing yogasanas,” he said. An exhaustive document containing rules and regulations and syllabus for the yogasana competitions has been prepared by experts in the field. The technical committee has also made a detailed list of asanas, both compulsory and optional, from traditional yoga literature.About 51 medals are being proposed in four events and seven categories for the events to be conducted at sub-junior, junior and senior level for both men and women. The events include traditional yogasana, artistic yogasana, rhythmic yogasana, free flow (group) yogasana, and individual all round championship and team championship.Experts are coming up with an information technology-enabled, automation scoring system for these competitions for marking participants objectively.The government will also be training and certifying coaches, referees, judges and directors of these competitions. The Sports Association of India is trying to recruit such personnel largely from the pool of former and retired sportspersons in India. “Training of athletes is one thing but we will also be training the technical team which is equally important. Sports Authority of India is trying to recruit more retired Indian sportspersons for the purpose of coaching,” said Rijiju.Naik said thatmission was to create athletes, and eventually achieve Olympic success.Dr Ishwar Basavaraddi, director of the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, said: “Yogasana involves rigorous training and the postures are quite elaborate that need to be performed with the right technique. Many people, especially youngsters, are likely to come forward to participate now that it has been officially declared a sport, especially those from villages. It is a good way to promote yogasana.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-push-centre-recognises-yoga-as-competitive-sport/story-EVbG3FhEanyuCwXsNKV1OM.html
18-12-2020||India||‘Soft-spoken, altruistic’ farmers’: Followers pay respects to priest who died by suicide||Baba Ram Singh had barely turned four years old when his parents noticed that their son had the traits of an ascetic. The devout Sikh couple handed over the toddler to Gurudwara Nanaksar, located in Kaleran village of Jagraon in Ludhiana district of Punjab, to pursue the path of spirituality. Gurudwara Nanaksar was his abode for many years. A little before 1990, he left Jagraon to spread the message of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. And his next destination, and permanent abode, became Gurdwara Nanaksar Singhera--a small Sikh shrine then spread across one acre in Karnal, Haryana. On Thursday, shocked admirers and followers of Singh came in droves to Gurdwara Nanaksar Singhera to pay their last respects to the Sikh priest. Singh, 65, died after allegedly shooting himself on Wednesday at the Delhi-Haryana border in Singhu where he had joined the farmers’ protest against three farm laws. He was unmarried and is survived by his sister and a brother, who live in Punjab. The soft-spoken Baba, known for his sense of charity and in-depth knowledge of Sikhism, had a huge following across religions, castes, communities and countries. Singh became head of Gurdwara Nanaksar Singhera in 1990 following the death of his predecessor Baba Jang Singh. He worked relentlessly to expand the shrine and visited many places in India and abroad to encourage people to donate to the gurdwara, said Gupal Singh, a follower from Peont village.His efforts paid off .From the small shrine it was in 1990, the gurdwara is now spread over 16 acres. It has a huge langer (community kitchen) hall with the capacity to serve meals to hundreds of visitors every day. The campus has residential buildings for about 400 sewadars (volunteers) and visitors, a sprawling lawn and parking lot. According to Satnam Singh, who has been with the Sikh priest since 1995, the Baba also set up two gurdwaras in Ulhasnagar of Mumbai and Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. He is credited with the construction of gurdwara also in Jalandhar district of Punjab. “He was very polite and always available to all. We never saw him angry,” recalled Jasvinder Kaur,70, a follower. She said she has been a regular visitor to Gurdwara Nanaksar Singhera for the past 20 years and he also had followers from the Hindu and Muslim communities. A confidant of the Baba, Satnam Singh, said that on December 9, he had visited the protesting farmers for the first time and donated Rs 5 lakh to farmers’ organisations spearheading the agitation. On December 15, he again visited the protest site and donated blankets to farmers. “After returning from Delhi on late night on December 15 he was very upset and told me that the farmers were being forced to spend their nights in open in harsh winter conditions and the government was insensitive to them”, said Satnam Singh. Satnam Singh said on December 16, the Baba again decided to go to the protest site and that his driver Gurpartap Singh and his aide Manjeet accompanied him. “At the dharna spot, Babaji asked his driver to bring tea... when the driver returned he found Babaji dead with a bullet injury on his forehead... but the driver did not find the weapon,” said Satnam Singh, who hails from UP and who is considered the successor to the Baba.“In fact, Sant ji never carried a weapon with himself,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soft-spoken-altruistic-farmers-followers-pay-respects-to-priest-who-died-by-suicide/story-2Iq9yf3bge24TdZE076YfK.html
18-12-2020||India||Widening of Char Dham road: Govt cites China border link||Dehradun: The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has increased the width of the main Char Dham Road to 7 metres by modifying a 2018 regulation, citing its strategic national importance as a link to the India-China border, restoring it to its original width after the Supreme Court ordered that it be reduced it to 5.5 metres. In the modification to the regulation that dealt with highways in hill areas, the ministry said the width of the main carriageway should be 7 metres. In 2018, the ministry reduced the width of the main carriageway of roads in hilly terrain to a maximum of 5.5 metres to reduce the environmental impact of road development.“For roads in hilly and mountainous terrain which act as feeder roads to the Indo-China border or are of strategic importance for national security, the carriageway width should be 7m with 1.5m paved shoulder on either side,” the ministry said in an order issued on Tuesday and made public on Thursday. It added: “The standards prescribed therein have been further reviewed in the Ministry in light of the issues raised by Ministry of Defence.”“We will now be following this new circular with carriageway width of 7 metres. Following these new norms, the total road width would come up to be 10m. Before the Supreme Court’s order in September, the total road width of 10m was being followed,” said VS Khaira, chief engineer at the regional office of MoRTH in Uttarakhand and project in-charge of the Char Dham Road project, He said that through an affidavit filed by the defence ministry in the Supreme Court, the Centre had been able to explain to the court the importance of the road and “we hope that the court will allow us” to build a 10 metre wide road. The Supreme Court in September ruled that the width of the Char Dham highway, an ambitious 900-kilometre project that promises to offer all-weather connectivity to four Hindu pilgrimage centres in Uttarakhand, and the ancillary benefit of facilitating rapid movement of Indian military forces to areas adjoining its border with China, shall not exceed the 5.5 metres specified in 2018 by MoRTH for roads under construction in mountainous terrain.The order came at a time when the Indian Army was locked in a tense military standoff with the People’s Liberation Army of China in the Eastern Ladakh theatre.On December 2, the SC was told by the defence ministry that the court order limiting the width of the Char Dham Road to 5.5 metres posed serious repercussions for the country’s defence preparedness along the border points with China and Nepal.Both the road transport and defence ministries were aggrieved by the SC’s September 8 order mandating that the width be restricted to the 5.5 metres recommended by five members of a 26-member high-powered committee (HPC) headed by Ravi Chopra. The members, part of a faction opposed to the project on environmental grounds, had written to the court on October 5 and November 2 that constant tree felling by the Uttarakhand government was causing landslides along the Char Dham route.The defence ministry, in an affidavit filed in the he Supreme Court on the Char Dham road project, said the national highways from Rishikesh to Mana, Rishikesh to Gangotri and Tanakpur to Pithoragarh were also strategic and feeder roads for the India-China border. These roads are also a part of the Char Dham road project which means their width too can increase. The court asked the HPC to examine the concerns of the two ministries and submit its report within two weeks. The next hearing on the matter is on January 18, 2021.When asked if the new road width would be followed for the whole project, Hemant Dhyani, a member of the faction of the HPC opposed to the project, said: “We have discussed the new circular issued by MoRTH in our recent meeting, but we cannot comment on anything as the matter is subjudice. The HPC will be submitting a report to the Supreme Court within a week’s time.”Environmentalists are opposed to the Central government going ahead with the project in violation of the environment norms and challenged the project in the Supreme Court. The project was separated into 100 parts to escape a comprehensive environmental review by the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee, activists alleged. The government has claimed that it followed all environmental norms.The project is being developed by the Uttarkhand government’s Public Works Department, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), and National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (NHIDCL). The road will provide all- weather connectivity to the Hindu pilgrim centres of Gangotri, Yamnotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/widening-of-char-dham-road-govt-cites-china-border-link/story-8JXEqnYM6L8o2f2AooH5II.html
18-12-2020||India||Sonia Gandhi calls Congress strategy meet tomorrow, dissenters to attend||Congress president Sonia Gandhi has called a meeting of senior leaders, including a few from the group of 23 dissenters, on Saturday to discuss the party’s strategy for the upcoming assembly elections besides the ongoing farmers’ agitation and the government’s decision not to hold the winter session of Parliament, people familiar with the development said. A Congress functionary said the first in-person meeting between the party chief and senior leaders during the Covid-19 pandemic could extend to Sunday as well. Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra are also expected to attend the meeting.Among the dissenters, leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, his deputy Anand Sharma and former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda have been called for the meeting to be held at Sonia Gandhi’s 10, Janpath residence. So far, all party meetings during the pandemic have been held virtually. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has also been invited to the meeting, said to have been called at the insistence of Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath who had met Sonia Gandhi last week and also interacted with some of the dissenters. Another dissenter and former union minister Shashi Tharoor will also meet the Congress president as he had sought an appointment with her to discuss the local bodies elections in Kerala, the functionary quoted above said. He said party leaders from states going to polls early next year had offered their suggestions on potential alliances and other election-related matters to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi over the past few weeks. Rahul Gandhi had told them that he would convey their suggestions and proposals to the Congress president as he cannot take such important decisions, added the functionary. Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal, Puducherry and Assam in March-April next year. Sonia Gandhi returned to Delhi on December 6 after staying in Goa for over a fortnight following doctors’ advice to shift out of the national capital because of heavy pollution and poor air quality that had aggravated a chest infection. In her upcoming meetings, she is expected to discuss the party’s dismal show in the assembly polls in Bihar and by-polls to 58 seats in 11 states apart from the setbacks in the local bodies’ elections in Rajasthan, a state ruled by the Congress, ane Telangana, Goa, Kerala and Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) in Assam. Apart from seeking suggestions on the party’s strategy for the upcoming assembly polls, she will also discuss with her party colleagues the ongoing farmers’ agitation over three new farm laws enacted in September this year and also the government’s decision to skip the winter session of parliament and club it with the budget session that begins at the end of January, the functionary said. A second Congress functionary said Sonia Gandhi was also keen to see an immediate end to the ongoing internal crisis in the party and discuss the steps needed to strengthen the organisation in the wake of a series of electoral setbacks. She wants to bring all the warring leaders together and end the current impasse in the party. “She wants all the leaders to work in close coordination with Rahul Gandhi in strengthening the party,” he said. The second functionary added that the Congress president did not want to isolate the dissenters pushing for an organisational overhaul and internal elections from top to bottom. The group of 23 signatories, also known as G-23, had written to the Congress president in August, seeking a full-time and active leadership and introspection behind the “steady decline” of the 135-year-old organisation while outlining an 11-point action plan. Apart from Azad, Sibal, Sharma, Tharoor and Hooda, the other key signatories included Mukul Wasnik, Jitin Prasada, Manish Tewari and Prithiviraj Chavan. The dissenters reiterated their demand following the party’s poor show in recent elections. However, there has been a visible softening of their stand on both sides after senior leader Ahmed Patel’s death on November 25. The second functionary quoted above said the party’s central election authority (CEA) was in the process of finalising the schedule for the organisational elections. Once that is done, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) will meet to ratify it after which the All India Congress Committee (AICC) session will be held. He said the CEA, mandated under the party constitution to hold the organisational polls, had in its last meeting decided to restrict the electoral college to the AICC members and not include co-opted constituents. It is also in the process of preparing digital identity cards for the AICC members to use them in case the session is held virtually. The functionary said the organisational elections and the AICC session are expected to be held by February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-calls-cong-strategy-meet-tomorrow-dissenters-to-attend/story-wLPctvFQg6WaKDSSeWoqpI.html
18-12-2020||India||India calls for further talks over LAC||New Delhi India on Thursday called for further discussion with China to reach a “mutually acceptable solution” on complete disengagement at all friction points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) against the backdrop of the nearly eight-month-long border standoff between the two nations in the Ladakh sector. The eighth and most recent round of talks between senior military commanders of India and China was held at Chushul along the LAC on November 6, and the two sides haven’t held any discussions since then as they were unable to bridge reported differences on pulling back troops and armoured vehicles from key friction points. “It is our expectation that further discussions will help both sides to achieve an agreement on a mutually acceptable solution for ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western sector and full restoration of peace and tranquillity as early as possible,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. Responding to a question on possible talks with China either between diplomats or military officers, Srivastava said several rounds of discussions held so far had led to a better understanding on both sides. “The two sides continue to maintain communication through diplomatic and military channels. These discussions have helped both sides to enhance understanding of each other’s positions,” he said. India and China recently blamed each other for the situation along the LAC, where tens of thousands of troops from both sides have dug in for the winter. New Delhi has maintained that attempts by Chinese troops to unilaterally alter the status quo on the LAC and violation of several agreements for maintaining peace and tranquillity on the disputed border triggered the standoff. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said on December 9 that China had given “five differing explanations” for deploying thousands of soldiers on the LAC and pushing bilateral ties into their most difficult phase ever. He also said ties were “very significantly damaged” by Beijing’s violation of border agreements. In response to another question regarding media reports that a member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was hired by the Indian consulate in Shanghai through a Chinese state-owned recruitment agency, Srivastava said the ministry wasn’t in a position to independently verify the information. “In certain countries, the hiring of local staff requires the approval of local authorities. However, all our missions and posts ensure due security precautions in this regard,” he added. Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement that such allegations of “CPC infiltration” were groundless and made out of “ideological prejudice”. She added: “The members of the CPC are not ‘monsters’...It is absolutely ridiculous and wantonly smearing to maliciously label CPC members [for] ‘espionage’.” Responding to another question on Indian crew members of cargo vessels stranded at Chinese ports due to the China-Australia trade row, Srivastava said 23 Indian nationals were on board the MV Jag Anand, anchored near Jingtang port in Hebei province since June 13, and another 16 Indian nationals were on board MV Anastasia, anchored near Caofeidian port since September 20. Both vessels were waiting to discharge their cargo. Chinese authorities have said crew change is not permitted at these ports because of Covid-19-related restrictions, and owners of shipping companies and receivers of the cargo were made aware of the delay in unloading the cargo. “The government continues to be in regular touch with Chinese authorities to seek a resolution of these issues at the earliest and to ensure the humanitarian needs of the crew are taken care of,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-calls-for-further-talks-over-lac/story-64R16ztLKl7SCvGrygvLbM.html
18-12-2020||India||In a letter to farmers, Narendra Singh Tomar reiterates assurance on MSP||Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday wrote an impassioned letter to farmers protesting against the three farm reform laws, reiterating his commitment to resolve farmers’ issues and again offering a written assurance that the system of state-set minimum support prices (MSPs) for farm commodities will remain place. In the eight-page letter, Tomar said farmers in most parts of the country were happy with the reforms and that confusion had been created by some political forces as part of a conspiracy to derail the laws enacted in September, appealing to the protestors to call off the agitation.“I belong to a farmer’s family and since childhood, I have experienced the tough life of farmers. It is very satisfactory that after implementation of the laws, MSP procurement has set a new record this time,” Tomar said.Tomar didn’t name anyone, but wrote: “A lie is being spread in the name of MSP and Mandis. The fact is that nothing is going to change.”Farmers, mainly from the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have massed at border entry points to Delhi since November 26 in a massive protest was set off by three laws pushed through by the government in September that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules. Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices. They are also concerned that the government-controlled mandis. or agricultural markets, may be dismantled. Protesters decided to call off further negotiations on December 8, after a meeting with home minister Amit Shah, claiming a stalemate. The agriculture minister wrote that MSPs and the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees that run the mandis will remain in place and the government was ready to offer a written assurance to that effect Tomar alleged that the Congress did not act on recommendations made by a commission headed by agricultural scientist MS Swaminathan t for eight years. “These days, they are working again to create tension. They even questioned our Army and their supreme sacrifice in Leh-Ladakh,” the minister wrote, appealing to the farmers to end the agitation.The farmers’ group spearheading the protest insisted that the laws be withdrawn,“The government (is) repeatedly dishing out old rejected logic. Farmers are ready for talks, but the three Farm Acts and the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 have to be withdrawn,” said Avik Saha of the All India Kisan Coordination Committee.The draft bill has a provision for direct benefit transfer (DBT) of subsidy provided to consumers, particularly to the agriculture and domestic sectors. Opposition leaders say this will work against the interest of farmers and poor domestic consumers, and insisted that the mode of payment should be left to state governments to decide. The bill also aims to ensure a mandatory minimum purchase of power from renewable sources of energy and enforce stringent penal measures for non-compliance with the provisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-letter-to-farmers-tomar-reiterates-assurance-on-msp/story-MLSrylJo2lYvY1EdgkNsrK.html
18-12-2020||India||Ready to help India defend itself, says Israel envoy||New Delhi: Israel won’t be found wanting in meeting India’s requirements to defend itself against all challenges and hostilities though such cooperation is not directed against any other country, Israeli ambassador Ron Malka has said.The normalisation of ties between Israel and key West Asian states such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain presents new opportunities for trilateral cooperation with India in areas such as trade and technology, Malka told HT in an interview. In an effort to boost cooperation with India in water management, an area in which Israel possesses the world’s leading technologies and expertise, the country will soon post a “water attaché” at its embassy in New Delhi and undertake an end-to-end project covering 25 villages in a semi-arid region of Uttar Pradesh focused on conservation, purification, recharging groundwater and irrigation techniques, he said. Responding to a question on whether India had made any emergency requests for defence equipment amid the border standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Malka said: “Since we have a strong friendship, whatever India needs from Israel to defend itself, we are there and available to India because this is how we manage our friendships and especially a precious friendship like with India. But I have to stress that we are not against anyone, we have enough [problems of our own], so we are not against anyone but we are in favour of India...and we also trust India and the bold and strong leadership of India, that India knows how to manage its affairs wisely.” He added, “You don’t need us for that, you just need us to share with you the experience and practices since we share similar challenges and similar hostilities. So of course, there is so much we can share but we are not against anyone but only very strongly in favour of India.” India-Israel defence cooperation has advanced from a buyer-seller relationship to a key strategic partnership, Malka said. “We are working on a regular basis with India, sharing research and development, information and experience,” he said. Referring to the Abraham Accords and Israel’s normalisation of ties with the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco, Malka said this has opened new doors for trilateral cooperation. “Given the fact that Israel and the UAE are defined as key strategic partners of India, those distant partners now form relations...and I understand there is a big opportunity for India.” This atmosphere for normalising relations was reflected in the recent decision by Israel and Bhutan to establish diplomatic relations, he said. “Israel is trying to make as many friends as we can, it is part of our vision and values...There have been bilateral relations between Israel and Bhutan for many, many years, this warm freindhsip matured to the stage that we decided to formalise and start a formal relationship between the nations,” he added.Israel, the UAE and India are all focused on innovation and technology, and each country brings “comparative advantages to the table” and a lot of “added value to each other”. Malka pointed out that the Indo-Israeli Chambers of Commerce had opened an international office in Dubai because of the huge potential in trilateral collaboration, and identified water security, food security and health care as potential areas for cooperation. The three countries will work together “to make each other more self-reliant because if there is one lesson that we learnt from this pandemic, every country should be more self-reliant”, he said. To give fresh impetus to Israel’s efforts aimed at water management in India, Israeli foreign minister Gabi Ashkenazi has cleared a long-standing proposal to post a “water attaché” at the embassy in New Delhi. “We have signed a MoU with Uttar Pradesh for a flagship water project that will bring in Israel’s holistic approach for water and agriculture, we are going to work in a semi-arid area with 25 villages on both sides of the equation – the sources and the uses of water – to make it very efficient,” Malka said. A feasibility study for the project will soon be carried out. “It will be successful because it’s a proven concept in Israel. After we finish that, we can just replicate it in many places,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-help-india-defend-itself-says-isreal-envoy/story-kPsYXGcsW399JfB3cJ7puN.html
18-12-2020||India||India, Bangladesh sign 7 pacts, revive railway line||New Delhi: India and Bangladesh signed seven agreements in areas ranging from hydrocarbons to agriculture at a virtual summit on Thursday, a day after the independence anniversary of the latter, and revived a cross-border railway line that was snapped 55 years ago, giving a boost to connectivity initiatives and energy cooperation, . Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his opening remarks at the summit with his counterpart Sheikh Hasina, described Bangladesh as an important pillar of India’s “neighbourhood first” policy. Both countries, Hasina said, could move up global and regional value chains by further integrating their economies, and connectivity initiatives such as the revival of the Chilahati-Haldibari rail link will be catalysts for this process. Hasina used the summit to raise the sharing of Teesta waters and repatriation of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar – two issues on which Dhaka has repeatedly sought greater cooperation with New Delhi. Hasina highlighted the need for the early signing of an interim agreement for sharing Teesta waters, finalised in 2011, and Modi reiterated “India’s sincere commitment and continued efforts” in this regard, according to a joint statement. The agreement on the Teesta, held up by opposition from West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, has become an irritant in bilateral ties. Pointing to India’s election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2021-22, Hasina “expressed Bangladesh’s expectation to see India assist in the repatriation of the forcibly displaced Rohingyas back to Myanmar”, the joint statement said. Modi appreciated Bangladesh’s generosity in sheltering 1.1 million forcibly displaced people from Myanmar’s Rakhine state and both leaders reiterated the importance of their “safe, speedy and sustainable” return. The seven agreements signed on Thursday cover cooperation in the hydrocarbons sector, agriculture and textiles, high impact community development projects to be carried out by India, trans-border elephant conservation, supply of equipment for improving garbage disposal in Bangladesh’s Barishal city, and creation of a CEOs Forum. The agreement on hydrocarbons will help streamline investments, technology transfers and joint studies and promote hydrocarbon connectivity. The two countries agreed to strengthen sub-regional energy cooperation, especially with Nepal and Bhutan, and speed up work on the 130-km India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline. Both leaders directed officials to speedily conclude a joint study on a comprehensive bilateral economic partnership agreement. Modi began his remarks by greeting Hasina in Bengali on the occasion of Bijoy Dibosh or Victory Day, which marks the surrender of Pakistani forces in Dhaka on December 16, 1971. Hasina, who spoke in Bengali, responded by saying December 17 was a special day for her and her family as it was on that day in 1971 when Major Ashok Tara of the Indian Army freed her, her mother, sister and brother from Pakistani forces. “Bangladesh was freed on December 16, but we were freed on December 17,” she said, paying tribute to three million Bangladeshi martyrs of the war of independence and Indian military personnel killed in action and their families. Tara, then aged 29, had won the Vir Chakra in the battle of Gangasagar when he was assigned the responsibility of freeing the wife and family of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh. Tara completed the task with only three more Indian soldiers despite having to take on a numerically superior Pakistani contingent. Modi said strengthening ties with Bangladesh has been of special importance to him since his first day in office, and expressed satisfaction at bilateral cooperation amid the Covid-19 pandemic, including the supply of medicines and equipment. Modi assured Hasina vaccines will be made available to Bangladesh as and when they are produced in India, and also offered a partnership in vaccine production. Hasina referred to several new initiatives, such as trade through rail routes and the first trial run of Indian cargo from Kolkata to northeast India by ship, and said: “We happily recognise the growing dependency of the economies of Bangladesh and India. “A good number of Indian nationals are employed in the manufacturing and service sectors of Bangladesh, and are remittance earners for India. On the other hand, India receives the highest number of tourists and medical patients from Bangladesh.” The two leaders virtually inaugurated the revived rail link, which was snapped during the 1965 war with Pakistan and will connect Assam to Bangladesh via West Bengal, launched a stamp on Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman, and inaugurated a digital exhibition of Rahman and Mahatma Gandhi focusing on their contributions to the independence movements of the two countries. The joint statement said the filming of a biopic on Rahman, being directed by Shyam Benegal, will begin in January. The two sides also discussed key issues such as terrorism and border management, including Bangladesh’s concerns about the death of its nationals in incidents along the frontier. “Recognising that terrorism remains a threat to global peace and security, both sides reiterated their strong commitment to eliminating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” the joint statement said. Modi and Hasina agreed to complete border fencing in all pending sectors of the border at the earliest, beginning from the Tripura sector. “Both leaders also agreed that loss of civilian lives at the border is a matter of concern and directed the border forces concerned to enhance coordinated measures to work towards bringing such border incidents to zero,” it added.The Bangladesh side sought the early implementation of India’s commitment to remove remaining restrictions on use of land ports by Bangladeshi travellers in a phased manner, beginning with checkpoints in Tripura and West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bangladesh-sign-7-pacts-revive-railway-line/story-sVN6uVKCr6brQUDRuS1gMI.html
18-12-2020||India||Row over Rahul Gandhi’s walkout from House panel meeting escalates||A political row between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress escalated on Thursday over Rahul Gandhi’s walkout from a meeting of Parliament’s standing committee on defence in protest on Wednesday, with Union minister Prakash Javadekar saying Gandhi had insulted constitutional institutions even as the former Congress president wrote to Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla to allow MPs to speak freely.In his letter to Birla, Gandhi said he was “not allowed to speak freely” and sought the speaker’s intervention in protecting the rights of elected members, people familiar with the development said. Gandhi, according to a Congress leader, gave a blow-by-blow account of the proceedings and also the circumstances that prompted him and other party colleagues to walk out of the meeting. Javadekar said Gandhi has remained mostly absent from the committee’s meetings in the past, and that the proceedings of the parliamentary panels are not for delivering speeches or staging political protests. “He has attended only two out of the 14 meetings in the last one-and-a-half years and did not disclose his desired agenda for discussion as he was absent in the meeting to finalise the agenda,” he said in a media briefing. “Rahul Gandhi remains absent and then blames the government and all procedures,” the minister added. “He himself is not attending the meetings and conveying desired agenda, and then making imputation of not discussing important issues is an insult to all parliamentary procedures and constitutional institutions,” Javadekar said, pointing out that such meetings are meant to be confidential.Gandhi, a Lok Sabha member from Wayanad in Kerala, said he was “repeatedly prevented” from speaking by panel chairman Jual Oram. “It is the right of a member to point out digressions from the agenda and the purpose of the standing committee. The committee is free to disagree with what I say, but the fact that the chairman does not even permit a member to speak is a sad comment on how the government handles military affairs,” the Congress cited above leader quoted Gandhi as having said in the letter. Gandhi urged the speaker to protect the rights of elected members to speak freely in parliamentary panel meetings and ensure that the discussions and presentations in the panel on defence are in consonance with its role and objectives. Gandhi and two other members of his party – Rajeev Satav and Anumula Revanth Reddy – had walked out of the meeting on Wednesday, alleging that the panel’s time was being wasted in discussing armed forces’ uniform instead of the crucial issue of national security. The Congress leader said that Gandhi also expressed surprise in the letter that the panel chose to discuss “uniforms in the current military situation”, and claimed that he had given in writing that discussion should be held on India’s strategy against China’s aggressive posture; response to China’s reusable autonomous armed drones; and the agreement on the purchase of Rafale aircraft, among other issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-rahul-walkout-from-house-panel-meeting-escalates/story-WUE1hYyDnnnSaXlo5LVYzH.html
18-12-2020||India||Able to find time for ‘actor’s riyaz’: Anupriya||Anupriya Goenka had a scary start to the lockdown. She was shooting for the sequel of digital show ‘Criminal Justice’ when shooting was stopped. “The shoot halted on March 15, so I wanted to quarantine for two weeks before I went to see my parents who live in Thane, while I stay in Versova. I did not want to come in contact with them for some days. And then, the lockdown began,” the Kanpurite said.It was a tough phase for her as she was not keeping well. “I was having breathlessness, bodyache and all. Now, I realise it was just over-exertion. But then, I did not know what to do as there was so much news of the virus around. When I spoke to a few doctors, they said I should wait and watch. I did what best I could do like steam-inhalation, washing hands and quarantining myself. It was a difficult time with a bit of fear but it passed,” said the ‘Padmaavat’ and ‘Airlift’ actor.She is not stepping out of her house at all and is managing well with her house-help. “I had a lot of pending paperwork to finish from the time when I was pursuing my father’s business in Delhi and Kanpur. I wrapped up his business when I was still in college. Then I de-cluttered my own papers,” she said.The UPite has shot for Prakash Jha’s series ‘Ashram’ in Ayodhya. “The series is complete and in post-production. I have shot for the film ‘Mere Desh Ki Dharti’ with Divendu Sharma and some little work is left in it. We were in the last schedule of ‘Criminal’ and I hope after shootings start once again, this will be the first thing we do. Besides, there were three-four projects which were supposed to start in April, others in May-June,” she said.Her film ‘War’ released in February, which was followed by the OTT series ‘Asur’. “I am happy both the projects did very well. After doing good business in theatre ‘War’ did great in the digital space too,” she said.These days, Anupriya is doing an ‘actor’s riyaz’ which she was not able to on normal days., “I have been reading books on acting, watching ‘master-classes’, working on some accents and am also practising voice modulation. All these are an actor’s ‘riyaz’ that I always wanted to do and was not able to find time. I wanted to pick up painting which I have not been able to yet, but will do some sketching soon,” she promised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/able-to-find-time-for-actor-s-riyaz-anupriya/story-Mt2fxVZMmrRsz321PVx5vN.html
18-12-2020||Editorials||The Delhi-Dhaka bond | HT Editorial||India’s relationship with Bangladesh is arguably its most consequential relationship in the region. The 49th anniversary of diplomatic relations and the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is an opportune time to recognise how far bilateral relations have progressed. Once derided as a basketcase, Bangladesh is now the fastest growing economy in South Asia; it surpasses India on many development indicators; and it has overtaken Pakistan’s economy. Sustaining relations with Bangladesh — which saw a turnaround of sorts under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sheikh Hasina — has been an important element of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “neighbourhood first” policy too.Much of what is going on today between the two countries, including the results of Friday’s virtual summit, has been about converting goodwill into tangible economic links and steadfast political relations. The two countries are now reconnecting by rail, road and water in the way they were prior to 1965. Conduits for trade and investment keep improving as the two agree to more infrastructure and less red tape. Ms Hasina’s government has provided a model of security cooperation. India should involve Bangladesh more in its global initiatives such as Covid-19 and climate. Both countries should take some time to consider how to reconcile their domestic political narratives. For example, immigration concerns would be best managed through an agreement that accepts the reality of circular migration. Indian visions of Bangladeshi hordes need to be replaced with a realisation that migrants cross in both directions. Dhaka, in turn, needs to be more honest about localised discrimination of minorities and the outward migration this has engendered. Differences over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act arise from such incomplete viewpoints. New Delhi has concerns about the Hasina government’s policy of allying with Islamist groups to counterbalance other such groups. This may be politically useful, but all such groups are cut from the same anti-Indian cloth and share a desire to make Bangladesh a theological state. Beijing will continue to expand its influence but as long as Dhaka does not cross security redlines and keeps Delhi in the loop, the China factor can be managed. If these larger meta-issues can be addressed over the coming years, in part though domestic debate, the two countries can be assured of another half-century of improving relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-delhi-dhaka-bond-ht-editorial/story-pVlB1Yhp0J9DAHA2xyzWXJ.html
18-12-2020||Editorials||The good news on Covid-19 | HT Editorial||In the past week, India has reported 27,672 new infections of the coronavirus disease a day on average. When the Covid-19 wave was at its peak in the country in mid-September, this number was 93,617 cases a day. This is a 70% drop in cases in three months, and it takes the Covid outbreak in India back to levels that were last seen in mid-July. While the Indian wave has been receding since mid-September, even as recently as October and November, there were regions such as Delhi, Kerala, West Bengal and Rajasthan that were still defying the larger trend and reporting rising cases. This is not true anymore. This is the first time numbers are receding in every major state in the country. It gets even better in terms of testing. In the past week, 2.9% of all samples tested in India have come back positive for Covid-19 — the lowest this number (known as the positivity rate) has ever touched since the government started releasing testing figures. India’s dropping positivity rate tells us two things — first, the testing strategy currently being enforced is adequate; second, the rate of spread of the virus in the community is being brought under control. According to the World Health Organization, if the positivity rate remains 5% or below for two weeks, a region can be said to be keeping its outbreak under control and is testing adequately. India’s positivity rate has been below this threshold for 24 days now. India’s Covid-19 numbers have clearly taken a turn for the better. But the government, and the people, can’t get carried away. Trends in Europe and the United States must serve as a strong reminder of how the situation can quickly go out of control even if the first peak is contained. And each subsequent wave abroad has been stronger than the one preceding it. So if that holds true for India, and if a second wave hits, it may be devastatingly strong, especially given the fierceness of the first wave. While the Union government has said it has started preparations to start a vaccination programme to cover close to 300 million people by the middle of next year, this is work in progress and others will remain vulnerable. India has done well but must not let down its guard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-good-news-on-covid-19-ht-editorial/story-DsGxyIukS3WEIqO36ThlVO.html
