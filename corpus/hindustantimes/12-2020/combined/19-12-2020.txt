Representatives of other countries witness the proceedings from a seating enclosure at a slight distance.The usual practice at the UN is for delegates, even if they are senior dignitaries, to read from prepared texts with copies of their statements, provided in advance, distributed by UN staff to the assembled delegates. At the UNSC, the rule was to distribute copies to everyone in the seating enclosure but only to the main delegates at the horseshoe table and not to the four seated behind.The presidency of the UNSC rotates alphabetically every month. In 2011, when India joined the UNSC, Brazil, which was already on the council, assumed the presidency in February and organised a high-level debate on the interdependence between security and development. Given our partnership with Brazil across global forums, including India, Brazil, South Africa (IBSA), Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS), G4, and the fact that we were coming on to the UNSC after a gap of 19 years, it was natural that external affairs minister, SM Krishna, led the Indian delegation at this high-level debate. The four back seats were occupied by our Permanent Representative, the additional secretary dealing with the UN in the ministry of external affairs (MEA), the minister’s adviser (a political appointee) and the Security Council political coordinator in India’s Permanent Mission to the UN. This writer, who was Deputy Permanent Representative, the MEA joint secretary dealing with the UN and the minister’s private secretary were outside the UNSC chamber, in a lobby area equipped with TV screens to enable witnessing of the UNSC proceedings.The Brazilian foreign minister opened the debate and was followed by the UN Secretary-General, who felt it expedient to attend that meeting of the UNSC. They were followed by the foreign minister of Portugal, which was elected to the UNSC at the same time as India. In a most unusual act, the foreign minister declared his prepared (and distributed) text as having been read and proceeded to make impromptu remarks. Thus, the content of his formal statement was unknown to us outside or to our four delegates in the back rows of the horseshoe table.And then, Krishna was called upon to deliver his statement. He began by recognising the UN Secretary General. I was surprised but happy as we had not included the UNSG in the typed salutations. Krishna then appreciated the presence of two Portuguese-speaking nations on the Council. This astonished me as again it was not in our prepared text but one thought that he had heard this from the Brazilian and Portuguese foreign ministers and though it diplomatically apt to mention this. His third sentence was about Timor-Leste. The penny dropped. There was something badly amiss. I ran into the UNSC chamber to our Permanent Representative, who stood up, saw the minister holding the Portuguese text while his own speech folder lay unopened and stopped him from proceeding further. The minister was, however, caught on the UN TV camera asking whether he should start his speech again from the salutations! The rest, as they say, is history — the Portuguese speech was front page news in India the next day.India will re-enter the UNSC in January 2021. But the Indian delegation need not worry about reading another’s speech as our political coordinator, who now heads the UN vertical in MEA, forced a rule change — copies of statements are now also distributed to the four in the back row.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-sm-krishna-slipped-up-at-unsc/story-vCKLs1nSnA6ApDcG9S3VnO.html

Some of his body parts were found in two plastic bags along the railway tracks at Matheran on Wednesday and the police arrested the accused couple – Charles Nadar, 41, and Saloni Nadar, 31, on Thursday.Initially, the Nadars had told police that Sarnaik said something objectionable about Saloni while drinking alcohol and that led to a fight between them, following which Charles attacked Sarnaik with a knife.Anil Gherdikar, deputy superintendent of police, said, “The couple had actually told us a cooked-up story. Sarnaik and Saloni had worked in a BPO around a decade ago, but they were not in touch after that. A few weeks ago, they met online and started talking. On December 5, Sarnaik came to the Nadars’ place and left after two days.”“The Nadars then planned the murder to procure some money from Sarnaik and his bank, and invited him to their place again on December 12. That night, they offered him alcohol and also drugged him with some sedative. When Sarnaik was semi-conscious, the Nadars unlocked his phone using his fingerprint and changed the PIN of his debit card. That night, at around 1am, they allegedly killed him with a knife and also severed his head and one of his hands,” he said.Charles is an asthma patient and could not cut the whole body that night. On December 13, he threw the severed head and the hand and withdrew ₹80,000 from Sarnaik’s account in Badlapur. He then purchased a cutter machine for ₹2,000 and returned home.“That day, the Nadars cut the two legs and the other hand of the body, threw those and then went to stay in a resort. On December, 14, they returned with two plastic bags and cut and dumped the rest of the body in the next two days. They then went to a friends’ place at Mira Road,” he said.The police had spotted Charles in the CCTV footage while purchasing the plastic bag. But their rented flat was locked. “A local auto driver informed us that the Nadars keep going to a friend’s place at Mira Road. He had dropped them there a couple of times. Our officials then reached that place in his auto and nabbed the Nadars below the friend’s building,” Gherdikar said. “The Nadars purchased gold worth ₹26,000 using Sarnaik’s debit card. They were also planning to get a pre-approved loan (available only for bank employees) of around ₹4 lakh from Sarnaik’s bank using his phone. However, we nabbed them before they could execute it. We have recovered ₹28,000 in cash from them,” he added.Charles and Saloni got married in 2018 and they have a daughter. Charles’ father was a physician in South Africa and he studied there till Class 12. He ran a small BPO of his own in Virar till a few years ago.“Since he was an asthma patient, he wanted to spend some time in the good climate at Neral and that’s why they had rented a house here one-and-a-half years ago. We have not found any criminal record of them so far,” Gheridkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/banker-murdered-for-money-says-neral-police/story-ZFv8nonTbm5UnuUgKJOQiP.html
19-12-2020||Mumbai||With business hit, hotels in Mumbai woo local patrons with staycation offers||Pravin Jain (name changed), a Parel resident and an information technology professional, went on holiday last month with his family — only instead of a vacation, it was a four-day staycation at a five-star hotel in south Mumbai. “We wanted to take a break as we were exhausted from being in the same environment for the past eight months. We desperately needed to get out, but travelling long distance was out of the question,” said Jain. When Jain discovered the five-star hotel that usually charged approximately Rs 15,000 per night was available for Rs 7,000 per night, he decided this would be their family holiday. With international and outstation guests slowing down to a trickle due to the pandemic and lockdown, hotels across Mumbai are wooing local residents with various offers, including slashed room tariffs, food festivals, and customised menus.Take, for example, Hotel Radisson in Andheri, which is giving a discount of 30% on all bookings. Discounted rates like these are making staycations popular among Mumbaiites, said experts. “Professionals can carry out their routine work in a plush, changed environment and the hotels are doing everything to facilitate this. In addition, women who are tired of working hard during the lockdown, especially due to the absence of domestic help, can get some relaxation from their routines. After their online classes, children can also indulge in various activities [in the hotel],” said Gulam Zia, executive director (hospitality) at the consultancy firm, Knight Frank.In Lower Parel, the five-star hotel St Regis Mumbai has been organising weekend events like regional Indian food festivals, games and champagne tasting sessions for their guests. “We have tweaked our menu and are seeing an increase in Indian vegetarian and oriental food due to the demand from our guests,” said Nicholas Dumbell, general manager, St Regis Hotels and Resorts. A popular feature during the pandemic has been the hotel’s special butler service, which ensures guests are in touch with one person instead of multiple hotel staff from various departments.Interglobe Hotels, which runs properties like Hotel Ibis in Vile Parle and Navi Mumbai, has been organising activities like live music gigs and wine promotions. “After the lockdown and with gradual reopening, we understand that people needed to break the monotony of working from home and relax. Hence, we have introduced customised and attractive F&B [food and beverage] offerings,” said Shwetank Singh, vice president (development and asset management), Interglobe Hotels. At JW Marriott in Sahar, guests are offered activities like zumba workshops and pizza-making sessions. The hotel is also allowing early check-ins (before 12 noon) and late check-outs (after 2pm). Nikita Gonsalves, director of sales and marketing for the hotel, said the hotel had also received a good response to its social media campaign. “Our campaign emphasised that we are taking all the precautions to ensure a safe environment at our hotel, which worked very well and attracted many guests,” said Gonsalves.Hospitality experts said the staycation crowd is an important clientele for hotels right now. “Since business travellers are few, we are seeing hotels offering rates at unheard of prices with many reducing [tariffs] by more than half to attract domestic travellers. This is just covering the running cost of these establishments and none of them are making any profits,” said Zia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/with-business-hit-hotels-in-mumbai-woo-local-patrons-with-staycation-offers/story-XEXaCDym1yqpGAZamIivCP.html

The figure is the highest in any fortnight achieved so far ever since the home isolation facility for asymptomatic patients was allowed by the state government in July, according to data of the district health department. The official records also indicate that 10,381 patients so far opted for home isolation till December 18, and 9,602 of them were discharged. The discharge rate is about 92.49%. The health department data indicated that there were an average of 1,370 active cases during the first fortnight in December and an average of 654 of these patients were allowed home isolation. During the previous fortnight from November 16 to November 30, the district had an average of about 1,335 active cases and an average of 561 of these were eligible for home isolation with a share of 42.03%. The experts said the records indicate that the district has more of asymptomatic patients. “The higher percentage of Covid-19 positive patients in home isolation indicates that they were asymptomatic patients and the number of such patients has increased. The figures also indicate that the severity of infection has also decreased,” said Dr Ashish Agrawal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “The trend so far is encouraging as we were expecting major spike in winter season, but cases have not increased much. Still, there is need to keep monitoring the situation each day,” he added. During the period November 1 to November 15, the district had an average of 1,281 active cases with an average of 575 patients in home isolation at a share of about 44.8%, the data showed. Similarly, from October 16 to October 31, the district had an average of 1,153 active cases with an average of 542 patients in home isolation which is a share of about 47%. This is the second highest share ever since the home isolation was introduced. “Our teams carefully scan patients before allowing them for home isolation. The trend is encouraging and we are still monitoring every home isolation patient through our Covid control room, besides initial monitoring by the rapid response teams,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad. “Since, there are more patients in home isolation and our active cases have also fallen below 1,000, we have sufficient availability of beds in the district,” he added. The officials said that with the overall discharge rate of 95.77% as per the state control room figures on December 18, the occupancy of beds in both the government and private hospitals has come down. They further said that 394 patients were active in home isolation on December 18, while another set of 460 patients were in healthcare facilities. These include 72 patients in government hospitals and 388 in private hospitals. The district at present has 1,264 Covid beds in the private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-at-48-number-of-patients-in-home-isolation-highest-in-first-15-days-of-december/story-aYxJWl372JmT1ejez8QEoJ.html
19-12-2020||Mumbai||Reopen varsities in phased manner: Students to Maharashtra government||Even as colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai (MU) are currently busy conducting their first-semester exams online, different student groups have demanded that the state government take immediate steps to reopen colleges and universities in a phased manner. In their demand, student groups mentioned the need for practical classes for several subjects which cannot be conducted online, leaving students at a loss during exams. “First-semester classes across colleges were conducted virtually where the focus was mainly on theory. However, a host of subjects in arts, sciences as well as other streams require practical classes to understand concepts better, which has been missing from the curriculum,” said Siddharth Ingle, president of Maharashtra Students’ Union (MASU). He added that MASU and other student groups have already raised this issue with local authorities and now hope for the state education minister to take a stand. “The state has allowed temples and churches to open to public but schools and colleges still remain shut. The government should take steps and form guidelines to ensure safe reopening of colleges for the benefit of students,” added Ingle. His group has also demanded that the state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant take a stand on the status of fees being charged by colleges, especially when lectures have only been conducted virtually this entire semester. In November this year, the state government decided to bring back students from Class 9 to Class 12 back to schools and colleges in batches so as focus on conducting practical lectures for them. However, in view of the increasing cases of Covid-19, the government asked educational institutes to remain shut till December 31 for students of other classes.At present, many schools across the state, barring Mumbai and Thane, have already started bringing students of Class 9 to Class 12 back to the campus after ensuring that teachers undergo Covid-19 tests and students, too, get consent forms signed by their parents before coming back to school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/reopen-varsities-in-phased-manner-students-to-maharashtra-government/story-hNvrzi1GytkB926atSruCK.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||15 minutes at a tea stall saves life of 21-year-old from Vishnu Garden roof collapse||For 21-year-old Rizwan Shah, whose mother was among the four killed in the factory roof collapse in Vishnu Garden, it was the 15-minute delay in reaching the factory, stopping at a nearby stall for a cup of tea, that saved his life.“I usually used to start work at 9.15am. On Saturday, however, I was late by 15 minutes as I had not been feeling well for the past two-three days. I had stopped at a stall for tea when people came running out of the lane, screaming about an earthquake. Soon, more people came and said our factory had collapsed. I rushed to check on my mother and called out her name, but she did not respond. There was dust all around and nothing was visible,” said Rizwan, who is from Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh.Rizwan is among the seven who worked on the mezzanine floor of the motor stamping factory in RZ-block of Vishnu Garden where the mishap took place around 9.30am on Saturday. Four people were killed while two were injured – one critically – in the mishap. Rizwan’s 45-year-old mother Guddi (single name) was among the four dead. The other three deceased were identified as China Devi, 36, Twinkle, 25, and Ramesh, 35. The two injured are Ravi, 20, and Guddu Kumar, 18.According to Rizwan, when the roof of a loft constructed on the ground floor, by laying red stones upon iron angles, collapsed and fell on the six people working inside, nearly a dozen workers who were working on the first floor of the building rushed out, puzzled as to what had happened and what to do next.“It took us two-three minutes to understand that the loft’s roof had collapsed and the raw as well as manufactured iron materials kept in the nearly 100 plastic sacks and stored on the roof had fallen on my mother and five other workers. Some locals joined us in the rescue operation. It took us almost half an hour to rescue my mother and the other trapped workers, despite 20 of us working together,” said Rizwan, adding that the left side of his mother’s face was totally crushed.Guddi lived with her husband, Mumtaz Shah, son Rizwan, his wife and three children in a rented home in Khyala, nearly half a kilometre away from the factory, where she had been working there for the past nine years.Waiting for his wife’s body at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital mortuary after autopsy, Mumtaz said his family had migrated to Delhi in search of livelihood.“Despite factories being closed during the lockdown, we stayed in Delhi and survived the entire lockdown on free meals distributed in our neighbourhood. We belong to a poor family and there is no work back home. But after losing my wife, I am considering returning to my village,” said Mumtaz.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/15-minutes-at-a-tea-stall-saves-life-of-21-year-old-from-vishnu-garden-roof-collapse/story-WpFlLDreSOZztkkDb1lv9O.html

19-12-2020||City||JNU allows differently-abled PhD students of science cadre to return to campus||New Delhi: As part of its phase-wise reopening, the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Saturday allowed PhD scholars from the People with Disabilities category of Science schools and centres to return to campus from December 21. The university administration, in a circular, said that both day scholars and hostellers from this category requiring access to laboratories will be allowed to return to campus. In October, the university had initiated phase-wise reopening for final-year PhD students from Science courses beginning November 2. Like previous circulars on the matter, the varsity administration on Saturday reiterated that JNU’s central library, canteens and dhabas will remain closed for now.Upon their return to Delhi, outstation students will have to undergo a seven-day self-quarantine before entering the campus. They have also been asked to submit a self-declaration form on the matter. Students have also been advised to install the Aarogya Setu app on compatible mobile phones and update their health status on it. They have also been asked to wear masks and gloves while working in the laboratory.The JNU students’ union has, however, opposed the move and will hold a demonstration on the campus on Monday demanding the return of students from non-science backgrounds as well. They have also been demanding the reopening of the varsity library and dhabas, along with mess facilities for all hostellers.JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said the university took the decision consulting the university coronavirus (Covid-19) monitoring committee and based on guidelines of the ministry of home affairs. “We are concerned about the safety and security of students, if they come in large numbers. We can allow more students to come into the university once the Covid-19 situation improves,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jnu-allows-differently-abled-phd-students-of-science-cadre-to-return-to-campus/story-Ym1axtVcIpvEENdPysYXaL.html

From studying at the public school in her village in primary to attending classes at one of the premier institutes of the state, Charul has come a long way.Born as the second oldest among five siblings to farmer parents, Charul is adamant on changing the health conditions in her village – Kiratpur in Uttar Pradesh’s Bijnore district.“I became involved with Vidyagan after fifth standard and that was a life changing moment for me. I lived at the residential school but every time I went home, I would realise that healthcare services in my village were not up to the mark and a lot needed to be done. That is when I decided that I wanted to become a doctor,” said the teenager.Vidyagyan is a co-ed school established by HCL group’s Shiv Nadar foundation, offering free education to meritorious underprivileged students in Uttar Pradesh. Children whose family’s annual income is less than Rs 1 lakh are admitted to this residential school, where they are imparted free education from class six till 12. The school is located in Dulhera village in Bulandshahr district, around 28 kilometres from Greater Noida’s Pari Chowk.A music enthusiast, Charul is also a closet Hindi poet.“After my 12 exams last year (in which she secured 93%), I decided to take a year off and prepare for my medical exams. I obtained a scholarship to a training institute in Pune where I spent the last year preparing, before taking my NEET-UG exams in September. I was nervous but when my result was declared in October, I was beyond ecstatic. My family was very proud of me, when I got selected at the AIIMS, Delhi,” said Charul.She feels that with this achievement, she will be able to set a good example for her two younger brothers and sister.“I have to be responsible for guiding them in the future and now I can do that. I can eventually help in the medical field and give back to the society,” she said, though she has yet to decide on her doctoral field.She said she is thankful to her parents for their strength and belief in her. Her father is a graduate and continues to work as a farmer to take care of the family of seven.Because of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, she is currently taking online classes while staying at home, though she has been facing some challenges with internet connectivity issues in her village, making it difficult to undertake all lessons. She is excited, however, to start actual classes at the AIIMS campus whenever the opportunity arises.Sudeeksha Bhati, a tea seller’s daughter from Dadri, who was the district topper in 2018 and was granted a scholarship to USA’s Babson college, was also a Vidyagyan student. Sudeeksha died in an accident in August this year in Bulandshahr.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmer-s-daughter-from-up-village-cracks-neet-gets-selected-to-aiims/story-84HvZkaSYeNo5z6HY4WcAL.html
19-12-2020||Noida||14 people injured as truck hits bus on Yamuna Expressway||Noida: At least 14 people were injured when a UP Roadways bus carrying about 45 passengers was hit by a speeding truck on the Yamuna Expressway in Dankaur, Greater Noida, on Friday night. The police said that the incident took place around 11.30pm when the truck lost balance, hit the divider, and rammed into the bus on the other side of the carriageway. The state-run bus belonging to Shikohabad depot was going to Delhi via Agra from Lucknow, the police said, adding that the truck was going to Jewar from Greater Noida. Anil Kumar Pandey, station house officer (SHO), Dankaur police station, said that the accident took place at about 13km from the zero point in Greater Noida.“It appears that the truck driver dozed off behind the wheel and lost balance of the vehicle. The truck hit the divider first before crashing into the roadways bus on the other side,” the SHO said.The truck driver and his helper were also injured in the accident, police officials said.The bus passengers informed the police, and teams from Dankaur police station and Yamuna Expressway patrol reached the spot and rescued the victims, the officials said. Pandey said that five of the 14 victims had received serious injuries. Some of the injured were identified as Shyam, Deenanath, Vickey, Akash, Raj Kumari, Yogesh Kumar, Anil Kumar, Laxmikant, Raju, Dharmendra Kumar, and Rampal. The victims have been admitted to a private hospital in Greater Noida.The accident led to a traffic jam on the expressway for about half an hour, the officials said. However, the police personnel placed barricades and signalled other vehicles to stop to avoid a pile up. The police team later removed the two damaged vehicles from the spot and cleared the road.According to the police, the passengers, who escaped unhurt, boarded other buses and left the spot while some others were picked up by their friends and relatives from the accident spot. Pandey said that the police have not received any complaint in this regard. Last week, the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority had directed for reducing the speed limit on the Yamuna Expressway to 75 kmph from 100 kmph in view of foggy weather conditions.

19-12-2020||Noida||Cold wave persists, Noida temperature falls by three degrees||Noida: Cold wave weather conditions continued in Noida and neighbouring areas on Saturday, as the mercury fell by at least three degrees over the past 24 hours. According to weather analysts, cold wave conditions will continue on Sunday, and return from Tuesday December 22 again after a short breather on Monday. On Saturday, the minimum temperature for Noida was recorded at 5.1 degrees Celsius against 8.1 degrees a day earlier. The maximum temperature was recorded at 21 degrees, same as a day earlier, said officials at the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Meanwhile, the minimum temperature for the national Capital region, based on the Safdarjung observatory, was 3.9 degrees Celsius, four degrees below the season’s average, against 4.6 degrees a day earlier.“Icy cold winds will continue their effect on the region towards Sunday as well, with the minimum temperature likely to hover around 5 degrees Celsius and the maximum around 22 degrees Celsius, respectively,” said an official from IMD. Experts said that the mercury will, however, rise by two to three degrees on Monday, briefly pulling the region out of the cold wave situation. “There is a western disturbance expected to cause light snowfall or drizzle over the Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. The western disturbance will create an induced cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan, leading to a change in the wind directions over the NCR from icy-cold north-westerly to easterly and south-easterly on Monday. The change in winds will lead to a rise in mercury,” said Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecasting agency Skymet. He added that the change in wind directions will be short lived as they will revert to the icy-cold north-westerly winds coming from Himalayan states, leading to drop in the mercury. “The wind directions will revert to north-westerly from Tuesday, which may lead to another series of cold-wave from Tuesday, December 22, or Wednesday onwards,” said Palawat. Meanwhile, the air quality of Noida entered the “very poor” category on Saturday, while Greater Noida and Ghaziabad were under “poor” category. Noida has been oscillating between the “moderate” and “poor” category since December 14. According to the central pollution control board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, on Saturday was 301 or “very poor” against 288 or “poor” a day earlier. Greater Noida’s air quality was 292 against 297 a day earlier, both “poor”. The AQI of Ghaziabad improved from 304 or “very poor” a day earlier to 295 or “poor” on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/cold-wave-persists-noida-temperature-falls-by-three-degrees/story-EkjT7JrYjHjrg545kr7NML.html
19-12-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad plans ropeway system for local commute, feeder to metro stations||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has planned to develop aerial “urban passenger ropeway” links, which will provide better short-distance mode of commute and also serve as feeders for the metro system in the city. Authority officials said that on Friday, they floated an expression of interest (EOI) for the preparation of a techno-feasibility study and a detailed project report (DPR) for the project. At present, the city has two metro links, which connect commuters from Vaishali to Anand Vihar and Dilshad Garden to New Bus Adda (Shaheed Sthal). The authority, in its EOI, has specified three routes – New Bus Adda to Ghaziabad railway station, Mohan Nagar to Vaishali, and Electronic City to Vaishali – for the ropeway project. “During a recent meeting, the chief minister directed for finding alternate modes for local commute. So, we decided to go for the ropeway system and the cost per kilometre is estimated to be about Rs 35-70 crore. The EOI has been floated and once the DPR is prepared, it will be sent to the state government,” said Kanchan Verma, the vice-chairperson of the authority. Ropeway is a transport system for ferrying goods or people especially used in mountainous areas or mines, wherein the carrier cars are suspended with the help of moving cables, powered by a motor system. Such ropeways or cable car systems are already in operation in Haridwar and have also been proposed for Ayodhya. A 16km ropeway route is also popular in La Paz in Bolivia. “It is proposed for short distance commuting and will also serve as a feeder system for metro stations in the city. It is being thought of for two proposed extensions – Vaishali to Mohan Nagar and Electronic City to Mohan Nagar – will take time for construction. The ropeway system will help out local commuters,” Verma added. In all, the Ghaziabad city has 10 operational metro stations. Officials said that the New Bus Adda to Dilshad Garden route has no direct connectivity with the Vaishali metro. Likewise, the New Bus Adda has no further extension towards the city, besides which, many commuters willing to go to Vaishali metro station from Indirapuram and Vasundhara have to use their own vehicle or change autos. “Commuters face daily hassles, and this is why the authority has planned the ropeway system which requires less funding and less space in terms of land than the metro. For instance, we cannot extend the New Bus Adda metro towards Ghaziabad railway station as the route has less space and is highly congested. Besides, there is also a flyover at the central verge. The ropeway will be more feasible and it will also be at a lesser cost than the per kilometre cost of metro system,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, authority’s chief architect and town planner. The GDA officials clarified that the proposed ropeway system will be a “self-sustaining model” and will be developed on the basis of a public-private partnership model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-plans-ropeway-system-for-local-commute-feeder-to-metro-stations/story-gpmeXg7hYMNISJCFeNvcQM.html

As a result, the traffic going from Noida to Delhi remained diverted via the DND flyway.Hundreds of farmers have been protesting at the Chilla border (Noida-Delhi link road) for the past nearly three weeks. Members of Bhanu faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) have been camping at the Chilla border after they were stopped from entering Delhi.On Saturday, the BKU (Bhanu) supporters were joined by a small group of farmers from Telangana. “A larger delegation will also join us in the coming days. If the government had thought that the movement would lose its momentum, they were wrong,” said Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president, BKU (Bhanu).The number of protesting farmers at the Chilla border are swelling, as a group of farmers from UP’s Etah had joined the group on Friday night.The border had opened on December 13 before the traffic from Noida to Delhi was once again blocked on December 16 after the farmers alleged that their supporters were being illegally detained in the state. The Noida-Delhi side was opened on Saturday for a brief period to let a medical emergency vehicle pass through, the police said.On Saturday evening, farmers camped at the border also burnt some copies of the new farm laws and a letter from the minister of agriculture to the farmers.“We don’t need them to write letters to us. We need them to talk to us and listen to the problems that we are facing and then take steps to improve them. The cold weather no longer affects us. We are going to remain here until the government takes some action in our favour,” said Singh. The BKU (Bhanu) leader was on a hunger strike which he had broken on Thursday. The members of the BKU (Lok Shakti) camped at the Dalit Prerna Sthal are also on an indefinite hunger strike. They were joined on Saturday by the local transgender community that gave cultural performances to boost the morale of the protestors.Meanwhile, with one side of the border remaining closed, traffic continues to be diverted through the DND flyway.“Traffic is moving steadily through alternate routes. The protestors were joined yesterday by a group from Etah. Police is on high alert to manage any law and order situation and we are monitoring the developments,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida zone 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-continue-sit-in-at-chilla-traffic-diverted/story-cgjX5UJ0WYLj5tqOs0noyH.html
19-12-2020||Noida||At UP Gate, farmer leaders ask volunteers to gear up for ‘long fight’||Ghaziabad: Leaders of various farmer organisations protesting at the UP Gate in Ghaziabad on Saturday asked their supporters to prepare for a “prolonged agitation” and also suggested measures so that the ongoing protests go on without any disruption. Thousands of farmers have been occupying the UP Gate border area since November 28 to press for their demand for rollback of the Centre’s three new farm laws. The farmers’ leaders said that the Bharatiya Janata Party has been organising ‘kisan’ meetings across the country to publicise the benefits of farm bills, and it seems that the ongoing agitation will get prolonged but they are prepared for it. “The government is not inclined to take back the farm laws and has been publicising their benefits. So, it appears that the fight will continue and you must prepare for a long fight. Those willing to join the protest here should come just like the farmers of Punjab. So, you spend couple of days here and return, while other groups will come here,” said Rakesh Tikait, leader and national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). He told the farmers that the protest as well as work in the field back home should continue. “We have asked them to keep an eye on the protests at Delhi borders, and if the situation demands they should be able to arrive here within 3-4 hours. Here we have provision of electricity and we also have solar panels. Our volunteers also ensure that outsiders or any disturbing elements get spotted at the outset. Further, we must tell the media persons about our issues so that more people become aware of our problems,” Tikait added. Thousands of farmers from UP, Punjab and Uttarakhand have joined protests at the UP Gate and have also blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the National Highway-9 since December 3. “Our farmers’ associations have given a joint call to pay tributes to our members who have died during the agitation, and everyone has been asked to remember them from 11am to 1pm in whatever way they can. When the court has already said that protest can go on peacefully, tractor-trolleys are getting stopped and other coercive measures are being taken to stop them. If this continues, ten times more people will come and try to enter Delhi,” said Sardar VM Singh, a prominent farmer leader who heads the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan. The farmer leaders further said that they have a fight with the Centre and not with any state government. “We have no fight with governments of UP and Uttarakhand. So, they must not stop our tractor-trolleys. Some of our vehicles have been stopped in different districts that include Rampur, Bareilley and Amroha, among others. If they do so, we have directed our district volunteers to ensure that such trolleys move ahead from such districts. The government representatives are going in villages while we are in Delhi. Let them come back to Delhi and we will talk to them,” Tikait said. However, Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that there have been no incidents of stoppage of tractor-trolleys in the district. “We are in regular talks with the farmers’ leaders and there is no issue of any stoppage of their tractor-trolleys in Ghaziabad. We are ensuring that their protest remains peaceful,” he said.Chandra Mohan, BJP’s state unit spokesperson, said that they are getting good response for the farm bills in villages across UP. “We are holding meetings with farmers to tell them about the benefits of the new farm laws. Most of the farmers are with the government. Also, our government has not tried to stop any tractor-trolley of farmers,” he said.Meanwhile, the farmers’ leaders on Saturday reiterated that the farm laws be rolled back and a new law on MSP should be enacted, otherwise the farmers will stay put and continue their protests. There have been at least six rounds of talks between the central government and the farmers’ leaders, but have failed to end the stalemate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/at-up-gate-farmer-leaders-ask-volunteers-to-gear-up-for-long-fight/story-bGtBSOxS7MqIPvA9K3A25K.html
19-12-2020||City||Cauliflower prices come crashing down in Ludhiana as farmers’ protest causes veggie glut||The price of cauliflower, which till a few months ago was being sold at Rs 50/kg, has gone as low as Rs 2 in the wholesale market of Ludhiana. This free fall has been attributed to the glut-like situation resulting out of farmers’ protest at Delhi borders.Rajinder Kumar, an arhtiya, said as the routes leading to Delhi are closed due to the farmers’ stir, vegetables are being dumped in the wholesale mandis of Ludhiana. “Earlier, vegetables from the neighbouring states used to be transported to Delhi. Farmers from Ludhiana were also selling their produce in the capital. But nowadays, instead of selling their crop in mandis or directly to customers, farmers are dumping it in the wholesale market before leaving to join the protesters at Singhu and Tikri borders,” the arhtiya added. Same is the story of radish and carrot, which are being sold for Rs 2/kg and Rs 5/kg, respectively. The rates of onion and potatoes have also seen a dip, with the former being sold at Rs 20/kg and the latter settled at Rs 10/kg. Peas are currently available for Rs 12 to Rs 13/kg and so is pumpkin. Karam Singh of Ek Allahi village in Khanna said he was getting about Rs 1.5 for a kilogram of cauliflower. “If I include the expenditure of harvesting and transportation of cauliflower, one kilogram of crop costs me Rs 4 to Rs 6. I am running into losses. If vegetable rates don’t spring back, I will be left with no other option but to run tractor on my next cycle of crop which is due for harvest by next week,” he added. Sahnewal’s Gurpreet Singh also airs a similar plight. He said that he had sold cauliflower between Rs 15 to Rs 25kg earlier this year. “Now, I am getting merely Rs 2/kg. Due to the protest, I could not take my produce to Delhi. So I have donated some of the crop to community kitchen for preparing langar,” Gurpreet said. Prof Raj Kumar from the economic department of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) said the cost of cultivating a kilogram of cauliflower is about Rs 4.5 to Rs 5.Prof Tarsem Singh Dhillon of PAU’s vegetable sciences department, meanwhile, sought rate regulation of the perishable crops to protect farmers from fluctuating prices.“It is not the first time that vegetable growers are facing losses. This, in fact, is primarily the reason why farmers shift to wheat and paddy as these two crops offer assured price,” Dhillion added. Hemant Dhawan, another vegetable arhtiya, said he has witnessed the slump in vegetables prices for the first time. “Be it radish, carrot, onion or potato, prices of all vegetables have crashed and strangely, there are not enough buyers,” Hemant said. However, while the wholesale rates are nosediving, vendors are selling vegetables at premium prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cauliflower-prices-come-crashing-down-in-ludhiana-as-farmers-protest-causes-veggie-glut/story-Ae57t3xHq2c0IHmIwvUKUM.html
19-12-2020||Mumbai||Over 15,000 schools reopened across Maharashtra with 10 lakh students||Almost a month after the state allowed schools to reopen, the number of students resuming regular classes is increasing while schools attempt to meet the challenges posed by the pandemic. Schools were allowed to reopen from November 23, provided they followed guidelines laid down by the state government. According to the state education department, more than 15,000 schools have reopened and over 10 lakh students have been attending classes as of December 14. More than 90% of schools in districts such as Gadchiroli, Osmanabad, Satara, Solapur, Jalgaon and Nanded have reopened.As per data shared by the state education department on December 3, a total of 1,51,539 teachers and 56,034 non-teaching staff in schools across the state underwent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests to check their Covid status before schools reopened. Of these, 2,212 teachers and 682 non-teaching staff tested positive. Officials said so far, no Covid-positive cases have been reported among students since schools reopened.Balasaheb Wagh, principal at New English School Koregaon, Ahmednagar, said, several students requested certain topics that were taught online be repeated. “Students said they did not understand a few concepts well in the online mode and even the teachers realised that there was no point going ahead unless previous doubts are cleared,” said Wagh. Manoj Mothe, teacher at Latur’s Deshikendra Vidyalay, said, “Many parents requested us to repeat what was taught. We are trying to revise the syllabus and finish what is left at the same time. Every day, we are calling students for four hours.” Most schools HT spoke to said they were seeing a steady increase in the number of students in attendance. However, convincing parents to send their children to school remains a challenge. “Parents had genuine concerns, which we had to hear. For instance, many said they were worried about sending their children as there were senior citizens or people with ailments at home and they were worried about the risks involved,” said GG Ahire, principal of Tilak High School in Karad, Satara. The school has seen nearly 50% attendance over the last few weeks and has offered both online and offline options to students. “Our school timetable is shared with students who wish to continue online and teachers live stream the entire class for such students. This avoids duplication of efforts and students get the feel of being in a classroom and get to solve their doubts then and there,” Ahire said. Balu Bhoyar, principal, Karamveer Vidyalaya in Chandrapur, said teachers are also working with students who struggled to adjust to online classes. “Special attention can be given to such students to ensure they do not face any learning hurdles,” said Bhoyar.Adhering to the mandatory safety protocols means longer working hours for schools’ staff, many of whom must now come at least two hours before working hours. “We reach the school at 8.30am even as children are called at 10am. We have to get the entire premises sanitised and make sure students enter in a systematic fashion, wear masks and have their temperatures checked. We are new to this routine, but are slowly making it a habit,” said Wagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-15-000-schools-reopened-across-maharashtra-with-10-lakh-students/story-XCYNtQsn81TiYoOb2Y7dgP.html
19-12-2020||Mumbai||Declare Christmas holidays, schools urge Maharashtra education department||Schools in Maharashtra have requested the state education department to grant Christmas vacations for teachers and students to give them a break from online classes. Recently, several teachers requested the department to give them at least a week-long break like many schools give during the festival every year. “Students are tired due to the online classes that began in June this year. Due to the Covid-19 situation everyone is cooped up at home, so some break is definitely needed. The department has not given an academic calendar this year, thus making it difficult for schools to plan their year. We request that the department at least asks schools to not conduct exams or any sort of assessment this month,” said Rajesh Pandya from Teachers Democratic Front. Several schools in the city generally declare holidays each year for Christmas and New Year with schools remaining shut between December 24 and January 1. While some schools have given classes a break even this year, teachers said an official policy was needed for everyone to be able to implement it. “Just like the government announced Diwali break, we are hoping that they give at least a few days off for Christmas,” said a teacher from a convent school in the suburbs. An official from the state education department said, “A decision is yet to be taken in this regard.”Over the past few months, teachers have been requesting the education department to give them an academic calendar for the current year as classes continue to remain online this year. “In the absence of a calendar, each school is following its own schedule and there is absolutely no uniformity whatsoever,” said the teacher of an aided school in Dahisar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/declare-christmas-holidays-schools-urge-maharashtra-education-department/story-7kkXzhyJTjJItaDykD8yLK.html

19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana Inc seeks Centre’s intervention over hiked raw material rates||Disconcerted by the steep hike in price of raw material amid the pandemic, the industrialists here have urged the Centre to step in to bring some relief otherwise nearly half of the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector would face closure.Under the banner of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), the industrialists on Saturday stated that their working conditions were turning unviable and they were not able to meet even the previously made commitments and contracts on low rates. Production has already decreased and the hike in raw material rates could increase the price of finished products, they rued.According to a survey conducted by the industrialists in the last five months, the price of stainless steel has increased by 32 percent (Rs 200/kg hike), aluminium by 26 percent (Rs 210/kg hike), and natural rubber by 52 percent (Rs 156/kg hike). Rates of copper, which is a key component for the MSME sector, has witnessed a hike of Rs 600/kg, which comes to around 77 percent hike. The rate of steel at present is highest in the last 12 years.Stating that large quantities of steel is being exported by India, the industrialists demanded that the Union government should suspend the export for at least six months and no duty should be imposed on import. They also asked for tightening the noose around cartelisation by the big players, which is one of the major reasons behind the price hike.Industrialist Avtar Singh Bhogal said, “The frequent fluctuations in the prices are taking a toll on the industry. If we book an order and the rates of raw material witness a steep hike, we land in trouble and are forced to bear losses on our previous commitments.”“Steel rates have gone up across the world because the iron ore mines remained closed due to lockdown. However, the hike is 25 percent in other countries, while in India, the rates of different types of steel have been increased by around 45 percent. The demand of steel products is high but we are forced to bring down production due to the hike in raw material rates,” said Hand Tools Association president SC Ralhan.The industrialists said if the conditions prevail for some more time, 50 percent of the MSME sector will face closure, which will push around 5 crore staff/labourers towards unemployment.CICU president Upkar Singh Ahuja and general secretary Pankaj Sharma said that the industry is already struggling due to the ongoing pandemic and the hike in raw material rates has added to their woes.Sharma stated that Union minister Nitin Gadkari had also raised concern over the issue in the recent past, while Ahuja said, “We will take up the matter with the Union government and ministry of steel in the coming days. The government needs to stop export of steel for a certain period to save the local industry.”‘Make in India campaign ignored’ The industrialists also slammed the Centre for allegedly ignoring the Make in India campaign by allowing huge steel exports to China even when the local industry is in dire need.CICU publicity secretary JS Bhogal said, “Large quantities of steel is being exported to China, which is a major competitor for bicycle parts, hardware, auto component, hand tools and sewing machine industry in the international market. The cost of final products being exported from India is increasing due to the hike in raw material prices, but China is not hiking the rates, which makes it difficult for us to survive globally. Even when we are not in good terms with China, we are benefitting China through exports.”Form price control panel: FICOFederation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) also warned that the MSME sector will collapse if the central government failed to intervene and ban steel export. FICO members demanded that the Union government should constitute a price monitoring committee to control the rates of essential raw material like steel. FICO president Gurmeet Singh Kular said, “Ludhiana is a manufacturing hub of bicycle, its components and engineering products. The steep hike in raw material prices in the pandemic has hit the industry hard. The price of steel, copper, CRCA steel, craft paper, zinc and brass has increased by 40-50 percent since August and it is expected to rise further in the coming weeks. The MSME sector will not be able to survive and will be forced to shut down. The government should constitute a monitoring committee to control the hike in prices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-inc-seeks-centre-s-intervention-over-hiked-raw-material-rates/story-7YA8zC3ieeblGaAEEe1iUO.html

The term of these officials, working in the bridges and roads (B and R), light and horticulture wings of MC, ended in June. In the absence of a formal extension of their services, they have been working without pay since July.Some have even stopped reporting for work, leaving MC grappling with acute staff shortage. Earlier, the local bodies department had also delayed the extension of 20 JEs and SDOs working in the operations and maintenance (O&M) cell. But, it was allowed later. One of the SDO, requesting anonymity said, “We have received nothing but false assurances that the contracts will be renewed. While MC failed to renew the contracts, the local bodies department has also issued a letter refraining it from outsourcing staff.”“A lot of outsourced staff are not coming to work due to uncertainty over disbursal of salaries since July. It has become difficult to make ends meet. Worse, MC’s work has also been affected. Even if MC starts development works, there will be no staff to monitor them,” the official said.Mayor Balkar Sandhu had met local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra in this regard on Thursday and sought that MC be allowed to outsource its manpower and extend the contracts of employees required to continue so as to keep a check on the quality of works underway across the city.“Mayors from Amritsar, Patiala and Jalandhar were also present in the meeting, where minister Mohindra assured to find a solution soon,” said Sandhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ban-on-outsourcing-staff-future-of-43-jes-sdos-in-ludhiana-hangs-in-balance/story-WZJzvhWsGG3Aktbof20DfI.html

19-12-2020||Chandigarh||PSPCL jumps on social media bandwagon||Catching up with the times, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has decided to join the social media bandwagon to provide better access to its consumers. Now, one can contact the state power corporation on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and through the customer care email and mobile app.The move is a part of a comprehensive plan chalked out by the department to ensure quality, reliable and uninterrupted power supply to all its consumers, especially on the farming and industrial sector, during the upcoming paddy season.PSPCL chairperson-cum-managing director A Venu Prasad visited Ludhiana on Saturday to take stock of all pre-preparations. Central Ludhiana, chief engineer (distribution) Bhupinder Khosla received him.Prasad took stock of the working of the electricity fuse at the call centre in Chaura Bazaar and Janta Nagar (both respond to toll free number 1912). He said, “ To earn consumers’ trust, it is important to hear their complaints and resolve them immediately. Thus, the PSPCL has set up a round-the-clock electricity call centre and erected a new building for the same at the 66KV gas-insulated substation kilovolt substation at Chaura Bazaar in Ludhiana.“Apart from registering a complaint by calling or sending an SMS at 1912, the consumer can also use the PSPCL mobile application to register and track status of complaints, which will provide feedback on complaint resolution. If not satisfied, the consumer can also contact PSPCL through the customer care email (1912@pspcl.in), Facebook (fb.com/pspclpb), Twitter (twitter.com/PSPCLPb), Instagram (instagram.com/PSPCLPb) or Whatsapp at 96461-06835,” Prasad said.He said that a special control room had been setup to deal with complaints during the paddy season. One can contact the paddy control room at 96461-06835 or 96461-06836 to get their complaints registered and redressed.Prasad also inspected the position of the 220 KV power system transmission network lines,66 KV lines and grids feeding Ludhiana city and surrounding areas under the central zone. He studied the different works in progress including the de-loading of the 220 KV gausgarh substation by connecting the 220 KV Ladowal-Gausgarh line.He asked the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) officers to expedite the augmentation of the 220/66 KV transformer and the 160 mega-volt ampere (MVA) transformer at BBMB, Jamalpur, so that the industrial consumers feeding from 66 KV Chandigarh Road and other high-end 66 KV industrial consumers at Industry Focal Point Ludhiana do not get a restricted load.He also directed the officers to ensure that the repair and maintenance of transmission lines, grids, substations and transformers is completed at the earliest. He said overloaded transformers’ supplying power to tubewells should be de-loaded in advance without delay to facilitate consumers in rural areas. He said directions had already been issued to field officers to complete the developmental works by January 15, 2021, and to solve problems of transmission lines and transformers and tree cuttings well in time.He also directed the chief engineer (stores) and the local PSPCL workshop to ensure every material required to tackle any power-related exigency was available. While appealing consumers to deposit their electricity bills on time, Prasad also directed officers to expedite the recovery of arrears of bills from erring consumers since PSPCL is a commercial organisation, which requires financial resources to provide reliable and uninterrupted electricity to 96 lakhs consumers in the state.He also appealed the consumers to report power theft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pspcl-jumps-on-social-media-bandwagon/story-GNLDKN15I0kcOibh2DqryM.html
19-12-2020||Gurugram||BJP members hold one-day fast on SYL Canal issue||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday held a one-day fast in support of state farmers on the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal matter, which has remained stuck for the several years owing to a dispute between the states of Punjab and Haryana. The BJP leaders in Gurugram, who congregated at Rajiv Chowk on Saturday morning, said that issue of SYL Canal was crucial for the agriculturists to prosper in Haryana, but the decision of the apex court has not been implemented for many years. A large number of farmers and party workers from rural areas, including Pataudi, Tauru and Sohna, joined the fast, said party leaders. Sudhir Singla, Gurugram member of legislative assembly, who attended the protest along with other party functionaries, said that farmers in Haryana have been denied their share of Sutlej water and it is time that the directions of the Supreme Court are implemented. “The farmers in Haryana must get their share of water for agriculture. As far as farm protests are concerned, the Central government has shown considerable flexibility,” said Singla.Gargi Kakkar, district BJP president, said that around 4,000 farmers and workers from across the district participated in the protest. “The rights of the farmers of Haryana need to be supported. Farmers’ protests have become more political as people realise that the primary agenda is to malign the government and influence elections in other states,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/bjp-members-hold-one-day-fast-on-syl-canal-issue/story-6khInITsHxM7IPaSeax2FM.html

The police said that the duo worked at the warehouse of an e-commerce delivery platform in Bilaspur and has stolen 78 iPhones worth Rs 1 crore, by taking advantage of the relaxation in physical checks during the lockdown to stall the transmission of Covid-19.They were produced in court on Saturday and sent to one-day police remand.The city police on Saturday identified the two accused as Ansar Ul Haq and Nawab Singh, both residents of Nuh, and were arrested on Thursday and Friday, respectively. The police said that the duo had hidden 38 mobile phones and they had planned to sell them in the near future. The phones were recovered on their instance, said officials, adding that they have taken them on a one-day remand.“The duo was working at a warehouse and during the lockdown, they managed to steal expensive smartphones as there was no physical checking due to Covid-19. The accused would throw the boxes in the warehouse after taking the mobile phones from the boxes. By the time the company came to know of the theft in September, the duo had quit the job,” said Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), Gurugram.The police said an official of the e-commerce company had complained to the Bilaspur police on November 7, stating that they have found 78 empty boxes of expensive iPhones and that these were stolen from the warehouse. A case was registered and the crime unit of Sector 10 and the police started a probe in the matter.The accused were arrested after sustained technical and human surveillance. During questioning, they revealed the modus operandi used by them, said officials.“During the investigation, the role of two more persons has also been found and they would also be arrested soon,” said Sangwan, adding that the remaining phones will also be recovered from their associates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/duo-arrested-phones-worth-rs-50-lakh-recovered/story-qkj5WfvDgxFafhXBUCOW4N.html

He was admitted to the ICU after being shifted from Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak.Tests conducted on Vij so far have shown normal functioning of the liver and kidney. On Friday, doctors said that his oxygen requirement and respiratory rate have reduced, while his blood investigation results have improved.Vij, 67, who is also Haryana’s health minister, tested positive for Covid-19 on December 5. He was admitted to Civil Hospital in Ambala and later to PGIMS, Rohtak, after he was detected with Covid-19 pneumonia, which led to lung infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/vij-stable-but-still-in-icu/story-acT5wmPUkU3E1xzfEPV2rL.html

According to the district health bulletin, Gurugram has recorded 187 new infections, on an average, per day, over the last week. On Saturday, 151 new Covid-19 cases were reported, taking the total tally to 55, 638. The Covid-19 toll stands at 139. No deaths were reported on Saturday.Over the previous week, from December 6 to 12, the TPR remained at 6.8%, with an average of 356 new cases recorded daily.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a positivity rate of less than 5% indicates that the epidemic is under control. A higher TPR is usually an indication of higher transmission in the community, with chances of more people having contracted the virus but not having been tested.On Saturday, 6,344 tests were administered, with the health department continuing with its strategy of conducting the maximum number of tests in the week every Saturday. This week, 4,472 tests, on an average, were administered daily, which is almost 23% lower than the average of over 5,800 tests per day between December 6 and 12. As per the health department, over 93% of the tests administered were of the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), which is the gold standard test for Covid-19.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that increased testing over the last month has helped in lowering the TPR. “The TPR is now below 5%. If 4,000 tests are being administered, only 2% are being detected positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus. The department is doing sufficient testing compared to the number of people who are getting infected,” said Yadav.The downward trend in new infections and a high recovery rate, of almost 96%, has also led to an overall decline in active cases. Currently, Gurugram has 1,586 active cases, of whom 1,425 are in home isolation, while 157 are seriously-ill and undergoing treatment in private hospitals and four in district Covid care centres. Considering the decline in hospitalisation, the district administration on December 15 reduced the reserved bed capacity from 50% to 35%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-weekly-test-positivity-rate-down-to-4-2/story-ugSyU80a96GSjX7fI8Y1eJ.html
19-12-2020||Gurugram||Farmers will pay tribute to those who died during agitation||Farmers protesting along the Delhi-Jaipur national highway against the new farm laws on Saturday said that they will pay tribute to fellow protesters, who have died during the agitation, on Sunday.Addressing a press conference from the protest site at Jaisinghpura-Khera village, near Shahajahanpur in Alwar of Rajasthan, farmer leaders criticised the country’s leaders over the laws and reiterated their demand for a rollback. They said that tribute meetings would be organised in villages and towns across the country on Sunday.“Lakhs of farmers are now on the streets surrounding Delhi amid the severe cold. They are braving the cold and other obstacles created by the government, as they are determined to achieve their goal. Their only demand is that the three anti-farmer laws should be revoked,” said a farmer leader, protesting under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha.Farmers from Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Haryana have been protesting near the Haryana-Rajasthan border on the Delhi-Jaipur highway for the past seven days, after the Rewari police stopped them from proceeding towards Delhi.Farmers at the site said that the new laws will put them at the mercy of large corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) that they receive for important crops.Sanjay Madhav, the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that meetings will be organised on Sunday to recognise the sacrifices made by farmers since the agitation started. “More farmers from Sikar, Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh from Rajasthan arrived today with their tractor-trolleys. We are getting support from all social classes, who are pitching in with food and other resources,” said Madhav.Farmers protesting at the site have also made arrangements for buses to ferry farmers in Rajasthan between their homes and protest sites, free of charge.Harvinder Singh, a farmer from Sri Ganganagar in Rajasthan, said, “The free bus service will start tomorrow, from Hanumangarh. With this facility, more farmers will be able to join us and manage errands at home too,” said Singh, who is a member of Grameen Kisan Mazdoor Samiti.He said that 25-30 tractors and trolleys from Sri Ganganagar district were not being allowed to reach the protest site by the Haryana Police.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), meanwhile, said that farmers were being misled by opposition parties and they were creating false apprehensions among the people, which the party would clear by reaching out to them. “The Congress, during its rule, had entered into agreements with private companies to store grains and same policies were endorsed in its manifesto,” said Raman Malik, BJP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-will-pay-tribute-to-those-who-died-during-agitation/story-QXvfEUb14iLPhiulh8AcKM.html
19-12-2020||Gurugram||Mercury hits season’s lowest at 3.8°C, day temperature rises||The minimum temperature in the city plummetted to 3.8 degrees Celsius on Saturday, marking the lowest temperature so far this winter. The temperature was five degrees below the normal and a dip from the 4 degrees Celsius recorded the previous day.There was a slight relief for residents as the maximum temperature increased to 20.1 degrees Celsius on Saturday, from 18.4 degrees Celsius the previous day and 13.1 degrees Celsius the day before. However, as per the data, the maximum temperature was two degrees below the normal.Officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) pointed to cold winds from snow-capped mountains as the cause for the drop in temperatures. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature is expected to hover around 20 degrees Celsius on Sunday as well, while the minimum temperature is also expected to stay around 4 degrees Celsius. As per the weekly forecast, shallow fog might prevail in the morning hours, followed by cloudy skies later in the day. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that cold wave conditions are likely to continue due to clear skies. “There may be some relief from cold wave around December 21, when another western disturbance is expected,” said Srivastava. The air quality in the city deteriorated slightly on Saturday, with a reading of 260 (“poor”) on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin, up from Friday’s AQI of 224, also in the ”poor” category. The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5) — the city’s primary pollutant —was recorded at 178.9 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) on Saturday, as per the data from the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. According to the early air quality warning system for the National Capital Region (NCR), the air quality is likely to remain in the “poor” to lower-end of “very poor” category on Sunday. On Monday, the air quality might stay in the lower-end of “very poor” category. Further, the air quality is likely to remain largely in the lower-end of “very poor” category over the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mercury-hits-season-s-lowest-at-3-8-c-day-temperature-rises/story-eavUGwQLpS1EgzD7ed6phP.html
19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Our Take: It’s up to us to ensure the success of the new waste collection system||In another attempt to effectively manage waste in the city the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) will from Tuesday launch door-to-door collection of waste using twin bin vehicles.With UT administrator VP Singh Badnore inaugurating the drive, the vehicles will first cover sectors 1 to 30 as part of a three phase plan. Part two, covering the rest of the sectors, will begin from January 1 and the last phase on January 7, covering Manimajra.Until now, independent garbage collectors were lifting mixed waste from houses and commercial spaces. Earlier attempts to segregate waste fell flat as people refused to follow rules.Residents will now have to pay user charges to the MC and will also be penalised for mixing waste. The new system will take off ahead of the upcoming Swachh Survekshan (cleanliness survey).About 115 vehicles which will be used for collection in the first phase have reached the city and passed technical checks and 392 vehicles will join the fleet by the end of December.The move comes in a year when Chandigarh improved its Swachh Survekshan ranking to 16 from 20 last year. However, the city could not make it to the top 10 cleanest cities in the country for the second year in a row.Chandigarh last made it to the top slots in 2018 when it was adjudged the third cleanest.The reason for the city’s poor show is largely due to its waste management strategies, which are not up to scratch yet despite years of planning.Chandigarh’s experiment with the waste segregation plant at Dadumajra has so far been a fiasco, with the municipal corporation this year taking over from Jaypee.Now, hopefully, with stricter action, the segregation mission might finally be successful.Another issue that the city authorities need to resolve immediately is the manual garbage collectors’ plight. They have been demanding that they be allowed to lift waste and get paid 50% of the fine collected from defaulters.MC joint commissioner Anil Garg, sanitation committee chairman Rajesh Kalia and medical officer of health Dr Amrit Warring recently met representatives of the collectors.“We have heard them and will take up their demands with senior officers. We are already registering them with us as drivers and helpers in the twin-bin hopper vehicles,” Dr Warring has said.In a year with soaring unemployment rates because of Covid-19 lockdowns the administration and municipal corporation should ensure rehabilitation of each and every collector by integrating them into the system, help them work with dignity and earn enough to live a comfortable life.Meanwhile, it is up to each and every resident of Chandigarh to ensure the success of the new system and ensure the city once again tops the Swachh Survekshan rankings.WASTE NOTHow can success of door to door garbage collection be ensured?The new segregated waste collection system rolls out in Chandigarh from December 22. How can its success be ensured?

As Xmas comes riding Pandemic season, that spells more woe than mistletoe and more things glum than cakes rum ‘n’ plum, hope you’ll understand if the Wishlist sounds Pandemic fixated.To script a wishlist that’s non-Covid centric would be like Edvard Munch painting his fabled self-portrait with nary a shade of the Spanish Flu he survived.Assuming, dear Santa, that you’re also in #WorkFromHome mode, here’s keeping scrolling down Wishlist 2020 short ‘n’ tweet:Of Words’ Worth & WishlistsDear Santa, since we Tweeple are suffering from not only overexposure to sanitisers but also another overdose – Pandemic Vocabulary Fatigue – for 2021, could you please gift us lingo-ism that’s better or battier?In Pandemic year-end, when Oxford English Dictionary seems suffering from a strange disorder, being at a ‘loss for words’, figuratively as much as literally, to name one “word of the year”, The New York Times has played it ‘safe’ and smart. It’s scripted a Short List of 20 phrases that defined Season 2020. From ‘blursday’ and ‘doomscrolling’ to ‘flatten the curve’ and ‘contact tracing’, making it to the list is all such sundry hashtag-ism hurled at us by Tamasha TV or Twitterverse, for better or adverse.Dear Santa, could you beat Shashi Tharoor at it and be the first to gift us a farrago of fancier catchphrase-ism for 2021? Or, if #WFH has made you lost ‘n’ lazy like most of us, could you simply tweak 2020’s vocabulary to make it battier if not better?F(l)atten the Curve: So sick are our cochlear compartments of being fed on this 2020 catchphrase that, dear Santa, could you gift its tweaked version – Fatten the Curve?Hopefully, this ‘Fatten the Curve’ narrative would drive ‘n’ define fattening of pay-packet curves or employment curves in 2021. As much as denoting the fiscal curve, #FattenTheCurve hashtagism could also hopefully herald fattening of the follicular curve on the balding pates of Lamba jis, Lally jis & Co.New (Ab)Normal: Again, so fatigued are we Twitterati at this catchphrase-ism called #NewNormal that, dear Santa, could you gift us tweaked newness – #NewAbnormal?‘New Abnormal’ could be a Godsend (or Santa-send) to describe our Pandemic-bestowed battiness better – such as dashing into the apartment or Mall lift with lightning speed one minute and darting out the next second, faster than an AK-47 bullet, upon seeing the strength of lift boarders touching a social distance-defying number of four or more.#NewAbnormal could also be more befitting for Pandemic’s paranoid quirkiness, such as Lockdown’s Lollitas & Co imagining themselves suffering ‘fatal’ breathlessness every time that jogger of a neighbour – drop-dead dashing dandy Khullar Junior or Khanna Junior – takes the breath away by breezing past few breaths away minus a mask, waddling like wannabe Usain Bolt.The curious case of “Will You Be My Quarantini?”Of Maskne & MeetIn a Corona-scape that also spawned cosmetic catchphrase-ism called ‘Maskne’ (mask-induced acne), dear Santa, could you gift masks to camouflage midlife blues, or at least midlife clues. Eyebrows or nostrils that betray more grey than Trump’s grey cells or wrinkles that’re erupting faster than the rash of OTT flicks.Dear Santa, since we’re pretty fatigued by Coronascape’s crap and many an app – Arogya Setu to Google Meet – could you please gift us life beyond Lockdown’s Living Room called Zoom?The curious case of more than Meet (s) the eye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/witerati-for-whom-the-jingle-bells-scroll/story-aJ0ppXEr1OJ4K5Nxst2bmK.html
19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Random Forays: You win some, you lose some||The battle of life is a long-drawn affair, for all human beings, relentless in its bombardment, with challenge upon challenge thrown at us, day after day. Yet there are sunny moments in each day, or most days, which cause us to smile and feel blessed. Some days actually end up leaving us feeling lighter, even satiated, at having conquered new ground or having made new friends. But on other days, those which only add to our list of lows, we might be forgiven for wishing that such days had never dawned at all.“You win some, you lose some”, goes the old saying. And in these philosophical words we find the answer to the seeming unfairness of life. Those who think they will always be on a high, might just discover that life will jolt them sooner than later. And those who are so despondent with their lot that they cannot visualise any light at the end of a tunnel, need to shake themselves out of their sense of despair. Life is imperfect after all. But it need not all be downhill. Sunlit, flowery, pathways will surely emerge along the way.The year 2020 has epitomised the mother of all worst-case scenarios. The pandemic and its severe impact upon the lives of people all over the world, whether they were infected or not, has left many rattled, even shattered. The pain and tragedy of families which have experienced illness and even loss of life, cannot be imagined by those who have been more fortunate. But the generic consensus is that the whole year has been a write off for everyone.Yet, will 2021 bring all the answers to mankind’s problems? Will pollution, disease, ignorance, poverty, petty politics, crime, and degradation of values, simply fade away? Indeed, the pandemic shows signs of relenting at last and the new year will offer hope that we have seen the worst of it. Things can only get better in the new year. Yet, the shades of grey and the incessant play of darkness and light will go on unendingly, will it not?Have we not found any moments of joy at all in the year 2020? Those who have not been affected by illness must surely have spent many more months of quality time with family and themselves. A new skill, a new art, a new hobby or a new outlook must have made its glorious entry into their existences, and brought some cheer with it. The very fact that mankind has been able to produce medical heroes from within its ranks who have combated the worst of the virus is a very heartening sign. Numerous common individuals, too many to name here, have inspired and led by example to help those who have needed an embalming intervention during this global crisis.Life is never black or white, after all. And it is not in the calendar but within us that the answers to greater happiness can be found. Those who can carry on unflinchingly despite the surmounting challenges that life keeps presenting as the years roll by, will win the greatest battle of them all, the battle of the mind. It is within us that triumph and turmoil coexist. And the choice is ours, whether to focus on the sunshine or the darkness in each situation.Walt Whitman said, “Keep your face towards the sunshine, and the shadows will fall behind.” The choice is actually ours, and not the making of our circumstances. We make of life what it ultimately becomes. We can forever focus on the black spots in our lives, or on the bright light that envelopes most of our days. Even in our worst moments, we can summon the resolve to bounce back, if we exercise our will power to the fullest.And on a lighter note, even India’s poorest ever cricket Test Match score of 36 All Out is being blamed on the year 2020! Team India had better salvage some pride in the second Test which begins on December 26, Boxing Day, at Melbourne. The players, the fans, and even the year 2020 will do well to remember those golden words.

19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Centurion Prithipal Gill’s smoking barrel||A trait associated with some ladies hailing from an era long past is that their memories are elephantine and remembrances lucid. There is no better embodiment of this attribute than Preminder Kaur (93), who has this delightful anecdote to share about her centurion husband: “He was painfully thin. So, when a wounded bison charged at him and tried to gore him with the expansive, curving horns, Prithipal’s reed-slim body saved the day. The horns went around and not through him! That gave him enough time to pull out his service revolver and shoot the bison in the head at point blank range. But not before a final, glancing blow from the dying horns took out a pair of Prithipal’s front teeth!”On December 11, 2020, India celebrated the 100th birthday of a unique veteran and city beautiful resident, Col Prithipal Singh Gill (retd). He holds the distinction of having served the Air Force, Navy and Army. During the 1965 War, four artillery guns of his regiment were cut off by enemy action in the Sialkot sector, but then Lt Col Gill personally led a successful mission to retrieve the guns. Also a World War II veteran of air and naval battles, Col Gill hung up his boots in 1970. The sprightly couple celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary on December 24, 2020.A life across three armed services lent Col Gill a unique opportunity to traverse diverse Indian jungles and luxuriate in his childhood passion for the outdoors and the true calling of his heart, shikar. The gleam still prevalent in his eyes reveals one of the defining traits of his character, an intrepid naughtiness inherent in his fauji escapades! “Prithipal was born naughty, his mother could not handle him. That trait was omnipresent throughout his career. A leopard wandered into the Army camp near Hoshiarpur and Prithipal brought it down with a .12 bore shotgun. He then hatched a plan to surreptitiously place the dead leopard in his commanding officer’s (CO) tent while his boss was away so that the latter suffered a memorable though dreadful fright on return. However, wiser counsel prevailed and Prithipal’s wicked plot was abandoned on the apprehension that the unknowing CO could have suffered a heart attack,” Kaur told this writer.Her husband, despite his mesmerising age, is all there. His skin glows with daily oil massages and grooming by an attendant. The “young” man still insists on clipping his fingernails and does so with such deft application of force that they fly off like spent cartridges dispensed crisply from an English shotgun’s ejectors! Till just six months back, 200 ml of Scotch would daily and just past twilight regale the run up to his dinner. The rare secret of his longevity, as he claims!Adding shikari detail to the bison encounter, his eyes mist over with a recall of his fondest memory. “I had gone to hunt bison with a local guide in Madhya Pradesh. I fired upon the bison with my rifle, a .450/.400 Nitro Express by John Rigby. The guide, being a canny fellow and wise to a bison’s rages, promptly abandoned me and scaled the first tree in sight. The wounded bison charged and crashed into me, my rifle was flung with the impact but my revolver saved the day,” grinned Col Gill. He had his two teeth replaced or else the gap in his otherwise gleaming dentition would have showcased a remarkable relic of his shikar escapades!The pursuit of shikar harboured more than the danger of diehard beasts. A remarkable Army connection ensured he lived to tell this tale, too. Posted with the Gwalior Mountain Battery, the irrepressible shikari would venture into the jungles every night on a jeep. “One night, dacoits laid a tree across the jeep track. They took Prithipal and his guide prisoner. Upon learning their prisoner was from the Gwalior Battery, one of the dacoits tested Prithipal’s claim and queried if he knew a particular subedar of the Battery. That subedar, as luck would have it, was a relative of the dacoit. Upon receiving a precise reply of affirmation from Prithipal, the dacoits released him with the warning that he should not venture into the jungles again. I thanked my stars when Prithipal got back as I was very young, had a baby son and was virtually alone. To whom would I have turned had the dacoits not spared the shikari,” said Kaur.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-centurion-prithipal-gill-s-smoking-barrel/story-0OmoXBz0qrJT7dOSCYHqnN.html
19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Roundabout: The Lost Homestead – from Sargodha to Sussex||Sargodha born Dip (pronounced Deep) Singh grew up in Delhi and then settled in the UK with her BBC correspondent husband Charles Wheeler. Though she travelled far and wide, yet the memories of a Pakistan town lost to her with Partition remained etched in her mind forever. Talking to her grandchildren of what seemed to them an imagined town recalled the cold winter evenings of her childhood: “On winter evenings, we would sit around the fireplace in our parents’ bedroom, munching at dried fruits and roasted nuts. Papaji sat too. He enjoyed being by the fire but felt compelled to point out its perils by recounting a story about dacoits. A gang of dacoits robbed a house nearby but delayed their escape to sit by the fire. Its soothing warmth lulled them to sleep and so they were caught”.The little ones who had heard this story many times nodded their heads each time Dip recounted it and listened with due respect. And their mother and Dip’s daughter would get lost in deeper thought about the calm and order of her mother’s childhood and adolescence and a simple but happy life she led till the age of 15, never handling money or going to a shop or cinema hall. This and much more prompted Marina Wheeler, a lawyer and former wife of journalist politician and now UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, to put it all down in a book. Not a writer by profession, the memories of her mother’s serene world destroyed forever by the 1947 Partition pushed her to make a journey in recent times to bring back the story of the two Punjabs in India and Pakistan for her mother.Wheeler’s journeys are encased in a travelogue with a difference: The Lost Homestead, published by Hodder and Stoughton, UK, and brought to us by Hachette India. Essentially a personal journey to Wheeler’s ‘motherland’ it becomes a much larger story of the violence, Partition, displacement and rebuilding of the wounded subcontinent which saw millions of homesteads lost for all times. What was it that led Wheeler to journey back and forward in time tracing her Anglo-Indian roots? The seeds were sown when she went to see the screening of Gurinder Chadha’s film The Viceroy’s House in 2017 with her youngest child Theo, studying A-Level history. That was the year when the Seventieth anniversary of Indian Independence and Partition, which came hand in hand, was being commemorated. In fact an editor who knew that Wheeler’s mother had borne Partition and migration personally asked her to review the film.Looking back at what troubled her even as she praised the film and its impact on ordinary families was the question: Why Partition? Wheeler says: “The answer (the film claimed) was that, unbeknown to Lord Mountbatten, the outgoing Viceroy, Britain had a secret plan to partition the country, to secure oil supplies and advance its own geopolitical interests in the brewing cold war with Soviet Russia. Really? This did not tally with what Dip had told me and anything I had read.” Thus, this question led to a publisher asking her to do a book and one thing led to another and when she put pen to paper it was not just to check Chadha’s facts which did interest her though. The author says: “As I travelled across the plains of the Punjab and into the Himalayan foothills, and as I mulled over the trajectory of my mother’s own life, I discovered I was indeed on a journey. It was a journey about memory and identity, what we have, what we lose and what we rebuild.”During her travels and writings Wheeler remained in touch with her mother who chose to guide her daughter whenever she could and also suggested that the title of the book could be From Sargodha to Sussex. The book then became a gift from a daughter to her mother who never forgot her homestead. It is a matter of surprise when Dip told her that she never read a book from India, not even Vikram Seth, because that would make her homesick. This was after a lifetime in Sussex, where she chose to live alone after her husband’s death, yet home remained Sargodha. Then, in the course of three years, Dip’s health deteriorated and she was buried by her children under the weeping beech. But not after she saw the pictures of her town of Sargodha lost somewhere in the pages of history.The book, which touches themes that resonate even in these times like political change, religious extremism, migration, minorities, nationhood, identity and belonging, has been hailed in reviews in India and abroad. It has been called a personal sometimes harrowing history of Partition, and a relatable journey for many in the diaspora abroad. Closer home, author Shashi Tharoor, gives it a fine review without using difficult words: “ Marina Wheeler delves deep into the history of her family that is linked inextricably with the history of a nation. This book is more than a family memoir – it is an insightful glimpse into the way small worlds are forever changed by the impersonal currents of history”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-the-lost-homestead-from-sargodha-to-sussex/story-yL1aYl7V8OndQ1z8DbuAKL.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi MCD mayors call off strike after 13 days||The 13-day strike called by BJP mayors demanding the release of Rs 13,000 crore in dues from the Delhi government was called off on Saturday with union minister Hardeep Singh Puri offering fruit juice to the protesting lawmakers. The MCD mayors and 22 councillors from the Bharatiya Janata Party were protesting outside the chief minister’s residence for almost two weeks.The mayors were also observing a hunger strike since Thursday demanding a response from chief minister Arvind Kejriwal regarding their grievances. Union minister Puri said that the chief minister should have at least met the protesting MPs once to listen to their demands.“These mayors and leaders were not protesting for themselves or the party, they were protesting because dues of Rs 13,000 crore have not been paid and the salaries of the sanitation workers and other employees of the municipal corporations are affected,” Puri was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He also requested the chief minister to understand the concerns raised and find a solution to the problems faced by the residents of Delhi. The Delhi BJP has also said that the agitation demanding the dues from the Delhi government will continue in other forms.Delhi MCD mayors had already begun working from the protest site and also warned the Delhi government that if dues remain unpaid, then the city may face a sanitation crisis. North Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Jai Prakash on December 14 said, “The three corporations have 70,000 sanitation staff, and we lift close to 10,000 metric tonnes of waste and 100 metric tonnes of biomedical waste. But we have not been able to pay them on time. Does the AAP government want a sanitation crisis in the midst of a pandemic...

As Gaur, a resident of Gurpreet Nagar of Lohara Road, did not agree to the alliance, Shankar kidnapped him from his factory on Dheri Road in Bajda village. Gaur said Shankar and five more men turned up outside his factory in a Toyota Innova without a number plate. They forcibly dragged him into the vehicle and drove off. As Gaur’s workers informed the police, cops pursued Shankar over the phone, prompting him to throw Gaur out of the moving vehicle near Dhanansu, before fleeing towards Chandigarh Road. Gaur borrowed a mobile phone from a passer-by and informed the police, who reached the spot and rescued him.In his statement, Gaur said Shankar and his brother, Kashi, used to work for him, but he sacked them as Kashi had an eye on his daughter.“Since then, Shankar has been forcing me to solemnise the marriage of my daughter with his brother. As I did not relent, he kidnapped and beat me up,” he alleged.ASI Harjit Singh, who is investigating the case, said they had registered a case under Sections 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) of the Indian Penal Code against Shankar and his five unidentified accomplices.

Mayor Junaid Mattu tweeted: “Have noticed that a large number of people are seen in public places and on public transport without masks. Wearing of face masks when you step out of your homes is mandatory under Covid-19 guidelines.

19-12-2020||Kolkata||Amit Shah does not understand the reality of West Bengal politics: TMC MP||Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Kalyan Banerjee took a swipe at Amit Shah, stating that the Union Home Minister does not understand the politics of West Bengal and that Mamata Banerjee would come to power for a third term ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections in 2021. “Amit Shah doesn’t understand the reality of West Bengal politics. Mamata Banerjee will come in power for the third time. People have inbuilt confidence in her,” he said. The Trinamool MP also took a swipe at Shah’s criticism against family-centric politics, implying that the Home Minister’s own son was in a top position in the Board of Control for Cricket (BCCI) in India thanks to his influence. “Amit Shah speaks of family-centric politics of others. Let me remind you, isn’t Adhikari from an influential political family? Your son too is a top official of BCCI on whose influence?”, he said. Suvendu Adhikari, along with other former TMC leaders, publicly joined the Bharatiya Janata Party during a public address delivered by the Home Minister in West Bengal’s Paschim Medinipur district. Adhikari had quit West Bengal’s ruling party after months of discontentment. He was one of the most powerful leaders of the TMC and had played an influential role in the Nandigram constituency that had helped Mamata Banerjee come to power, ending the CPI(M)’s three-decade long rule in 2011. Amit Shah claimed in his rally that the BJP would come to power in the state with 200 seats and slammed the chief minister for accusing the BJP of inducing defection, also stating that she would be left alone by the time election comes. “Senior party members are leaving TMC. Didi accuses BJP of inducing party members to defect. But I want to ask her when she quit Congress to form TMC, was it not defection? This is just the start. She will be left alone by the election,” he said. The TMC and the BJP are the two main rivals for power ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections scheduled to be held during April-May. The BJP had a poor showing in the state’s previous assembly election but the party won 19 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/amit-shah-does-not-understand-the-reality-of-west-bengal-politics-tmc-mp/story-Mlt0HDxgAfHAMEs0ze1ODL.html

19-12-2020||Kolkata||‘Get over narrow politics of regionalism’: Amit Shah targets Trinamool Congress||Home Minister Amit Shah said on Saturday that revolutionary Khudiram Bose is as much a pride for the whole of India as he is of Bengal, hitting out at those indulging in “narrow” politics of regionalism.Garlanding the statue of Khudiram at the freedom fighter’s ancestral residence here, Shah said that he has inspired the youths of the country with his slogan ‘Vande Mataram’ while he was hanged by the British in 1908 at the age of 18.“I want to tell those who are doing narrow politics in Bengal that Khudiram Bose is as much a pride of India as he is of Bengal,” he said.He said that freedom fighter Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil, who gave his life for the country, was also as much a son of Uttar Pradesh as he was of Bengal.In an indirect dig at the ruling Trinamool Congress, he said that those indulging in politics of regionalism should overcome it.Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and other leaders of her party have often accused the BJP of bringing in “outsiders” to West Bengal ahead of assembly elections, likely in April-May next year.Shah said that those brave sons of the country who fought and made great sacrifices for Independence together “could never have imagined such narrow politics of regionalism”.Maintaining that the country can never forget the contributions of Bengal and its brave men in the freedom struggle, Shah said that the future generations will be inspired to work for the cause of the nation by the supreme sacrifice made by Khudiram Bose.“With Geeta in his hands, Khudiram Bose had walked up the podium where he was hanged,” the BJP leader said, remembering one of the youngest freedom fighters to have been executed by the British imperialists.Shah said that Khudiram was so popular among the people that some weavers had started weaving his name on clothes, which became an inspiration for the youths of Bengal to join the freedom movement.Arriving at the ancestral house of Khudiram after landing at Midnapore town from Kolkata in a helicopter, the home minister greeted the revolutionary’s family members with shawls and mementos.“I am having the feeling of a new consciousness on having had the opportunity to have touched this sacred soil on my forehead,” he said.“I want to tell the youths that though we have not had the occasion to give our lives for the country, we have got the opportunity to live for the nation. We should endeavour for building a strong and secure India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Shah said.The home minister interacted with the family members of Khudiram Bose for some time before visiting the centuries- old Siddheswari Mata temple nearby.He paid floral obeisance to the goddess and performed ‘aarti’.

19-12-2020||City||West Bengal woman reunited with family after four years||Leela Tamang, 49, who went missing from Bagdogra in West Bengal in January 2017, has finally been reunited with her family. The credit for tracing her and reuniting her with her family goes to the anti-human trafficking cell of the Haryana Police crime branch. Leela, who was living at Nari Niketan, Mashobra in Shimla, had gone missing from a hospital at Bagdogra near Siliguri on January 25, 2017. Her daughter Sanjana Rai and son Krishnan Tamang saw their mother after almost four years when they reached Shimla to take her back home. Sanjana said her mother was mentally unstable and had been admitted to the hospital at Bagdogra for treatment when she went missing. On seeing her children, Leela was overwhelmed and said, “I just can’t describe the feeling of seeing my children again.” “We lodged a complaint with the police at Bagdogra after she went missing. We made every effort to look for her and even launched a campaign on social media but in vain. We had lost hope till we got a call the other day,” says Krishnan. Reuniting families gives me immense joy: Cop Haryana Police assistant sub inspector Rajesh Kumar of the anti-human trafficking cell says his team gathered records of missing persons and while researching on it traced Leela to Shimla. Over the years, Rajesh says he has reunited more than 500 families across India. “I feel I’ve been sent by God to reunite families. It gives me immense joy. In Himachal Pradesh alone, I have reunited 30 members with their families. They include missing children,” he says. “In this case, we got details of the woman from Bagdogra police station and matched the records with Nari Niketans in the region and were able to trace her to Mashobra. We shared Leela’s pictures with her daughter and she confirmed they were her mother’s,” he says. The family left for Siliguri soon after they were reunited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/west-bengal-woman-reunited-with-family-after-four-years/story-swZOw2ipCH9Fcq9BtI78YL.html

The money will be mainly spent on amenities like water, road, sewage and solid waste management, to create basic facilities which residents of these 23 areas residents want badly. According to Prashant Waghmare, PMC’s city engineer, “Corporation had sent a detailed note in 2015 about development of 34 villages to be merged in PMC. Of these 34 areas, 11 were merged in 2017 while a proposal has been put forward to merge the 23 more areas.” In 2014, the civic body had sent letter to state government that it will require Rs 5,740 crore to carry out amenities in 34 villages. (HT has a copy of the letter). According to Waghmare, the civic body has estimated that there would have been a 10 per cent rise every year in the expenditure, taking the overall amount to Rs 9000 crore. “It is a challenge for PMC to develop upcoming areas which are unplanned. We will have to take a lot of effort in every aspect of development - from planning to execution,” said Waghmare. According to another civic official, the PMC requires Rs 4,598 crore for water supply road and solid waste management and drainage system. The other money will be spent for developing amenities like garden, playground, schools and administration. V G Kulkarni, superintendent of the road department, said, “Without a development plan, we cannot build a good quality road network. Right now, we can repair and maintain existing roads in inclusive areas.” Suresh Jagtap, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We have not estimated the water quota yet, but the existing quota is not enough for the new areas. We have to make provision for these inclusions.” Sanjay Gawade, acting head of solid waste management, said, “We will have to develop a proper garbage collection system and acquire land to set up new processing plants. At present, there is no proper system in these villages. Generation of garbage has been increased due to urbanisation in these areas. The local body has no system for solid waste management. We will have to set it up.” Besides these basic facilities, the PMC will have to build social infrastructure like education, health, parks, and community halls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-prepares-rs-9-000-cr-plan-to-develop-newly-included-villages/story-WQiVHtDgxcXTF1UmL5RneL.html
19-12-2020||Pune||NHS: 27 per cent married women in state have experienced spousal violence||A total of 27 per cent married women in the state have experienced violence by a spouse, according to the National Health Survey (NHS). The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) states that the rate of crime against women in Pune is 58.1. Also, cruelty by husband or relatives has a rate of 13.6 as per NCRB for Pune city. Speaking on violence against young girls, activist Kiran Moghe said that under sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO), there is relatively more awareness about child abuse.. According to the NHS, young women of 18-29 years who have experienced sexual violence by age 18 are 6.2 per cent in Maharashtra. The percentage has shown an increase from 2.9 in the last survey which was released in 2015-16. “The reporting has increased. There is greater awareness among the public as well as the police about these cases. And police are also sensitive and proactive towards the victims which is one of the reasons for the increase in reporting. Also, there is an increase in sexual violence also,” said Moghe. Talking about spousal violence, Moghe said that married women understand consent and so they understand rape as well. “Marital rape is evident as many women talk about it. There is enough awareness about it. Spousal violence that is physical, as well as sexual violence in a marriage, is affecting a lot of women and the numbers speak for themselves,” said Moghe. She further added that marital rape should be recognised by law. “We have laws in place which deal with rape. But there is a need to recognise marital rape and it should be publicised like other laws. So that the victims can get justice,” said Moghe. According to Varsha Deshpande, activist and lawyer, as nuclear families have increased the need to intervene in case of domestic abuse has decreased. “No one wants to interfere with the family matters of others. Also, communication between families has decreased. So we can see an increase in spousal violence,” said Deshpande.

19-12-2020||Pune||“Issues with data” may have led to 80 per cent unpaid traffic fine in 2020||The citizens of Pune have failed to make payments on 80 per cent of traffic violation cases registered in the city in the past year, despite a lockdown in place. The per cent of unpaid fines for traffic violations has gone up from 64.34 per cent in 2019 to 79.59 per cent in the second week of December 2020. The number of cases of traffic rule violations has reduced, however, by a thin margin in 2020 as compared to 2019 and 2018, according to data provided by Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), traffic, Pune. “The unpaid fines this year are almost 80 per cent as per the data. The amount of the unpaid fines is Rs 59,96,12,400 and the collection of paid fines was Rs 15,37,10,853 since January 1. The maximum number of cases are for no parking, helmet use, signal jumping,” said DCP Shrirame on Thursday. Even though the annual number of cases is less than the past two years owing to the vehicle movement restriction during the lockdown, the number of annual cases in which the fines have remained unpaid has remained constant. At the end of 2019, 14,67,211 violations were unpaid for. A traffic police official pointed out that there are multiple issues with the data used for sending information about violations to violators. For example, the contact information is missing, or the number seen in the online system is misread by traffic officials sending the message. While the traffic police officials blame the regional transport office (RTO), the RTO officials have a different story to tell. “The data is not provided by us. The National Information Centre (NIC), through the road transport ministry is the custodian and provider of that data. We do get the data when new vehicles are registered. But, the under V4 system, which has been in place since April 1, 2019, every government agency involved in the process has access to it,” said Sanjay Sasane, deputy regional transport officer, Pune. The vehicle numbers which were purchased before 2007, and are still owned by the same person, are yet to be digitised. Therefore, those numbers are missing from the RTO and police’s online system. “We could not finalise an agency to undertake that task. If those numbers have been transferred, they have entered the system. However, the ones which are still in the same person’s name as in 2007, are yet to be digitised. If the police find such numbers in violation and are not able to find their contact details, they can send the numbers to us and we will manually find and digitise them immediately,” said Sasane. The numbers which are charged for traffic rule violations, and have remained unpaid, can face action as it can reflect on their vehicle record. The traffic police or the RTO officials, either one of them can mark the vehicle number owner as “wanted”, according to RTO officials. “The police can themselves mark it as wanted. But if they send us the license numbers, we can mark them too. Upon request from the police, we can also cancel the license,” said Sasane. When the violator has to undertake any routine work like license renewal, insurance renewal, transfer of ownership done, the violations committed using those numbers in any part of the state will reflect on their registration numbers. According to said Prashant Inamdar, convener of a citizen group called “Pedestrian First”, most of these fines must be e-challans. “When traffic police put a nakabandi, the pending fines are paid. There could be a reluctance to pay fines but there are 2-3 aspects that need attention. I am not sure whether the police have the mechanism which smoothly delivers the challan for the violation to the offender. This must be the biggest reason for the non-payment of fines. The RTO data for contact details of offenders is most likely insufficient and not getting updated. The physical delivery of the challans and delivery of it on the phone number need robust, updated information. There is also a possibility that the people who have received the intimation do not pay, but a major issue is whether the challan is falling in the right hands within a reasonable time period. There needs to be a fool-proof result-oriented delivery system to solve this issue,” Inamdar said. Do you have a pending fine on your vehicle? -If you are not sure about whether there is a fine on your vehicle or not, go to mahatrafficechallan.gov.in and check your vehicle number -Make sure to check the image attached with the violation, if there is one against it, and make sure it is your vehicle and location in the image -If the fine is verified, pay it and clear your dues -Payment can be made using online payment options or approach a traffic police official deployed on the street and swipe your debit card -If the fine is not verified, send details of the fine to cctvtrafficpune@gmail.com. The police will reverse the fine. Header: Breakup of violations and dues Info: The amount of the unpaid fine is Rs 59,96,12,400 and the collection of paid fines was Rs 15,37,10,853 since January 1.

19-12-2020||Kolkata||By the time Bengal goes to polls, you’ll be left alone, Amit Shah warns Mamata at Midnapore rally||Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday challenged Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee at a rally in Midnapore and said that she will find herself facing the BJP all by herself by the time West Bengal goes to polls next year. Shah said, “Mamata Banerjee keeps on saying that BJP forces other politicians to switch sides and join BJP. I want to ask the chief minister if she remembers she was also a member of the Congress party before she formed Trinamool Congress. Today several leaders from Congress, CPI(M) and Trinamool Congress have joined BJP because they believe in the developmental work of the BJP and the leadership of prime minister Narendra Modi.”He further added, “This is just the beginning, by the time the state goes to polls, you’ll be facing the Bharatiya Janata Party alone.”Shah also took a jibe at Trinamool Congress leader and MP Abhishek Banerjee saying that the chief minister is always looking forward to install her nephew as the next chief minister of West Bengal. He said, “You took the slogan of Maa Mati Manush and used it to extort the people of Bengal. You paved the path for appeasement politics and nepotism in Bengal. You chose to ignore the future of more than 10 crore Bengali people and then ignored the cries of Bengal’s unemployed youth. You chose to concentrate on how to install your nephew as the next chief minister of this state.”He also alleged that Bengal’s farmers are not able to avail the benefits of Centre’s schemes because the state government decided to not implement those schemes. He said, “If the farmers of Bengal do not vote out the Trinamool Congress from power, they will not be able to avail the benefits of Centre’s schemes. Farmers here have said that they have not received the Rs 6000 that is guaranteed under the agricultural schemes designed for farmers by the Modi government.”Shah also targeted other TMC leaders and said, “Several TMC leaders said that in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP will not be able to win a single seat from Bengal but we won in 18 seats across Bengal. When the results of the 2021 legislative assembly elections are out, chief minister Mamata Banerjee can see for herself that BJP will form the government by winning more than 200 seats.”“You promised development in Bengal. There has been no development in the state and the amount of money the prime minister sent for developmental schemes has been used to fill the pockets of anti-social elements,” Shah further added. Shah is on a two-day visit to West Bengal to take stock of BJP’s preparations ahead of 2021 Bengal legislative assembly elections.Suvendu Adhikari, Trinamool Congress rebel leader, also joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in the presence of the union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday at the rally in Midnapore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/by-the-time-bengal-goes-to-polls-you-ll-be-left-alone-amit-shah-warns-mamata-at-midnapore-rally/story-F9OdGbBXrlmuceFwb3eeRO.html
19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers uproot BJP workers’ tent in Fatehabad for fast backing farm laws||Raising slogans against the BJP, farmers uprooted a tent put up by party workers in Fatehabad on Saturday during their day-long hunger strike in support of the three farm laws and their demand for Haryana’s share of water from Punjab through the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal. BJP district chief Baldev Groha and other party leaders were present when the farmers showed them black flags, raised slogans and uprooted the tent. They left the venue under tight police security. The state BJP announced a day’s fast and dharna at district headquarters to counter the farmers’ protest against the Centre’s new farm laws and to demand the construction of the SYL Canal in Punjab and its share of water. Sirsa MP Sunita Duggal, Fatehabad MLA Duda Ram and Ratia MLA Laxman Napa did not join the protest on Saturday. HISAR MP SKIPS PARTY PROTEST A day after his father extended support to the protesting farmers against the farm laws, BJP’s Hisar MP Brijendra Singh skipped the day-long hunger strike. State agriculture minister JP Dalal led the protest in Bhiwani, while Haryana BJP chief OP Dhankar observed the protest in Jhajjar. In a video message, Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhry of the Congress hit out at the BJP for trying to divide farmers of Punjab and Haryana. “The BJP can do one thing, and that is to create a division among farmers. But the farmers have seen their real face. I want to ask the Haryana agriculture minister why did his party fail to take a single step to bring the SYL water to Haryana despite being in power for six years? The minister should ask his government to send water in the Hansi-Butana canal so that farmers of southern Haryana can benefit,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-uproot-bjp-workers-tent-in-fatehabad-for-fast-backing-farm-laws/story-K9mX5OI10Dgqzwn40P2IqJ.html
19-12-2020||Kolkata||TMC rebel Suvendu Adhikari joins BJP in presence of union minister Amit Shah at Midnapore rally||Trinamool Congress (AITMC) rebel leader Suvendu Adhikari on Friday joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the presence of union minister Amit Shah at a rally in Midnapore. Adhikari left Trinamool Congress alleging that the party has become corrupt and there is ‘extremely deep rot’ within the party. BJP Bengal chief Dilip Ghosh, leader Mukul Roy and senior leader Kailash Vijayvargiya were also present in the ceremony with union minister Amit Shah. Shah is on a two-day visit to Bengal to take stock of BJP’s preparations ahead of the 2021 legislative assembly elections. Adhikari after joining the ceremony said that if the same government which rules Delhi does not rule Bengal then it will hurt the state’s economic prospects. Adhikari said, “If the same government which rules in Centre does not rule West Bengal then it will hurt the state’s chances of development and economic prosperity.”Adhikari also questioned chief minister Mamata Banerjee regarding her opposition towards Bharatiya Janata Party and reminded her that she was a partner of the NDA-led government when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister. He also recalled that he was introduced to Amit Shah in 2014 in Delhi by Uttar Pradesh health minister Siddharth Nath Sinha. He also pointed out that despite knowing several BJP leaders not a single one of them ever asked him to switch sides. Adhikari also said, “When I was ill with Covid-19, the party (TMC) for whom I worked for 21 years did not feel the need to ask me how was I doing. It was only Amit Shah who felt the need to inquire about my health.”The TMC rebel leader cited that who dares to oppose the hierarchy in Trinamool faces the wrath of the chief minister. He said people like Mukul Roy, Dilip Ghosh and Arjun Singh has been subjected to arrests under false cases because they dared to raise their voice against Banerjee. Adhikari also said that Banerjee will not be able to defeat BJP using police as her tool and in the upcoming elections BJP will replace the Trinamool Congress to form a government in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-rebel-suvendu-adhikari-joins-bjp-in-presence-of-union-minister-amit-shah-at-midnapore-rally/story-BVblwwcFQ6y0SXLOu2HC3K.html
19-12-2020||Ranchi||Maoists attack Jharkhand coal project, seek suspension of mining||In a late night strike, suspected members working for the outlawed Tritiya-Sammelan Prastuti Committee (TPC), a faction of CPI (Maoists), allegedly attacked the central coalfields limited (CCL)-run Tetariyakhad coal mine at Balumath in Jharkhand’s Latehar district on Friday. In a brief assault, the armed miscreants set four coal laden trucks and a bike on fire. Four drivers and cleaners also sustained bullet injuries in the indiscriminate firing. The armed miscreants fled after reinforcements from Balumath police station reached the spot. Both sides also exchanged fire for a brief period. Incidentally, the Latehar deputy commissioner Abu Imran had visited the same location around 48 hours before the attack to find out if the operations at the coal mines were running smoothly. One Pradeep Ganjhu, working in connivance with the TPC, the People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI) and a criminals’ gang led by jailed gangster Sujeet Sinha, later claimed the responsibility for the attack and warned the coal traders of more such action if they continued working without his consent. The attack assumes significance as the TPC had been posing a tough challenge for the state police by calling for the stoppage of coal mining and coal transportation work for four days beginning December 13 and had put up posters and banners at many locations in Latehar and Chatra district apart from a crowded place in the state capital of Ranchi, surprising police. Upping the ante against the TPC, the security forces had gunned down a sub zonal commander on Wednesday and seized one AK-47 and cache of ammunition and other items from the spot in Latehar district. The district police had also made elaborate security arrangements to ensure that coal mining and transportation work was not stalled. Also Read: NCW seeks report on ‘rape’ complaint against Jharkhand CM Hemant SorenThe Latehar superintendent of police (SP) Prasant Anand said, “Pradeep Ganjhu is the same man who is having a nexus with both the TPC and the PLFI besides working for the criminal gang. We have recently arrested two of his accomplices and seized the AK-47 carried by him after an encounter from Balumath area. The duo was involved in firing at coal sidings in Latehar and Chatra district.” The SP added, “This is an act of desperation by the TPC after being forced on the back foot by the security forces. They used Pradeep who is also frustrated after losing two of his close aids and the weapon. He however, will soon be neutralised.” Incidentally, the marauders selectively targeted the drivers and the cleaners. They spared the traders and transporters and the officials. “They especially targeted the drivers and cleaners as the act was aimed at creating fear for extortion,” the SP pointed out. Those injured were identified as cleaners Pintu Yadav and Suraj Ganjhu; driver Anil Yadav and clerk Bansropan Ganjhu. After the first aid at the community health centre at Balumath, they were shifted to Ranchi for better treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/maoists-attack-jharkhand-coal-project-seek-suspension-of-mining/story-SY9oZIV8xULePBFOxiUkdJ.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi mayors likely to call off stir outside CM’s residence today||Mayors and councillors of Delhi’s three municipal corporations, who have been sitting on a protest outside the chief minister’s residence for the past 13 days, are likely to leave the protest venue on Saturday following court orders. Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri is expected to meet the mayors and councillors outside CM’s residence around 3pm on Saturday. After that, the protest will be called off, said a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader.Mayors and BJP councillors have been protesting outside the CM’s residence since December 7, demanding pending dues worth Rs 13,000 crore. The BJP-led corporations claim that they are unable to pay salaries to their employees as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government has not released the dues. On Saturday, South Corporation Mayor Anamika Singh, who was on an indefinite hunger strike, was admitted to Hindu Rao Hospital after her condition deteriorated. She is said to be stable right now.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash, who was undergoing treatment at the protest site, said that they have been served notice by the Delhi Police to vacate the protest venue. “We are law-abiding citizens. We will follow the court’s order and leave the venue. But our protest will continue in a different form. We will now take this battle for the rights of municipal employees to each ward,” said Jai Prakash.Delhi BJP media head Naveen Kumar said that Puri, along with party’s state unit chief Adesh Gupta, will visit the mayors and councillors outside CM’s residence at 3 pm. “It is unfortunate that Delhi CM couldn’t find time to meet these people for the past 13 days. A decision to take this protest forward in a different way will be taken soon,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-mayors-likely-to-call-off-stir-outside-cm-s-residence-today/story-tj9WbYr5tv1x5usstD6xmO.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||Seems third Covid-19 wave in Delhi has been brought under control: Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said Delhi seems to have overcome the third wave of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said from a peak of around 8,600 fresh cases on a single day, Delhi’s corona situation seems to have “significantly” improved with only 1,133 new cases being reported in the last 24 hours. He also claimed that each and every Covid-19 test conducted in Delhi is genuine and no “fraud” was done, as reported in some other states. “There was a time in November when of every 100 persons tested for Covid-19, over 15 people used to test positive. The positivity rate back then was 15.26%. Today, the positivity rate has come down to 1.3%. This is probably the lowest in the country. In today’s health bulletin, which will be released shortly, the total tests done in 24 hours was 87,000,” he said. Kejriwal further said there was a time when Delhi had 45,000 active Covid-19 cases, which came down to nearly 12,000 on Saturday. The recovery rate of the city is nearly 96.5%. On November 19, Delhi recorded the highest number of fatalities with 131 deaths in a single day. On Saturday, the number of Covid-19 deaths in as single day was 36. “In Delhi, testing was most important for us to fight Covid-19. I am proud of our doctors, officers and other corona warriors who have helped us increase the city’s testing numbers. Till August 20, Delhi used to conduct about 20,000 Covid-19 tests every day. When the second wave came, we increased this to 60,000 tests per day in just about 10 days. When the third wave came, we increased this further to 90,000 tests per day. We tested and isolated people, which has been our main Covid-19 management strategy,” Kejriwal said. The Delhi chief minister said the current daily figure of about 90,000 Covid-19 tests per day in the city is not only the highest in the country, but is also one of the highest across the world. “Today, Delhi is conducting 4,500 tests per million population every day. Uttar Pradesh is testing only 670 people per million daily. Gujarat is testing 850 people per million every day. In the USA, 4,300 tests per million are being conducted every day. England is testing more than Delhi, with 4,800 tests per million,” Kejriwal said. He reiterated that Delhi was the first in the world to introduce the home isolation system, which reduced the load on the city’s hospitals manifold. He cited example of New York city of how despite having around 5,600 cases per day the city had patients lying in hospital corridors for want of treatment. Kejriwal said that even when Delhi had 8,600 cases on a single day, the city had over 7,000 beds vacant for Covid. He also recalled how Delhi was the first to start plasma therapy which helped keep the number of deaths low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/seems-third-covid-19-wave-in-delhi-has-been-brought-under-control-kejriwal/story-f8PhCdIfBaJ5hkn7Oy9QHO.html

The BJP too, in its poll manifesto, had announced a free corona vaccine for residents of the state.The chief minister asked the officials to formulate plans for Covid vaccination and manpower utilisation in such a way that other medical operations are carried out uninterrupted.“Covid vaccination has to be carried out on the patterns of Pulse Polio campaign with full alertness and it has to be monitored at district magistrate level every day,” said Kumar.Lauding the work done by the health department, the chief minister said that increased testing has helped in containing the spread of the virus.

Amit Shah is scheduled to address a public rally at Midnapore on Saturday. A number of TMC leaders are likely to join the BJP during this rally, reported news agency PTI.2. A day before his visit, a controversy erupted after placards with his picture above Rabindranath Tagore’s were found all over Bolpur and Santiniketan in Bengal’s Birbhum district. Shah is slated to visit Bolpur on Sunday.3. The placards were removed after local people and students of Visva Bharati, Bengal’s only national university set up by Tagore, raised objections.4. Meanwhile, the tussle between the Centre and the state over the alleged breach of law and order situation in the state during BJP chief JP Nadda’s visit continued. Nadda’s convoy was attacked during his visit to the state. While the Centre has summoned state officials over the attack, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said it was staged as BJP leaders always come with their own security.5. It was decided in a party meeting last month that the Shah and Nadda would visit West Bengal every month till the assembly elections, likely in April-May, are over.6. Nadda was on a day-long visit to the state in October and came on a two-day tour last week, while Shah was in the state for two days in November before this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/amit-shah-in-kolkata-for-a-2-day-visit-all-you-need-to-know/story-BFTFss7dzmlRLkOX2rUR4N.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Saddam’s gajar ka halwa||It’s such a deathly cold evening that the mere sight of steaming hot gajar halwa (carrot pudding), here in this central Delhi market, brings instant relief.Only later does the attention shift to the boy manning the cart. His face is hidden behind a mask but his eyes—so huge—seem to speak for his entire being. In such a chilly hour, he ought to be snuggled inside a cushy quilt at home, with one of his parents perhaps serving him a bowl of this very same halwa.Saddam giggles.“My mummy is dead, my papa is ill,” he says matter-of-factly.Saddam says he is 18. He arrived in the Delhi region “many years ago” from his village in Bahraich, UP, where his father still lives. He works for a sweet seller in Noida, in neighbouring UP, and sells the freshly made gulab jamun and carrot halwa on the street every evening from 5 to 8. He gets Rs5,000 monthly, he says.Responding to queries, Saddam replies that he lives by himself in a small room in Noida given to him by his employer. “I have an elder brother, he lives and works in Karkardooma.” That’s in east Delhi, a few miles away from his address. The brothers rarely meet. But Saddam does have friends, he says, “I meet them when I have time.”Usually, Saddam’s street vending is confined to a few Noida sectors but today his employer sent him across the interstate border to this Delhi market. “It took me two hours to cycle here,” he says. The cart is fitted with a bicycle. After finding a spot to park his stall, Saddam went on to lit the stove to reheat the desserts.Gazing towards the halwa platter, he says he can barely recall his mother. “If mummy ever cooked gajar halwa for me, I don’t remember it.”On the possibility of having dreams for the future, he stays silent, smiles shyly and shakes his head.Now a female beggar gets up from the footpath nearby, and silently hands over a Rs10 note gesturing towards the halwa. Saddam deftly picks out a disposable bowl, fills it with a ladle of halwa, and gets his first transaction of the evening done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-saddam-s-gajar-ka-halwa/story-ZLiKuAkQX4jhsOBsDtj5OJ.html
19-12-2020||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai civic body clears redevelopment of 4 housing societies||In a major relief for the residents of dilapidated buildings in the city, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has sanctioned the redevelopment of buildings in four housing societies in the city on Friday.The proposal for these buildings was stuck in alleged bureaucratic red tape and political interference for more than five years. The decision has now given hopes to more than four lakh other residents residing in 3,500 dangerous buildings across Navi Mumbai.The approval for redevelopment was given to 31 buildings in four housing societies in Vashi and Nerul where 616 families reside. The buildings include Nivasti Tvisa Society in Sector 2, Little Flower Society in Sector 9, Utkarsh Society in Sector 9 and Panchsheel Apartment in Sector 1A in Nerul.The redevelopment issue of Cidco buildings, which are more than 30 years old and declared as extremely dangerous (C1 category) was stuck for over five years. The state government has already sanctioned 2.5 FSI for redevelopment in the city and recently, the CM Uddhav Thackeray has given the green signal for granting 4 FSI, a proposal for which is being readied by Cidco.NMMC has formed an identification committee for the purpose of scrutinising redevelopment proposals of dangerous and dilapidated buildings. The committee, headed by the municipal commissioner, includes Cidco chief planner, Cidco chief engineer, superintending engineer PWD, Thane, Joint director – town planning, Konkan Division and NMMC chief engineer.NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said, “The residents of buildings declared in C1 category had constantly been following up on the redevelopment proposal submitted by them. The approval had been stuck lately due to the Covid pandemic. Now, we have taken up the issue on priority as the residents do not have a proper home of their own. The members of the identification committee personally inspected these buildings on December 15 and 17. They then submitted their report to me based on which the committee has approved the proposals for the redevelopment of the buildings in these four societies.”Bangar added that the decision to approve redevelopment plans for the four societies will benefit a large number of residents residing in them and help them get quality houses of their own.Welcoming the sanction by the civic body, BM Siraj (51), a resident of Nivasti Tvisa society, said, “We have long been suffering and waiting for the sanction for long. A lot of people in the society have no other option but to risk their lives on a daily basis by residing here. We know there is still a long way to go before we get new houses as there are several other permissions to get as well. However, this is a very important hurdle that has been crossed and the redevelopment process can finally be set in motion.”Vikas Sarote, 40, resident of Utkarsh society, added, “This is a good crucial decision by NMMC and a major relief. Hopefully, residents of other dilapidated buildings too will get their sanction early and will not face the problems we faced.”THE REDEVELOPMENT ISSUECidco constructed around 44 per cent of the total houses in Navi Mumbai. The total housing stock created in Navi Mumbai is about 3,00,000 units, out of which 1,30,000 units are built by Cidco and around 1,70,000 tenements by the private sector.There are around 55,000 people living in extremely dangerous buildings in Navi Mumbai. In all, there are around 3,500 dilapidated buildings in the city, in which around four lakh residents live.Several buildings constructed by CIDCO in Vashi, Koparkhairane, Ghansoli, Airoli, Sanpada and Nerul are in a pathetic state and have been declared dangerous by the NMMC. The residents of these buildings risk their lives daily. There have been several instances of slab, ceiling and plaster falling, injuring the residents.The state government had issued a GR on February 4, 2015 allowing 2.5 FSI for the redevelopment of dilapidated Cidco-constructed buildings. Despite almost six years having passed, the redevelopment process in the city has not really taken off yet.THE BENEFICIARIES Nivasti – 10 buildings – 160 families Little Flower – 1 building – 16 familiesUtkarsh – 3 buildings – 48 families Panchsheel – 17 buildings – 392 families||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-clears-redevelopment-of-4-housing-societies/story-6Gu2bIibHfVsNBIOnNZCXK.html

19-12-2020||Mumbai||More than 9K visit Karnala sanctuary since reopening||More than 9,000 tourists visited the Karnala bird sanctuary in Panvel within a month after it was thrown open to the tourists despite trains and buses not operational for the common people.The sanctuary, which saw close to 10,000 visitors per month before the pandemic, has now become the much sought-out destination due to its proximity to Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane and Raigad.After remaining shut for nearly eight months, the Karnala bird sanctuary was reopened on November 12. Since then, the sanctuary has received an overwhelming response. Tourists choose to visit in their private vehicles as trains are not operational for the common man.The number of tourists noticeably goes up on Saturdays and Sundays. Pradeep Chavan, range forest officer of the bird sanctuary, said, “We believe that after staying at home for a long time, people want to spend some time amidst nature, and that too without travelling much. People from Mumbai and its peripheries can come to this bird sanctuary and return in a day. Thus, it has become an ideal destination from the entire region.“Normally, around 10,000 tourists visit the sanctuary in a month during this time of the year. Since the local trains are not for all, and also there are several other restrictions, 9,084 is a huge number of us,” he said.The Karnala bird sanctuary is located along the Mumbai-Goa highway, around 10km away from Panvel city. According to the authorities, around 134 species of birds including many migratory ones are present in the sanctuary. Three rare birds – Ashy Minivet, three-toed kingfisher and Malabar Trogon – are spotted here.Chavan said, “We are following all safety and hygiene measures at the sanctuary as directed by the government. Our officials are checking the body temperature of the tourists before allowing them in. We have kept hand sanitizer at the main entrance and using it is compulsory for all. No one is allowed inside the sanctuary without wearing a mask.“Our sanitation workers clean the washrooms twice a day from Monday to Friday. On weekends, they clean them thrice a day as more people visit,” another forest official said.Three local self-help groups are operating a cafeteria inside the sanctuary. “It is compulsory for them to wear face masks and gloves and to sanitize the plates before serving the customers,” the official said.Raju Mumbaikar, an animal lover from Uran who visited the bird sanctuary last week, said, “The officials have maintained the bird sanctuary well and are also following the rules to stop the spread of Covid. No one is allowed to feed the monkeys. This rule was there even before the pandemic, but some people violated it. Now, they are strictly warning the tourists not to do it. They have even stationed their officials at different places to keep a tab on the tourists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/more-than-9k-visit-karnala-sanctuary-since-reopening/story-g3pA94CSenTpe7o4Z9FAzL.html

The demolition had started on Monday and concluded on Thursday. Prashant Gaikwad, assistant commissioner of D ward, which has jurisdiction over the area, said, “BMC demolished illegal portions of over 200 shops on the ground and first floors of the mall. The second and top floors were completed gutted in the fire. Many owners have constructed mezzanine floors in their shops, and bigger shops have been divided into smaller ones with false walls.” Earlier this week, the fire brigade had also revoked the fire no-objection certificate issued to the mall. It will not be allowed to reopen until a structural audit, declaring the structure safe for habitation, is completed. Three weeks ago, the fire brigade had submitted a preliminary inquiry report about the blaze to BMC’s standing committee. It had noted that while the mall’s blueprint showed only 344 approved galas (shops), there were 1,344 shops. Gaikwad said, “The remaining galas had been approved by the civic body’s building proposal department in 2017. However, these 200 shops had unauthorised additions and alterations to their original structures and we demolished them in the past four days.”The committee had directed the administration to not reopen the mall until all the illegalities had been removed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-portions-of-200-shops-at-south-mumbai-mall-razed/story-wrh7egDjXerbe3k6yfFmIL.html
19-12-2020||Mumbai||Low-key X’mas celebrations with most indulging in home-made delicacies||With most families working from home this year, the age-old tradition of making Christmas goodies like Jujube, Kulkul or Marzipans is back.The demand for store-bought goodies, which was increasing since the last few years, has reduced this year with most people still wary of outside food. Even those who have been making goodies at home and selling have got fewer orders this year.The city, though, has managed to prevent a second wave of Covid-19 so far, Christmas celebrations in the city still will be low-key. Most families are not expecting guests and, thus, are not indulging in large quantities of store delicacies.Penny Rathore, 47 and a resident of Kolbad, has been making Christmas goodies and selling them since the last 25 years. She said, “I take orders from other countries as well. My regular clientele remains the same. However, owing to the pandemic situation, the quantity of goodies ordered has reduced as everyone may not be visiting friends or expecting guests like earlier. Also, there are many who have started selling cakes from home. Not everyone has been financially sound post-lockdown and this has become a means to earn.”From cakes including the traditional plum cake, coconut rawa cake, date and walnut cake and the goodies like guava cheese, coconut cookies, milk cream and marshmallows are preferred during Christmas.“Sweets like jujube, kulkul and marzipan are traditional Christmas delicacies. Many households also make nankhatai and chakli. These are not very complicated recipes. However, they are time consuming, but with enough time to spare during the lockdown, I have managed to learn a few and will try them this year,” said Benita D’Silva, 39, resident of Rabodi.Many have elaborate plans to decorate the house. “As we do not really have to juggle between work and home like before, work from home has given a lot of time at hand to focus on the decorations and we are coming up with innovative ideas. But, we will not be having any guests due to the social-distancing and pandemic rules this year,” said Alex Coelho, 45, resident of Rabodi.Though people may not be visiting friends and relatives, Christmas this year surely is more about celebrating together as a family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/low-key-x-mas-celebrations-with-most-indulging-in-home-made-delicacies/story-HeoMxWSVk6EIuS0ZUXt3ZP.html

He agreed to take up the entire expenses for the ground.Mhatre spent around ₹90,000 on the ground that sprawls in an area of 4521.50sqm, since the start of this month.Mhatre visited the ground and found there was no water supply while the seating arrangements were missing. The watering activity at the ground had stopped for three years, causing the ground to dry up and releasing dust, posing problems to the residents.“The pump room had turned into a dumping ground and was not functional. I decided to buy a new pump instead of repairing the existing one. I also bought a pipe for watering the ground,” said Mhatre.Mhatre appointed two persons to keep the ground clean by giving them salary from his pocket.“There were no seating arrangements in the ground. The old benches were broken, so I fitted new ones. I have plans to paint the premises so that the entire ground is beautified,” added Mhatre.Chandrashekhar Pradhan, 77, who lives nearby, said, “I have been visiting the ground daily since the last 40 years and am happy to see the facelift Mhatre has given it. We had to close our windows to not allow dust from the ground to enter the home. Since the ground is being watered for two hours, that issue is resolved. Several senior citizens go to the ground regularly, all are glad with the change in the ground.”An officer from Dombivli KDMC office, who did not wish to be named, said, “Under budgetary allocation for the maintenance of the garden in Kalyan-Dombivli, the civic body takes up maintenance and repair works. Due to the Covid pandemic, some work got delayed. However, the repair and maintenance work will be undertaken without further delay.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dombivli-ground-receives-facelift/story-ZXmh2uIqpmBd3i6NSpabVK.html
19-12-2020||City||Apologise in 15 days or face ₹100-crore defamation suit, Thane MLA Pratap Sarnaik tells BJP leader Kirit Somaiya||Two days after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Member of Parliament (MP) Kirit Somaiya had alleged irregularities in the housing projects undertaken by Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik, the latter has issued a notice to Somaiya on Friday. The notice has stated that Somaiya must either prove the allegations or apologise before the media in 15 days, failing which Sarnaik will file a ₹100-crore defamation suit against the former MP. The notice has also stated that the allegations by Somaiya are “childish”, made with an intention to revive his political career. On Wednesday, Somaiya in a press conference had claimed that the construction at Thane’s Vihang Garden by Sarnaik’s Vihang Group is illegal. He had also alleged that the building constructed by the group does not have permissions to increase its floors from nine to 13 and that the Thane Municipal Corporation has given orders to demolish the structure. Sarnaik’s lawyer advocate Raghunath Kulkarni said, “The BJP leader has given an extremely wrong statement to the media against my client without any proof. These statements have maligned the political reputation of my client.” Replying to Somaiya’s allegations, Sarnaik had said, “The issue pertaining to the structure was resolved several years ago. When the then commissioner RA Rajeev had sent us a notice over the structure, we had explained that we have constructed a civic school in exchange of the transferable development rights (TDR).

19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chinese air force’s combat experience sketchy: Former IAF chief BS Dhanoa||Former Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said on Friday that the combat experience of China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is “very sketchy”, even as he raised concerns over the large resources available with the neighbouring country in case India goes to war with it. The former Indian Air Force chief was moderating a panel discussion on China airpower capabilities on the opening day of the fourth edition of Military Literature Festival, which is being organised in virtual mode this year. Other participants included former Air Vice Marshal Arjun Subramaniam, Group Captain Ravinder Chhatwal and Dr Ming-Shih Shen from Taiwan. Speaking amid rising tensions in eastern Ladakh, Dhanoa said China has got such a large force that whatever it loses at the battlefront can be replaced from elsewhere. The same goes for its loss of fighter aircraft. “One of the reasons we always say that (India) needs squadron strength is because we also need deep pockets to replace our attrition,” he said. However, he also raised doubts on the combat experience of Chinese air force. “Combat experience of the PLAAF is very very sketchy; there is one bombing mission they carried out in the Korean war… after that, there have been no offensive missions by them,” said Dhanoa. Air Vice Marshal Arjun Subramaniam (retd) said that unlike in 1962, when thousands of PLA troops swarmed down the Himalayan slopes in the eastern sectors and into Ladakh, this time around, “I think no such thing will happen as because every thrust will be met by significant friction on the ground”. “Outcomes (of the war) will likely be driven by the air power with a few disruptive technologies, like electronic warfare, cyber, unmanned aerial vehicles and space capabilities, emerging as important factors,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chinese-air-force-s-combat-experience-sketchy-former-iaf-chief-bs-dhanoa/story-ibrlfPxnCu0pH3U9KdxJvN.html
19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Nature of threats, wars is changing: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said that with changing times, the nature of threats and wars is also changing, adding that in the future, more security-related issues may arise before India.Inaugurating the fourth edition of Military Literature Festival through a virtual ceremony, the defence minister underlined the ever-evolving nature of warfare in global scenarios and urged people, especially youngsters, to acquaint themselves with the “defence way of life” to act as a formidable shield in case of need. “Today, a mobile is as potent a weapon as missile and our youngsters must leverage and complement our forces by leading research in cyber, biological and information domain,” he said.He added that the enemy can now reach people even without crossing any borders, and urged everyone to play the role of a soldier. “We should remain alive to these dangers and save ourselves from wrong and misleading information and save others too, and festivals like this can play a key role in this,” he saidPunjab governor VPS Badnore said that given the rich martial traditions of Punjab, it comes as no surprise that this region is a treasure trove of military events, such as the literature festival. Lt Gen TS Shergill (retd), senior adviser to the Punjab CM, lauded the Western Command headquarters for providing support in organising the festival.NN Vohra, former governor of Jammu and Kashmir, said earlier there was a sense of secrecy revolving around defence-related matters, such as sharing experiences of war and making documents shedding light on military matters. “But now, the scenario is undergoing a change and if it continues, the young generation, especially cadets in military academies, can be really inspired,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nature-of-threats-wars-is-changing-rajnath-singh/story-c2UwGrWnCr0jdHq8TMxkpL.html

If Babaji’s supreme sacrifice could not shake their conscience, then I think the government is filled with oppressors,” she said. Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the Centre should respect Baba Ram Singh’s sacrifice by accepting the farmers’ demands so that they can return home and resume their agricultural work.Farmer leaders from Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan who came to pay their respects to the Sikh preacher also echoed similar views. Manjit Singh Rai of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Doaba, said, “Since Babaji has already sacrificed his life for the protesting farmers, we urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately resolve this issue so that such incidents are not repeated in future. We cannot bear more such losses,” he added. A farmer leader from Rajashtan, Ram Pal Jat, who is the national president of Rashtriya Kisan Mahapanchayat, said, “Babaji’s supreme sacrifice has united the farmers of the entire country. PM Modi must take immediate steps to end this agitation by withdrawing these laws.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/baba-ram-singh-s-cremation-politicos-religious-leaders-farmers-urge-modi-to-resolve-issue-at-earliest/story-rSVm9NqRrHmZnTZ06wvDeO.html

19-12-2020||City||Sonia Gandhi writes to Maharashtra CM, expresses unhappiness over “diversion” of funds for SC, ST communities||Congress president Sonia Gandhi has written a letter to Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, expressing her unhappiness over the alleged non-utilisation and diversion of funds allocated for welfare of the socially backward classes in the state. She has advised Thackeray to ensure that the budget allocated for the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities are utilised for the same purpose. HK Patil, Congress’s state in-charge has confirmed the development. This is the first time that Gandhi has expressed her unhappiness over an issue in the state since the three parties formed the government last year in November. “The party had organised a conclave of leaders from socially backward classes in which some problems and suggestions have come to the fore. It was informed that sometimes the allotted funds get lapsed, or they are diverted for other uses. This should not happen as it will affect the interest of the disadvantaged sections of the society. This was specifically mentioned by Mrs Gandhi so that these sections are protected against such administrative lapses,” said Patil. He said that it is a “natural advice” given for the “effective implementation” of schemes and laws meant for disadvantaged sections. “I am sure they [the government] will take up the matter in the days to come,” Patil added and said he hopes that the CM will take the matter seriously. The development may lead to unease between the ruling MVA partners. Congress leaders have been expressing their discontent over various issues in the past one year. They have expressed their displeasure over the allocation of portfolios, the alleged secondary treatment in decision-making and the dominance of the bureaucracy in the government, which has also led to clashes between bureaucrats and ministers on a couple of occasions. However, Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said the party welcomes the advice. “We welcome the letter and the suggestion. The common minimum programme is binding on our government. In the past one year, we couldn’t do several things due to the pandemic. In the coming year, there will be progress on what was decided in the common minimum programme,” he said.In May, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi had said that the party is not the key decision maker in the state. “We are supporting the government in Maharashtra, but we are not the key decision maker there,” he had said at a news conference in response to a question on the “poor handling” of the Covid-19 pandemic in the state.

19-12-2020||Chandigarh||High court stays demolition in Sukhna catchment area||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday stayed demolition and construction activity in the Sukhna catchment area besides the recovery of ₹100 crore fine each imposed on governments of Punjab and Haryana.The order was passed by high court bench of justice Jaswant Singh and justice HS Sidhu on the plea of Kansal Enclave Residents Welfare Association, Mohali, which had sought review of the March 2 order of a division bench. At that time, the HC had fined both states ₹100 crore each for causing damage to the catchment area and ordered demolition of all structures in catchment area as demarcated by the Survey of India in 2004 besides directing the authorities that owners whose building plans were approved be relocated and compensated with ₹25 lakh each. The March order had come in a 2009 suo motu petition initiated in view of depleting water level in the lake. The order could have resulted in widespread demolitions in Nayagaon and Kansal areas, where even some upscale residential pockets have come up.“The detailed order is awaited. But the court said that demolition as ordered in March 2020 is stayed. No new kind of construction would come up. Even for renovation, residents will have to take court’s permission. The fine imposed on Punjab and Haryana has been stayed,” senior standing counsel, UT, Pankaj Jain said after the hearing. What the residents’ body contendedThe residents’ body had told court that the March order was passed without making them party in the case. There was no consensus ever drawn regarding veracity of the 2004 map according to which court had taken decision on the catchment area, it was contended. The map was questioned as well as objected to not only regarding its technical aspects in terms of accuracy but also disputed in respect of its adoption. Objections to the map were neither considered throughout the pendency of matter nor in the final order of March, the petitioner had told court. The court was also told that the catchment area is directly coming in conflict with the Master Plan of 2021 notified by Punjab for Nayagaon area, which has statutory force. However, court in March declared two master plans of Punjab and Haryana as illegal, which regulated construction in the catchment area.In March, the court had also declared Sukhna a living entity. Fine was imposed as court found that “state connived with the defaulters” in allowing construction. The chief secretaries of both states and adviser, Chandigarh, were directed to constitute high-power committees to fix the responsibilities of officers who permitted large-scale unauthorised construction.The court had also directed the ministry of environment and forest to notify at least 1 km area from the boundary of Sukhna wildlife sanctuary as eco-sensitive zone. The lake was created by Le Corbusier in 1958. By 1988, 66% of the original water holding capacity of the lake was lost due to silting. Following this, check dams were constructed in the catchment area. But the water-level has once again started going down. The man-made lake now has a capacity of around 500 hectare metres against the original capacity of over 1,074 hectare metres. The lake’s depth is 12 to 13 feet. On the north side, the lake is surrounded by 26 square kilometre area of wildlife sanctuary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/high-court-stays-demolition-in-sukhna-catchment-area/story-CpaNLLF7p1cFwkKXobK7OM.html

19-12-2020||City||Khattar’s relative eyewitness in forest official’s assault case||A nephew of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was amongst the two eyewitnesses present when a divisional forest officer (DFO), VS Gill, allegedly assaulted Chief Conservator of Forests (North), G Raman on December 7 at the latter’s Ambala office. The names of Ramit (Khattar) and his friend and BJP worker from Barara, Rajat (Malik) figure in the first information report (FIR) lodged at Baldev Nagar police station on December 9. The FIR, based on a complaint by the Chief Conservator of Forests (North) G Raman, reads: “It is brought to your kind notice that on December 7, Virender Gill, divisional forest officer, Kurukshetra, had misbehaved and manhandled with the undersigned and threatened life in the presence of persons namely, Ramit, son of Jagdish, a resident of Delhi, and Rajat, son of Rajender, a resident of Barara, Ambala, in my office room at Forest Complex, Company Bagh, Ambala City.” When asked whether he was a relative of the Haryana chief minister, Ramit replied in the affirmative. Ramit Khattar is the son of the chief minister’s brother, Jagdish Khattar. Asked about the reason behind his presence at the office of the Chief Conservator of Forests (North), Ramit said: “I run my own business. This incident is not connected in any way to my being a relative of the Haryana chief minister. My friend Rajat had some issues pertaining to the forests department. Actually, it was regarding the growth of tree branches outside his establishment. I was on my way to Chandigarh and stopped by at Ambala to accompany him to the office of the Chief Conservator of Forests.” When asked about the presence of the chief minister’s relative at his office, G Raman said: “I didn’t know his surname. In fact, Ramit never introduced himself as Ramit Khattar. The other person Rajat was the one who had a grievance and had come to my office to get it redressed. They are in no way connected with the affairs or business of the forests department. They are private individuals.” Ramit’s friend, Rajat Malik, who claims to run a small business in Barara, said that he went to the office of the Chief Conservator of Forests for redressal of a grievance. He said that he went to meet the officer personally with his friend Ramit from Delhi to complain about a tree’s branch outside his residence after the issue was not redressed on a written complaint. He said that they had just reached the office and were explaining the issue when the incident (manhandling) happened.

19-12-2020||Mumbai||Bullet train, port project to escalate MVA-Centre tussle||The tussle between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government, over the Metro-3 car shed, is set to intensify further with the state now looking at the Centre’s ambitious Vadhavan port project.On a day the leader of Opposition, Devendra Fadnavis, slammed the Uddhav Thackeray-led government over its plan to consider building the shed at a Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) plot (see box) where a terminus for the Centre’s flagship Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project has been proposed, the state said they respect the peoples’ stance against the proposed Vadhavan port in Dahanu, Palghar district.On Friday, Thackeray called a meeting of locals from Dahanu opposing the project. On February 5, the Centre had approved setting up Vadhavan port at ₹65,544 crore as it has a natural draft of about 20m, to handle modern container vessels. Earlier, Fadnavis called the state’s BKC plan “childish”, while Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut said the Opposition need not worry about the Metro-3 car shed. Fadnavis said, “The idea of shifting the car shed to BKC will increase the project cost multiple times. The cost of building a car shed will go up to around ₹5,000 crore to ₹6,000 crore, as against ₹500 crore, following the original plan, because BKC land is very much expensive. It will also increase the annual maintenance cost by many folds and make the Metro project non-feasible.”Fadnavis also said the advisors of the Thackeray government were so bad that they will drown this government as well as the state.Hitting back at Fadnavis, Raut said, “They [Opposition] don’t need to worry about it [Metro-3 shed[. The government doesn’t need to take their advice,” he said.Meanwhile, after the meeting with Dahanu locals, state urban development minister Eknath Shinde said they respect the people’s view. “Primarily, it appears that the locals are against the project and the chief minister has taken a stand that the state government respects their viewpoint and are with them,” Shinde told reporters.Shiv Sena MP from Palghar, Rajendra Gavit, who was also part of the meeting, said that it is a destructive project for the locals. “The project requires around 5,000 acres, hence, locals are of the view that they will lose their farm land. Similarly, local fishermen are concerned that it will bring an adverse impact on their traditional business and deprive them of their livelihood,” Gavit said.“The decision of the Dahanu Taluka Environment Protection Authority (DTEPA) would be very important as the authority has to clear the project first, because Dahanu is considered as an environmentally sensitive area,” he added.Dahanu taluka has been enjoying special protection since 1991, as the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) declared it an ecologically fragile area, restricting hazardous industries, among other things and also formed DTEPA. The notification was passed following the directives of the Supreme Court.Currently, DTEPA is being headed by the state urban secretary Bhushan Gagrani. MoEFCC now wants to scrap DTEPA and has filed an application before the apex court.BJP leader Ashish Shelar alleged that the intention of the Thackeray government is to halt development projects such as the bullet train .“The leaders and officials in the state government have taken the decision (to explore BKC plot as one of the options for car shed) with ill intention. Proposing the car shed at a site where it is not possible to build clearly means they want to halt the bullet train project, rather than completing the Metro-3 project. They are trying to stop Mumbai’s development,” Shelar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bullet-train-port-project-to-escalate-mva-centre-tussle/story-6ZSwphyUnlcrIpYGkyQj5J.html
19-12-2020||City||Seven mayoral, 101 ward candidates in final list for Ambala MC polls||The sub-divisional magistrate (city)-cum-returning officer, Sachin Gupta, on Friday allocated party symbols to the contesting candidates for ward and mayoral seats for the Ambala municipal corporation elections.As per the final list, there are seven mayoral candidates and around 101 candidates for the 20 wards in the fray.Gupta, in the presence of observer J Ganeshan, police observer DIG Arun Nehra and AROs alloted party symbols to all the candidates and performed the randomisation of electronic voting machines in a videographed process.The mayoral candidates include Bharatiya Janata Party-Jananayak Janata Party (BJP-JJP) candidate Dr Vandana Sharma, Congress candidate Meena Agarwal, Haryana Jan Chetna Party (HJCP) candidate Shakti Rani Sharma, Haryana Democratic Front (HDF) candidate Amisha Chawla, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate Jolly and two independent candidates Gurmeet Kaur and Veena Dhall.On Thursday, the scrutiny of the nomination papers was done and the papers of nearly 12 candidates, including a mayoral candidate, were rejected that led to late-night drama as a few of them staged a sit-in outside the residence of DC-cum-election officer Ashok Kumar Sharma in chilling weather. However, the DC later assured a proper hearing.On this, Gupta, in a statement said that such candidates were called before the observers for a hearing on Friday.“The observers considered the cancellation of the nomination papers was correct that was done following the criteria set by the returning officer. Now, voting will be held on December 27 and counting of votes will be done on December 30,” Gupta said.The mayor seat in Ambala is reserved for women candidates and the residents will vote directly for the seat for the first time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/seven-mayoral-101-ward-candidates-in-final-list-for-ambala-mc-polls/story-1x0B2hxVdyHh7iV0vSmCYK.html
19-12-2020||Mumbai||Over 1.85 lakh seats vacant after third round of FYJC admission in Mumbai Metropolitan Region; special round on December 20||Nearly 1.85 lakh first-year junior college (FYJC) seats remain vacant in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region(MMR) after the third admission round concluded on Friday. Of the 45,402 students who were allotted college seats in the third list, which was declared on December 15, only 14,074 students took admission. Friday was the last day for students to confirm their admissions in the third round. After the third round, junior colleges have also been allowed to surrender the vacant seats under various quotas like minority, management and in-house. As per the data on the state education department’s official website, as of Friday, nearly 62,000 seats were vacant in the three quotas, with the highest being from minority quota – nearly 42,000. Colleges will be allowed to surrender their quota seats by December 19. The department will declare the college-wise vacancies for the special round on December 20. The schedule for the special round of admission is yet to be declared. “While most high-scorers have already taken admission, those with average scores might have tried for a better college during the last two rounds. Most prominent colleges thus, have filled most of their general seats,” said the principal of a south Mumbai-based college. After three regular rounds in 2019, more than 1.70 lakh seats remained vacant in MMR. While 3.19 lakh seats were up for grabs in MMR last year, this year, there are over 3.20 lakh seats in the region.This year, the department had declared that there will be no first-come-first-served (FCFS) rounds for admissions. Instead, special rounds will be conducted for students who do not get admission in regular rounds. FCFS rounds usually follow regular admission rounds wherein students can claim seats against vacancies across colleges in a particular city or district, and are allotted seats based on who claims them first. These rounds were introduced in the academic year 2018-19, but were criticised by many parents and experts as they allowed students with lower scores to get into top colleges against vacant seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-1-85-lakh-seats-vacant-after-third-round-of-fyjc-admission-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-special-round-on-december-20/story-vIlLUg9qCTjQmhtX5CagjM.html
19-12-2020||Mumbai||BKC plot rejected twice in past for Mumbai Metro-3 car depot||The 21-hectare plot in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is eyeing to build the Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) car depot has been rejected twice in the past for the project. The government is considering the plot, where a terminus for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train has been proposed, after the Bombay high court on Wednesday stayed allotment of 102 acres of saltpan land at Kanjurmarg to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to construct the car shed. “It is true that the BKC option was rejected, but we are now exploring different technical possibilities, including an underground car shed. We will look at its feasibility again,” said a senior state official, on condition of anonymity.The plot at BKC exhibition grounds was among those considered when the detailed project report (DPR) for the 33.5-km Metro corridor was submitted in 2011. The DPR, however, did not approve it considering its commercial value. It stated, “[The plot] be used more gainfully for property development/commercial exploitation.” The DPR also stated that a car shed in BKC would “result in loss of revenue and close doors on future expansion”.The DPR had considered an underground car shed, but stated it would cost ₹1,250 crore more, with an additional expense of ₹20 crore every year for operations. It also stated that an underground depot will require five years for completion, instead of two years for an over ground one. “[An] underground depot may be provided, in case, all other options to construct a depot at grade have been exhausted,” stated the DPR.In 2015, a six-member committee, appointed by the then Devendra Fadnavis-led state government, considered nine options, including BKC, for the car shed. However, the panel said building the depot in an intermediary location is not recommended for operations. The committee questioned that a ramp will have to be constructed to bring the trains from the underground station to an at-grade location, which would require 400 metres of land cutting across the main BKC road and cost ₹30 crore more, apart from undertaking rehabilitation. “This land [BKC] is an extremely valuable economic asset. The revenue estimated to be generated from this land is about ₹30,000 crore. Such funds are planned to be used to develop other equally important infrastructure and transport projects in MMR,” said the panel. BKC, currently, is among the most premium land in Mumbai. In 2019, the MMRDA sold a three-acre plot in BKC to Japan’s Sumitomo for ₹2,238 crore, one of the highest land deals in the country. On Friday, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, while talking to reporters, called the idea of shifting the car shed to BKC “a childish one”. “It [BKC] is prized land. Even if the car shed was to be constructed underground, it would cost five times more,” Fadnavis said. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had on Thursday convened a meeting with officials to look at options for the car shed, which the government had moved from Aarey to Kanjurmarg. Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar had confirmed that they were considering the BKC plot for bullet train as one of the options for Metro car shed. “The Kanjurmarg plot, where the car shed is being planned, is entangled in a legal process, which will take time. Hence, it has been proposed to examine the technical feasibility of the BKC plot. Based on the findings of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL), the state government will take a decision,” Kumar had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bkc-plot-rejected-twice-in-past-for-mumbai-metro-3-car-depot/story-lx0bU1xq3OP5s35bjm2qvK.html
19-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra farmers plan vehicle march from Nashik to Delhi on December 21||Farmers from Maharashtra will organise a vehicle march from Nashik to Delhi on December 21 and join those protesting in the national capital for the past three weeks. Farmers from 20 districts of the state will gather at Nashik and travel 1,266 kilometres to Delhi, after joining the protests at the Rajasthan-Haryana border on December 24. The announcement was made by the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) at a press conference in Nashik on Friday. Ashok Dhawale, president of AIKS, said in the statement, “The Vehicle Jatha will begin with a massive public meeting at Nashik on December 21 afternoon. It will be welcomed by thousands of people at Ozar, Pimpalgaon Baswant, Chandwad, Umrane, Malegaon, Dhule and Shirpur in Nashik and Dhule districts of Maharashtra before entering Madhya Pradesh.”On November 26 and 27, farmers from Maharashtra had participated in the countrywide call for protests made by AIKS, by organising roadblocks and staging protests on highways. There was participation from 21 districts, including Thane, Palghar, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Sangli, Nanded, Wardha and Solapur, among others. Similarly, farmers from state also participated in the Bharat Bandh on December 8 and held peaceful protests, including marches to government offices at the district and tehsil levels across the state. “In November, we had taken a call not to march to Delhi from Maharashtra owing to the Covid-19 situation. However, the government is being very obstinate. It is also running propaganda that whatever is happening in Delhi is only because of farmers from Punjab and Haryana. That argument needs to be razed. Now, when thousands of farmers from Maharashtra will travel around 1,300 kilometres to participate in the protest, it will effectively counter the government’s argument,” said Dhawale. The farmers will support the main demands of those already protesting in the Capital, including asking the Central government to repeal the three “anti-farmer and pro-corporate” farm laws passed by it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-farmers-plan-vehicle-march-from-nashik-to-delhi-on-december-21/story-9jfbyxQtRKOEYhNjbW4UKM.html
19-12-2020||Mumbai||Medical institutes across Maharashtra reopen, take steps to bring students back||Three weeks after the National Medical Commission (NMC) and the Union health ministry suggested reopening of medical colleges in phases across the country, institutes in the state are taking positive steps towards bringing students back on campus. While some institutes are following a mixed pattern by depending on digital classrooms for theory work and physical duty in hospital wards as part of the course, others have started calling students for physical lectures while ensuring that all safety norms are followed. At Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College (KEM Hospital) in Parel, digital classrooms are being conducted for all class work. “Ever since the lockdown was implemented, our classes have been conducted online and students are comfortable with it by now. They are already also working in the hospital as part of their practical teaching,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean, KEM Hospital. “Towards the end of this year or the beginning of 2021, examinations will be scheduled and most institutes are prepared for the same,” he added. At Pune’s Pravara Institute of Medical Sciences University, all batches have recently been called back on campus and the students are presently under 14-day quarantine within the institute. “Students are settled in their hostels on campus and we are continuing online lectures for the time being. Once the quarantine period is over, our students will be ready to attend regular physical lectures,” said a spokesperson of the institute. He added that even after the quarantine, the institute might opt for a combination of virtual and physical classes to ensure maximum safety for staffers and students. In a notification released in the last week of November, NMC has shared recommendations and guidelines for institutes in the wake of the ongoing pandemic. While keeping safety and health of staffers and students in mind, NMC suggested that with all safety steps in place, it will be possible for colleges to bring students back on campus starting December 1. While Maharashtra has still not given a green signal for other schools, colleges and other higher educational institutes to reopen until December 31, medical institutes are already working on bringing normalcy back into routine lectures.“We started classes from December 1 itself, and the first MBBS theory exam concluded on December 18. Students will be attending their practical exams starting next week,” said Dr Varsha Phadke, dean of KJ Somaiya Medical College. She added that before inviting students back on campus, the institute conducted RT-PCR tests for those students who were traveling from other parts of the state or country and were supposed to stay in hostels within the campus. “All safety precautions are being followed very strictly,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/medical-institutes-across-maharashtra-reopen-take-steps-to-bring-students-back/story-GPWqNizInlK0gQMSMtBqRN.html

19-12-2020||Mumbai||Placements at IIT-Bombay: 18% drop in job offers||The Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) saw an 18% drop in the number of job offers made to its final-year students in the first phase of placements. A total of 946 offers were rolled out during the campus placement season between December 1 and 15 — a four-year low — according to data released by the placement office of the institute. While the number of preplacement offers has jumped to 182 from 164 last year, the total number of offers has dropped significantly. Of the total 1,128 jobs offered, 973 have been accepted by students. The economic slowdown in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and logistical challenges are some of the reasons cited by the placement office for the slouch.“Comparison (of this year’s statistics) with previous years would not be fair, considering the economic, travel and logistical challenges faced during this pandemic year. The placement office has endeavoured to minimise the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on student recruitment process and has optimised selection outcomes,” the placement office said in a statement.In view of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, the institute had decided to conduct the entire placement process online. Interviews and selection exams were conducted online, thus allowing students to participate in the process from their homes.The number of public sector undertaking (PSU) visiting campus, too, has dropped further this year. Two PSUs picked up five students this year as compared to the same number of companies recruiting nine students last year. In comparison, six PSUs had visited campus in the first phase of placements in 2018 picking up 13 students. Students received a total of 58 international offers from different countries such as the USA, Japan, UAE, Singapore, Netherlands, Hong Kong and Taiwan. An official from the placement cell said the highest number of job offers were from the engineering and technology sector. The average salary, which had soared to ₹20.43 lakh per annum last year from ₹17.75 lakh per annum the year before, has dropped to ₹18.4 lakh per annum.“The highest domestic package offered is that of ₹64 lakh per annum and the highest international package is EURO 1.57 lakh per annum (roughly converted to ₹1.4 crore),” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/placements-at-iit-bombay-18-drop-in-job-offers/story-gOfChsYvVPCxd9cQTN3N0O.html

We are scrutinising the details submitted by Johar about the party,” Wankhede added.The NCB had issued a notice to Johar over a viral video of a 2019 party at his residence, attended by famous Bollywood stars. However, NCB said in the notice that Johar needed not have to physically come to the NCB office and could send his reply through his representative.In the notice, NCB had not asked whether drugs were consumed at the party or not. “We had only asked for the details of who had organised the party and how many stars were invited, and who amongst them attended the party,” said an NCB officer. NCB also sought to know as to what was served at the party, said the NCB officer.A few videos and pictures after and before the party taken by participants have also been submitted, the NCB officer added. The devices used for recording the videos were also called for. We will send those devices for forensic analysis, the NCB officer added.NCB in September had received a complaint from Siromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa, demanding a probe into the matter, claiming that celebrities used drugs at the said party. The central agency then forwarded the complaint to its Mumbai zonal unit for further action, to check the veracity of the video and thus, notice had been sent to the producer-director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/karan-johar-replies-to-mumbai-ncb-notice-about-viral-video-of-a-party-at-his-house/story-lTHWFhMLDRaqq9asTD6zjN.html

19-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: BEST proposes to procure 600 new buses on wet lease||The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) has proposed to procure 600 new buses on wet lease. Under the wet lease model, BEST does not own the buses but get the vehicles along with staff from contractors for a fixed rate for each kilometre.The buses are proposed to be procured in three phases of 200 buses each which will be non-air-conditioned (AC) single decker buses. The buses will be compressed natural gas (CNG)-operated. Along with the buses, BEST has also proposed to hire bus drivers and conductors from the contractors.The proposal is yet to be approved by the BEST committee. Only after the committee’s approval, BEST administration will get the buses. Committee members have, however, said hiring drivers and conductors for operation of buses is a step towards privatisation. “We will oppose the proposal when it comes up for discussion. This is a step towards privatisation of the organisation, and the employees will have to suffer,” said Ravi Raja, opposition leader in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and BEST committee member. Few committee members also said BEST would soon have to take loan to get buses on wet lease. “As it is BEST is taking loans to give salaries to employees. Hiring conductors and drivers will further increase the monetary burden on the organisation. We will not support the proposal,” said Sunil Ganacharya, BEST committee member. BEST recently also floated tender to procure 100 new upgraded double decker buses. The buses will be equipped pneumatic door closers for both the rear and front doors. In addition, two staircases will be provided for passengers as opposed to one staircase in the present double decker buses.BEST presently has a fleet of 3,337 buses operating on different routes in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-best-proposes-to-procure-600-new-buses-on-wet-lease/story-g2hj2S7XoSeNPPpbCKRWEL.html
19-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC allows Cidco to remove mangroves for Uran bypass bridge||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday permitted the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) to remove mangroves located on around 0.6266 hectare of land to make way for the construction of a bypass bridge between Hotel Anandi to Uran City (Dronagiri). HC has asked Cidco to give an undertaking of strictly complying with conditions laid down in permissions issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF). The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing Cidco’s plea, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the planning authority wanted to commence construction of an 11-metre-wide bypass bridge starting from Hotel Anandi to Uran city in Dronagiri, Navi Mumbai over 1.0287 hectare of land, of which 0.6266 hectare was mangroves/forest land. Kumbhakoni submitted that the reliefs sought to cut the mangrove trees were in the public interest and Cidco was conscious of the preservation of the environment, hence it explored all possibilities to save the existing mangroves. However, after it concluded that there was no other alternative, it decided to remove the mangroves for implementation of the project, and hence the plea. In its plea, Cidco contended that the project was part of its efforts to decongest traffic between Mumbai and the already developed area of Navi Mumbai. The bypass bridge at Uran was proposed for easing of traffic passing through the congested Uran city, as due to the non-availability of such a road, there were continuous roadblocks, traffic jams, accidents and other issues faced by locals. The bypass bridge would also help in reducing the pollution in the local area, said the plea. Cidco further informed the court that it has proposed to set up an eco-friendly project with architectural intelligence and international standards, and had received relevant permissions from Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA), State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and clearances from the MoEF thereafter.Advocates Sharmila Deshmukh and Rui Rodrigues for SEIAA and the Central government did not oppose the plea but said that Cidco would have to comply with conditions laid down for the same.After hearing the submissions, the bench granted permission to cut/remove mangroves and noted, “We are of the opinion that an exception is required to be made in favour of the petitioner to remove the mangroves as prayed for, and subject matter of the conditions as granted by the respondent authorities as the work in question is for the public good and in public interest.” Before disposing of the plea, the court directed the Cidco officer to file an undertaking within one week of strictly complying with conditions imposed in permissions granted by SEIAA and MoEF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-allows-cidco-to-remove-mangroves-for-uran-bypass-bridge/story-JJDHLP2rlhbsDTe79hdZpJ.html
19-12-2020||Mumbai||Hema Upadhyay-Haresh Bhambani murder case: Mumbai sessions court asks police to find tempo used in crime||The city sessions court on Friday forfeited a bond given by Ramadhar Rajbhar, father of Vijay Rajbhar, one of the accused in the artist Hema Upadhyay and advocate Haresh Bhambhani murder case, for failure to produce the tempo used in the crime.According to police, Hema and her lawyer Haresh Bhambani were allegedly smothered with a chloroform-laced cloth at Vijay’s warehouse on December 11, 2015. The killers packed their bodies in cardboard boxes and dumped them in a Kandivli sewer. The prosecution has alleged that the tempo was used to transport the bodies. The tempo was seized by the police during the investigation in 2016. After the investigation on October 21, 2016, Vijay’s father Ramadhar was allowed to take custody of the tempo on furnishing a bond assuring that he would bring the tempo back to the court whenever required for the trial.However, when the court asked Ramadhar to produce the tempo, he could not and said it was sold by Vijay’s wife. On Tuesday, the court gave him a last chance to produce the tempo. On the same day, he moved an application claiming that the tempo was never seized by the police and his son was been falsely implicated. The prosecution denied the allegations.“Ramadhar’s plea was rejected by the court and he has now been asked to pay ₹5 lakh within 15 days as he has not produced the tempo. Besides, the court has asked police to find the tempo and produce it before the court,” said special public prosecutor Vaibhav Baghade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hema-upadhyay-haresh-bhambani-murder-case-mumbai-sessions-court-asks-police-to-find-tempo-used-in-crime/story-51JbIa7PvDd8dIZYPCA9dN.html
19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Military Lit Fest:Taking on the enemy in Mashkoh Valley during the Kargil conflict||Two decades after the Kargil War, here is a first hand account by Brig US Bawa (retd) of the Mashkoh Warriors, a group of Indian Army braves, involved in the conflict. What he has to reveal is surprising: “This book is written mainly to identify the mistakes we made during the Kargil War. The main aim was sharing lessons of war with young generations so that they don’t write history with more blood,” says the author.As the 4th edition of the Military Literature Festival opened “virtually” on Friday because of the Covid pandemic, Brig Bawa’s book, Mashkoh: Kargil As I Saw It, was discussed in a session moderated by Ramesh Vinayak, executive editor, Hindustan Times, with Maj General Amarjit Singh (retd) and Manraj Grewal Sharma, resident editor, Indian Express, in attendance.The author, who commanded the 17 Jat Regiment during the Kargil War and was awarded the Vir Chakra for his gallantry in the Mashkoh Valley in 1999, talked about the strategic and tactical significance of the valley, recounting how his troops surrounded the enemy from three sides and established a firm base. About the book, Maj Gen Amarjit Singh said often military history was written either by those who never fought a war or by soldiers who never experienced warfare. Then there were authors who had actually been at the front to confront the enemy face to face. Manraj Grewal Sharma talked about being fascinated by the book which had tales of bravery, emotions, tragic losses and hard-won victories in the extremely challenging high-altitude terrain of Kargil, where many believed any mission by the Armed Forces was impossible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-military-lit-fest-taking-on-the-enemy-in-mashkoh-valley-during-the-kargil-conflict/story-oCja4bWcGWH8iH6WcFJPTJ.html
19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Military Lit Fest: China on the road to changing world order||The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of the Chinese government, a massive global infrastructure development project involving almost 70 nations and organisations indicates a “strategic shift in pivot of geography.” Is India’s neighbour then set for world dominance?Discussions around Chinese expansion and President Xi Jinping’s foreign policy at the fourth edition of the Military Literature Festival on Friday were moderated by Maj Gen Amritpal Singh (retd). The speakers included Defence expert and former diplomat Gurjit Singh, Lt Gen PM Bali and Brig Praveen Badrinath.Lt Gen Bali said the last three decades had seen China’s strategic rise, which spelt a significant shift of the geographical pivot in terms of the world’s economy. International experts feared that China was set on its “conquest” through BRI by gaining control of the host country’s economy. The countries agreeing to BRI have done so after factoring in long term capital gains, especially in maritime projects, but the impact had to be assessed at a later stage, Lt Gen Bali added.During British times China was buffered by Tibet, but now thanks to connectivity and technology the world has flattened, Gurjit Singh said. The Chinese are now building connectivity through railways and ports and making “roads everywhere purely due to its deep pockets,” he added.However, despite its much hyped BRI project, China had failed to maintain its own domestic markets and given severe economic shocks to countries like South Africa, where BRI projects had been initiated, during the coronavirus pandemic. China simply refused to pick up raw material there, the former diplomat added. Chinese economic plans were fraught with danger as these were ‘strategic projects’ that do not abide by timelines, Gurjit Singh warned.Brig Badrinath talked about Chinese perspective of heartland theory. He said smaller countries were falling “prey” to Chinese road because of the BRI corridor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/china-on-the-road-to-changing-world-order/story-kO89NfueAlbDMu5nUklOUI.html

According to neighbours, the couple lived alone on the first floor in ward 5A of Arun Vihar. Their son lives in a different sector in Noida while their daughter lives a few houses down.“It was around 8.15pm when we first saw smoke and flames emanating from the house. Several of us rushed to the house but the main door was locked from inside. It took us a while to hammer down the door and get in. Meanwhile, calls were made for the police, fire department and ambulance. Once inside, we saw both of them lying near the main door itself, after which we pulled them out and rushed them to a nearby hospital in our cars,” said Major (retd) Vinod Krishna, a neighbour.A spokesperson for Kailash hospital said that both the husband and wife were brought dead.Neighbours said the house was completely burnt from the inside and several of them pitched in to douse the flames even before the fire tenders reached the spot but the smoke was too thick.“The brigadier was not in prime physical shape. The way they were found, it seems that they tried to reach the main gate but must have lost consciousness due to the smoke. It wasn’t too late but they must have been in their bedroom, probably asleep at the time when the fire first started. It is difficult to say exactly what happened but there were no burn marks on them when they were eventually found,” said Colonel (retd), Shashi Vaid, chairman, Arun Vihar residents’ welfare association.Police officers said they suspect that the fire might have originated due to a short circuit in the house heater, though it is not absolutely certain at the moment.“The bodies were handed over to the family who refused an autopsy due to the age of the couple. But prima facie it seems that the cause of death was suffocation due to smoke inhalation,” said a senior police official.Officials said it took three fire tenders to completely douse the fire.“We got the first call around 8.30pm and teams were immediately dispatched. The house had a lot of flammable items such as books and wooden furniture but we were able to control it from spreading to other houses in half an hour. The cause of the fire is unclear at the moment,” said chief fire officer, Arun Kumar Singh.The bodies were handed over to the family for the last rites, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/fire-at-noida-home-retired-brigadier-wife-die/story-wc41DTokYFku3F2DfwHc5N.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||HC seeks response from NHAI, DDA, Delhi govt after plea says flyover work in Dwarka illegal||The Delhi high court on Friday sought the response of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the Delhi government and other authorities concerned on a plea which has contended that the NHAI is illegally constructing a flyover on road no. 226 in Dwarka’s Sector 22-23 as no permission was taken fell about 980 trees and 1,500 shrubs and neither was any other mandatory clearance obtained for the flyover construction.Justice Navin Chawla issued notice to Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), UTTIPEC (United Traffic & Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) and the contractor on the plea filed by the cooperative group housing societies (CGHS) and residents of sectors 22 and 23, where approximately 50 apartment societies and 12 schools adjoin the road no. 226, which is owned by the DDA.The plea, filed through advocates Anand Varma and Abhishek Prasad, said the construction is being carried without having obtained the necessary permissions/approvals from Delhi government, the DDA and the DPCC. It said that under the garb of execution of the Dwarka Expressway Package 2, the construction is being carried out “for the ulterior and extraneous purpose of providing connectivity to an exhibition and convention centre”.The petition said the “unapproved” construction carried out by the NHAI, to which the other authorities have turned a blind eye, would lead to exponential increase in traffic, air and noise pollution, and also create traffic bottlenecks, increase road safety issues for residents, not to mention the impact wrought by the felling of trees on the residential road.It also claimed that the residents were not consulted before the work began.Varma told the court that from an RTI (right to information) reply given on July 22, they got to know that thre was no record of the road being handed over to the NHAI. He said the housing society also got to know that DDA had given permission to NHAI for execution of civil works -- from NH-8 to Dwarka Link Road, Delhi Gurgaon Link Expressway and from Delhi Haryana Border till Delhi Gurgaon Link Expressway.The plea said a detailed RTI reply on August 4 sought to justify the construction of the flyover by linking it to the extraneous commercial purpose of providing “seamless connectivity to the proposed prestigious India International Convention Centre (IICC) in Sector 25, Dwarka, a project of Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (DMICDC)”.Verma said the approval conditions by UTTIPEC made it clear that the approval was only of the conceptual drawing and all required statutory clearances were to be obtained be fore work could commence.The matter would be now heard on February 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-seeks-response-from-nhai-dda-delhi-govt-after-plea-says-flyover-work-in-dwarka-illegal/story-8emlH5Zjbkkh3SBxgP9fMK.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi to use indigenously developed Feluda kit for Covid testing soon||To scale-up testing for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) further, the Delhi government will deploy the faster gene-editing technology based testing kits developed by the researchers from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research’s Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB). The test named by the researchers as Feluda after the Bengali fictional detective is being marketed by Tata Sons as TataMD Check. An official from the Delhi government confirmed, “As soon as the testing kits are made available on the government e-marketplace (GEM), we will purchase and deploy it.” Also Read: The spread of India’s 10 million Covid-19 cases“Actually Delhi Government is also deploying it simultaneously,” said the director of IGIB Dr Anurag Agarwal in a tweet to counter the claim that the technology developed using public funds was available only in private sector hospitals. Tata Sons had announced in November third week that they were partnering with the Apollo Group of hospitals to launch the tests in 8 metropolitan cities initially. “The kit is manufactured by TATA and available through them as per supply capacity. Also, it is not really being manufactured with public money. The technology was given non-exclusively by CSIR but with commercials attached as per guidelines,” said Agarwal in another tweet. This means, the technology can be transferred to other companies for manufacturing and branding of their own. The kit manufactured by Tata Sons can give out the result of an accurate molecular test in just 45 minutes after the RNA has been extracted from the patient sample. In comparison, the current RT PCR tests take about four to five hours in the lab. Once a swab sample from which RNA is extracted and amplified using a thermocycler. The sample is then tested using a paper strip barcoded with the Cas-9 protein of the Crispr system, which recognises the genetic material of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Once dipped in the processed solution, the strip displays lines that can be interpreted as positive or negative using a mobile phone app available with the Tata Sons kits. The kits can be monitored at every level of transportation and a sensor on the packaging checks that they were stored at the right temperature. Another benefit of the Feluda-based kits is that it uses a commonly available thermocycler rather than a sophisticated RT PCR machine to process the sample. These thermocyclers are available in smaller labs in the city as well as most science institutes, which will help in scaling up testing. The increase in the testing in Delhi since mid-November – when the government decided to conduct up to 100,000 tests a day half of which would be molecular – was mainly due to increased capacity for Delhi samples in central government labs in Delhi as well as the neighbouring Noida and Gurugram along with the mobile laboratories deployed by the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-to-use-indigenously-developed-feluda-kit-for-covid-testing-soon/story-YHHI27dXHECbCxfyndQvmM.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||1,418 new Covid-19 cases in Delhi, positivity rate below 2% for 4 days||Delhi on Friday conducted more RT-PCR tests than the alternative and less accurate rapid antigen ones for the second day in a row. There were 88,400 total tests done on Thursday, of which 54.5% or 48,180 tests were conducted using the RT-PCR method.This is the third time when the share of RT-PCR tests has been 50% or more of the total number of tests conducted in the city. On November 30, the city had conducted 52.6% RT-PCR tests, on December 1, 51.8%. The highest share of RT PCR tests was recorded on December 14, when they accounted for 56.6% of the tests, as per the daily data shared by the Delhi government. On Thursday, the number of RT-PCR tests were 54.3% of total tests conducted in the city. The RT-PCR and other molecular tests amplify the genetic material of the Sar-CoV-2 virus to detect the infection, whereas the rapid antigen tests just look for specific proteins in the sample. This is the reason why RT-PCR tests can pick up small amounts of virus in a patient sample. The rapid antigen tests however are cheaper, easily deployed outside laboratories, and give result in fifteen minutes. This is the reason the tests were rolled out in mid-June when Delhi saw its first surge in number of cases when the positivity rate had shot up to almost 37%. On Friday, Delhi recorded 1,418 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as per the health bulletin, while reporting 37 new deaths due to the infection, taking the total death toll to 10,219 so far. The World Health Organisation says that if the positivity rate is over 8%, the scale of the infection spread cannot be captured by the current number of tests. Hence, the rapid antigen tests were used to scale up testing from just 6 to 7 thousand tests a day in mid-June to about 50,000 tests a day by mid-November. After a second meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah then, the government decided to scale up testing to between 100,000 to 120,000 a day, half of which would be performed using RT-PCR method. “Even with the positivity rate on the decline, the government should continue to tests as many people as they can and scale-up testing as much as they can. A high number of tests instil confidence that the transmission is actually low in the community. With fewer tests, the low positivity rate could be because the tests are unable to capture the positive cases. With a higher number of tests, that cannot happen; the positivity rate will be low, because the transmission is low,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research. Delhi’s positivity rate – proportion of samples that test positive for the infection among the total tested – has been under 5% for sixteen days in a row so far and under 2% for four days. Dr Kant says its fortunate that the infection levels have remained low despite the dip in temperature. However, people must continue to follow all precautions. “We were expecting that with the cold and higher levels of pollution, the number of cases would go up in north India. But that hasn’t happened. One of the reasons, at least in Delhi, could be that a large number of people have already been exposed and have some immunity to the infection. But we cannot say that there wouldn’t be surges in the future as countries in the west are seeing an increase again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rt-pcr-accounts-for-54-of-all-tests-again-city-records-1-418-new-cases/story-45qdS82JsIvMvn4ZAdxR1L.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s day temperature rises marginally, no relief from cold wave||After dealing with four consecutive days of a cold spell, Delhi’s maximum temperature increased to 19.8 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees above normal, on Friday. However, the cold wave continued as the minimum temperature was very low on Friday. Delhi’s Ayanagar station recorded 3.5 degrees Celsius, 5 degrees above normal, and Safdarjung station recorded 4.4 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees below normal.On Thursday, the day temperature was 15.2 degrees Celsius, 7 degrees below normal—categorised as a “severe cold day” by India Meteorological Department (IMD). IMD scientists said “cold day” conditions have abated but “cold wave” conditions are likely to continue over Delhi for a day or two. “There is relief from cold day conditions mainly because there was a layer of uplifted fog over parts of Punjab and Haryana which has moved away so the surface is warming up due to sunlight. There is a slight drop in the chill factor of winds blowing from the western Himalayas. But because of clear skies, the cold wave is likely to continue over Delhi. There may be some relief from cold wave around December 21 when another western disturbance is expected,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. According to IMD a “cold day” or “severe cold day” is designated based on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees and maximum temperature of 4.5 degrees Celsius, or a temperature of 6.4 degrees Celsius below normal respectively. A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 degrees lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees Celsius in the plains. Witnessing a cold day and cold wave together means the gap between day and night temperatures is lower than normal.Minimum temperatures are likely to increase by 2-3 degrees Celsius in the next two or three days and maximum temperatures are likely to increase by 4-5 degrees Celsius in the next three days. “Cold wave to severe cold wave” conditions are likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jammu division, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh on December 19 and decrease thereafter. “Cold day to severe cold day” conditions are likely in some pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, West Uttar Pradesh, Jammu division, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, East Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Madhya Pradesh during next 24 hours and decrease thereafter, IMD said in its Friday bulletin. Dense fog is likely in some pockets over Himachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura during the next two days. Ground frost is also very likely in Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, West Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan during next 2 days. A strong surface wind with a speed of 10-20 kmph is likely to blow over northwest India for the next two days, according to IMD. Delhi recorded “poor” air quality on Friday with an air quality index reading of 281. “Moisture may increase and there may be some clouding on Saturday because of which air pollution levels may increase marginally but they will hover around ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ category. Further deterioration is expected in air quality from December 22 due to change in wind direction and speed,” said Vijay Soni, scientist, air quality division, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-day-temperature-rises-marginally-no-relief-from-cold-wave/story-VFGBSPVgbArrfp1zEeDbRO.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||Manish Sisodia alleges BJP using old news clips to malign Delhi govt schools||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saying that the party’s leaders in Uttar Pradesh have still not spoken to him in detail about an open debate. He also called out some social media posts, saying BJP leaders have used edited images of old news clips to show the “plight” of government schools in the Capital.Sisodia’s comments were aimed at social media posts by state minister Sidharth Nath Singh, who had shared news clips on Thursday saying, “Before participating in a debate, correct the problems in Delhi schools Mr Manish Sisodia. This is Mr Arvind Kejriwal’s second term as a chief minister.”Sisodia said in a video press briefing on Friday, “Instead of running away from the open debate challenge, commit to the time and location of the debate in Lucknow for December 22. (Delhi CM) Arvind Kejriwal’s education model is based on truth and honesty. It cannot be challenged through falsehood and lies.”“There will be an open debate on the Yogi [Adityanath] model versus the Kejriwal model of education in Lucknow on December 22. It will be a healthy and meaningful debate for our democracy with crores of children of UP and the country benefiting from it. The UP minister should name ten schools improved by them in the last four years. I will share a list of a thousand schools in Delhi,” Sisodia said.A day after Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the party would contest the 2022 assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Sisodia and other AAP leaders locked horns with Singh and Uttar Pradesh’s basic education minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi on issues ranging from Covid-19 management to education system.Responding to the allegations, Singh said, “It took the Delhi government four years to change the face of the schools, which I have tweeted. They must understand that we have 1.58 lakh government schools in Uttar Pradesh, as compared to Delhi’s 1,000+ schools.”On the issue of the debate, Singh said, “Let Manish Sisodia answer the series of questions I have asked in my press conference like the total number of Covid-19 tests they have done. You cannot compare Delhi’s 1.75 crore population with UP’s 23 crore.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sisodia-alleges-bjp-using-old-news-clips-to-malign-delhi-govt-schools/story-aA36eJ68q2vmFDwOqt55aP.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||‘MCD scam’ bigger than CWG one, says Kejriwal in Assembly||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday trained guns at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleging a Rs 2,500 crore scam in the municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD), dubbing it “bigger than the CWG scam”. The Delhi Assembly, too, passed a resolution demanding a CBI probe in the matter.The BJP – which rules all three municipal corporations – dismissed the allegations as “baseless”. Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said that he shall resign if Kejriwal and other Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders can prove their claims. He demanded an apology from the AAP, if they failed to do so.“The BJP’s Rs 2,500 crore scam in MCD is the biggest so far in Delhi – bigger than the Commonwealth Games scam during Congress’ time. With the money, one could have built hospitals with 7,500 beds or 12,500 Mohalla clinics… This was the money that was to be utilised for paying salaries and arrears of sanitation workers. Had this money not been lost in the scam, the sanitation workers, healthcare workers and other municipal employees, who risked their lives in Covid-19 management, would have received their salaries in time,” said Kejriwal in the Assembly on Friday – the second day of a special session.Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said: “Arvind Kejriwal is trying to divert attention from the inefficiencies and failures of the Aam Aadmi Party government by dragging issues such as Commonwealth Games which have already been probed by several agencies.”The first day — Thursday — had witnessed heated debates and discussions on the ongoing farmer’s protests against three contentious farm laws passed by the Parliament in September.On Friday, the discussions continued to be focussed on allegations of misappropriation of funds to the tune of around Rs 2,400 crore – related to proposed waivers on payments concerning rent for office space between the south Delhi and north Delhi civic bodies, which operate from the same building in central Delhi. It comes at a time when mayors of the three MCDs are protesting outside Kejriwal’s residence demanding Rs 13,000 crore which, they claim, the Delhi government owes to the MCDs. The Delhi government has dismissed the claims.The House also witnessed some drama on Friday, with some AAP leaders displaying a huge poster alleging scam in the MCD inside the premises of the Assembly.Kejriwal on Friday said in the Assembly, “The Delhi government is saving every single penny in all its projects. It has recently constructed a flyover worth Rs 325 crore in Rs 200 crore. With all the savings, it is providing facilities to the people of Delhi — such as free electricity, water, quality education, health care, and free bus rides for women. The BJP-led MCD, on the other hand, ended up spending Rs 730 crore on a flyover which was supposed to cost Rs 187 crore.Kejriwal was referring to the Rani Jhansi flyover which was conceptualised in 1998 and completed in 2018 by the north Delhi municipal corporation. “When AAP leaders like Raghav Chadha and Atishi went to meet Union home minister Amit Shah and lieutenant governor and demand a CBI probe into the matter, they were detained by the police… The Central government, on the other hand, was quick enough to order CBI raids in my office, (health and home minister) Satyendar Jain’s office,” said Kejriwal, who is also the national convener of the AAP.He further said, “Now the MCDs are claiming that we owe them Rs 13,000 crores. The claim has been dismissed even by the high court and Supreme Court. It seems like they are done spending Rs 2,500 crore and they only want more… It has become a widely-accepted system in the BJP that the councillors will get five years to do corruption, taking turns… BJP’s 15-year black era in MCD is soon going to end, I sincerely hope that two crore people of Delhi will end this black era in the upcoming (municipal) elections (in 2022).”The motion demanding CBI probe was led by the AAP’s Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj. While all AAP MLAs in the 70 member House voted in favour, eight BJP MLAs refrained from casting votes. Bhardwaj later said that it “exposes the BJP’s hypocrisy” – responding to which BJP’s Bidhuri said that such a demand did not require any approval of the House in the first place. In the Assembly, Bidhuri and BJP MLA from Rohini, Vijender Gupta, said that they are open to probe by any agency.BJP MLA Bidhuri said in a statement: “Commissioner of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation constituted a committee of six officers in October and sought a report. This committee submitted its report in December and said that the allegations of any scandal are absolutely untrue… Also, when there has been no transaction, where does the AAP see any room for a scam? The allegations regarding the Rs 2,500 crore so-called scam are completely baseless. I challenge Kejriwal and leaders of the AAP to prove the allegations. If they succeed, I will resign, if this allegation proves to be false, then apology must come from the people who are making these unwarranted allegations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mcd-scam-bigger-than-cwg-one-says-kejriwal-in-assembly/story-8fCI8TQnWqo3H8WvlrZsCL.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||500 metres of busy Ring Road now sports a gleaming cycle track, walkway with LED lights||The rubber-coated cycle track with blinking LED lights, and a separate pedestrian walkway, along a 500m stretch of the busy Ring Road in south Delhi is hard to miss these days. The effort is a part of the public works department (PWD)’s plan for beautification of roads on a pilot basis. The PWD has created a 2.5m-wide rubber-coated cycle track and a separate pedestrian path along a 500m stretch of the Ring Road, from Nehru Nagar to Sriniwaspuri. They have also installed benches in the open space on the roadside near bus stops along with decorative streetlights. The pedestrian pathway is about three metres wide and has been paved with interlocking tiles.The PWD officials said the whole beautification drive is part of the Delhi government’s bigger project to redevelop and redesign Delhi roads to meet European standards. “A 3km stretch between Ashram and Moolchand on the Ring Road has been chosen for a pilot exercise involving redesigning of road and creating cycling and pedestrian facilities. The work was started over a month ago, and till now, we have laid down a synthetic cycle track over a 500m stretch. The work is still ongoing. In the first phase, we will start similar works on two more road stretches in east Delhi,” a PWD official, who wished not to be named, said.The official said the other two stretches where such exercises will be taken up in the first phase include a 3km stretch of Vikas Marg --between Laxmi Nagar and Karkardooma --and the other will be 2km stretch of Narwana Road, near Mother Dairy in east Delhi. “After developing these stretches on a pilot basis, we will further take up six more roads for redesigning and redevelopment in the second phase. All these roadworks will be the part of the government’s bigger project to redesign 540km length of road in the city by 2023,” the official quoted above said.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal earlier this week had announced that the process of appointing a consultant for redesigning 540km Delhi roads, to match those in European cities, has been completed and a detailed project report will be readied by February 2021.On the 500m stretch that was recently developed, the PWD has installed decorative streetlights having tricoloured illumination. To ensure that motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, do not ride on the newly developed cycle track and pathway, the PWD has put in bollards at the entry and exit points of the track. A Delhi government official said PWD minister Satyendar Jain had also inspected the newly developed stretch earlier this week to review the progress.The PWD said the redevelopment will not only remove traffic bottlenecks but also create cycle lanes, wide footpaths, parking for rickshaws, open spaces for the public, and have in place attractive street furniture for pedestrians and public transport users.The redesign has already earned positive reviews from the publics.“Earlier, the footpath was broken and it was occupied either by two-wheelers or vendors, but now the stretch has got a new life. One can walk freely or ride a bicycle. More stretches should be redeveloped along similar lines,” Neelesh Rana, a resident of Nehru Nagar and a regular cyclist, said.Anuj Malhotra, knowledge partner, Union home ministry, who has helped different agencies in various pedestrianisation projects, also welcomed the initiative and said similar facilities should be developed on more road stretches so that cycling can be promoted. “This is a wonderful initiative by the PWD. With such dedicated cycle tracks and pathways, cyclists and pedestrians will feel safe. The government should also focus on repairing the existing footpaths and cycle tracks. The government should make efforts to integrate new cycle tracks with the existing ones to create a seamless network for non-motorised transport,” Malhotra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/500-metres-of-busy-ring-road-now-sports-a-gleaming-cycle-track-walkway-with-led-lights/story-Gw2VT5ARdbLwrxJ1ysPIbO.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||Three women councillors on hunger strike admitted to hospital||Three women councillors, including a former mayor, who were on a hunger strike since Thursday, were admitted to Hindu Rao hospital on Friday after their health deteriorated. The three councillors were sitting on the fast, along with the mayors of north, east and south corporations, outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Flagstaff Road to demand the release of Rs13,000 crore allegedly due to the municipal corporations from the Delhi government. The mayors and nearly 30 councillors of the three municipalities have been camping outside the CM’s residence since December 7. According to civic functionaries, former south corporation mayor Sunita Kangra, chairperson of the health committee in east corporation Kanchan Maheshwari and deputy chairperson of south zone ward committee Maya Bisht were admitted to the hospital after their blood sugar and blood pressure levels fell.Jai Prakash, mayor, north corporation, said, “They were immediately taken to Hindu Rao Hospital in three ambulances. We are staging a sit-in for the past 12 days and an indefinite hunger strike since Thursday demanding the release of dues amounting to Rs13,000 crore to all three corporations. There has been no response from the government yet.” Anamika Mithilesh, mayor, south corporation, said they have been braving the extreme cold and making do without basic amenities, but the CM has turned a blind eye towards the issue. “The councillors are on a hunger strike and their health is deteriorating. Three women councillors were admitted to the hospital today. Instead of showing callousness, the Delhi chief minister should ask government officials to ensure the release of dues without further delay,” she said.The AAP did not respond to calls and messages sent to them for a reaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-women-councillors-on-hunger-strike-admitted-to-hospital/story-QDTA9e73WJUWVcp0lYhgYM.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||Govt floats tender for real-time passenger information of DTC, cluster buses||The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has issued a tender concerning a real-time passenger information system which will enable commuters to access information on bus routes, estimated arrival times, fare, location of nearest buses which they wish to board, availability of seats and best options for interchange on their mobile phones.The tender document titled “engagement of vendor to design, develop, implement, operate and maintain real-time passenger information system for DTC buses” – which HT has seen – is broadly divided into three categories focussing on a mobile application for commuters, a separate mobile app for DTC staff, and an interface to help crunch passenger usage statistics.The DTC aims at implementing the system in 18 weeks, from the date a work order is issued to the chosen vendor.The system will initially be for all DTC buses, but the vendor entrusted with the job is expected to integrate the routes operating under the cluster bus fleet too, the document said.While DTC currently has 3,702 buses in its fleet, the cluster fleet has 3,080. All of them have GPS devices fitted and locations are monitored in control rooms. “The system aims at further breaking down information on multiple parameters and making it available to commuters on their phones,” said a senior official in DTC.The application meant for commuters is supposed to help with route information, live tracking of buses on maps designed for the app, estimated time of arrival of buses in the concerned bus stand, ticket fare, availability of seats and interchange options – from the criss-cross of bus routes between the commuters point of origin and destination – on parameters such as minimum time and minimum cost, said the document.The application for DTC staff is supposed to help them with assigning routes, management of bus timings, monitoring routes, trip durations, registering real-time information on occupancy in each bus and preparing consolidated reports on daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual basis, the document said.The interface on passenger usage statistics will deal with data such as origin, destination, date, time, and passenger profiles. Passenger profile information may include name, age, gender, mobile number, email address, residential area, place of work, the document said. The data is supposed to help the government on ascertaining which locations witness the most footfall, at what time, which routes witness the most footfall and at which hours. It is supposed to help in the management of bus routes, the DTC official said.Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot had mentioned about real-time information system on November 22 when the Delhi Cabinet, chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, had given approval for induction of 1,250 low-floor buses in the DTC fleet.“Such interfaces come under the domain of intelligent transport system. Such a system is capable of helping people plan their travels, which has been a problem when it comes to the bus system in Delhi. Such systems increase reliability of the transport network and scale up efficiency. Many developed cities across Europe, America and Asia have such systems in place,” said PK Sarkar, an expert with the intelligent transport system committee at the International Organisation for Standardisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-floats-tender-for-real-time-passenger-information-of-dtc-cluster-buses/story-2CZyGCN3xUY6DfxA8CKFZK.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||If govt can’t find a solution, we will plough our way to one, warns Bharatiya Kisan Union at UP Gate||Exhorting farmers to be a part of the next “kisan kranti (farmers’ revolution)”, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait warned that if the central government cannot find a solution to the deadlock over the three new farm laws, then the farmers will be forced to “plough their way to a solution”. “Six rounds of talks with the central government have yielded no solution. The government should either find a “hal (solution)” or we will have to resort to a “hal kranti (plough our way to a revolution/change)”. Such a revolution would go right through the heart of Delhi itself,” said Tikait, who is also BKU’s national spokesperson, at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border, where hundreds of farmers have been protesting against the farm laws for the past 23 days. Also Read| ‘Bow to farmers’: PM Modi backs laws, slams OppositionAddressing the gathering of farmers, Tikait urged farmers and all kisan unions across the country to “unite and join” the ongoing protests at the four border points of Delhi – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate and Chilla. “Every farmer should now leave their homes and, carrying farming tools, join us in our protest. I also ask all farmer unions , both big and small, to come here (the Delhi borders with their flags and banners. We will welcome them,” said Tikait. The farmer leader also thanked the Supreme Court for terming their protests “peaceful” and for asking the government “why in the past eight days have there been no talks with farmers over contentious issues”. “I have learnt that the representatives of the government will be holding 700 meetings over the farm laws. One such meeting is in Meerut on Friday. Why is the government holding such talks in cities and towns and not meeting farmers in their villages? Farmers are protesting at the Delhi borders. Why is the government not coming here?” said Tikait. Also Read: MSP only real risk protection for farmers, says new studyApart from Singhu and Tikri borders, where thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping for the past 23 days, blocking vehicular movement, farmers from Uttar Pradesh have been protesting at UP Gate and Chilla border (Delhi-Noida Link Road) for just as many days, unmindful of the cold wave sweeping through the NCR. The number of tents at Ghazipur border has increased and nearly all of them have been covered with tarpaulin sheets to stop the cold draughts. The elderly farmers have been advised to stay in the tents or tractor trolleys to avoid falling ill. Also Read| The farm laws: How not to do reformsWhile the gathering at three borders remained intact, even increasing during the weekends, the situation at the Chilla border has kept fluctuating in the past fortnight. On Friday, the number of protesting farmers at Chilla border was fewer than 100, compared to Thursday when 200 to 300 farmers had remained present and had a brief standoff with the security personnel, while making a bid to proceed towards Delhi. At Ghazipur and Chilla borders, unlike SInghu and Tikri, protesters have only blocked the carriageways going towards Delhi from Ghaziabad and Noida. The traffic is being diverted to the alternative border points to avoid inconvenience to motorists commuting between Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/if-govt-can-t-find-a-solution-we-will-plough-our-way-to-one-warns-bharatiya-kisan-union-at-up-gate/story-O86r2PNr9eDbSoa2ujRwNP.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||Two minors killed in Sagarpur factory fire||Two brothers — aged five and six years — were killed after a slippers manufacturing unit in south-west Delhi’s Sagarpur caught fire on Friday afternoon. The children lived with their parents in the manufacturing unit on the ground floor of the three-storey building. Police said that the incident took place when the parents of the children were out for some work. The mother of the children had allegedly left the house after locking the gate from outside, the police and fire departments officials said.Delhi Fire Services (DFS) chief Atul Garg said that the fire control room received a call at around 3pm regarding a blaze in a slippers manufacturing factory in P-block in Sagarpur.“Three fire tenders were rushed to the spot. It was a small fire, but there was a lot of smoke because of the presence of rubber materials. The blaze was doused immediately. By the time our rescue team could reach, the two children had suffered burns and been rescued by the locals and taken to a hospital, where they were declared brought dead. They died of suffocation,” said Garg, adding that the fire may have been caused due to a short circuit. Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh said that nearly a dozen people, who lived in the upper floors, were safely rescued by the local police and locals of the area. He said that the police had roped in a team from the forensic science laboratory (FSL) to inspect the spot and ascertain the exact cause of the fire.Fire officials said that the children’s father was a worker at the factory and made rubber and polymer slippers. The family had shifted to the building on rent on December 1.The police said they were trying to find out if the person running the factory had proper permits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-minors-killed-in-sagarpur-factory-fire/story-GQO3okoQe3ZXFZxPt2OuyJ.html
19-12-2020||Delhi||Chief financial officer of Zenica Cars arrested||The Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing on Friday said it has arrested the chief finance officer of Zenica Cars India Pvt Ltd, a firm involved in the dealership of high-end cars, for allegedly duping banks to the tune of Rs300 crore by forging the company’s balance sheets. This is the third arrest in this case that was registered in 2018, a legal action that was followed up by the police arresting the company’s directors, father-son duo Rashpal Singh Todd and Mandhir Singh Todd, in September that year. The Todds, who are British citizens of Indian origin, were arrested from the IGI Airport in Delhi just as they were preparing to board a flight to the United Kingdom, allegedly on the pretext of attending a relative’s wedding there.The latest arrest, of the firm’s chief finance officer Vaibhav Sharma, took place on Thursday, said OP Mishra, joint commissioner of EOW. Sharma, however, denied that he was arrested. “I received anticipatory bail from the Delhi High Court on Thursday. So, I couldn’t have been arrested,” said Sharma, refusing to comment on the allegations. But Mishra said that the anticipatory bail only saved Sharma from going to jail. “He was technically and formally arrested and then let off,” said Mishra. Ajay Verma, a criminal lawyer at Delhi high court, said that an arrest after an anticipatory bail is a mere formality and the accused is released after furnishing a bond. Sharing the background of the case, Mishra said that in 2007, the Todds had approached the Bahadurshah Zafar Marg branch of HDFC Bank for financial assistance. “They had been availing term loan, cash credit facility and bank guarantee since 2013,” said the officer. Till March 2018, the firm was operating as per the law, but they began defaulting after that, said the officer. In June 2018, during an inspection, the HDFC Bank found that the balance sheets had been manipulated to dupe the bank of Rs102 crore, Mishra added. He said that other banks too had been duped in a similar fashion, taking the total cheated amount to Rs300 crore. The alleged fraud also involved selling demo cars without no-objection certificates and misappropriating loan amounts. Detailing Sharma’s role, Mishra said that he had forged the statement of a bank and also showed that the company was suffering losses for four years although their balance sheets showed profits. The Todd father-son duo have already been chargesheeted in the case. The Zenica group claims to have established India’s first and largest Audi dealership in NCR and have showrooms of high-end cars across Delhi and Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chief-financial-officer-of-zenica-cars-arrested/story-cHI35lbTs2y7TkLUtWxE5I.html

19-12-2020||Pune||Over 60% 108 ambulance calls made for Covid in the past nine months||As per the information given by the Maharashtra Emergency Medical Services (MEMS), of the 7 lakh calls made for the 108 ambulances, over 60% or 4.22 lakh of the calls were made for Covid-19 while training calls were made for non-Covid requirements. MEMS also reported that over 214 of its own staff members were infected during these nine months with Covid and five of their doctors were also reported dead due to the virus infection.As per the data shared by MEMS, 7,00,179 calls were made for 108 ambulance services of which 4,22,166 were for Covid, while 2,78,013 were for non-Covid needs. The agency also said that the average response time for ambulances were about 17:51 minutes for urban areas and 23.12 minutes for rural locations, for the same period. With respect to the most affected districts in the state due to Covid, Pune reported maximum cases in any district in the country. At least 46,584 108 calls were made of which 19,510 were made for Covid purposes and 27,074 for non-Covid reasons. In Mumbai, 46,249 calls were made of which 33,381 were made for Covid reasons and 12,868 for non-Covid purposes. Similarly, in Nagpur, of 29,624, over 12,000 were made for Covid and 17k for non-Covid.Dr Dnyaneshwar Shelke, chief operating officer of MEMS- Dial 108, said, “Usually we get a lot of calls for on-road emergencies, but due to no traffic we did not get those calls. However, the non-Covid calls were replaced with Covid calls. We had to work double as we also received regular medical calls like strokes, pregnancy-related and other emergencies. We operated with 937 ambulances during the entire Covid period and 96% per cent ambulances were up across the state and only 4% were left for maintenance and repairs. We took care of 4,000 emergencies in the state on a daily basis. We did attend to all the calls, but it could be possible that due to the sheer number of calls, we could have been slightly late in some places but the response time for most of this period remained the same as it has been even during the non-Covid period for the same months.”“Due to the less traffic, it worked to our advantage by reducing travel time. However, in some cases, if there were more cases from one area then we did face a slight delay as we had to get the ambulance from another area. We also integrated ambulances from private agencies which were mostly used for asymptomatic Covid patients,” he said. The 108 ambulances had come under fire during the months of July to September when maximum cases were being reported and the service could not reach the patients on time or lacked basic facilities, including oxygen cylinders or cardiac ambulances. Dr Sanjay Dabhade from Jan Aarogya Manch, a public health activist, said, “I can tell from my experience as when I tested for Covid I did call for the ambulance service but when it did not turn up on time and seeing that my condition worsened, my family had to drive me to the hospital in our private vehicle. There have been so many instances when an ambulance did not come on time and people could not reach the hospital on time and it some cases also died for lack of timely treatment. In some cases, even if ambulances did arrive, it did not have basic facilities like a doctor or an oxygen cylinder.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/over-60-108-ambulance-calls-made-for-covid-in-the-past-nine-months/story-gpsno7vmpPaMRKBxwjL6WP.html
19-12-2020||Pune||FYJC admission third round completes, 61,359 seats vacant in Pune region||The third round of First Year Junior College (FYJC) admissions ended on December 18 and 45,671 students have completed their admissions. Of the 12,461 available seats in the third round, 4,633 students completed their admissions and 61,359 seats are vacant across the streams in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad region. From December 20, the special round of FYJC admissions will start. For this year’s Class 11 admissions, 72,820 students are eligible for the first round of admission in 304 colleges of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad areas. The total intake of seats this year is 1,07,030 in Pune region. At least 41,021 students have completed the admission process in the second round and 66,009 seats are vacant. Due to the interim stay given by the Supreme Court (SC) on the implementation of the quota for the Maratha community in jobs and education, the state education department had stopped the admission process for Class 11 (FYJC) since September 9 and it resumed from November 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fyjc-admission-third-round-completes-61-359-seats-vacant-in-pune-region/story-M3E1QjulzRxjxhNcDoMJrJ.html
19-12-2020||Pune||College seats are solely based on marks and cut-offs: Meena Shendkar||With the admission process for First Year Junior College (FYJC) or Class 11 going on in the state, 1,07,030 seats are available for the academic year at 304 junior colleges spread across Pune division, including Pune and Pimpri- Chinchwad. The admissions were halted due to the Maratha reservation case being heard by the Supreme Court, before it resumed from November 26. Post three rounds of admissions, a special round started from December 20. Meena Shendkar, assistant director of education, Pune and incharge of admission process, gives details about the process this year. How is the FYJC admission process being conducted in Pune division during the unprecedented Covid period? We are following the safety precautions as per the guidelines given by the state and central governments for the admission process. We completed the first round and had to stop on September 9 because of Maratha reservation issue. Admissions resumed from November 26 and the second and third rounds were conducted smoothly despite the Covid-19 pandemic. The admission percentage will increase when the students’ marks and college cut-off lists will match. Students are waiting to get into prominent colleges, but their marks are less than cut-offs. As students are waiting to take the final step, we have to wait and watch. The main reason behind low admission numbers even after the third round is because though seats are available students are waiting for their preferred colleges. I have requested parents to look at your child’s marks, cut-offs and distance from house before confirming admission. There is a need to maintain balance between students’ marks and college cut-off to confirm admission. What will be the next step for students who have not yet completed their admissions even after all the rounds? Students have been given choice of colleges as per marks and cut-offs during the three rounds of admission. Going forward, in the first special round, only those non-admitted students who have given their “consent” for special round will be allowed to process their admission. Those who have not given consent in the earlier rounds will be given chance only in the next special rounds. The first special round of admission process will start on December 20. Parents need to understand that most of the prominent colleges in Pune and Pimpri- Chinchwad have already surrendered their management quota seats to us. So, those admissions will also happen from the centralised admission process only. Hence, parents should not waste time in waiting for prominent college admission seats. Challenges faced this year because of the Covid outbreak. The entire admission process, from registration of colleges to student admission, was online, unlike the pre-Covid situation. I made it clear to colleges and students that in-person meet posed spread of infection, so a dedicated email was sent to students to highlight the issue. We started an online grievance address cell. I have replied to more than 5,000 emails of students and parents regarding admission related queries. Earlier, there were 46 guidance centres to help students in the admission process. We verified all Secondary School Certificate (SSC) board students at the school level itself, a process earlier done by guidance centres. I took eight online webinars for around 1,100 school principals in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad areas. This step helped to speed up the admission process through online mode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-should-understand-that-students-will-get-college-seats-as-per-marks-and-cut-offs-only-meena-shendkar/story-OQYrlh1Qs3foHEADmqO7lI.html

These are part of 20,000 registered startups that Maharashtra has of the total 1.10 lakh in the country, according to the committee survey. Vishwas Mahajan, head of the committee, shared the data during a virtual meeting of startup ecosystem stakeholders in the city on Friday. The Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) has launched a monthly interaction series for stakeholders in the startup ecosystem in the city. The committee will be the voice of startup customers, Mahajan said during the interaction. MCCIA committee aims to synergise the strengths of incubators and provide a platform for networking amongst themselves as well as other stakeholders in the city. Mahajan said, “We had recently undertaken a study in which it was revealed that more than 5,600 startups recognised by the government of India under the Startup India initiative are from Pune. There will be more startups functioning and operating from Pune, but not registered with the government. We are trying to bring together all these startups along with other stakeholders in the startup ecosystem like accelerators and incubators.” “There are a few examples of unicorns and other startups who have made it to international headlines. However, we as a city are punching much below our potential,” Mahajan said. MCCIA president Sudhir Mehta said, “Close collaboration between stakeholders is necessary for an ecosystem to become successful. The objective of the initiative is to give startups access to customers. Pune has the capacity to become global centre of innovation and MCCIA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/5-600-startups-from-pune-registered-with-the-central-government-s-startup-india-initiative-mccia-committee/story-gz3SABXkyWhD33JWKCi0sL.html
19-12-2020||Pune||Pets banned at NIBM forest parks||The Pune forest department has launched a strict crackdown on morning visitors bringing pets to the forest area of NIBM in Pune. District forest officer Rahul Patil said, “Pets are a threat to the natural biodiversity of forests. We will be dealing with pet owners very strictly, wherein they will be fined and criminal offences will be lodged against them if they bring pets for morning walks or any other activity in the NIBM forest.” Patil, however, made it clear that morning walkers were free to continue with their physical exercise in the forest. “Pets like dogs have been banned completely from the forests as per the law and any violation will invite strictest action and even an FIR,” he reiterated. Earlier, the forest department took strict action against pet owners who brought pets to Vetal tekdi. A police official attached to the city commissionerate was bitten by an unchained Alsatian on November 29 inside the NIBM forest premises. NIBM citizen’s watch committee member Daljeet Goraya said, “We demand strict action against unchained dogs being let loose inside the NIBM forest as small children, elders, patients and general walkers are threatened by their aggression. There is a need to protect the lives of the citizens and the forest department is doing a good job banning pets strictly as per the law.” Meanwhile, pet lovers have termed the action as a violation of animal rights. Sameer Jadhav, who till recently used to bring his pet to Vetal tekdi for a morning walk, said, “The forest department is acting without reason. Pets are not harmful. Denying pets their space in a forest is a violation of pet rights.” Rohini Sharma, another pet lover at NIBM, said, “We have been taking stroll in the NIBM forest for the last several years. The problem is a few pet owners are leaving unchained dogs inside the forest. Action must be taken against such type of pet owners, but chained pets must be allowed as per the law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pets-banned-at-nibm-forest-parks/story-wXNQdVlfuFrnTxlwrHVHmM.html

The move has been taken as many projects submitted in the past had inflated estimates. These estimates later inflated the total project cost.

In the rest of England, people will be allowed to meet in Christmas bubbles for just one day instead of five, as the government originally planned.“It is with a very heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot proceed with Christmas as planned,” Johnson said.He said he concluded there was “no alternative open to me” and people must sacrifice this Christmas to have a better chance of protecting the lives of loved ones.Also Read: Moderna, McKesson and US Army general begin rolling out new Covid vaccine“I know how much emotion people invest in this time of year, and how important it is for grandparents to see their grandchildren,” Johnson said. “But when the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defense.”A fast-moving new variant of the coronavirus that is more than 70% more transmissible than existing strains appears to be driving the rapid spread in London and southern England, Johnson said. London now has the highest infection rates in England.“There’s no evidence to suggest it is more lethal or causes more severe illness,” he stressed, or that vaccines will be less effective against it.England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said the UK has alerted the World Health Organization that the new variant identified this week appears to be accelerating the spread of Covid-19. The government’s scientific advisers came to that conclusion based on preliminary modelling figures, and they are continuing to analyze the available data, he said.Viruses mutate regularly, and scientists have found thousands different of mutations among samples of the virus causing Covid-19. But many of these changes have no effect on how easily the virus spreads or how severe symptoms are.Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, told reporters after receiving notification from England this week that the UN health agency had “no evidence this variant behaves differently” and that it was similar to a variant initially reported among mink in Europe. She said scientists would study the virus strain to see if there might be any difference in how it prompts an immune response in people.Wales and Northern Ireland, which have their own devolved governments and independent rules for controlling the virus, have already announced fresh lockdowns once Christmas is over.UK officials reported another 28,507 confirmed cases on Friday, and 489 deaths of people within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. The UK has Europe’s second-highest Covid-19 death toll behind Italy, standing at 66,541 as of Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-nixes-christmas-gatherings-shuts-london-shops/story-emXJgeZZefYF9LQAqnatXP.html
19-12-2020||World||Moderna, McKesson and US Army general begin rolling out new Covid vaccine||Distribution of Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine to more than 3,700 locations in the United States has begun, vastly widening the rollout started last week by Pfizer Inc, US Army General Gustave Perna said on Saturday. Moderna has already moved vaccines from its manufacturing plants to warehouses operated by distributor McKesson Corp where they are being packed into containers and loaded on to trucks on Saturday, Perna said during a news conference. Trucks will set out on Sunday and shipments will start reaching healthcare providers as soon as Monday, he said. The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved an emergency use authorization for Moderna’s vaccine, the second Covid-19 vaccine to be approved. The jab developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE was approved Dec. 11. Workers in pharmaceutical services provider Catalent Inc’s facility in Bloomington, Indiana, are filling and packaging vials with Moderna vaccine and handing them to McKesson, which will ship doses from facilities including Louisville, Kentucky and Memphis, Tennessee. Those locations are close to air hubs for United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp.Also Read: US clears Moderna vaccine for Covid-19, 2nd shot in arsenalThe start of delivery for the Moderna vaccine will significantly widen availability of Covid-19 vaccines as US deaths related to the respiratory virus set records.“This is now a footrace between the vaccine and Covid,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Friday at a briefing on the virus. He said New York expects to receive 346,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine next week. Those will go to 292 medical facilities across the state. Pfizer organized its own distribution system but the US government’s Operation Warp Speed, led by an Army general, is in charge for Moderna. The Moderna delivery system will have some of the same players as Pfizer’s but will differ in key ways.Transportation companies UPS and FedEx are giving priority to vaccines on planes and trucks that are moving holiday gifts and other cargo. Their drivers will handle the bulk of the last-mile Moderna vaccine deliveries. They are going directly to vaccination sites, unlike Pfizer’s which was sent to large hubs and redistributed. Moderna’s vaccine is available in quantities as small as 100 doses and can be stored for 30 days in standard-temperature refrigerators, while the inoculations from Pfizer come in boxes of 975 doses, must be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), and can be held for only 5 days at standard refrigerator temperatures. Texas and Arkansas officials told Reuters they expect Moderna to be the primary vaccine for rural areas, which often lack the ultra cold storage equipment to store full trays of Pfizer’s vials. Once the plastic on a Pfizer 975-dose tray is opened, recipients have 120 hours to use the vaccine. Initial doses were given to health professionals. Programs by pharmacies Walgreens and CVS to distribute the Pfizer vaccine to long-term care facilities are expected to start on Monday, said Gareth Rhodes, a member of Cuomo’s Covid-19 task force. And a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel on Sunday will consider what groups should get vaccinated next. “The logistics will be easier with the Moderna vaccine,” said Jesse Breidenbach, senior executive director of pharmacy for Sanford Health, which operates almost four dozen hospitals in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. “Thirty days in the refrigerator will make it a bit easier to deal with,” Breidenbach said. Still, doses of vaccine must travel with security guards, including US Marshals, and will be stored in locked refrigerators.

Both vaccines were about 95% effective at preventing illness in clinical trials that found no serious safety issues. Separately, US officials said Pfizer is preparing to distribute 2 million additional doses of its vaccine to locations around the country next week, with preparations for shipping beginning over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-mckesson-and-us-army-general-begin-rolling-out-new-covid-vaccine/story-wj91lVHc2tocgVmakq1UjJ.html

Trial is scheduled for March.Cahill dismissed concerns by state prosecutors, who argued last month that recording audio and visuals of the trial would violate court rules and scare away potential witnesses. Attorney General Keith Ellison’s office, which is leading the prosecution, asked that Cahill rescind his previous ruling or consider narrowing the scope of outside access.Cahill declined to modify his original ruling, writing that although he had granted more extensive video coverage than allowed in court rules, he is permitted to modify the rules “in any case to prevent manifest injustice.”A coalition of media organizations, including The Associated Press, has requested camera access, arguing that cameras would increase transparency, especially during the pandemic.Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died May 25 after Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after Floyd said he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin faces second-degree unintentional murder and manslaughter charges. Lane, J. Kueng, Tou Thao and Thomas Lane are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. All four officers were fired.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/video-allowed-in-trial-of-officers-charged-in-floyd-killing/story-5VTeRVPU2ujHhRbDPllmsM.html

Breaking his silence for the first time on the major cybersecurity breach, Trump said he has been fully briefed on the matter and everything is “under control”. The US president also tried to undercut the assertions of top government officials, including State Secretary Mike Pompeo, who had suggested that Russia was behind the massive cyberattack. “Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!),” Trump tweeted.The outgoing president also suggested that the cyberattack could have also targeted the voting machines during the presidential polls, claiming that he won the election. “There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA,” he added. The tweet was promptly flagged by the micro-blogging site with the message, “Multiple sources called this election differently.” The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality.

He said there are broader ramifications since the attackers used a technique that has put at risk the technology supply chain for the broader economy.A popular software called Orion, developed by the company SolarWinds, was compromised by a malicious code snuck into one of its upgrades in as early as March. The software provides network-monitoring services to a host of companies and government agencies around the world. The malware granted hackers remote access to networks of many of its targets.“The installation of this malware created an opportunity for the attackers to follow up and pick and choose from among these customers the organizations they wanted to further attack,” wrote Smith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-may-be-china-trump-undercuts-pompeo-s-assertion-on-cyberattack/story-8PIrStzRkBLnXep8sn8dCO.html

President Xi, who heads the Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall high-command of the two million-strong People’s Liberation Army (PLA), appointed Gen. Zhang Xudong as the Commander of the Western Theatre Command, according to the official media here. Xi has promoted four senior Chinese military and armed police officers. Among them was Gen. Zhang, Commander of the Western Theatre Command of the PLA, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Friday. The other officers who were promoted include Guo Puxiao, Political Commissar of the Logistic Support Department of the CMC; Li Wei, Political Commissar of the PLA Strategic Support Force and Wang Chunning, Commander. The new appointments at the top of the PLA Western Command comes in the midst of the standoff between the Chinese and Indian military in eastern Ladakh since May. Not much is known about Gen. Zhang, especially his association with Western Theatre Command, as he reportedly served mostly in other theatre commands of the PLA. He succeeds 65-year-old Gen. Zhao Zongqi who headed the Western Theatre Command during the 2017 Doklam standoff where the Indian Army stood up against the PLA’s plan of laying a road close to the Indian border in an area claimed by Bhutan. The Ladakh standoff also happened under the watch of Gen Zhao. It began in May after China dispatched thousands of troops which were mobilised for military exercises to eastern Ladakh borders, sparking a new round of tensions with India. India and China have held several rounds of talks at the diplomatic and military-level to resolve the prolonged standoff. At the latest round of foreign ministry-level talks on December 18, the two sides said that they have agreed to continue work towards ensuring complete disengagement of troops in all friction points along the LAC. The meeting also decided to hold the next round of military dialogue at an early date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ladakh-standoff-chinese-president-xi-jinping-appoints-new-general-for-pla-s-western-theatre-command/story-fu4FiygoRnsGv7NcGc3A4L.html

The Indian diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Office (FO) here a day after the Pakistan Army accused the Indian Army of “deliberately” targeting the UNMO, an allegation dismissed by India as completely false, baseless and factually incorrect. The FO said that the UN Observers were on their way to Polas village to meet with the victims of ceasefire violations when their vehicle was targeted. While the vehicle was damaged, the two UNMOs remained unharmed, it said. Military sources in New Delhi have rejected the allegation, saying reports of targeting the UN vehicle are not true. Meanwhile in New York, United Nations Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq, commenting on the incident on Friday, said: “I believe that the details we have are in fact that there was no one hurt but there has been a vehicle damaged in an incident and the mission is currently investigating the incident”. Official sources in New Delhi have said the reports emerging from the Pakistani side regarding attacks on the UN vehicle by Indian troops along the LoC are completely false, baseless and factually incorrect. The sources said there was no firing from the Indian side in that sector on Friday. Since movements of UN vehicles are known in advance, the question does not arise of any such firing, the sources said, adding the allegations are baseless. India maintains that the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), established in January 1949, has outlived its utility and is irrelevant after the Simla Agreement and the consequent establishment of the Line of Control.

19-12-2020||World||Hack attack adds to Putin mystique even if Russia faces pain||The storm over a cyber attack on US government agencies only helps Russian President Vladimir Putin’s image at home as a strong leader unafraid to confront the former Cold War enemy, even as the Kremlin denies involvement amid fears of a backlash when Joe Biden enters the White House.“Inside the country it bolsters the authorities’ prestige,” said Andrey Kortunov, head of the Kremlin-founded Russian International Affairs Council. “Outside Russia, it only deepens mistrust and this creates risks” by stoking hostility in Washington and other Western capitals, he said.Secretary of State Michael Pompeo became the highest ranking US official to link Moscow to the attacks, saying in a radio interview on Friday that Putin “remains a real risk to those of us who love freedom.”“This was a very significant effort, and I think it’s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,” Pompeo said. President Donald Trump has yet to comment publicly on the hacks.Those risks became apparent Friday when Russia’s ruble took a hit after rallying for two months, slumping as much as 1.4% amid renewed concerns over sanctions. After years of US and European sanctions, however, Russia’s grown more resistant to pressure and there may be little left for Washington to penalize without disrupting global energy and mineral resources markets where Russia is an important player.Putin himself brushes off any accusations he’s behind hacking campaigns. When a local rock-star-turned-journalist, Sergey Shnurov, asked tongue-in-cheek at the president’s annual news conference Thursday why Russian hackers couldn’t repeat their 2016 operation to help get Trump re-elected, Putin dismissed the question with a smile as a “provocation.”‘Revenge’ CampaignThe Kremlin leader also accused US intelligence of involvement in a recent leak about his family’s finances, calling it part of a “revenge” campaign against Russia.The fallout from the cyber attack on Texas-based SolarWinds Corp., which spread to its customers including the State, Treasury and Commerce departments and many Fortune 500 companies, may well unleash a new round of pressure on Russia, said three people close to the Kremlin who declined to be identified discussing internal matters.While Russia didn’t expect U.S. policy to soften under Biden, each new accusation weakens prospects for normalization because the president-elect will be unable to start his administration on a fresh page, said one of the people.Biden is taking office following four years of steadily worsening ties after US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election campaign to help elect Trump. The Kremlin denies the accusation.Few in Moscow expected a thaw from the new president, though there was at least an expectation of finding common ground on some issues.Unlike Trump, Biden has promised to extend the New START treaty that expires in February and is the last remaining nuclear arms agreement between Russia and the US.He has also pledged to return to the 2015 deal limiting Iran’s nuclear program that Trump abandoned, while calling for some changes to the accord.The SolarWinds scandal “is an effort to inject more negativity and increase anti-Russian rhetoric to sabotage Biden’s few positive initiatives,” said Alexander Dynkin, president of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, which advises the Kremlin. “These are dangerous games.”Deter AttacksBiden hasn’t threatened specific retaliatory measures yet, though he warned Thursday that his administration will move to deter cyber attacks from adversaries by “imposing substantial costs on those responsible.”The latest allegations aren’t as serious as in 2016, when Russian military intelligence was accused of targeting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton with a hack-and-leak operation, because they weren’t an attempt to interfere in U.S. politics, said Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat who’s now a foreign policy analyst in Moscow.“This is classic espionage. They’re the ones to blame, they should have protected their network better,” Frolov said. “Maybe there’ll be some diplomats expelled, but I doubt much more.”Putin underlined the rising competition between major powers in the virtual arena at a meeting of his Security Council on Friday, saying it would focus on “neutralizing threats to our country’s national security associated with the development of artificial intelligence technologies for military purposes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hack-attack-adds-to-putin-mystique-even-if-russia-faces-pain/story-cTyrMyTS8YCUsvOGV83XKM.html
19-12-2020||World||Covid-19: WHO was warned lives were at risk over yanked report on Italy||An author of a withdrawn World Health Organization report into Italy’s coronavirus response warned his bosses in May that people could die and the UN agency could suffer “catastrophic” reputational damage if it allowed political concerns to suppress the document, according to emails seen by The Associated Press.The comprehensive report examined how the Italian government and health system reacted after the country became the epicenter of the European outbreak in late February. , with real-time data and case studies of what worked and what didn’t. It was aimed at helping other countries prepare as the virus spread globally, but it hit a sensitive nerve among Italian officials because it noted that Italy went into the crisis with an out-of-date pandemic plan.The agency took it down a day after it was posted on its website, prompting the official who coordinated the work to appeal directly to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on May 28 and warn that the report’s disappearance was undermining WHO’s credibility. He cautioned that any further attempts at censorship would compromise the agency’s independence and its relations with donor nations that funded the research.The handling of the report could cause a “scandal of huge proportion — in a delicate moment for the UN health agency with the forthcoming COVID-19 investigation,” wrote Francesco Zambon, WHO’s chief field coordinator for Italy and its regions during the pandemic.In a statement Saturday, WHO said Zambon “expressed his views to many people and they were handled via appropriate channels.”The report, written by Zambon and a team of WHO public health experts and consultants, was posted May 13 after it had received necessary approvals within the UN system, according to internal WHO documents seen by AP. The agency later said it was withdrawn because of “factual inaccuracies” that it has not detailed and denied that it received any pressure from the Italian government to remove it.In the face of criticism that yanking the report deprived countries of data that could have helped them avoid Italy’s fate, WHO said Monday that it has offered another “mechanism” to assess pandemic responses. But that wasn’t rolled out until two months after the report was pulled.Concerns over the missing report have grown in recent weeks, fueling criticism of WHO’s leadership of the global response to the pandemic that led the agency to agree to an independent probe of its performance.The UN agency has been loath to publicly criticize countries that are top donors even when their policies could undermine public health.During the initial stages of the outbreak in January, for example, WHO officials were privately frustrated by the lack of information being shared by China, but publicly lauded the country for its transparency. As the pandemic gained pace in Europe, WHO scientists internally questioned Britain’s policies — such as when it suggested it would pursue “herd immunity” — but publicly emphasized their support.The missing report has cast a spotlight on preparedness in Italy, where Europe’s deadliest outbreak unfolded. In the hard-hit province of Bergamo, prosecutors have seized on it as part of their investigation into what went wrong.Paradoxically, the report isn’t even particularly critical of the Italian government and credited officials for their efforts, praising at one point how they counteracted with data “sensational displays of disagreement in talk shows” that stirred anxiety.The text did note that the Italian Health Ministry hadn’t updated its influenza pandemic preparedness plan since 2006. The 2006 plan was merely “reconfirmed” in 2016-2017 without being updated and was “more theoretical than practical.”“Unprepared for such a flood of severely ill patients, the initial reaction of the hospitals was improvised, chaotic and creative,” the report said. “It took some time before formal guidance became available.”Italy’s state-run RAI television investigative “Report” program has published emails showing that a top WHO official, Raniero Guerra, who worked as a liaison with the Italian government during the pandemic, told Zambon to “correct” that Italy’s preparedness plan had been “updated” in 2016, even though the 2016 version was identical to the 2006 one.Guerra had been in charge of prevention in the Italian Health Ministry from 2014 to 2017, when the plan should have been overhauled. He himself wrote to the then-health minister saying the plan needed to be updated, according to a copy of his 2017 memo seen by AP.WHO has said the Italian government “at no time” asked it to remove the report, which it now says it does not endorse. “The decision to remove the document from the website was taken by WHO’s Regional Office for Europe due to factual inaccuracies,” WHO said.Zambon says the only inaccuracy was an out-of-date timeline of the virus in China that he corrected immediately and had new copies without it printed. WHO on Saturday defended retracting the report altogether.“We are, of course, resolutely focused on saving lives, but published content needs to be accurate and based on proven methods,” WHO said.Guerra told the Financial Times he didn’t interfere. He added that the 2006 preparedness plan actually didn’t need to be updated because no significant flu strains had been identified since then and that the preparedness plan wasn’t relevant to the current pandemic because it was only meant to cover influenza.The deputy health minister, Pierpaolo Sileri, begged to disagree. “That plan was from 2006 and needed to be updated,” Sileri told the Corriere della Sera paper. Guerra didn’t immediately respond to questions from AP, saying he was traveling.The emails seen by AP suggest that WHO officials were concerned that the report had upset the Italians, offering rare insight into decision making by the UN agency, which is not subject to Freedom of Information requests.In a May 13 email to Zambon, Guerra noted that Italy had just made a 10 million-euro ($12.3 million) voluntary donation to the WHO, and that negotiations between WHO and Italy for funding the agency’s Venice office were about to begin.“There are already signs of institutional turmoil from the Italian side and unnecessary resentment against the WHO,” Guerra wrote to Zambon on May 14, the day the report was yanked.A day later, the head of WHO Europe, Dr. Hans Kluge, wrote to Zambon that the “key issue” at stake in the controversy was his relationship with the Italian health minister, Roberto Speranza, who he said had been “very disappointed” by the report.The Italian government, he said, feels “they are constantly attacked by the press and each word can be misinterpreted. They felt stepped (on) by a friend.”Kluge said he would propose to Speranza including Italian health officials in a review of the report. “We need MoH (Ministry of Health) happy and sign off for Venice,” he said, referring to the funding for the office.The ministry told RAI it doesn’t consider the report official.Meanwhile, Zambon was warning Tedros and Kluge that lives were being put at risk around the world by withholding Italy’s “lessons learned.”“A large team of experts worked literally days and nights with one motivation: making sure that what happened in Italy is not repeated in those countries behind in time in the epidemic curve,” Zambon wrote Kluge on May 27. “The report contains important messages, extrapolated from facts on what worked (many things) and the blind spots of the system.”A day later, in a message to the WHO chief, Zambon warned of a “risk of catastrophic damage in terms of independence and transparency if a ‘censored’ version of the above mentioned publication is modified,” as well as “compromised” relations with the government of Kuwait, which is one of WHO’s biggest donors and had funded the research with an $80 million grant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-who-was-warned-lives-were-at-risk-over-yanked-report-on-italy/story-UviRbwfBcF1joen7zMTMIP.html

She said scientists would study the virus strain to see if there might be any difference in how it prompts an immune response in people.Johnson is expected to announce to announce changes to current infection-prevention restrictions when he holds a news conference later Saturday.London now has the highest case rates in England, and this week moved under the highest level of coronavirus restrictions in the country’s three-tier alert system. Most of southern England joined the capital in an expansion of Tier 3 rules Saturday, meaning a total of 38 million people — or 68% of England’s population — are living under the toughest rules.Under the restrictions, people cannot socialize indoors or in most outdoor places, and restaurants and pubs only can offer takeaway service. Shops remain open, however.The government has said restrictions on socializing will be eased from December 23 to December 27 to allow people to travel and celebrate Christmas with family and friends. The temporary holiday rules allow a maximum of three households to meet in a “Christmas bubble,” though Johnson urged residents to keep their celebrations small and short.The planned relaxation of rules has raised increasing concerns given that infections are already climbing sharply in many places.The Prime Minister held an unscheduled meeting on Friday evening to discuss the latest evidence about the mutant strain with officials. He has refused to rule out the prospect of a third national lockdown for England.Wales and Northern Ireland, which have their own devolved governments and independent rules for controlling the virus, have already announced fresh lockdowns once Christmas is over.UK officials reported another 28,507 confirmed cases on Friday, and 489 deaths of people within 28 days of testing positive for the virus.

Less than two months earlier, at least 24 people died in a suicide bombing outside an education center in the country’s capital, Kabul.The continued violence in Afghanistan is taking place as both the government and the Taliban hold peace negotiations in the Qatari capital, Doha.The talks began this past September following the completion of a prisoner exchange process, although a recess is currently in effect to give both sides the opportunity to hold internal meetings on agenda items.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-480-afghan-civilians-dead-over-past-three-months-from-taliban-attacks/story-z8yLXKmex6kBZwrk2p2TtO.html
19-12-2020||World||Explainer: Russia’s potent cyber and information warfare capabilities||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that Russia was responsible for a cyber attack that embedded malicious code inside US government software systems and those of other governments and companies across the world.The Kremlin has always denied Moscow’s involvement in cyber attacks against the West. It has said that Russia had nothing to do with this latest assault.Here is some information about Russia’s possible motives for such an attack, and details about Russian cyber offensive and information warfare capabilities. Possible Russian motive The Kremlin has said many times it wants to improve ties with the United States, which are at a post-Cold War low and strained by issues from Ukraine to Syria. But it also openly views the United States as Russia’s main geopolitical adversary and as a threat to its national security. President Vladimir Putin has accused Washington of starting a new arms race and NATO of moving military infrastructure closer to Russia’s borders, and has complained about US sanctions, part of what Putin casts as an attempt to hold Russia back economically and technologically. Russia regularly probes US defences, flying nuclear-capable strategic bombers near Alaska and sending submarines into the Atlantic to lurk off the East Coast. Putin has complained that outgoing President Donald Trump was unable to improve U.S-Russia ties and has singled out what he has called President-elect Joe Biden’s harsh anti-Russian rhetoric.On Thursday, Putin blamed US intelligence agencies for a series of recent media investigations into people close to him. Without providing evidence, he also linked US intelligence agencies to what he presented as the stage-managed poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Putin did not congratulate Biden on his victory in the Nov. 3 election until Dec. 15. Putin said last month he was not worried that his delay in congratulating Biden would worsen US-Russia ties. “You can’t spoil a spoiled relationship,” said Putin. ‘Cozy bear’Some cyber researchers have suggested that Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service may have been behind the latest attack. In 2018, Dutch media cited unnamed intelligence officials as saying the AIVD, the Dutch intelligence agency, had linked a Russian hacking group known as “Cozy Bear” or APT29 (advanced persistent threat 29) to the SVR. The AIVD did not comment. The Washington Post cited sources on Dec. 13 as saying the United States had identified “Cozy Bear” as being responsible for the latest cyber attack referred to by Pompeo. Hackers from “Cozy Bear” were detected by cyber security firm CrowdStrike on the US Democratic Party’s servers in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election when email accounts of Hillary Clinton’s staff were hacked. In July, Britain, the United States and Canada accused “Cozy Bear” of trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine research from academic and pharmaceutical institutions around the world. ‘Fancy bear’Russian military intelligence, commonly known as GRU, has potent cyber offence capabilities, according to US intelligence agencies. In particular, GRU controls a hacking group known to cyber researchers as “Fancy Bear” or APT28 (advanced persistent threat 28) they have said. It was that group, according to a Department of Justice indictment filed in 2018, that hacked the email accounts of Hillary Clinton’s staff before the 2016 election.Reuters reported in September that Microsoft believed “Fancy Bear” had also targeted a firm working with Biden.In 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency accused Russian hackers of stealing confidential medical information about US Olympic athletes and publishing it online. The FBI later seized the domain of the site - http://www.fancybear.net - where the information was released.“Fancy Bear” hackers have also been linked by cyber security investigators to cyber attacks on the US and French elections.The FSBRussia’s Federal Security Service, the FSB, is the country’s main domestic intelligence agency. The United States in 2017 charged two FSB agents and two hackers with masterminding the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts. The Justice Department indictment included charges of computer fraud, economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, wire fraud, access device fraud and aggravated identify theft. It painted a picture of the Russian security services working hand-in-hand with cyber criminals, who helped spies further their intelligence goals in exchange for money.Internet research agency US prosecutors say the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) played a key role in Russian efforts to try to sway the 2016 election in favour of Trump. It did so, they say, by flooding social media with false reports and conspiracy theories in an attempt to exploit existing divisions.The group is a Kremlin-backed outfit whose employees have posed as Americans, according to US officials.The US Treasury Department in September imposed sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the financier of the IRA, who was charged in 2018, along with 12 other individuals and three entities, with conspiracy to defraud the United States for his alleged role in election meddling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-russia-s-potent-cyber-and-information-warfare-capabilities/story-JfcoM58TefQjZOBPvxD8lN.html

The European Commission last week approved the drug, branded Leqvio, which Novartis bought last year in a deal worth nearly $10 billion and expects to be a top seller.The purchase was a part of the drugmaker’s $9.7 billion takeover of The Medicines Co last November in a bid to challenge cardiovascular medicines from Amgen Inc, Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. “Novartis is confident in the quality of the regulatory submission for inclisiran....We look forward to meeting with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and our third-party manufacturing partner to discuss the feedback received and next steps,” Novartis Chief Medical Officer John Tsai said in a company statement. No onsite inspection was conducted by the FDA, the company said, adding that the regulator would schedule a facility inspection if it was deemed necessary once safe travel resumes.In an emailed response to a query, Novartis identified the supplier as Corden Pharma Caponago, based in Italy, which is responsible for drug product manufacturing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-declines-approval-of-novartis-cholesterol-lowering-drug/story-MPu86SITTQUtbVXU2ayrKJ.html
19-12-2020||World||UK discusses action after confirmation new Covid strain spreads more quickly||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was discussing with his senior ministers on Saturday what urgent action to take after it was confirmed that a new strain of the Covid-19 virus could spread more quickly and lead to a surge in cases.England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said that while there was no current evidence the variant of the novel coronavirus caused a higher mortality rate or impacted vaccines, urgent work was underway to confirm this.“We have alerted the World Health Organisation and are continuing to analyse the available data to improve our understanding,” Whitty said in a statement.The government said on Monday that a rise in infections across London and southeast England might be linked to a new, more transmissible variant of the virus.Johnson will hold a news conference with Whitty and the government’s chief scientific adviser at about 1600 GMT amid suggestions that he will announce new urgent measures to try to address the rise in cases caused by the variant Covid strain.Britain reported 28,507 new Covid-19 cases on Friday and 489 deaths, with the reproduction “R” number estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2, meaning the number of cases is rapidly increasing.Johnson said on Friday he hoped England would not need to go into a third lockdown after Christmas and has so far resisted calls to change plans to ease restrictions for five days over the festive period, allowing three separate households to meet indoors.Much of the country, including London, is currently in the highest of a three-tier system of restrictions to curb the spread. The Daily Telegraph newspaper said ministers could now announce curbs on travel between southeast England, including the capital, and the rest of the country.“Failing to act decisively now, will mean further suffering. We must keep asking ourselves ‘are we doing enough, are we acting quickly enough’,” Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), said on Twitter.The opposition Labour Party said the tiered system had failed to curb the virus’s spread.“It has been apparent for some days that the virus is again out of control in parts of the country,” said Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-discusses-action-after-confirmation-new-covid-strain-spreads-more-quickly/story-6glpSwmXRJSt1HylsffWUK.html

Critics demanded that the leader resign and tried to pelt him with eggs.The Azerbaijani army pushed deep into Nagorno-Karabakh in six weeks of hostilities that ended with a Russia-brokered peace deal on November 10 that saw Azerbaijan reclaim large parts of the separatist region and surrounding territories.The loss of lands that had been controlled by ethnic Armenian forces for more than a quarter-century has traumatized Armenians, triggering weeks of protests demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.On Saturday, thousands of protesters rallied near the Yerablur military memorial cemetery on the outskirts of the Armenian capital of Yerevan as Pashinyan visited it to honor the soldiers killed in the latest fighting. The nation is observing a three-day mourning period for the dead.The prime minister’s opponents, shouting “Nikol, you traitor!,” engaged in scuffles with his supporters and police. Police dispersed the protesters to clear the way for Pashinyan and his security guards covered him with shields and umbrellas as protesters attempted to hit him with eggs.Later in the day, about 20,000 opposition supporters marched across Yerevan for a memorial church service for the victims of the conflict.Also on Saturday, 14 retired military generals issued a statement calling for the resignation of the government over its handling of the latest fighting.Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands.In 44 days of fighting that began in late September and left more than 5,600 people killed on both sides, the Azerbaijani army fought its way deep into Nagorno-Karabakh, forcing Armenia to accept last month’s peace deal.Russia has deployed nearly 2,000 peacekeepers for at least five years to monitor the peace agreement and facilitate the return of refugees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-honors-nagorno-karabakh-dead-some-call-for-pm-resignation/story-43Jt68yj0uZDvZQPeCvosM.html

Speaking of the general situation in France, where the number of deaths passed 60,000 on Friday, he warned: “We have to be vigilant as the virus is gaining in strength again.” The French authorities are concerned that the holiday period could see a new spike in infections.On Friday, a total 15,674 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours in France, down from 18,254 the previous day.And the so-called positivity rate -- which measures the number of confirmed contaminations as a proportion of the number of tests carried out -- slipped slightly to 5.9 percent from 6.1 percent on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emmanuel-macron-stable-after-covid-19-infection-presidency/story-qIXGiUyyD5jJoQtW3qPKoI.html
19-12-2020||World||Brexit deal on a knife edge after day of high drama in talks||Brexit trade talks headed into a decisive weekend with neither side confident of a deal after a frantic 24 hours exposed just how far apart the UK and European Union still are on an issue that’s hampered the talks since March.With officials from both sides expecting a conclusion one way or the other within the next two days, talks resumed in Brussels on Friday afternoon -- but only after EU negotiators had spent the morning consulting their own national capitals over the scope for compromise on the issue of fishing rights. The UK rejected the bloc’s latest offer.British and European diplomats close to the negotiations insisted it’s still just as likely that talks will collapse without a deal being struck as they are to end with an accord. It sets up a critical two days that will define the UK’s relationship with the bloc when the country makes its final break with the European single market on Dec. 31.In a day of high drama:The whole trade deal is increasingly hinging on how much the EU is prepared to give up of its fishing catch in UK waters. The British feel they have the upper hand after making concessions on the other major roadblock, a level playing field for businesses, in recent days.A handful of fishAccording to officials close to the negotiations, the UK on Thursday rejected an EU offer that would see the bloc lose around 22% of the current 650 million euros ($800 million) of fish caught annually in British waters. After consultation with the capitals on Friday, the EU offered 25% and this was again rejected. The UK is pushing the reduction to be closer to 60%, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.To put that into context, the negotiations are snagged over fishing rights equivalent to about 0.01% of UK GDP. The British government’s own analysis in 2018 suggested the economy will be at least 2.6% smaller in 15 years’ time if there’s no trade deal.The EU offered to reduced the phase-in period of the new arrangements to six years, after originally wanting 10. The UK rejected the offer of six and has proposed just three years.The British see control of their fishing waters, previously under the jurisdiction of the EU, as a key element of the sovereignty that it is regaining with Brexit. For its part, the European side doesn’t want to give access to its single market without maintaining fishing rights in return.“Our door is open, we’ll keep talking,” Johnson said. “There’s a gap that needs to be bridged. We hope that our EU friends will see sense and come to the table with something themselves.”Officials said they expected talks to resume in Brussels on Saturday.On Saturday, French European Affairs Junior Minister Clement Beaune told France Inter radio that her country wouldn’t be bowed by the hard Sunday deadline.“It would be normal not to say, well it’s Sunday evening so let’s wrap it and sacrifice everything,” Beaune said. “It may be hard and sometimes tough to understand, but it’s necessary to take the time, and at any rate not to sacrifice our interests under the pressure of a calendar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-deal-on-a-knife-edge-after-day-of-high-drama-in-talks/story-qYj8cGPsPHohaOyU15DOML.html
19-12-2020||World||Biden to introduce team tasked with ambitious climate agenda||President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled to publicly introduce his climate and energy team on Saturday, a history-making group that will be tasked with advancing his ambitious climate policy and strengthening safeguards against pollution.Biden has promised to make tackling climate change one of the pillars of his Democratic administration. But with a slim majority in the US House of Representatives and control of the U.S. Senate still undecided, Biden and his new team may see little success in Congress and instead rely on rules from his regulatory agencies to enact sweeping change. The climate team will be formally introduced in Biden’s home state of Delaware on Saturday, during a press briefing where he’s expected to tease further details of his climate plan. The former Vice President to President Barack Obama tapped a familiar face, Obama’s US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Gina McCarthy, to lead a newly-created position as national climate adviser tasked with implementing the domestic Biden agenda. Biden nominated Michael Regan, North Carolina’s top environmental regulator, to head up the EPA. Regan, who worked at the Washington-based agency during the Clinton and Bush administrations, has served as secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality since 2017.Democratic congresswoman Deb Haaland will serve as Biden’s interior secretary, and former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm as his energy secretary.The team also includes Brenda Mallory, an environmental lawyer, as chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and Ali Zaidi, a leading climate expert and Biden adviser, as deputy national climate adviser.If confirmed by the US Senate, Haaland would be the first Native American to hold a US cabinet post, Mallory would be the first African American to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and Regan would be the first Black man to run the EPA.The team has been largely praised by environmental groups for its experience and diversity. But the powerful fossil fuel industry, which Biden has frequently targeted for criticism, said the administration must balance its climate efforts with preserving jobs.“We will also be watching closely to ensure that the incoming administration keeps President-elect Biden’s campaign promises to the energy workforce and protects the millions of jobs supported by our industry in states like New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and across the country,” American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-introduce-team-tasked-with-ambitious-climate-agenda-on-saturday/story-sz80J8iWdVQvPoLL9zJELI.html

Shanghai-based chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and Shenzhen-based drone giant SZ DJI Technology Co. were among the companies that were punished.“Such moves have seriously damaged the international economic and trade order and free trade rules, as well as the security of the global supply chain,” China’s commerce ministry said.DJI, the world’s biggest drone maker, said it was “disappointed” about the blacklisting but won’t stop US customers buying its products.

19-12-2020||World||US government hack: Espionage or act of war? What do we know about it?||The suspected Russian hack of US government agencies has led to heated rhetoric from lawmakers, with US Senator Dick Durbin calling it “virtually a declaration of war” and US Senator Marco Rubio saying that “America must retaliate, and not just with sanctions.”But cybersecurity and legal experts said the hack would not be considered an act of war under international law and will likely go down in history as an act of espionage.Here’s why.WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE HACK?The hack, first reported by Reuters, hijacked software made by Texas-based SolarWinds Corp. By inserting malicious code into updates pushed to SolarWinds customers, the hackers were for months able to explore the computer networks of private companies, think tanks, and government agencies.Sources familiar with the US investigation said the hack was likely carried out by Russia’s foreign intelligence service. Moscow has denied involvement.The magnitude of the hack is still unclear, but hackers are known to have monitored email or other data within several US government agencies.The breached federal agencies include the Commerce Department, Treasury Department, and Department of Energy. An Energy Department spokeswoman said malware had been “isolated to business networks only” and had not impacted US national security.WAS THE HACK AN ‘ACT OF WAR’?It is too early to say for sure, but probably not, according to cybersecurity experts.To qualify as an act of war, United Nations resolutions and other sources of international law require a certain level of force or destruction that does not appear to be the case this time.“Warfare implies violence, death and destruction,” said Duncan Hollis, a professor of law at Temple University specializing in cybersecurity.Hollis and other experts said the attack appears to have been carried out to steal sensitive US information, and should be viewed as espionage.“Simply stealing information, as much as we don’t like it, is not an act of war — it is espionage,” said Benjamin Friedman, a policy director at the think tank Defense Priorities.Experts said cyber attacks can be acts of war if they cause physical destruction.A Department of Defense law of war manual states that some cyber operations should be subject to the same rules as physical, or “kinetic” attacks. Examples include operations that “trigger a nuclear plant meltdown; open a dam above a populated area, causing destruction; or disable air traffic control services, resulting in airplane crashes.”John Bellinger, the top State Department lawyer under former Republican Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said it was not yet clear whether the hack could be considered an act of war.“It may simply be a massive act of espionage that would not constitute an act of war. We don’t know yet whether the Russians simply accessed US government computers or actually disrupted government functions,” said Bellinger, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.IS THERE ANY PRECEDENT FOR THE HACK?A hack in 2014 that targeted the US government’s personnel agency, the Office of Personnel Management, exposed sensitive personal information of millions of current and former federal employees and contractors.Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in 2015 that he suspected China of conducting the hack, and he said during congressional testimony two years later that in his view it was an act of espionage.“I think there is a difference between an act of espionage, which we conduct as well, and other nations do, versus an attack,” Clapper said at the time.A devastating 2017 hack attributed to Russia, known as “NotPetya,” crippled ports by paralyzing the shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk and other global corporations.Olga Oliker, a Washington-based expert on US-Russia relations, said in 2017 testimony before the US Senate that, if Russia was to blame for NotPetya, “it is an example of precisely the type of cyber operation that could be seen as warfare, in that it approximates effects similar to those that might be attained through the use of armed force.”HOW MIGHT THE UNITED STATES RESPOND?The Defense Department manual says the United States cannot use force to respond to a cyber operation that is not itself an act of force. Instead, the United States can respond with measures such as “a diplomatic protest, an economic embargo, or other acts of retorsion” the manual says.“We know that lots of countries engage in espionage, and we don’t bomb them in response,” said Friedman.US President-elect Joe Biden signaled on Thursday that he would use targeted financial sanctions to respond.“They’ll be held accountable,” Biden told The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “Individuals as well as entities will find ... there are financial repercussions for what they did.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-us-government-hack-espionage-or-act-of-war/story-UklwUFOYyy6EnyLIoHnNwM.html
19-12-2020||World||Portugal’s armed forces help nursing homes battle the virus||Tears well up in Diana Correia’s eyes as she recalls the October day that 24 of the 55 residents of her nursing home in Portugal tested positive for Covid-19.The stunning discovery set off a scramble to enact the home’s contingency plan and stiffen safety procedures. With some staff sent into isolation, others worked double shifts of up to 16 hours in full protective equipment, leaving them lathered in sweat and bone-weary. Some of the home’s residents, suddenly confined to their rooms or their floor, were bewildered and chafed at restrictions, even trying to take the elevator and escape confinement.“They were hard times,” Correia says, trying hard to keep her composure. “Very hard times.”As a resurgence of the pandemic in the fall looked set to overwhelm Portuguese nursing homes like Correia’s, and the country’s public health service struggled to cope, the government mobilized all the resources it could. That included deploying military units.The soldiers’ mission: fan out across the country to visit hundreds of nursing homes and help shore up their defenses against the pandemic.Long-term care facilities have proven vulnerable worldwide during the pandemic. The age of their residents, their physical closeness inside what is essentially a large house, and the residents’ underlying health problems put them in peril. On top of that, nursing home staff in Portugal commonly work in several different care homes and travel between them on public transport.Noting that international data on nursing home Covid-19 deaths is “imperfect and limited,” a study of 21 countries by the London-based International Long-term Care Policy Network, which includes scientific researchers, found in October that those homes’ average share of coronavirus deaths was around 46%.The European Centre for Disease Control, an EU agency that monitors 31 countries, said the same month that up to 66% of all fatal Covid-19 cases have been among nursing home residents.By that measure, Portugal hasn’t fared badly. Care home deaths through December 14 accounted for 30% of the country’s Covid-19 fatalities, the General Directorate for Health told The Associated Press.On Friday, Portugal’s total deaths reached almost 6,000.At the end of September, fearing a calamity, the Portuguese government sent a distress call to its military. As well as helping with contact tracing, disinfecting buildings and providing beds for hundreds of virus patients at military hospitals, the armed forces were now being asked to buttress nursing home protections.Dr. Maria Salazar, a physician and a colonel in the Portuguese Air Force, swiftly drew up a nationwide program to train care home staff at their workplace. The program also ensures the staff get the specific medical advice they need in almost daily online Q&A sessions with doctors, nurses and pharmacists.Within a week, the program was launched, coordinated from the CECOM military operations command center near Lisbon.About 140 teams of one to three people, taken from the Portuguese Army, Navy and Air Force, have traveled across the country since early October. They have already been to more than half of the targeted 2,770 care homes.Salazar, a 49-year-old gastroenterologist, says the military presence is reassuring for nursing home staff and residents who were spooked by the virus threat and desperately short of medical know-how.“Suddenly, all these staff ... felt like they didn’t know what they were doing and they were scared to death,” Salazar says.At the root of some muddled decision-making was, simply, fear. “We’ve identified that very clearly,” she says.In a first phase, troops go in person to the nursing homes and give talks with slideshows that go through the rudimentary rules of cooking, laundry, cleaning and social distancing. It’s Covid-19 101.Correia, the technical director of an AFID charitable association nursing home in Amadora, just north of Lisbon, acknowledges it’s nothing her staff haven’t heard many times before. The difference is who the instructions are coming from.“It’s a voice from the outside, a military voice with all the weight that carries,” she says.In a recent afternoon session at the AFID home, 10 of Correia’s staff listened intently to Sgt. Ari Silva, from the No. 2 Lancers Regiment, whose barracks are nearby. Wearing military fatigues, a beret and an olive-green face mask, Silva asked his audience how many times they had washed their hands that day. A man sitting at the front said four.Silva was unimpressed: “Friend, I’ve done at least double that,” he said.The benefits of the military presence are as much psychological as practical, says 38-year-old Correia.“We feel like someone outside of here feels concern for us,” she said. “It’s not just us who are concerned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/portugal-s-armed-forces-help-nursing-homes-battle-the-virus/story-bSbXLitEIrI5r4PU7MV0UO.html
19-12-2020||World||China says it tailed US warship Mustin in Taiwan Strait||China’s military tailed a US warship as it passed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Saturday, the Chinese military said, denouncing such missions as sending “flirtatious glances” to supporters of Taiwan independence.China, which claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory, has been angered by stepped-up US support for the island, including arms sales and sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait, further souring Beijing-Washington relations.The US Navy said the guided missile destroyer USS Mustin had conducted “a routine Taiwan Strait transit (on) Dec. 19 in accordance with international law”.“The ship’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” it added.This is the 12th sailing through the strait by the US Navy this year.China’s military, in a statement released by its Eastern Theatre Command, said its air and naval forces “tailed and monitored” the vessel throughout.Such missions “deliberately raise the temperature of the Taiwan issue, as they fear calm in the Taiwan Strait, and send flirtatious glances to Taiwan independence forces, seriously jeopardising peace and stability in the strait”, it said.The United States is engaging in a show of force and trying to use Taiwan as a pawn for its own selfish strategic purposes, the statement added.In Taipei, Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said the US ship had proceeded in a southerly direction, that it has also monitored its movements, and that “the situation was as normal”.Beijing believes Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is bent on a formal declaration of independence for the island, a red line for Beijing. She says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.Tsai has made bolstering Taiwan’s armed forces a priority in the face of repeated Chinese military activity near the island, including on occasion this year sending fighter jets across the Taiwan Strait’s median line, an unofficial buffer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-tailed-us-warship-mustin-in-taiwan-strait/story-3wtCOK1rF4P1lGFbR8BaFL.html
19-12-2020||World||Explainer: Iran, despite sanctions, has routes to Covid-19 vaccines||Although Iran faces crushing US sanctions, there are still ways for Tehran to obtain coronavirus vaccines as the country suffers the Mideast’s worst outbreak of the pandemic.After earlier downplaying the virus, Iran has since acknowledged the scope of the disaster it faces after 1.1 million reported cases and over 52,000 deaths. Getting vaccines into the arms of its people would be a major step in stemming the crisis.But while Iran is able to obtain vaccines, challenges remain ranging from sanctions imposed under President Donald Trump to the logistics of making mass vaccinations happen.HOW COULD IRAN GET THE VACCINE?Iran has signed up for COVAX, an international program designed to distribute coronavirus vaccines to participating countries around the world. That program is run in part by Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance. Gavi says the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control has already issued a license for Iran to take part. The Treasury declined to comment.For its part, Iran has alleged US sanctions have affected its ability to purchase medicine and vaccines. President Hassan Rouhani has said Iranians “should curse Trump a hundred times” over the difficulties. US sanctions do have specific carve-outs for medicine and humanitarian aid to Iran. However, international banks and financial institutions hesitate in dealing with Iran transactions for fear of being fined or locked out of the American market.Those sanctions, however, would not stop Iran from flying a load of cash to Geneva to pay for its participation in COVAX. Gavi declined to offer any information about Iranian payments or orders, though Iran under its rules at a maximum could order vaccines for 50% of its 82 million people.Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman at Iran’s mission to the United Nations, criticized the US for its sanctions and banking restrictions, which he said “cruelly put many obstacles in the way of Iran receiving the Covid19 vaccine.“Nonetheless, along with our own indigenous vaccine trials, we fully expect the international community and the relevant international drug companies to fulfill their humanitarian obligation and expedite all our orders,” Miryousefi said.Local efforts to produce a vaccine have not begun in earnest, meaning the Islamic Republic may need to rely on those abroad.DOES IRAN HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A MASS INOCULATION?When it comes to childhood vaccinations, Iran has nearly 100% success in inoculations, according to World Health Organization data. People from surrounding countries often come to Iran for medical care as well. Iran’s hospitals, doctors and nurses are known as some of the best in the wider Middle East, with a network of clinics from villages to big cities. State-run facilities offer subsidized care, while private hospitals can be incredibly expensive.However, there are questions about the logistics of a mass vaccination drive. Iran’s aging fleet of aircraft likely would need to fly to pick up vaccines made abroad. Many airlines don’t fly into Iran due to sanctions. Keeping vaccines ultra cold, like in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech’s required minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit), also likely would be a challenge. Mostafa Ghanei, the director of the scientific commission at Iran’s National Headquarters for Combating the Coronavirus, reportedly has said that Iran doesn’t want the Pfizer vaccine for that reason.WOULD IRAN ACCEPT AN AMERICAN-MADE VACCINE?That remains in question. Early in the pandemic, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei floated an unfounded conspiracy theory claiming the virus could be man-made by America. In those March remarks, he suggested that “possibly your medicine is a way to spread the virus more.” Those remarks appeared aimed at dismissing any US assistance out of hand from the Trump administration, but Iranian officials also now increasingly criticize President-elect Joe Biden.Iran is looking at Chinese and Russian vaccine options. However, if it relied on COVAX for the vaccines, the cooperative could choose to issue it American-made vaccines. There’s a cost implication as well for Iran if it decides to choose which vaccine it wants from COVAX. It would need to put up $3.50 a dose in advance to have the ability to refuse the vaccine offered, as opposed to $1.60 per dose. If Iran chooses to offer a deposit to vaccinate half its population through COVAX, that means a $143.5 million as opposed to a $65.6 million initial payment.Rejecting a COVAX vaccine offer could see Iran receive doses later as well.WHY IS IRAN UNDER US SANCTIONS?Since the 1979 US Embassy takeover and the 444-day hostage crisis in Tehran, Iran has been subject to a series of changing economic sanctions. Some were lifted under Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which saw Tehran limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for that relief. In 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from that accord, re-invoking sanctions that had crushed Iran’s long-anemic economy.Trump said he pulled out of the deal over Iran’s ballistic missile program, its regional ambitions and other issues — all of which were not part of the 2015 deal. Biden has signaled he could return America to the deal if Iran agrees to again honor its limits. However, a series of escalating incidents over the last year and a half across the Mideast have raised tensions between Tehran and Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-iran-despite-sanctions-has-routes-to-covid-19-vaccines/story-u6VjjiS3XjhZFfCVvtNiUM.html
19-12-2020||World||Switzerland grants authorisation for Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine||Switzerland has authorized Pfizer Inc.’s and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine, the first approved for use in the country.“The data available to date showed a comparable high level of efficacy in all investigated age groups, thus meeting the safety requirements,” drug regulator Swissmedic said in a statement Saturday. “The level of protection afforded seven days after the second injection is over 90% in adults.”Switzerland had previously signed contracts with the companies for the delivery of three million vaccine doses. “Deliveries will start in 2020 and occur throughout 2021,” BioNTech said in a separate statement.The Swiss nod comes after the UK and US among others have already approved the vaccine, while European regulators will be meeting next week to decide. Unlike the US and UK, which conducted emergency authorizations, Swiss and EU regulators have been reviewing the vaccine for a conditional marketing authorization. That process requires a higher evidence level, according to the EU commission’s directorate-general for health.The Swiss government on Friday announced that it will close restaurants and leisure venues to curb the spread of new infections. It also said it’s considering further steps should the situation worsen.The nation of about 8.5 million reported 4,478 new infections on Friday, with the seven-day average up 3% compared to last week. It’s had more than 400,000 cases and about 6,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic.Vaccinations will start in the “coming days,” Swiss Interior Minister Alain Berset said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-grants-authorisation-for-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine/story-8rg4ajNnX4fxlqDtcBdiTI.html
19-12-2020||World||Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to get clearance by year-end: Report||The Oxford University vaccine against Covid-19 being produced by AstraZeneca is likely to get regulatory approval from the UK’s independent regulator by the end of this year for a rollout to begin in early 2021, according to a UK media report.The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which had been formally tasked by the UK government last month with the process of clearance after the jab emerged “safe and effective” against the novel coronavirus in human trials, is expected to authorise the vaccine by December 28 or 29 after the final data is provided on Monday, ‘The Daily Telegraph’ quoted senior government sources as indicating.“Authorisation by the MHRA will also give confidence to countries across the world. India has already manufactured more than 50 million of the AstraZeneca vaccines,” the newspaper notes.In India, the vaccine is being produced as part of a tie-up with the Serum Institute of India. Health officials in the UK hope that the authorisation of the Oxford jab will prove a “game-changer”, allowing vaccines to be transported and administered far more easily compared to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine which must be stored at very cold temperatures. The Oxford vaccine can be stored in normal refrigerators but like the Pfizer vaccine, it also requires two doses – with a three-week gap between the two doses for the Pfizer jabs and a four-week gap for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.The Oxford/AstraZeneca, AZD1222, vaccine has taken longer for regulators to assess because of differences in the efficacy rates found in different groups, ranging from 62% to 90%. However, a study released this week suggests that leaving an adequate gap between doses is the most crucial way to boost efficacy, the newspaper reports. Although the first batch of 4 million doses will be delivered from the Netherlands and Germany, the bulk of manufacturing is set to take place in the UK. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has said a further 15 million doses of active ingredients are ready and can be filled into vials in a matter of days, the newspaper report adds. The full order of 100 million doses, in addition to 40 million doses of the Pfizer jabs being imported from Belgium, is believed to be enough to vaccinate the whole of the UK.The state-funded National Health Service (NHS), which is leading the UK’s mass vaccination drive with the Pfizer vaccine, has drawn up plans for “large scale” vaccination sites, in football stadiums, racecourses and conference centres to start administering jabs from the first week of January. The programme will also be expanded to high-street pharmacies and further general practitioner (GP) practices.The news of a second vaccine for the UK comes as the US cleared its second vaccine for emergency use against the deadly virus – the Moderna vaccine – and will begin rolling out thousands of doses soon alongside the Pfizer vaccine.The UK, meanwhile, has been vaccinating the highest risk categories of the population with the first of two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for over two weeks now, even as millions more across the country entered the toughest Covid-19 lockdown measures from Saturday due to a spike in infection rates.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called an unscheduled meeting of senior ministers on Friday night to hold talks over a worrying new variant of the deadly virus, which has been spreading more rapidly across London and the south east of England.“We’re hoping very much that we will be able to avoid anything like that. But the reality is that the rates of infection have increased very much in the last few weeks,” Johnson said, on being asked about the prospect of another complete nationwide lockdown in the New Year.Earlier in the week, all four nations of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland – agreed to not reverse a change in the law allowing up to three households to get together over Christmas with relaxed rules between December 23 and 27, but people are being advised to keep their “Christmas bubbles” as small and short as possible.Latest analysis suggests the R number, which represents how many people each infected person passes the virus onto, has risen above the dreaded mark of one again.On Friday, the UK recorded a further 28,507 cases, along with 489 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, taking the country’s death toll to 66,541.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-to-get-clearance-by-year-end-report/story-MZHIJzLzhJWGuwBNl80rZI.html
19-12-2020||World||Sydney imposes lockdown on beach suburbs as Covid-19 cluster grows||A quarter million people in Sydney’s northern beach suburbs were ordered on Saturday into a strict lockdown until Christmas Eve to help contain a coronavirus cluster with authorities fearing it may spread across Australia’s most populous city. New South Wales (NSW) state government is to announce on Sunday whether further restrictions will be imposed on the rest of Sydney, home to around five million people. “I want to make that clear, to say to greater Sydney, please, please, do not go out tonight or the next few days unless you really have to,” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said at a news conference.The outbreak now totals 39 with two additional cases still under investigation. This up from five only two days ago, but authorities do not know the origin of the virus, which genome testing suggests is a U.S. strain.Australia has avoided the worst of the pandemic due to border closures, lockdowns, widespread testing and social distancing. It has recorded a total of around 28,100 infections.Until this week, the country had gone more than two weeks without any local transmission and had lifted most restrictions ahead of Christmas. The Sydney outbreak prompted states and territories to reimpose border restrictions, sending holiday travel plans for thousands into chaos.Western Australia state on Saturday said it would reimposed a hard border closure from midnight and other states such as Victoria may do the same if the Sydney cluster spreads rapidly.The island state of Tasmania imposed a 14-day quarantine for all Sydney arrivals placing the annual Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race starting Boxing Day is in jeopardy.The Sydney lockdown will mean people in the designated area will only be allowed to leave home for one of four essential reasons: grocery shopping, work, compassionate grounds including emergency medical treatment, or visiting an isolated relative.Local media on Saturday reported panic buying in some supermarkets in the area, leaving shelves empty. By nightfall beachside streets, usually thronging with people a week before Christmas, were eeriely deserted.Many restaurants, cafes and 14 hotels in the area voluntarily closed this weekend. Major public facilities in the area, such as swimming pools, beaches and playgrounds, have been closed and visitors banned from age care facilities.Authorities have pinpointed two clubs at Avalon beach as the original transmission sites for the cluster but have issued more than 30 potential secondary transmission sites, as far away as Bondi and Cronulla beaches in the east and south of the city.After more than 12,000 tests were conducted on Friday, people queued in Sydney for hours on Saturday to get tested and people rushed to stores to stock up on foodstuff. “That is the community responding in the way we want them to respond,” Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Paul Kelly said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-imposes-lockdown-on-beach-suburbs-as-covid-19-cluster-grows/story-ecu9zCTu2u7oh07bu71FdI.html

It is also peddling vaccines that lack essential data on safety and efficacy, due to a fundamental disregard for transparency and accountability regarding results from clinical trials. Both actions put Chinese citizens, and the world, at risk.”He further pointed out that the CCP has punished scientists, doctors and journalists who tried to alert the world to the dangers of the virus, which allowed a ‘controllable outbreak’ to become a global pandemic.The Secretary of State also called for other nations to demand transparency from Beijing regarding the origin of Covid-19, adding that if not done, China’s record of public health crises makes another future pandemic originating from the country ‘depressingly likely’.“Time and again, democracies that value transparency, the rule of law, property rights, and free-market capitalism have produced innovative solutions to public health crises. Freedom unleashes human potential, and competition spurs better outcomes, at lower costs. In contrast, authoritarian regimes control information and stifle innovation,” he said.China has been criticised widely across the world for its alleged role in the spread of the novel coronavirus that has infected over 75 million people across the world. More than 1.6 million people have lost their lives to the virus.While some accuse it of being complicit, others deem it culpable in the spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-accuses-ccp-of-blocking-who-investigation-spreading-misinformation/story-sbunvs5VTWy8YtJuZH8SZK.html

A simulator test was conducted for over a year by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a part of the recertification process to ensure that the aircraft could fly safely.According to the report, the staff of the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation started receiving information from whistleblowers after the second 737 Max crash, detailing numerous concerns related to aviation safety. The investigators said that the scope and breadth of the probe quickly expanded beyond the first allegations and dozens of whistleblowers revealed common themes.Also Read | Boeing 737 Max back in air 2 years after grounded by crashesHere are some of the most significant findings:1. The report suggests that the FAA continues to retaliate against whistleblowers instead of welcoming their disclosures in the interest of aviation safety.2. The investigators accused Boeing and the FAA of “attempting to cover up important information” that may have been contributed to those fatal crashes.3. The US agency repeatedly permitted Southwest Airlines to continue operating dozens of aircraft in an unknown airworthiness condition for several years, which put millions of passengers at potential risk.4. Boeing inappropriately influenced the FAA’s human factor simulator testing of pilot reaction times involving a Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) failure.5. The senior officials at the FAA may have obstructed a review of 737 Max crashes conducted by the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General.Last month, Boeing Co received the approval of the FAA, which was required to resume its 737 Max flights, however, the approval didn’t allow the Max aircraft to immediately return to the skies. The FAA had rescinded the order that grounded the aircraft and published an Airworthiness Directive, which specifies design changes that must be made before the aircraft returns to service. The US regulator also detailed training changes that the aviation company must incorporate to resume commercial flights after a 20-month grounding. On December 9, commercial flights with Boeing 737 Max jetliners resumed for the first time since they were grounded worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/attempting-to-cover-up-5-key-findings-by-us-senators-after-boeing-737-max-crashes/story-YZcSyim8zkWAfar6rkDVyH.html

19-12-2020||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan says Army ‘works under’ him: Report||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has asserted that the Army is a state institution which works under him, amidst Opposition’s allegations of the powerful military establishment’s interference in the country’s politics and elections. Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a 11-party opposition alliance, has been holding massive rallies since its inception in September to seek Khan’s ouster and press the military to stop interfering in politics. The PDM has been accusing the Pakistan Army of installing “puppet” Prime Minister Khan through a manipulated election in 2018.The Army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy. However, the military has denied meddling in the country’s politics. Khan also denies that the army helped him win the election in 2018.According to the ‘Lahore Declaration’ signed by the Opposition parties on Monday, the military establishment had stolen the people’s mandate in the 2018 election and imposed a “hybrid and inefficient” government on the masses.In an interview to SAMAA TV on Friday, 68-year-old Khan rebutted accusations that he does not have any real authority and said that the Pakistan Army is a state institution, which works under him.On Opposition’s claims that the government wouldn’t hold if not for the support from the powerful establishment, the cricketer-turned-politician said he is the country’s democratically elected prime minister and so the institutions back him.The PDM has set a January 31 deadline for Khan to step down or face a long march to Islamabad. The coalition pledged that it will make sure that there is no interference of the institutions of “the establishment and intelligence” in politics and at the same time it will make the security institutions stronger on the professional lines.Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz supremo and three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, 70, has been repeatedly blaming Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and spy agency ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed of meddling in Pakistan’s political affairs. Sharif was ousted from power in 2017 by the Supreme Court court on graft charges. The PML-N chief, currently out on bail, has been living in London since November last year after he was allowed by the courts and the government to go there for a period of eight weeks for medical treatment. But he did not come back, while his lawyers told the court that he was still recovering. Khan said the Opposition does not want to hold talks with the government and is instead pressuring the Army to send a democratic government packing. This can be called treason, he said.The real reason, Khan said, is that the Opposition wants all cases against them to be withdrawn and they be given an NRO-like concession. National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRP) was issued by former military dictator Pervez Musharraf to withdraw cases against Benazir Bhutto in 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-says-army-works-under-him-report/story-tXfetw116ovYqreg8sz4BM.html
19-12-2020||World||China to inoculate frontline workers first with Covid-19 vaccines||China will begin its Covid-19 inoculation programme by first vaccinating some key priority groups, including those involved in medical treatment and disease control, within the winter-spring period, before starting a mass roll out, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Saturday.The vaccination programme will also cover those who plan to work or study in counties and regions with medium or high risks of exposure to the virus, Cui Gang, an official with NHC’s disease control department, told reporters. This will help relieve the pressure on China in preventing and controlling imported Covid-19 cases, and lower the risks of domestic outbreaks of the epidemic, the official said. In a two-step vaccination drive, the vaccines will be first given to the priority groups, including those engaged in handling imported cold-chain products, and people working in sectors such as port inspection and quarantine, aviation, public transport, fresh market, medical treatment and disease control, said Cui.There is no word yet on the mass roll out of the vaccine programme and no announcement has been made about the government approval of various vaccines under trial.China has roped in more than a dozen countries, including Brazil, to conduct the final phase trials of its Covid-19 vaccines. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain have approved a vaccine developed by Chinese state-owned Sinopharm. Chinese officials say the coronavirus has been largely controlled in the country and herd immunity can be built with gradual roll out of the vaccination programme covering most of its population. The health officials said over a million people had been given vaccines under emergency use provision. The officials, who took part in Saturday’s press briefing, said no major side effects were reported during the trials. China has been focusing on developing five types of vaccines. In total, 11 vaccine candidates are at different stages of testing at home and abroad, Yang Sheng, Deputy Director of the National Medical Products Administration’s drug registration bureau told media earlier. China has joined COVAX, an international vaccine alliance. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said nine candidate vaccines, including two from China, are currently being evaluated for inclusion in the COVAX Facility. COVAX is co-led by Gavi, an international vaccine alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the WHO. Its aim is to accelerate the development and manufacture of vaccine. Zheng Zhongwei, head of China’s vaccine development task force, said China’s annual capacity to make Covid-19 vaccines was expected to reach 610 million doses this year and one billion doses by 2021, according to official media reports here. The novel coronavirus which originated from China’s Wuhan city last year has claimed 1.6 million lives and infected more than 75 million people globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-inoculate-frontline-workers-first-with-covid-19-vaccines/story-tjvFQVPVBylj5GVBizBCuJ.html

It appears, in this instance, FAA and Boeing were attempting to cover up important information that may have contributed to the 737 MAX tragedies.”The report citing a whistleblower who alleged Boeing officials encouraged test pilots to “remember, get right on that pickle switch” prior to the exercise that resulted in pilot reaction in approximately four seconds, while another pilot in a separate test reacted in approximately 16 seconds.The account was corroborated during an FAA staff interview, the committee added.Numerous reports have found Boeing failed to adequately consider how pilots respond to cockpit emergencies in its development of the 737 MAX.Boeing said Friday it takes “seriously the committee’s findings and will continue to review the report in full.”The FAA said Friday it was “carefully reviewing the document, which the committee acknowledges contains a number of unsubstantiated allegations.”The agency added it is “confident that the safety issues that played a role in the tragic (737 MAX) accidents involving Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 have been addressed through the design changes required and independently approved by the FAA and its partners.”Senate Commerce Committee chairman Roger Wicker said the report “details a number of significant examples of lapses in aviation safety oversight and failed leadership in the FAA.” The committee also said “multiple independent whistleblowers contacted the committee to allege FAA senior management was complicit in determining the 737 MAX training certification level prior to any evaluation.”Boeing resisted requiring simulator training for pilots before operating the 737 MAX but reversed course in January.The report also noted Southwest Airlines was able to operate more than 150,000 flights carrying 17.2 million passengers on jets without confirmation that required maintenance had been completed.The Senate report said the Southwest flights “put millions of passengers at potential risk.” Southwest said Friday it was aware of the report and added “we do not tolerate any relaxing of standards that govern ultimate safety across our operation.”Boeing still faces an ongoing criminal probe into the MAX. The committee said its review was “constrained due to the continued criminal investigation”Last month, the FAA approved the 737 MAX’s return to service and flights have resumed in Brazil. The first U.S. 737 MAX commercial flight with paying passengers is set for Dec. 29.Last month, the Senate committee unanimously a bill to reform how FAA certifies new airplanes and grant new protections for whistleblowers, among other reforms, while the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-inappropriately-coached-pilots-in-737-max-testing-us-senate-report/story-akpEzDJ67T43utUcGisRSJ.html
19-12-2020||World||Thailand reports jump in local coronavirus infections linked to shrimp market||Thailand has nine new local coronavirus infections, the biggest one-day rise in local transmissions in more than seven months, health officials said on Saturday.The nine cases are connected to a shrimp market in Samut Sakhon province, near Bangkok, where four infections were reported on Friday, officials told a briefing.The cases started with a 67-year-old woman, who sells shrimp in the market, who was confirmed to have the infection before three of her family also tested positive.There is no need for a lockdown yet but steps will be taken if cases keep rising, Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for Thailand’s Covid-19 taskforce, told the conference.“If the number of cases won’t come down tomorrow or the day after and become a cluster with unfound origins, we will choose measures from light to strong to handle it,” he said.Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said late on Friday the situation was not worrisome and more than 2,000 people in the area had been tested and more tests would be conducted.Local cases have largely been found in people observing quarantine after having been in close contact with an infected person. Most of Thailand’s recent cases have been imported.Thailand has kept infections at just 4,331 cases and 60 deaths, but its tourism-reliant economy has suffered from a travel ban imposed since April to curb the outbreak.The country on Thursday further eased restrictions to allow more foreign tourists to return.The government predicts about 8 million foreign tourists in 2021 after 6.7 million expected this year. Last year’s foreign visitors were a record of nearly 40 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-reports-jump-in-local-coronavirus-infections-linked-to-shrimp-market/story-MYBYSMvVGXitvPEntxdn0H.html

Ten people died on the scene, while four others later succumbed to their wounds, he said.A suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance gate of a stadium in the city of Galkayo on Friday, where Roble was expected to speak about the upcoming presidential election. The Islamist extremist group Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack, according to a broadcast on Radio Andalus, which supports the militant group.The Al-Qaeda-linked militants have waged an insurgency in Somalia since 2006 in a bid to impose their version of Islamic law. Al-Shabab continues to carry out suicide bombings and other attacks in the Horn of Africa country ahead of elections scheduled for early next year.US President Donald Trump earlier this month ordered most US forces to leave Somalia by early 2021. About 700 US troops are in Somalia on what is largely a counter-terrorism mission.The regional commander of an elite US-trained force that has helped build up Somalia’s weak security forces and his deputy also died in the attack, the New York Times reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-bomber-kills-14-in-attack-aimed-at-somali-pm/story-QIKxGUKML10WQlWS8Q1cBN.html

She said there are no casualties among civilians in the area.A NATO official confirmed the attack and said initial reports indicated that the airfield was not damaged.No one has immediately claimed responsibility. In April, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for five rocket attacks on the base. There were no casualties.The IS also has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in the capital Kabul in recent months, including on educational institutions that killed 50 people, most of them students.Violence in Afghanistan has spiked even as the Taliban and Afghan government negotiators hold talks in Qatar, trying to hammer out a peace deal that could put an end to decades of war. At the same time, The Taliban have waged bitter battles against IS fighters, particularly in eastern Afghanistan, while continuing their insurgency against government forces.Earlier this week, US Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, held an unannounced meeting with Taliban leaders in Doha to discuss military aspects of last February’s US-Taliban agreement.The agreement, signed in Qatar where the Taliban maintain a political office, was intended to set the stage for direct peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.After talks with the Taliban, Milley flew to Kabul to consult with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.

The government will take the advice of the Health Ministry regarding the percentage of people who need to be vaccinated,” Mohamed Azmin was quoted as saying by Bernama.Pfizer and their German partners BioNTech have supply deals with several countries including the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and Britain.They expect to produce globally up to 50 million doses of vaccines in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.More than 150 potential vaccines are being developed and tested globally to stop the Covid-19 pandemic, with 48 in human trials, the WHO says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-to-receive-first-batch-of-pfizer-vaccine-in-february/story-aiuJyat36JIUftXNLO8A0I.html
19-12-2020||World||World looks to spring for virus relief as vaccinations start||The developed world could start to emerge from the deadly grip of the pandemic by late spring if the first wave of Covid-19 vaccines are deployed effectively, scientists say. Even so, infection rates are likely to remain high for some time.More than 1.1 million people have been vaccinated in the US, UK, China and Russia, according to Bloomberg data, with the European Union expected to approve its first shot this coming week. As many as three vaccines could be available in the West by year-end, leaving governments and scientists hopeful the pandemic could start to turn a corner in the first half of 2021.“The one big victory we had about this outbreak was the extraordinary performance of getting vaccines available in less than a year,” Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview.While China has also deployed vaccines, it and other Asian nations have effectively parried the pandemic with measures such as mass testing, masks and social distancing.With older people and health-care workers among the priority groups in the vaccine drive, a decrease in the number of deaths and hospitalizations will likely be the first sign the inoculations are having an impact. But with little known about how well the shots might prevent transmission, it could take much longer to bring down infection rates.“The numbers of deaths should start to decrease slowly as the number vaccinated increases,” said Graham Medley, a professor of infectious disease modeling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the UK government’s Covid-19 advisory panel. But “if the vaccines do not stop transmission, then we will not see the numbers of infections change much.”With more than 310,000 deaths from Covid-19, the US has the most fatalities. Infections in the US have topped 17 million, with more than a million new cases occurring in the past week alone. More than 3,600 Americans died Wednesday, according to John Hopkins University.Across Europe, nearly 376,000 people have died from Covid-19, according to the latest weekly figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, with Italy and the UK suffering the most fatalities. The delay from the EU in approving the first vaccine has led to frustration from some corners, particularly in Germany, where the leading Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE shot was pioneered.European countries have moved in and out of lockdown as governments sought to contain rising infection rates and protect health systems in the face of additional winter pressures. Germany re-introduced lockdown measures this week, with all non-essential shops closed, after the country recorded its highest number of new cases since the pandemic began. In the UK, more than half the country is under the strictest curbs, with full shutdowns planned in Wales and Northern Ireland after Christmas.The UK and US both cleared the Pfizer vaccine this month, with the US also approving a second shot from Moderna Inc. on Friday. A third vaccine from AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford may be approved in the UK before the end of the year, or in early 2021. Together, the shots comprise a significant portion of global supplies and would go some way to getting the pandemic under control once deployed at scale.Even so, countries may need to keep social distancing restrictions in place through March or April to prevent hospitals from getting overwhelmed, said James Naismith, a professor of structural biology at Oxford University. Warmer weather, which would let people spend more time outside, should help Europe turn a corner by late spring, he said.“It’s a seesaw, and we’ll be on that seesaw until the vaccine changes the rules of the game,” said Naismith. “Hopefully by the time we get to spring, we can have a permanently lower level of restrictions. We may not get rid of them all at once, but the restrictions should be less.”The pace of change will partly depend on whether more vaccines get approved and the level of vaccine hesitancy among populations. Germany is planning to administer 11 million to 13 million doses in the first quarter -- assuming the front-runner shots get cleared -- but it could accelerate that schedule if regulators sign off on vaccines from developers such as AstraZeneca and CureVac NV, Health Minister Jens Spahn said at a press conference Friday.Still, it will take months before everyone who wants a shot will be able to get one, Spahn said, adding that measures like social distancing, hand-washing and mask-wearing will be necessary for the foreseeable future.How quickly the world emerges from the pandemic will also depend on how soon developing nations get vaccines, said David King, the UK’s former chief scientific adviser.“Where will we be by Easter? I think we’ll still be on the road,” said King. “We have the problem in a globalized economy that we actually depend on the health of people in other countries,” and developing nations will inevitably have last dibs on a vaccine.Things could get worse before they get better. As governments relax rules over Christmas, there’s the potential for infection rates to surge like they did in the US after Thanksgiving, leading to more deaths, according to Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. It’s really important people remember they could get a vaccine soon, he said.“I understand pandemic fatigue. I have that,” said Osterholm, who is advising President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team on the virus. But people must keep following the rules for the “few short months” until vaccines are more widely available, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-looks-to-spring-for-virus-relief-as-vaccinations-start/story-0BXNoUMkMIQhWoirAc7PjJ.html

US-Russia ties have been strained by issues ranging from conflicts in Syria to Ukraine, as well as allegations of Russian interference in US politics, which Moscow denies.Hackers believed to be working for Russia are accused of wide-ranging hacks of US government agencies and a private companies. Pompeo said on Friday it was “pretty clearly” evident that Russia was involved in the attacks that have sent computer network security teams worldwide scrambling to limit the damage.The Kremlin denies Russian involvement.At his annual news conference on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he hoped U.S. President-elect Joe Biden would help resolve some of the difficult issues in relations between Moscow and Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-halt-work-at-two-consulates-in-russia-after-covid-19-drawdown/story-GWpdJ20l2UgG8j8D2fLl4I.html
19-12-2020||World||Google blames Gmail, YouTube outage on error in User ID system||Google diagnosed a widespread outage that knocked out major services earlier this week, such as Gmail and YouTube, as a mistake with its system for identifying people online.Alphabet Inc.’s Google has several tools that enable it to verify and track logged-in users. In October, the company began moving those tools to a new file storage system, and in the process misreported portions of the data, according to a Friday post. That caused several of its services to go down for 47 minutes Monday morning, a rare technical misstep.Google’s explanation comes amid heightened cybersecurity vigilance. A hack on software provider SolarWinds Corp. has exposed companies including Microsoft Corp. and multiple US government agencies. A Google spokeswoman said on Friday that the internet giant has found no evidence the SolarWinds hack affected Alphabet or Google’s systems.About 15% of requests sent to Google’s cloud storage service were disrupted during the Monday outage, the company said. The cloud division offers an identification service similar to one from Okta Inc.On Tuesday, Google’s Gmail service had another disruption. The company attributed this to an issue with data migration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-blames-gmail-youtube-outage-on-error-in-user-id-system/story-akl2fyw87AXuMlGwIp5dxI.html
19-12-2020||World||‘So proud’: Dolly Parton’s association with Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine||US’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday approved its second vaccine candidate from Moderna against the coronavirus disease for emergency use. The vaccine, which has an efficiency rate of 94.1% and is bringing hope and good tidings to a world ravaged by the pandemic, has had a generous benefactor in Dolly Parton, known for her hit country numbers.Parton had announced in April that she has donated $1 million to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, after her good friend Dr Naji Abumrad, a professor of surgery at the university, told her about the work researchers were doing to come up with an effective Covid-19 vaccine. A part of her donation eventually went into funding the initial research for Moderna’s vaccine. “I just felt so proud to have been part of that little seed money that will hopefully grow into something great and help to heal this world,” she said on BBC One’s The One Show in November.Mark Denison, a professor of pathology, microbiology and immunology at Vanderbilt, told the New York Times that the contribution from the Dolly Parton Covid-19 Research Fund had helped finance the early stages of the vaccine trial before the US federal government’s investment of $1 million came through. Parton’s contribution is also funding a convalescent plasma study at Vanderbilt University. “Her money helped us develop the test that we used to first show that the Moderna vaccine was giving people a good immune response that might protect them,” Denison was quoted by NYT in November. The Jolene hitmaker is no stranger to the world of philanthropy as she has previously funded charities working with AIDS, and her Imagination library runs a book gifting program for children in five countries. Parton’s latest contributions have propelled her to new heights amongst her online fandom, many of whom have taken to social media to praise the country star. The Moderna vaccine is very similar to the one developed by Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech, both use messenger RNA technology. However, the Moderna vaccine is easier to store since it does not need to be kept at freezing temperatures. The coronavirus pandemic has paralysed the United States, which has been logging 216,000 new cases to its tally every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/so-proud-dolly-parton-s-association-with-moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-ZXYkfOJHSEZtqFlEuLxNgK.html

19-12-2020||World||Joe Biden’s transition team expresses concern over tensions with Defense Department||US President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team on Friday expressed concern regarding an ‘abrupt halt’ in cooperation with the Defense Department, according to The Hill.US media reported that acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller ordered a halt in cooperation with Biden’s transition amid frustration within President Donald Trump’s administration with the President-elect’s team.“We were concerned to learn this week about an abrupt halt in the already limited cooperation there, and as indicated by Department of Defense (DoD) earlier today, we expect that decision will be reversed,” Biden transition executive director Yohannes Abraham said in a briefing.Abraham also refuted claims of mutual agreement on any holiday break, saying there was no time to spare in continuing briefings and other engagements during this period.During his briefing, Abraham mentioned that the team has met isolated resistance in some corners including the DoD, and said that the cancelled meetings had ‘immediately and appropriately escalated’ the issue.The Pentagon acknowledged that about 20 meetings with 40 officials were being rescheduled until after January 1, but insisted that cooperation with Biden’s team was continuing, saying that the change was part of a mutually agreed pause for the holiday season, The Hill reported.“After the mutually agreed upon holiday pause, which begins tomorrow, we will continue with the transition and rescheduled meetings from today...Again, I remain committed to a full and transparent transition -- this is what our nation expects and the DoD will deliver AS IT ALWAYS HAS,” said Miller in a statement on Friday.The acting Defense Secretary also insisted that the Department has not cancelled or declined any interview with the Biden transition and that 139 meetings with 265 officials have already been conducted, according to The Hill.Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported the Trump administration was blocking meetings between transition officials and intelligence agencies that fall under the Pentagon’s control, including the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency.This comes after the US Electoral College certified Biden’s win in the presidential elections, amid repeated allegations of voter fraud made by Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-transition-team-expresses-concern-over-tensions-with-defense-department/story-SdsxISodEht66QTmVOUmsO.html
19-12-2020||World||South Africa identifies new coronavirus strain causing surge in cases||South Africa has identified a new variant of the coronavirus that is driving a second wave of infections, the health minister said on Friday, days after Britain said it had also found a new variant of the virus boosting cases. “We have convened this public briefing today to announce that a variant of the SARS-COV-2 Virus - currently termed 501.V2 Variant - has been identified by our genomics scientists here in South Africa,” Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize tweeted. “The evidence that has been collated, therefore, strongly suggests that the current second wave we are experiencing is being driven by this new variant,” Mkhize added.South Africa has recorded the highest number of coronavirus infections in Africa, approaching the 900,000 mark, with over 20,000 related deaths. A resurgence in cases saw the government tighten restrictions on society this week. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday it was in touch with the South African researchers who identified the new variant. The global body added there was no indication there were changes in the way the new strain of the virus was behaving.“We are working with them with our SARS-COV-2 Virus evolution working group. They are growing the virus in the country and they’re working with researchers to determine any changes in the behaviour of the virus itself in terms of transmission,” WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove told a news conference in Geneva.South African health authorities said the new variant seemed to spread faster than the previous iteration, but that it was too early to tell its severity and whether current vaccines would work against it.“In the UK they have also identified a new variant ... there are quite a few similarities between the two lineages ... there are also a similar number of mutations” said Prof Tulio de Oliviera, a member of government’s genomics consortium in a televised briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-identifies-new-coronavirus-strain-causing-surge-in-cases/story-wWLSSuaKmlr3jCjO4eX7zM.html
19-12-2020||World||Hackers’ broad attack sets cyber experts worldwide scrambling to defend networks||Suspected Russian hackers who broke into US government agencies also spied on less high-profile organizations, including groups in Britain, a US internet provider and a county government in Arizona, according to web records and a security source.More details were revealed on Friday of the cyber espionage campaign that has computer network security teams worldwide scrambling to limit the damage as a senior official in the outgoing administration of US President Donald Trump explicitly acknowledged Russia’s role in the hack for the first time.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on the Mark Levin radio show “I think it’s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.” Networking gear maker Cisco Systems Inc said a limited number of machines in some of its labs had been found with malicious software on them, without saying if anything had been taken. A person familiar with the company’s ongoing probe said fewer than 50 were compromised. In Britain, a small number of organizations were compromised and not in the public sector, a security source said.Shares in cyber security companies FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks and Crowdstrike Holdings rose on Friday as investors bet that the spate of disclosures from Microsoft Corp and others would boost demand for security technology.Reuters identified Cox Communications Inc and Pima County, Arizona government as victims of the intrusion by running a publicly available coding script from researchers at Moscow-based private cybersecurity firm Kaspersky. The hack hijacked ubiquitous network management software made by SolarWinds Corp. Kaspersky decrypted online web records left behind by the attackers.The breaches of US government agencies, first revealed by Reuters on Sunday, hit the Department of Homeland Security, the Treasury Department, State Department and Department of Energy. In some cases the breaches involved monitoring emails but it was unclear what hackers did while infiltrating networks, cybersecurity experts said.Trump has not said anything publicly about the intrusion. He was being briefed “as needed,” White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern told reporters. National security adviser Robert O’Brien was leading interagency meetings daily, if not more often, he said.“They’re working very hard on mitigation and making sure that our country is secure. We will not get into too many details because we’re just not going to tell our adversaries what we do to combat these things,” Morgenstern said.No determinations have been made on how to respond or who was responsible, a senior US official said.SolarWinds, which disclosed its unwitting role at the center of the global hack on Monday, has said that up to 18,000 users of its Orion software downloaded a compromised update containing malicious code planted by the attackers. The attack was believed to be the work of an “outside nation state,” SolarWinds said in a regulatory disclosure.People familiar with the matter have said the hackers were believed to be working for the Russian government. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the allegations.On Friday, US Representative Stephen Lynch, head of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform panel’s national security subcommittee, said the information provided by the Trump administration was “very disappointing.”“This hack was so big in scope that even our cybersecurity experts don’t have a real sense yet in terms of the breadth of the intrusion itself,” adding that it would take some time to fully vet all the agencies and targets.The breach appeared to provide President-elect Joe Biden with an immediate headache when he takes office on Jan 20. His transition team’s executive director Yohannes Abraham told reporters on Friday there would be “substantial costs” and the incoming administration “will reserve the right to respond at a time and in a manner of our choosing, often in close coordination with our allies and partners.”Microsoft, one of the thousands of companies to receive the malicious update, said it had notified more than 40 customers whose networks were further infiltrated by the hackers.Around 30 of those customers were in the United States, Microsoft said, with the remaining victims found in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, Britain, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Most worked with information technology companies, some think tanks and government organizations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hackers-broad-attack-sets-cyber-experts-worldwide-scrambling-to-defend-networks/story-y73X2g0UYFAhiATLd53MSO.html
19-12-2020||World||US clears Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use||The fight against Covid-19 received a major shot in the arm on Friday as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) to a second vaccine against the deadly coronavirus disease. Jointly developed by Moderna, a Massachusetts-based pharma company, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Covid-19 vaccine has been authorised for use on people aged 18 years and older, and has joined Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine, already being administered since Monday, on the frontlines of the battle against the virus.Moderna’s vaccine is similar to the one created jointly by Pfizer and BioNTech in many ways. They were both developed using the same cutting-edge mRNA technology and need to be administered in two doses, primary and booster. But they are also different: the Moderna vaccine is more convenient to store and transport; common refrigerators would serve the purpose instead of the super-coolers needed for the Pfizer-BioNTech vials. Also, the interval between the two doses is longer by a week.“There is much we still do not know about Sars-CoV-2 and Covid-19,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the most respected voice in the US on the pandemic and the head of the NIAID. “However, we do know that this vaccine is safe and can prevent symptomatic Covid-19 and severe disease.”Moderna expects to supply between 100 million and 125 million doses globally in the first quarter of 2021, with 85-100 million of those doses available in the US.The US food and drug regulator granted EUA to Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine a day after an advisory board of outside experts had cleared it overwhelmingly. Its distribution, however, will depend on one more clearance, from the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is expected to follow shortly.The United States is witnessing a continuing spike in Covid-19 cases. More than 233,000 new infections were reported in the last 24 hours and 3,270 fatalities. Dr. Fauci and other experts have warned of a grim winter with far more cases likely. More than 17 million Covid-19 cases have been reported in the US so far with at least 313,246 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-clears-moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use/story-scVlG4mqZdsfERf5No8pHP.html
19-12-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine update: US approves Moderna candidate, Odisha prepares for inoculation drive||Countries around the globe are gearing up to vaccinate citizens against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The US on Friday approved its second vaccine candidate, Moderna, for emergency use. The European Medicines Agency too is on the final leg of its approval process and is expected to come out with a decision on the Moderna vaccine on January 6, according to Reuters. The global vaccine alliance COVAX saw its member country sign deals for vaccine procurement for emergency use. With the global caseload nearing 75 million the world is racing against time to immunize its population against a virus that has been wreaking havoc for more than a year now. Here are the latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccine front:1. US regulator Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given approval to the Moderna vaccine for emergency use. This is the second approval for an inoculation drive in the United States and the first for Moderna. Data released by Moderna on November 30 of the late-stage trial shows that the vaccine has an efficiency rate of 94.1%, according to Reuters. Both Canada and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are currently slated to come out with their approvals soon. 2. AstraZeneca has started the process of seeking emergency use authorization in Britain and India. According to the data published by the pharmaceutical giant of the late-stage trial, their vaccine has an efficacy rate of 70% and as much as 90% for a subgroup of trial participants who were given a half dose first, followed by a full dose, reported Reuters. India is currently conducting an accelerated review and has asked for more data.3. Colombia, which is a part of the COVAX alliance, has signed deals with pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and AstraZeneca to provide 20 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, Reuters reported on Friday. The first group to be vaccinated will consist of healthcare workers, people over the age of 60, and those with pre-existing conditions, the country’s health minister said to Reuters. Colombia plans on providing free coronavirus vaccination for free under its national vaccination plan.4. The Odisha government has completed its database collection for the first phase of Covid-19 inoculation, reported news agency ANI on Saturday. The government has identified 3.2 lakh healthcare workers who are eligible for emergency vaccination. They have also demarcated 8,267 vaccinators and 29,276 centres to help carry out the vaccination process. For storage purposes, the state has assessed a total of 1,222 cold chain points across the state and readied 1,796 Ice Lined Refrigerators (ILRs) for transportation and 1,771 deep freezers for safe transportation of the vaccine all across the state, ANI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-us-approves-moderna-candidate-orissa-prepares-for-inoculation-drive/story-bGr0C9NdtVIZCfpAokGMMJ.html

In working with our public officials and out of an abundance of caution, a couple of employees have quarantined resulting in a temporary workforce reduction at the monument and its temporary closure,” he said.Bernhardt tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, a representative for the department said at the time, making him the latest in a series of Trump administration officials - including Trump himself - to have been infected by the virus.Bernhardt was asymptomatic and would continue to work while in quarantine, Interior said at the time.The Washington Monument, where visitors normally crowd into a small elevator to ascend to the top, is a DC tourist attraction. It had been closed for months after the onset of the pandemic, but reopened in October with new limits on the number of people allowed in the elevator at one time.The Washington Post, which first reported this story, said Bernhardt often led private tours of the monument after hours, including once earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iconic-washington-monument-shut-after-covid-infected-interior-secretary-s-visit/story-aJMfCPbTDmnLMf92NdzfWM.html
19-12-2020||World||Poorer nations to get virus vaccine early next year: WHO||Poorer countries will begin to receive coronavirus vaccination doses early next year from a facility created to ensure fair access, the World Health Organization and its partners said Friday.Almost two billion doses of candidate vaccines have been secured for the Covax facility, run by the WHO along with the Gavi vaccine alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).Countries including the United States and Britain have already begun to roll out a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, with another developed by Moderna expected to gain widespread approval soon.Neither drug is included in the two billion doses, but the WHO said it was in discussions with both companies.“The arrangements announced today will enable all participating economies to have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021,” the WHO, Gavi and CEPI said in a statement.Shipments of enough vaccines to protect health and social care workers would be delivered “in the first half of 2021 to all participating economies who have requested doses in this timeframe,” the statement said.It said deliveries were contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries’ readiness for delivery.20 percent target for 2021 WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference that “light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter”.“But we will only truly end the pandemic if we end it everywhere at the same time, which means it’s essential to vaccinate some people in all countries, rather than all people in some countries,” he said.The statement said that by the end of the year, 20 percent of the populations in participating countries should be covered.The WHO revealed Friday that it had signed an agreement with US pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson for 500 million doses of a candidate drug, adding to agreements already signed with AstraZeneca, Novavax and Sanofi-GSK.The UN health agency has previously said it was willing to include vaccines developed in China and Russia should those drugs prove safe and effective.CEPI chief Richard Hatchett said massive research and development efforts were paying off.“We now have safe and effective vaccines that can protect against Covid-19 and a clear pathway to securing two billion doses for the populations at greatest risk all around the world,” he said.Gavi chief Seth Berkley meanwhile hailed the “unprecedented speed and scale” of the project.“Securing access to doses of a new vaccine for both higher-income and lower-income countries, at roughly the same time and during a pandemic, is a feat the world has never achieved before,” he said.Covax is a collaboration between organisations, companies and 190 countries -- but neither the United States nor Russia have joined so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poorer-nations-to-get-virus-vaccine-early-next-year-who/story-xpF9BqjC3dnFRvWa4xotfO.html
19-12-2020||World||President Trump signs bill that could remove Chinese stocks from US||President Donald Trump on Friday signed legislation that could kick Chinese companies off of US exchanges unless American regulators can review their financial audits, a move likely to further escalate tensions between the two countries.The measure, which could affect corporate giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc., serves as another parting shot at Beijing before Trump leaves office in January.The president has long railed against China for what he calls unfair trading practices, and slapped tariffs on billions of dollars in imports. But his rhetoric sharpened this year as he blamed Beijing for the global coronavirus pandemic -- a central issue in his electoral loss to Joe Biden as Trump was widely criticized for his handling of the outbreak.The de-listing law won bipartisan support in the House early this month after easily clearing the US Senate in May. While it applies to any foreign company, the bill’s sponsors have said their goal was to target China.Chinese firms for years have used American capital markets and dollar-based finance as a key funding component to grow their businesses. While the measure includes a phase-in period, with penalties kicking in after three straight years of noncompliance, it could impose real damage on Chinese companies that fail to meet the audit standards.“US policy is letting China flout rules that American companies play by, and it’s dangerous,” Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, a lead sponsor of the new law, said in a statement.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing after passage of the House bill that China was “against politicizing securities regulation” and urged cooperation to protect investors’ rights.“It will undermine global investors’ confidence in the US capital markets and will undermine the US capital markets’ global standing and hurt US interests,” Hua said.Trump’s signing of the law capped a flurry of recent steps against China, including guidelines that would limit travel visas for 92 million Communist Party members. Any of them with a 10-year visa would now see it reduced to one month.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said that customs officers at American ports would impound “shipments containing cotton and cotton products originating from” the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps., a military-affiliated entity that’s one of China’s largest producers. This follows earlier US action against the company that bars it from making any transaction with American companies and citizens.Watershed MomentThe new law marks a watershed moment in a long-running dispute over China’s refusal to let the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board examine audits of firms whose shares trade in the US The requirement for the inspections by the agency, which was created in the wake of the Enron Corp. accounting scandal, is meant to prevent fraud and wrongdoing that could wipe out shareholders.In addition to requiring companies to allow US inspectors to review their financial audits, the measure -- introduced by Kennedy and Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat -- requires firms to disclose whether they are under government control.Van Hollen said in a statement that the delisting bill would protect people who “have been cheated out of their money after investing in seemingly legitimate Chinese companies that are not held to the same standards” as other public companies. “This bill rights that wrong, ensuring that all companies on the US exchanges abide by the same rules,” he said.Implementing the law falls heavily on the US Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump appointee, had been racing to propose rules before he stepped down by year’s end that would trigger the delisting of companies that don’t comply with US auditing rules. Clayton announced Friday that he was abandoning that effort to ensure that the agency’s plan conforms with the just-signed legislation.“While I am disappointed that I will not have an opportunity to consider the staff’s recommendation, I am pleased with the bipartisan, multi-agency approach to addressing these critical investor protection issues,” Clayton said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-signs-bill-that-could-remove-chinese-stocks-from-us/story-IiBFwBeTG4TjzXFTAj812I.html
19-12-2020||World||US clears Moderna vaccine for Covid-19, 2nd shot in arsenal||The US added a second Covid-19 vaccine to its arsenal Friday, boosting efforts to beat back an outbreak so dire that the nation is regularly recording more than 3,000 deaths a day.Much-needed doses are set to arrive Monday after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of the vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. and the National Institutes of Health.The move marks the world’s first authorization for Moderna’s shots. The vaccine is very similar to one from Pfizer Inc. and Germany’s BioNTech that’s now being dispensed to millions of health care workers and nursing home residents as the biggest vaccination drive in US history starts to ramp up.Also Read: Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine ‘overwhelmingly approved’, distribution to start soon, says US President TrumpThe two work “better than we almost dared to hope,” NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins told The Associated Press. “Science is working here, science has done something amazing.”Early results of large, still unfinished studies show both vaccines appear safe and strongly protective although Moderna’s is easier to handle since it doesn’t need to be stored at ultra-frozen temperatures.A second vaccine represents a ray of hope amid despair as the virus continues to spread unabated even before holiday gatherings that are certain to further fuel the outbreak.The scourge has claimed more than 312,000 US lives and killed 1.7 million people worldwide. New cases in the US are running at over 216,000 per day on average. Deaths per day have hit all-time highs, eclipsing 3,600 on Wednesday.California has emerged as one of the most lethal hot spots, with hospitals running out of intensive care beds and ambulances lining up outside emergency rooms in scenes reminiscent of the calamity around New York City last spring. California on Friday reported over 41,000 new cases and 300 more deaths.When New York’s hospitals were in crisis, health care workers from across the country came to help out. This time, “there’s no cavalry coming” because so many hospitals are swamped, said Dr. Marc Futernick, an emergency room physician in Los Angeles.The nation is scrambling to expand vaccinations as rapidly as Moderna and Pfizer can churn out doses. Moderna’s is for people 18 and older, Pfizer’s starts at age 16.It’s just the beginning of “what we hope will be a big push to get this terrible virus behind us, although it will take many more months to get to all Americans,” Collins said.Even with additional candidates in the pipeline, there won’t be enough for the general population until spring, and shots will be rationed in the meantime. And while health workers are enthusiastically embracing vaccination, authorities worry the public may need more reassurance to ensure more people get in line when it’s their turn.Also Read: Covid vaccine can turn people into ‘crocodiles’: Brazilian President Bolsonaro“Frankly if we don’t succeed in getting 80% or so of Americans immunized against Covid-19 by the middle of this 2021 year, we have the risk that this epidemic could go on and on and on,” Collins said.He is especially concerned that accurate information about the shots’ value reaches communities of color, which have been hard-hit by Covid-19 yet also are wary after years of health care disparities and research abuses.To try to help instill confidence, Vice President Mike Pence received the Pfizer-BioNTech shot on live TV Friday, along with Surgeon General Jerome Adams.FDA’s decision could help pave the way for other countries that are considering the Moderna vaccine, the first-ever regulatory clearance for the small Cambridge, Massachusetts, company. European regulators could authorize its use as soon as Jan. 6. Britain, Canada and a few other countries already have cleared the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, with a European Union decision due Monday.“What we want to always remember is one size does not fit all. We want to have options,” said Dr. Paul Duprex of the University of Pittsburgh.Moderna has about 5.9 million doses ready for shipment set to begin over the weekend, according to Operation Warp Speed, the government’s vaccine development program. Injections of health workers and nursing home residents continue next week, before other essential workers and vulnerable groups are allowed to get in line.Both Moderna’s and Pfizer-BioNTech’s shots are so-called mRNA vaccines, made with a groundbreaking new technology. They don’t contain any coronavirus – meaning they cannot cause infection. Instead, they use a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spike protein on the surface of the virus, ready to attack if the real thing comes along.Their development less than a year after the coronavirus first emerged set a speed record, but Collins stressed that shouldn’t worry people. The speed was due to billions in company and government investments paired with years of earlier scientific research, not any cut corners.“The rigor of the analysis of these vaccines is unprecedented,” Collins said. “We’re not done with this but hope is on the way, and the hope comes from this scientific brain trust that has pulled out all the stops.”Experts are hoping the two vaccines together will “break the back of the pandemic” when combined with masks and other precautions, said Dr. Arnold Monto of the University of Michigan, who chaired an advisory committee that publicly debated the shots’ evidence ahead of FDA’s decisions.The FDA’s main messages:--Both the new Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot require two doses several weeks apart. The second dose must be from the same company as the first.--In a study of 30,000 volunteers, the Moderna vaccine was more than 94% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in people 18 and older. It also strongly protected older adults, who are most vulnerable.--The inoculated can’t throw away their masks as it’s not yet clear either vaccine prevents silent, symptomless virus spread. But there was a hint that Moderna’s shot might provide some protection against asymptomatic infection.--The Moderna study uncovered no major safety problems. Like with the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, expect sore arms, fever, fatigue and muscle aches, which are signs the immune system is revving up.--Moderna’s study turned up no severe allergic reactions, like the handful reported with the Pfizer-BioNTech shots in Britain and Alaska. The vaccines’ ingredients aren’t identical. Still, after any Covid-19 vaccination, people should stick around for 15 minutes – or 30 minutes if they have a history of severe allergies – so if they do have a reaction, it can be treated immediately.--Both vaccines remain experimental, and the government is closely monitoring safety in case rare problems crop up.--Additional studies are needed to tell if the vaccine should be used by children and pregnant women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-clears-moderna-vaccine-for-covid-19-2nd-shot-in-arsenal/story-bgGVPZHyH8dfIpsubfpegJ.html
19-12-2020||World||Emmanuel Macron blames his Covid-19 on negligence, bad luck||French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday blamed his Covid-19 on a combination of negligence and bad luck, urging his compatriots to stay safe as critics called out slip-ups in his behavior to prevent infection, from a close-quarters handshake to repeated big-group meals over the past week.In what looked like a self-shot video from the presidential retreat in Versailles where he was isolating, Macron said he was experiencing symptoms that included headaches, fatigue and a dry cough. He promised to give daily updates and be “totally transparent” about the evolution of his illness.“I am doing well,” the 42-year-old French leader said, speaking softly with a bottle of gel on the desk behind him and dressed casually in a turtleneck top. “Normally, there is no reason for it to evolve in a bad way.”Also Read: French President Emmanuel Macron has tested positive for Covid-19Macron said his infection “shows that the virus really can touch everyone, because I am very protected and am very careful.”“Despite everything I caught this virus — perhaps, doubtless, a moment of negligence, a moment of bad luck, too,” he said.A fellow European leader who spent time with Macron at an EU summit last week, Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic, tested positive for the virus Friday. Ten other leaders at the EU summit have since tested negative; others either aren’t getting tested or haven’t released results.U.S. President Donald Trump, who tested positive for the coronavirus and spent three days at Walter Reed Medical Center in early October, spoke with Macron on Thursday and wished him a speedy recovery, the White House said Friday. Several White House aides and members of Trump’s campaign staff tested positive after he did.In France, Macron’s diagnosis brought criticism that he had set a bad example as the country sees a new uptick in cases and doctors warn families to take precautions this holiday season — especially at the dinner table.Macron usually wears a mask and adheres to social distancing rules, and has insisted that his virus strategy is driven by science. But he has been captured on camera in recent days violating France’s virus-control guidelines.He shook hands and half-embraced the head of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Angel Gurria, at a meeting Monday. Both were masked, but Macron’s office acknowledged Friday the move was a “mistake.”In his video message Friday, the president suggested that his behavior had helped limit the spread of the virus.“Had I not respected the rules, the barrier measures, I would have caught it much faster and, most of all, I would have transmitted it in the preceding hours to many more people,” Macron said.Also Read: Macron met several world leaders before testing Covid-19 positive. Here’s the listHe urged people to “hold firm” and look after each other during the festive season, warning: “The virus is picking up, even stronger.”Last week, Macron spent two days in intense negotiations at the EU summit in Brussels with the leaders of the other 26 member countries. Video excerpts released by the EU showed the leaders spread out in a circle in a huge meeting room — Macron, and most of the other leaders, were not masked.Macron also hosted or took part in multiple large-group meals in the days before testing positive Thursday, including with members of his centrist party and rival politicians, while French people are currently advised to avoid gatherings larger than six people. His office has been contacting those present for the meals, but told some people sitting far from the president that they were not considered at risk.Macron office isn’t providing details of his treatment. He is staying at the presidential residence of La Lanterne in the former royal city of Versailles, tucked in a grove tightly guarded by police.Macron’s positive test comes as French health authorities are again seeing a rise in infections and are warning of more as French families prepare to get together for Christmas and New Year festivities. France reported another 18,254 new infections Thursday and its death toll is just under 60,000.France’s Pasteur Institute released a study Friday suggesting that meal times at home and in public are a major source of contamination. Pasteur epidemiologist Arnaud Fontanet said on France-Inter radio Friday that during the holidays, “we can see each other, simply not be too numerous, and at critical moments at meals, not too many people at the same table.”Macron took a test “as soon as the first symptoms appeared” on Thursday morning and will self-isolate for seven days, in line with national health authorities’ recommendations, the presidency said. Macron plans to continue working, and went ahead with a planned speech by videoconference Thursday.The French health minister suggested that Macron might have been infected at the EU summit in Brussels last week, but Macron had multiple meetings in Paris as well.France had Europe’s first virus case in January, but Macron’s government came under criticism for not having enough masks or tests and not confining the population quickly enough. A strict two-month lockdown brought infections down, and France sent children back to school and their parents back to work.But infections surged again this fall so he declared a new, softer lockdown in October aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals. The measures were relaxed slightly this week, though restaurants, tourist sites, gyms and some other facilities remain closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emmanuel-macron-blames-his-covid-19-on-negligence-bad-luck/story-Z9b0XmkvfXCZDquSJOYBAO.html
19-12-2020||World||China offers to work with Biden, warns of new ‘McCarthyism’||China’s top diplomat on Friday offered cooperation on key priorities of President-elect Joe Biden, warning that Beijing’s many US critics were creating an atmosphere of “McCarthyism” and ignoring common interests.Taking aim at the hawkish approach of President Donald Trump, Foreign Minister Wang Yi voiced hope for a return of talks and “mutual trust” between the world’s two largest economic powers after Biden takes over on January 20.“It is important that US policy toward China return to objectivity and sensibility as early as possible,” Wang said in a virtual address to the New York-based Asia Society.Wang said that China saw “space for cooperation” with Biden on three of the four issues he has identified as immediate priorities -- Covid-19, economic recovery and climate change. Biden’s fourth stated priority is racial equity.On the pandemic, Wang said Beijing and Washington could collaborate in manufacturing vaccines and assisting third countries.“We hope that we will expand cooperation and manage differences through dialogue,” Wang said.The Trump administration says that decades of US engagement have failed with China, accusing Beijing of rampantly stealing intellectual property, widespread espionage and coercion of other nations through its blitz of infrastructure projects.In recent months, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has terminated Chinese-funded exchange programs for Americans and tightened visa rules for Chinese students as well as members of the Communist Party and their families, likely affecting hundreds of millions of people.“We see McCarthyism resurging and jeopardizing normal international exchanges,” Wang said, referring to the witch hunt for communists purported to be in the US government led by Republican senator Joe McCarthy following World War II.Wang accused unnamed senior US officials of “irresponsible presumption of guilt and emotional lashing-out.”“They ignore the vast common interests and room for cooperation between the two countries and insist that China is a main threat,” Wang said.“This is like misaligning the buttons on clothing. They get things wrong at the very beginning.”New curbs on technology The Trump administration has shown no sign of tapering off its tough stance on China as it enters its final month.On Friday, the Commerce Department said it was imposing restrictions on 77 entities that will need special clearance to receive advanced US technology.The targeted entities include two prominent universities -- the Beijing Institute of Technology, which allegedly sought to secure US items to benefit China’s military, and Tianjin University, which was accused of stealing trade secrets.Four companies were also targeted for assisting China’s drive to map citizens’ DNA, a campaign that activists say is used to control minorities, especially Uighur Muslims.“China’s corrupt and bullying behavior both inside and outside its borders harms US national security interests, undermines the sovereignty of our allies and partners, and violates the human rights and dignity of ethnic and religious minority groups,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.Pompeo separately marked the anniversary of the discovery of the first Covid-19 case in Wuhan to highlight the initial silencing of doctors who sounded alarm over the illness that has since killed more than 1.6 million people worldwide.He accused China of continuing to obstruct an investigation into the virus by the World Health Organization, from which Trump has ordered a US withdrawal.“It is also peddling vaccines that lack essential data on safety and efficacy, due to a fundamental disregard for transparency and accountability regarding results from clinical trials,” Pompeo said as the United States began mass vaccinations developed after intense Western research.“Both actions put Chinese citizens, and the world, at risk,” Pompeo said.Biden, who invested significant time in diplomacy with China as vice president, has broadly agreed that Beijing poses a global challenge and has called for a tougher response on human rights.But he is expected to take a less bellicose tone than Trump, with his nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, speaking of potential cooperation on climate change and the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-offers-to-work-with-biden-warns-of-new-mccarthyism/story-jAoXVytbIWroC7O9uaxQ2H.html
19-12-2020||World||Conservative group ‘True the vote’ says it’s challenging residency of 364K Georgia voters||A conservative group said Friday that it’s challenging the eligibility of more than 364,000 Georgia voters before election officials in each of the state’s 159 counties ahead of January runoff elections that will decide control of the US Senate.The Texas-based True the Vote said it’s working with Georgia residents across the state to make challenges under a state law that allows any registered voter to challenge the eligibility of any other voter within the same county. It’s up to local election boards to determine whether those challenges have merit.The Georgia Democratic Party’s executive director, Scott Hogan, called the voter challenges “blatant efforts to suppress the vote.” An attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union said they violate federal law.Georgia’s status as an electoral battleground was proven in November when Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia since 1992. Now GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler both face runoff elections Jan. 5. If both lose to Democratic challenges John Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, Democrats will take control of the Senate.Lawsuits filed by allies of President Donald Trump after the Nov. 3 election failed to turn up proof of widespread voter fraud. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, has defended the election results. Still, many Republicans have refused to accept the outcome and have tried to cast doubt in the fairness of the Senate runoffs.“Ongoing debates about the November election throughout the country have Americans focused intently on improving the integrity of our elections and restoring the faith of voters,” Catherine Engelbrecht, president of True the Vote, said in a statement Friday. “Today we assisted concerned Georgia voters in taking a stand for the sanctity of every legal vote.”The group said voters are being challenged based on questions about their residency based on change of address data obtained from the US Postal Service.Election officials in Cobb County on Friday rejected complaints brought by Jason Shepherd, the county’s Republican chairman, and a local GOP activist that sought to call into question the registration of more than 46,000 voters. The elections board voted unanimously, the Marietta Daily Journal reported.A similar challenge targeting more than 4,000 voters in Muscogee County, which includes Columbus, was found to have probable cause Wednesday by county election officials, the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reported. That means anyone on the challenged list who attempts to vote will have to prove their eligibility — as will anyone challenged who mailed absentee ballots that have yet to be opened.State law says counties can’t certify their vote totals until they have decided all challenges to people who voted.Rejection of a similar challenge filed over the summer in Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, ended up before a Superior Court judge. The judge refused to order county election officials to reconsider in a brief ruling that said federal election law preempted Georgia law.The ACLU of Georgia sent a letter to county election officials across Georgia urging them to reject the challenges, which the group said violates a federal law that prohibits any systemic removal of voters from the rolls less than 90 days before an election.Not only is Georgia’s election less than three weeks ago, but early in-person voting in the state began Monday.“We write to warn all county Georgia elections officials that participating in this charade violates state and federal law,” wrote Sean Young, legal director of the ACLU of Georgia. “Accordingly, you must reject such challenges because they lack probable cause, and you cannot force hundreds of thousands of Georgia voters to answer these baseless charges as a condition for having their ballot counted.”Because the challenges are carried out at the local level, Raffensperger has no role even though he’s the state’s top elections official. In a statement, he did not endorse the residency challenges but said he supports “any effort that builds faith in our election system that follows the proper legal procedure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/conservative-group-true-the-vote-says-it-s-challenging-residency-of-364k-georgia-voters/story-go6JzfBkQ4wn6zEmZXoPGM.html

But me, I won’t get vaccinated.”“Some people say I’m giving a bad example. But to the imbeciles, to the idiots that say this, I tell them I’ve already caught the virus, I have the antibodies, so why get vaccinated?”There have been a small number of cases of apparent reinfection although there is no certainty over whether a person can be reinfected or how long immunity lasts.Bolsonaro caught the virus in July but recovered within three weeks.Brazil is in the middle of a second wave of coronavirus infections.After peaking in June to August cases had been dropping but that changed in November.On Thursday, Brazil surpassed 1,000 daily deaths from covid-19 for the first time since September.The country’s immunization program has been widely criticized for being late and chaotic, not least given Bolsonaro’s opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-can-turn-people-into-crocodiles-brazilian-president-bolsonaro/story-ZfW9R6mJoibVm1Z4TK3FcN.html

Government officials are among the first to get the shots as part of longstanding plans to protect continuity of government.Recent polls have shown that confidence in the vaccine is increasing but that many Americans still harbor doubts.President Donald Trump has said he will take the vaccine, but hasn’t said when. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Tuesday declined to set a timeline, or to commit to him getting it while still in office.On Thursday, the transition announced that Representative Cedric Richmond, who has been named one of Biden’s White House aides, has tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first known infection among the president-elect’s senior advisers.Biden was tested after Richmond’s infection was known, and the president-electe tested negative for Covid-19 on Thursday. The transition team said Biden did not have “close contact” as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control when they appeared together at a campaign event Tuesday in Georgia, Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-elect-joe-biden-to-get-pfizer-vaccine-shot-on-monday-kamala-harris-likely-to-get-dose-the-week-after/story-NfBzsnwClBGkEvjauKL3sI.html
19-12-2020||World||Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine is ‘approved’, says Donald Trump; FDA’s nod awaited||US President Donald Trump announced on Friday that approval has been granted to Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, clearing the way for the distribution of a second inoculation against the deadly coronavirus within days of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.“Moderna vaccine overwhelmingly approved,” Trump tweeted. “Distribution to start immediately.” He added that “vaccines are on their way” to Europe and other countries hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.Trump’s announcement came even as the world awaited the Moderna vaccine’s formal authorisation by the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA), according to news reports.According to a Bloomberg report, FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said the agency was working quickly towards authorising the vaccine, which a panel of outside advisers backed on Thursday in a 20-0 vote.Moderna’s two-dose vaccine is similar to the Pfizer-BioNTech one; both have been developed using the mRNA technology. But it is said that Moderna’s vaccine is more convenient to store as it can be kept in refrigerators commonly available at health care facilities. In contrast, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine vials need much colder temperatures for storage.Meanwhile, US vice-president Mike Pence took a Pfizer vaccination shot on camera, seeking to demonstrate its safety to Americans who are sceptical of vaccines. President-elect Joe Biden and former presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama have said they intend to take their shots publicly, to reassure people distrustful of vaccines.The United States is witnessing a sharp increase in new Covid-19 cases, with more than 233,000 infections and 3,270 deaths reported in the last 24 hours, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker.Frontline health care workers and residents of long-term nursing homes are being prioritised for vaccination, which began to be administered in the US on Monday with the Pfizer vaccine’s shots. Nearly 3 million would have been administered the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by the end of the week at 600 sites.Moderna, which developed its vaccine with US health agencies and received federal funding, plans to distribute 20 million doses this month in addition to the 25 million shots supplied by Pfizer-BioNTech. In all, Moderna has committed to supplying 200 million doses in the US by the second quarter of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine-is-approved-says-donald-trump-fda-s-nod-awaited/story-kWAHYqoJhUodi9vafh7i1J.html
19-12-2020||India||India bans Covid-19 rapid antigen test kits by Korean company for 7 days||India’s apex drug and medical device regulator – the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) – has announced a seven-day ban on the import, sale, and distribution of the rapid antigen kits manufactured by the South Korean company SD Biosensors for not complying with the minimum requirement of sensitivity and specificity. The CDSCO had served a show-cause notice to the company asking why their import licence should not be cancelled or suspended. For any rapid antigen test kit to get approval for sale and use in India, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) requires it to have a minimum specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 50%. The regulator did not find the company’s response that “sample collection or procedural error during testing which has resulted in the non-compliance” satisfactory. Soon after, a notice was sent to all state drug controllers to recall all the kits of the particular batch number that was found to be faulty on December 7. A copy of the order is with HT. “Therefore, in public interest, under the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules thereunder, you are hereby directed to recall the product Standard Q Covid-19 Antigen test lot no. ….and to inform all to whom same has been distributed or supplied to stop further use of it with immediate effect,” the order reads. “And, also you shall not further import or sale or distribute the product Standard Q Covid-19 Antigen Test for a period of seven days,” the order says further. This was the first rapid antigen kit to hit the market in mid-June, which debuted in Delhi when the government was looking to scale up testing fast amid a surge in the number of cases. In an initial assessment by the Indian Council of Medical Research and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the kits were found to have a specificity of 99.3% to 100% and sensitivity ranging from 50.6% to 84%. With around 80% of the tests being conducted using the rapid antigen tests, the Delhi government was later criticised as the low sensitivity means that the tests can give a negative report for up to half of all the positive patients. Despite the kits being found to have a lower sensitivity and specificity than the existing norms, the industry body alleged that the government was favouring the company. “ICMR has approved 14 manufacturers for the corona rapid antigen tests with above specifications (Sensitivity 50% and specificity 95%) and various government agencies have purchased (these)…. How come the tender specifications have been modified to now suit only one Korean manufacturer SD Biosensor,” said a letter to the ICMR director general Dr Balaram Bhargava from the Association of the Indian Medical Device Industry (AIMED) on Saturday. “The ministry of health and other states were procuring the rapid antigen kits from the government marketplace, with the tenders not stating any minimum requirement of sensitivity or specificity. This means anyone approved by ICMR could apply. “From two weeks now, the government has changed this to a minimum 85% sensitivity, which is more than the 80% requirement of the US FDA as well. Now, there is only one company SD Biosensor that qualifies,” said one of the manufacturers of the kits. “The company had monopolised the market initially, when there were no India kits for the want of patient samples. And, it will do so again. The prices had been brought down from Rs 500 per kit to Rs 50 per kit,” the person said. The company is yet to respond to queries sent on Saturday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bans-covid-19-rapid-antigen-test-kits-by-korean-company-for-7-days/story-WEsjijSftq445ofFUKgjlL.html

I don’t do projects for money. My competition has always been with myself only. I have been working since 1999, so I am okay sitting back at home than working just for sake of it,” said the actor on her visit to Lucknow. Shinde gains confidence from her successes. “My shows have been in good TRP range and then ‘Bhabhi Ji…’ happened followed by ‘BB-11’ which I won. I was flooded with offers like ‘Angoori Bhabhi’ but I never repeat myself. I am always like — what better can I do now to set a higher benchmark. When not working, I have so many things to do in personal life. Besides, I keep organising garment workshops and my team keep holding lifestyle exhibitions,” she said.She prefers to keep a gap between her shows. “After ‘Waaris’ and ‘Mayka’ I took a two-year gap before ‘Chidiya Garh’ (and ‘Lapataganj’) happened. Then, after two years it was ‘Bhabi Ji…’ and similar was the gap between them and BB-11.” After that, she did a short stint in stand-up comedy show ‘Gangs of Filmistan’. “I did this small stint which was not a good show.” She prefers not to talk about BB but is amused that her name keeps cropping up in every season.On her upcoming show, she said, “I was not able to find anything interesting and then ‘Paurashpur’ came to me — it’s a historical show with a lot of scheming, mystery, thrill, intimate scenes and politics. It was a different level of experience. I am a daily soap actor while here playing a queen. It was about controlling emotions and expressions. So, I worked as per the director’s vision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/my-competition-has-always-been-with-myself-shilpa-shinde/story-SW0uUtAYhVidXqb9sZQD8I.html

19-12-2020||India||Congress fumes as RJD leader takes a dig at Rahul Gandhi in Bihar||Cracks have appeared in the relationship between the Congress and the RJD in Bihar after senior RJD leader and former Rajya Sabha MP Shivanand Tiwary once again took a swipe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and said that “he (Rahul Gandhi) is unable to inspire confidence in the public”. This is the second time in two months that Tiwary has targeted Rahul Gandhi leaving the Congress fuming. Earlier in November, Tiwary, an outspoken leader, had attacked the Congress for its poor show in the Bihar assembly polls and targeted Rahul for vacationing in Shimla amid the electoral battle even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a dozen rallies. Rahul Gandhi addressed only eight rallies throughout the three-week long poll campaign for the three-phase election, which ended on November 7. “Rahul Gandhi has never shown any inclination to possess traits of a full-time political worker. He’s unable to inspire confidence in the public. A section of Congress party has vested interests and supports Rahul Gandhi for party’s national president,” said Tiwary, RJD’s national vice president and advised Congress president Sonia Gandhi to overcome “putra moh” (weakness for her son) in deciding her political successor. “This statement is uncalled for and unwarranted. This is not expected from a leader of an alliance partner. I will request Tejashwi Yadav to take note of the statement and remove Tiwary from the party who is speaking the language of the BJP. His statement has created great resentment among Congress leaders. We will wait and see what action Tejashwi Yadav takes,” said senior Congress leader and MLC Premchandra Mishra. Not only that, Tiwary also slammed Congress general secretary and Bihar in-charge Randeep Surjewala for his claim that that almost 100 per cent of party members want Rahul Gandhi to be the party president. “It is not right to put out such numbers before any actual elections and this undermines the democratic principles of an institution,” said Tiwary. However, the RJD leader admired the “spirit of sacrifice” demonstrated by Gandhi in 2004 when she chose not to become the prime minister despite having the mandate. “I had a chance to meet Sonia Gandhi first when Lalu Yadav was a member of the Union cabinet. I was struck by the serenity on her face. She had revived her party which was left by Sitaram Kesri in a bad shape,” Tiwary said. “The choice before Sonia Gandhi today is not between her son and the party but her son and democracy itself. The Congress, which even now is more potent than any regional party, is capable of taking on a hegemonic BJP. But Rahul Gandhi has always come across as an “anichhuk” (reluctant) leader. He simply cannot inspire his supporters,” Tiwary said. The Congress won only 19 seats out of 70 seats it contested. A section of the RJD, preferring anonymity believes that the Congress was responsible for non-formation of the government in Bihar. Tiwary clarified that his opinion about Congress is not with any malafide intention. “We want the Congress to get stronger. Today, democracy is in danger especially the way civil liberties are being curbed and democratic voices are being suppressed in the country under the BJP rule. But I feel the Congress is not making any concerted effort in this direction,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-fumes-as-rjd-leader-takes-a-dig-at-rahul-gandhi-in-bihar/story-iuSXzR6kQVCg5XTdUkxWtK.html

19-12-2020||India||What is shigella infection reported in Kerala? All you need to know||As Kerala is battling with Covid-19, a new bacterial infection has been reported from the state spreading fear as the infection can be fatal and is believed to be contagious.An 11-year-old boy has died of the infection and many are reporting the symptoms.Here is all you need to know about this new infection in Kerala:1. The name of the bacteria is Shigella and the infection is known as shigellosis.2. Symptoms include diarrhoea, fever, stomach cramps which can last for seven days. Treatment is generally done through antibiotics, which can shorten the duration of the illness.3. Shigella bacteria spread from one person to another person through various means — even after the infected person is cured of diarrhoea.4. It takes a small number of bacteria to make someone ill.5. Contaminated food, water are the source of the infection.6. The presence of the bacteria is generally confirmed through a stool test.7. Like in the case of Covid-19, this infection can be prevented by maintaining proper hygiene. Washing hands properly is known to ward off the bacteria.8. The bacteria spreads not only through surfaces — touching an infected surface and then touching the mouth — but also from eating food prepared by someone carrying the infection.9. Though people of all ages can get infected, children are more susceptible to the infection. In Kerala too, those who have reported the infection are mostly children. People who are travelling are also vulnerable to the infection as they may get exposed to contaminated water during travelling. Sexual contact with those infected can also cause the disease.10. This is not the first time the infection has been reported in Kerala. In 2019, the bacteria was found in Koyilandy following which the schools were asked to monitor mid-day meal hygiene. 40 children of the West Lower Primary School, Keezhppayyur, were hospitalised in 2019, with similar symptoms.As health officials in Kerala are looking into the present outbreak and are sanitising the local water bodies, it has been found that those who are presently suffering from the disease somehow came in touch with the 11-year-old boy. They had either attended the boy’s funeral or had food from his house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-shigella-infection-reported-in-kerala-all-you-need-to-know/story-FZ6idraMxFZQnqVFlraowN.html
19-12-2020||India||North Kerala on high alert after 11-yr-old boy dies due to shigella bacterial infection||North Kerala has been put on high alert after an 11-year-old boy died and 20 suspected cases of shigella bacterial infection were reported in Kozhikode on Saturday, district medical officer Dr Jayashree said. She said the death took place two days back and later 20 people with symptoms, mild diaorrhea and fever, were admitted in various hospitals. Most of the infected were people who came in direct contact with the deceased.State health minister K K Shailaja said the health department will conduct a health camp in the area in a couple of days and investigation is on to locate the main source of the infection. She said health experts have said the infection spread through water and food and keeping good hygiene was the primary way to check the spread.What is shigella infection reported in Kerala? All you need to knowWorried health authorities have super chlorinated all water bodies in the area on Friday. Last year over 40 children of the West Lower Primary School, Keezhppayyur, were hospitalised after they complained of vomiting and diaorrhea. The presence of shigella bacteria was confirmed in the stool samples of at least two of these students, who recovered later. Later the district health department traced the presence of the bacteria from the water body in the siblings’ house. According to health experts, shigellosis is an infectious disease caused by the shigella bacteria, which triggers stomach pain, diaorrhea and fever in those infected. Though a worldwide problem, shigella is more often seen in developing countries, especially in crowded locations such as schools, day care centres, nursing homes or regions with poor sanitation. In some cases, people infected with the shigella bacteria do not have symptoms, but are still contagious. Besides water, there is a possibility that the bacteria spread through contaminated food, though the chances of that are less in this case, said officials. The health department has directed the community medicine department to reinvestigate each case and submit a report at the earliest. Health experts said the infection is not that deadly but if it is ignored it will aggravate the health condition and the patient may die of dehydration and exhaustion. But if ignored it may pose serious problems. “It has already been diagnosed. It is not a serious threat. We have to maintain personal hygiene,” said Dr C Anoop Kumar, head of the critical care unit in Baby Memorial hospital in Kozhikode. He was one among the first to diagnose the Nipah virus two years ago The deadly Nipah virus cases were reported in the district two years ago but it was localized and contained effectively though it claimed 17 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-kerala-on-high-alert-after-11-yr-old-boy-dies-due-to-shigella-bacterial-infection/story-yQLHW08dO9W4K23ue9cyeL.html
19-12-2020||India||E Palaniswami launches Tamil Nadu poll campaign from Salem||Tamil Nadu chief minister and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami on Saturday launched the party’s 2021 assembly elections campaign from his home constituency of Edappadi in Salem district by highlighting his government’s achievements. The AIADMK, having won two straight assembly elections under their late leader J Jayalalithaa, is aiming for a third term in power. This is the first time that Palaniswami will contest as the chief ministerial candidate.The CM started his day-long campaign by praying at Sendraya Perumal temple in Periyasoragai village in Salem district and inaugurated an ‘Amma mini clinic’. He completed his speech by appealing to people to vote for the two-leaves symbol. Addressing his supporters from an open van, which had a portrait of six-time chief minister Jayalalaithaa, he listed his government’s achievements in education, agriculture, water management, among other fields. The CM emphasised the government’s work in bringing the novel coronavirus under control in Tamil Nadu, which he said received praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He added that they realised the dream of poor students by carving out a 7.5% reservation in medical colleges for government school students who cleared National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET).Palaniswami also promised a hamper for Pongal, a multi-day harvest festival which falls in mid-January, in Tamil Nadu to 2.6 crore people holding ration cards. They will receive Rs 2,500 in cash along with raw rice, cashew, sugar, grapes, cardamom, sugarcane and a cloth bag. Opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MP Kanimozhi symbolically launched her campaign trail from Edappadi but the chief minister said that this region has been an AIADMK bastion and will remain so. “I didn’t expect to become chief minister, it is a God-given opportunity for me,” said Palaniswami. “After Amma’s death, the opposition was criticising that our government will fall in a month or two but we have ruled for four years amidst several challenges.”The AIADMK announced Palaniswami as its chief ministerial candidate after days of power struggle between Palaniswami and deputy chief minister and party’s coordinator O Panneerselvam in early October. The party is in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), actor Vijayakanth’s Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and Puthiya Thamizhagam which was formed ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. AIADMK leaders have said that they will continue in this alliance. After the DMK and Kamal Haasan’s MNM, the AIADMK is the third party to have hit the campaign trail. Haasan will start the second phase of his campaign on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/e-palaniswami-launches-tamil-nadu-poll-campaign-from-salem/story-isdfMX5sDJYHbEyrpWgoEN.html
19-12-2020||India||Military intelligence helps Kolkata Police bust illegal telephone exchange||The Kolkata Police have been receiving inputs from the Military Intelligence Unit in Lucknow about an illegal telephone exchange that was being run from Howrah with the help of SIM boxes. On Saturday a team comprising officers from the city police’s Special Task Force, Kasba police station and Howrah Police arrested a 38-year-old man identified as Sunil Shaw from a hideout on Beni Madhab Mukherjee Lane in Howrah. Six SIM boxes each having 16 to 64 SIM slots, adaptors, cables, two laptops, 175 SIM cards and a smart phone were seized by the raiding team. A SIM box routes international calls as local calls, allowing the box’s operator to bypass international rates charged by local mobile network operators. The SIM boxes are fitted with hundreds of GSM SIM cards procured using fake IDs. “Such an illegal exchange set up using illegal SIM boxes may serve as an illegitimate channel through which communication is made that may compromise the security of the nation as they evade regular gateways. They also rob the department of telecommunication of revenue,” said a senior officer of the STF. This is not the first time that such illegal telephone exchanges being run with SIM boxes have been busted in the country. In May this year, the crime branch of Mumbai Police broke up an illegal telephone exchange racket. A probe revealed that several calls were made to defence establishments in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). In February this year, a similar racket was found in Noida in Uttar Pradesh and Changaramkulam in Kerala. Police seized a total of eight SIM boxes and recovered 686 SIM cards from the raids in the two cities. “Further investigation is on,” said a senior STF official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-intelligence-helps-kolkata-police-bust-illegal-telephone-exchange/story-s1V2KHWbbPxb82xPUqZc3H.html

19-12-2020||India||BJP ally Hanuman Beniwal to lead farmers’ march, quits 3 Parliament panels||Rashtriya Loktantrik Party’s Hanuman Beniwal, an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) from Rajasthan, on Saturday resigned from three parliamentary committees in support of farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s agriculture-related laws, adding that the party will launch a march towards Delhi on December 26 in support of farmers. The route for the Delhi march is yet to be decided but the party claimed that around two lakh people will join them in the effort. “I am a son of a farmer and I have also supported farmers. Immediately after completing local panchayat elections on December 12 we launched a march for Shahjahanpur and had given an ultimatum to the Centre. Today, the deadline has ended after which my party has decided that we will launch a march towards Delhi on December 26 via Shahjahanpur border in which two lakhs farmers and youngsters will participate. The Central government is in the mood to muscle down the farmers’ protest. But this is the issue of sustenance and pride of farmers and we are standing with them,” said Beniwal while addressing a press conference at his residence. The MP from Nagaur was a member of the Standing Committee on Industry, Consultative Committee, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Committee on Petitions. Beniwal said that we are demanding that the government should implement the Swaminathan Commission recommendations so that farmers’ condition can be improved. “The government should roll back the farm laws. When the bills were discussed in Parliament, I was detected Covid positive. Otherwise, I would have torn the copy of the law. This is the time that the Prime Minister should listen to the farmers and get their blessings. He should not take this protest lightly. A saint died by suicide because of the issue,” the RLP chief added. On BJP’s hard stance amid protests, Beniwal said there is no farmer leader in the BJP and that’s why they are not able to understand farmers’ pain. A BJP spokesperson said that the RLP is supporting the protesting farmers to gain political mileage. “The BJP government is dedicated to the welfare of the farmers and majority of them are with us. The RLP had initially supported the farm laws and now taking a U-turn to gain political mileage,” he said on condition of anonymity. State Congress spokesperson Nitin Agarwal said that there is a lot of difference between what Beniwal says and what he does. “Initially, he supported the farmers’ law and now he is against the bills. There is a contradiction in his statements. If he really wants farmers’ benefit then just like the Akali Dal, he should break the alliance with the NDA,” he said. On being asked about his initial support to the farm bills, Beniwal said he had supported the ordinance which was not a detailed one. “But once I read the farm laws, I came to know that they are totally against the interest of farmers, that’s why I am against it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-ally-hanuman-beniwal-to-lead-farmers-march-quits-3-parliament-panels/story-K6OVsEOqKmUn2l2zA6QS2L.html

The attached properties include three residential houses, one at Gupkar road, Srinagar; one at Tehsil Katipora, Tanmarg, and one at Bhatindi, Sunjwan(Jammu); commercial buildings at posh Residency Road area of Srinagar. Lands at four different places in J&K have also been attached.Omer Abdullah said these properties are largely ancestral, dating from the 1970s. The most recent one among these were built before 2003.“Dr Abdullah is in touch with his lawyers & will fight all these baseless charges in the one place that matters - a court of law, where everyone is presumed to be innocent and is entitled to a fair trial unlike in the court of the media or the court of BJP-managed social media,” he tweeted.He also alleged that the news was published before Farooq Abdullah was given any official notice. “My father has seen the media reports regarding attachment of his properties in the ongoing investigation in to the JKCA matter. Not surprisingly the media was tipped off regarding the seizure before he had received any official notice or documentation,” he wrote.Farooq Abdullah served as the chief minister of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state for several years since 1982. His last stint as the CM was between 1996 and 2002.He was the president of JKCA from 2006 to 2012. The ED has claimed to have found that Farooq Abdullah “misused his position and clout by illegal appointments of office bearer to whom he gave financial powers for the purpose of laundering JKCA funds”.“Despite existing regular bank account of JKCA, six new bank account were opened for parking of JKCA funds and siphoning of the same. One dormant bank account in the name of Kashmir Wing of JKCA was also made operational for the same purposed,” the ED said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-justification-for-seizures-says-omar-abdullah-on-ed-action-on-farooq-abdullah/story-rskFUdWL4DXXQJ4vExnXqM.html

19-12-2020||India||India capable of appropriate response to transgression on borders: Rajnath Singh||India has the strength for an appropriate response to any transgression or unilateral action on the borders but believes in finding a peaceful solution to any conflict, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday against the backdrop of the border standoff with China. Singh made the remarks while addressing a combined graduation parade at the Indian Air Force Academy at Dundigal in Telangana, a day after India and China agreed to hold another meeting of senior military commanders to take forward disengagement and de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh sector. “You are all aware of the Indo-China standoff in the northern sector. China’s attitude amid a crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic reflects that country’s intention,” Singh said, speaking in Hindi after reviewing the passing-out parade. “However, we have shown that our India is no longer a weak India. This is a new India that has the strength to give an appropriate and complete reply to any type of transgression or aggression or any type of unilateral action of the borders,” he added. Several big countries, he said, had praised and supported the steps taken by India. “You will also be aware that we believe in finding a peaceful solution to any conflict through dialogue,” he said. India and China are holding talks through military and diplomatic channels, he noted. “I would like to again say on this occasion that we want peace, not conflict. But we will not tolerate any attempt to hurt the self-respect of the country. We are fully prepared to deal with any kind of situation,” he said. Following a meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on Friday, there were no signs of an immediate breakthrough but the external affairs ministry said the two sides had agreed to hold another meeting of military commanders at an early date. During his speech, Singh also criticised Pakistan for fighting a “proxy war” using terrorists even after being defeated in four conventional wars with India. Referring to last year’s air strike on Balakot within Pakistan, carried out in retaliation for a suicide bombing at Pulwama by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), he said this had shown that India is capable to targeting terrorists outside the country’s borders. “In the same way in the western sector, on the borders with Pakistan, our neighbour is always up to some nefarious activities. Even after being defeated in not one but four wars, Pakistan is fighting a proxy war through terrorism. Our army, security forces and police are fighting the challenge of terrorism with full strength,” he said. “India is taking effective action against terrorists not only within the country but on the borders and even across the borders. By taking effective action against terrorism in Balakot, the Indian Air Force showed the whole world India’s military strength and determination to fight terrorism,” he said. Singh told the cadets who passed out of the academy that the ways of fighting wars are constantly changing and they would have to be scholars and soldiers to fight the wars of the future using advanced technologies and military strategies. “The scope of these challenges too has become comprehensive. The challenges before the country are not just on the borders and on the seas, but they can come through space and cyberspace,” he said. “I believe that defence in the coming days will not be limited to defence of the seas, land and air, this will be a dynamic challenge for which we will have to prepare ourselves.” Singh added: “I advise you to learn from history, know the present and prepare for the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-capable-of-appropriate-response-to-transgression-on-borders-rajnath-singh/story-Sc979ngDWSEqcxS3TTfotM.html

Khattar held a meeting with union minister Narendra Singh Tomar to discuss the ongoing protests. The protests which have been going on at the Delhi-Haryana border at Singhu has entered its 25th day and the government expects that the solution can only be achieved through discussions between both parties. “I believe that the talk could be held in the next 2-3 days. A solution to this issue (farmers’ protest) should be found through discussion. I have said that this issue should be resolved soon,” Khattar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Khattar’s meeting with Tomar comes a day after former Union minister and BJP senior leader Chaudhary Birender Singh participated in a protest in Rohtak supporting the demands raised by the farmers. This is the second meeting between Haryana chief minister and the union agriculture minister. Earlier, both leaders had met on December 8. The Haryana chief minister also raised the issue of Sutlej-Yamuna link canal. Khattar said, “I appeal to farmers of Punjab to seriously consider SYL (Sutlej Yamuna Link) canal matter. Farmers of Haryana are struggling with a shortage of irrigation. I have raised this issue. We demand that construction of SYL canal should be completed.”Earlier on Saturday, BJP leaders from Haryana had observed a fast demanding that Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh should allow Haryana access to its share of river waters. BJP MP Arvind Sharma who was a part of the protests told news agency PTI, “After I became an MP, I raised this issue in Parliament. Punjab should look at the demand of people of Haryana.”The Sutlej Yamuna link canal is a contentious issue between Punjab and Haryana. While Haryana has been demanding the completion of the canal to get its share of 3.5 million acre feet of water Punjab continues to raise demands of assessment of the volume of water released from rivers Ravi and Beas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/next-round-of-talks-with-farmers-could-be-held-in-the-next-2-3-days-says-haryana-cm-after-meeting-tomar-reports-ani/story-vyCFzaZrORErmiDDr6jIWL.html
19-12-2020||India||Court seeks Rajasthan govt’s reply on work in jails given on caste lines||Taking note of a report that prisons in Rajasthan were allocating work to inmates based on their castes, the Rajasthan High Court has sought the government’s response and called for a complete overhaul of the “archaic” rule book.The division bench of Justice Sandeep Mehta and Justice Devendra Kachhawaha, while hearing the petition filed by Manoj Yadav, directed additional advocate general Farzand Ali to apprise the court regarding the proposed steps for complete overhauling of the Prison Manual and to ensure that the prisoners are not forced to indulge in menial jobs like cleaning toilets, etc, merely on the basis of their caste and also that no under trial prisoner is forced to perform such jobs in the prison.In the interest of justice, the court urged the state government to consider installation of mechanized/automated cleaning facilities in all the prisons.“We have come across a very disturbing report regarding the existence of a caste-based work assignment system in the prisons in Rajasthan. The report is based on a research paper of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI). The researcher of the CHRI interviewed various prisoners (since released) from prisons in Rajasthan and a shocking finding came out that till date the archaic Prison Manual, which was a gift of the British Rule, is prevalent in the prison system of the State.“As per the report, every person, who enters a prison in the State, is asked about his caste and once identified, menial jobs like cleaning toilets, sweeping the prisons, etc. are assigned to the persons from lowest echelons in the society irrespective of the nature of the offence committed,” the court observed.According to the report, the arrangement was clear – those at the bottom of the caste pyramid did the cleaning work; those high above handled the kitchen or the legal documentation department. And the rich and influential did nothing; they only threw their weight around. These arrangements had nothing to do with the crime that one was arrested for or his conduct in prison, the report added.“Caste-based labour, in fact, is sanctioned in the prison manuals of many states. The colonial texts of the late 19th century have barely seen any amendments, and caste-based labour remains an untouched part of these manuals. While every state has its own unique prison manual, they are mostly based on The Prions Act, 1894. These jail manuals mention every activity in detail – from the measurement of food and space per prisoner to punishments for the “disorderly ones”, the report said.“The report also refers to the fact that the Prison Manuals of various states are still plagued by the archaic and derogatory caste system, which the Constitution of India pledged to eradicate. We are of the firm view that no under trial prisoner can be assigned such duties in a prison,” the bench said.The court fixed February 2 as the next date for hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-seeks-rajasthan-govt-s-reply-on-work-in-jails-given-on-caste-lines/story-glMmZyqH54TKZxUgZo4UdP.html

He was 97.His son Manmohan Vaidya is the joint general secretary of the RSS, while his second son Dr Shriram Vaidya is a senior official of foreign cell of the organisation.“MG Vaidya, my father breathed his last today at 3.35 pm at Nagpur after completing 97 years of active, meaningful and inspiring life. He was a veteran journalist, a Hindutva “Bhashyakar” and active Sangh Swayamsevak for 9 decades,” tweeted MG Vaidya.A former Sanskrit professor of a local Christian missionary college, MG Vaidya also served the RSS as Akhil Bharatiya Bouddhikh Pramukh (chief of intellectual cell of RSS) and the spokesman of the organisation for over eight decades. He also worked as the chief editor of Tarun Bharat, a mouthpiece of the Sangh Parivar.Vaidya, who was one of the oldest living swayamsevaks of the RSS, had seen it all over the nine-decade-old history of the organisation — the three bans, isolation, internal conflicts over joining politics, ferment and resurgence. He was also a witness to the evolving power equations within the BJP, and its rise to power with an overwhelming majority in 2014 and 2019.A close confidant of former RSS chief, late Balasaheb Deoras, Vaidya was in jail during the Emergency and later became the member of the legislative council of Maharashtra in the late ’70s.Union minister Nitin Gadkari mourned the loss of the RSS veteran.“My humble tribute to Baburao Vaidya. Baburao was fortunate enough to work with all Sarsanghchalaks. It was a firm belief that Baburaoji would be a centenarian, but destiny had something different in mind. It is sad that a pious and sage-like personality has passed away,” Gadkari said in his condolence message.Vaidya is survived by his wife, Sunanda, three daughters, five sons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-ideologue-mg-vaidya-dies-at-97/story-2eNjZy28ChqmmXVuwqqN6M.html
19-12-2020||India||12 nations reached out to India for Covid vaccine: NITI Aayog’s VK Paul||India has received requests for vaccines against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from 12 countries, said NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul on Saturday during the meeting of the high-level group of ministers (GoM) on Covid-19. Dr Paul informed the GoM about the vaccine candidates in trial in India, the manufacturers, doses to become available and conditions for storage. He also spoke about the target populations who would receive the vaccines once they become available. The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), headed by Dr Paul, has recommended that 10 million healthcare staff, 20 million frontline workers and 270 million people over the age of 50 or with co-morbidities be given the vaccines on priority once it becomes available. Three companies have already applied for emergency use authorisation of their vaccines – US-based Pfizer which has not conducted any studies in India, Serum Institute of India for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine that it would be manufacturing, and Bharat Biotech that has developed its vaccine indigenously with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Apart from discussions on vaccines, the GoM, which met for the first time since October, was also provided data on the current situation of the infection in the country by the director of the National Centre for Disease Control Dr Sujeet Singh. He presented an analysis of the pandemic in each state, pointing out critical parameters like positivity rate, breakup of the proportion of rapid antigen test and RT-PCR, concentration of cases in particular districts, and fatality within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalisation. The union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan pointed out that the health seeking behaviour was the key driver in keeping the fatalities in check. He said there was a paradox with some states and union territories reporting a very high number of cases but minimal fatalities while others reporting low number of cases and comparatively high fatality. “This results from people not coming forward for testing even if they are symptomatic in the second category of states. People in the states and union territories with a vibrant public healthcare system are tracked and encouraged to be tested by grassroots health workers which inhibits the progress of Covid-19 to an advanced stage and keeps their fatality rate at minimum,” he said. The Union health secretary had earlier said that getting tested when symptomatic was also Covid-19 appropriate behaviour along with wearing masks, maintaining social distance and washing hands frequently. He said the government’s policy on allowing testing on demand without prescriptions can help. “We are planning to give the vaccine to almost 30 crore people, we will be able to get rid of the virus as best as possible,” said Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union health minister at the beginning of the meeting, thanking the healthcare workers. He said, despite festivals in the months of October and November, there was no new surge in the number of cases due to testing, tracking and treatment policy implemented on ground. He appealed to people that they follow Covid appropriate behaviours especially at a time when the country is on the verge of authorising the first set of Covid-19 vaccines. External affairs minister S Jaishankar, aviation minister Hardeep Puri, minister of state for health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey, and minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai were present at the meeting. They were joined virtually by advisors to the PM Amarjeet Sinha and Bhaskar Khulbe, Secretary (Textiles) Ravi Capoor, Secretary (Pharma) S Aparna, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, and other senior government officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-nations-reached-out-to-india-for-covid-vaccine-niti-aayog-s-vk-paul/story-M9bpdJxBvYCnRED3wL1HbN.html
19-12-2020||India||India has 223 active Covid-19 cases per million, second surge unlikely, say experts||With fewer new cases being reported and a high number of recoveries, the active cases or those with a current infection of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across India has reduced to just over 300,000 as on Saturday. The country reported 25,152 new Covid-19 cases on Friday and 29,885 recoveries, leading to a decline of 5,080 in the number of active cases, as per data released by the Union health ministry. This puts the number of active cases per million in India at 223. In comparison, the United States has 21,612 active cases per million-population and Russia has 3,513, as per the health ministry’s data. The country’s cumulative positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – has also been on the decline, reaching 6.25% as on Saturday. India has been testing over 1 million samples a day, with 160 million samples having been processed so far since testing began with just one laboratory in mid-January. “The number of new cases and positivity rate in the country are likely to remain low unless there is some mutation in the virus. This is because a large proportion of the population has already been exposed to the infection, I think. Even though some parts of the country – especially rural India -- have reported fewer cases than places like Delhi or Mumbai these are also places where fewer tests happened. And, with a much younger population in the rural areas most people must have recovered with a mild disease,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital. He cited the farmer’s protest as an example where despite thousands of people living in close proximity, a high number of infections were not reported. “In UK and other countries in Europe, there was a second surge in the number of infections when their lockdown or other restrictions were lifted. We had seen the same but our lockdown had ended early on when the number of cases was still high, masking the effect. Now, the numbers have come down,” said Kishore. Since then, the number of labs performing Covid-19 tests has increased to over 2,000. There are 15 states that have positivity rates lower than the national average, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha and Telangana. In Delhi, despite the current decline in the daily positivity rate to below 2% for four days in a row, the cumulative positivity rate continues to be 8.06%. The city which has seen three surges in the number of infections had reported a positivity rate as high as almost 37% in June. As per the data, there are 34 states which have a recovery rate higher than the national average. Recovery rate is the proportion of people who got the infection and recovered from it among the total who tested positive. The states with the highest recovery rates include Andhra Pradesh with 98.7%, Odisha with 98.6%, Tamil Nadu with 97.3%, Karnataka with 97%, and Delhi with 96.5% among others. Among these states, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Delhi are among the ten states that have reported the highest number of new cases on Friday. Kerala topped the chart with 5,456 infections reported in 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-223-active-covid-19-cases-per-million-second-surge-unlikely-say-experts/story-GiDpkXECLQCN92zXV2qoYO.html
19-12-2020||India||Retired IPS officer who runs schools thrashed by TMC leaders in Bengal||Former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Nazrul Islam, who has been running educational institutions and a college in Bengal’s Murshidabad district since his retirement, was allegedly thrashed by some local Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders on Friday. Islam lodged a formal complaint at Domkal police station after the assault. The TMC leadership has condemned the attacked. Islam, who is also a writer, formed a political outfit called the Mul Nivasi Party a few years ago to raise issues related to indigenous communities. He hails from a village in the Domkal area of Murshidabad. It is alleged that on Friday afternoon, Majidul Sheikh, the TMC councillor from Ward 17 in Domkal municipal area and two other men barged into Islam’s office at Ramna-Basantapur and thrashed him. Local people rushed to Islam’s rescue and took him to Domkal hospital. Islam was released after treatment. He lodged a written complaint against Majidul Sheikh, Bhadu Sheikh and Jahangir Sheikh at Domkal police station. The district TMC unit did not try to defend anyone. The coordinator of the ruling party’s Murshidabad unit, Asok Das, said, “We have asked the police administration to arrest all the culprits. We are not going to shield the accused.” Islam, who served in important positions such as head of the detective department of the Kolkata Police, runs some educational and charitable institutions under the banner of the Basantapur Education Society. Local people have alleged that Majidul Sheikh and some local TMC leaders are trying to take over the society for a long time. Islam said, “There was a parent-teacher meeting at the English medium school on Friday. Majidul and his uncle, Bhadu, entered the institution and locked the entrance.” “The two men and some of their associates thrashed me inside my office. They held me by the collar and dragged me to the field and beat me up. They said I have to leave my village forever. But I will not bow under pressure,” said Islam. Some staff members of the school alleged that Sheikh had beaten them up too in the past and a written complaint was lodged against him at Domkal police station. But the police did not take any action against him, they alleged. Sheikh’s aides claimed that he and his uncle work at the school but had not been paid for eight months. Sheikh’s aides said he went to demand his salary and this led to an altercation. Sheikh could not be contacted despite several attempts. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior officer at Domkal police station said, “We have started a probe on the basis of the written complaint. No one could be arrested till Saturday morning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retired-ips-officer-who-runs-schools-thrashed-by-tmc-leaders-in-bengal/story-aTlrjVCqWODhiQTVSTs8tM.html
19-12-2020||India||J-K Cricket Association money laundering case: ED attaches assets worth Rs 11.86 crore of National Conference president Farooq Abdullah||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday attached assets worth Rs 11.86 crores of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah in connection with the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) money laundering case. The properties which were attached by the Enforcement Directorate include three residential houses at Gupkar Road in Srinagar, Tanmarg and Sunjwan village. Lands owned by Farooq Abdullah at four different places in Jammu and Kashmir has also been attached by the ED officials. The Enforcement Directorate in its statement also pointed out that residential property attached in Sunjwan was constructed after grabbing state and forest land. ED said that after conducting investigations under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, it found out that between the years 2005-06 to 2012, the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association received funding totalling to Rs 109.78 crore from Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI). The ED in its statement said that between the years 2006 and 2012, Farooq Abdullah took advantage of his position in the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association by making illegal appointments at the JKCA and alleged that he misused those appointments by giving them financial powers in order to launder JKCA’s funds. ED says that the investigation conducted into the money laundering case revealed that the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister ‘was instrumental as well as beneficiary of the laundered funds of JKCA.’“Despite existing regular bank account of JKCA, six new bank accounts were opened for parking of JKCA Funds and siphoning of the same. One dormant bank account in the name of Kashmir Wing of JKCA was also made operational for the same purpose,” the statement from the central agency further said. The scam came into light in the year 2012 when JKCA treasurer Manzoor Wazir filed a complaint to the Jammu and Kashmir police against former general secretary Mohammad Saleem Khan and former treasurer Ahsan Mirza.Following Wazir’s complaint a list of 50 names linked to the financial scandal was out was released following which Farooq Abdullah lost the post of JKCA president after holding it for more than three decades. ED earlier in February had said that it has attached assets worth Rs 2.6 crore in a money laundering case related to the alleged embezzlement of funds of JKCA. The Enforcement Directorate conducted the probe based on the FIR filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) following which general secretary Mohammed Saleem Khan and former treasurer Ahsan Ahmad Mirza were booked. The J-K High Court in 2015 had asked CBI to conduct an investigation into the matter. The CBI filed a charge sheet against Farooq Abdullah, Khan, Mirza, Mir Manzoor Gazanffer Ali, Bashir Ahmad Misgar and Gulzar Ahmad Beigh (former accountant of JKCA) for “misappropriation of JKCA funds amounting to Rs 43.69 crore” from grants given by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to the association for promoting the sport in the state between 2002-11.(with inputs from Neeraj Chauhan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-cricket-association-money-laundering-case-ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-11-86-crore-of-national-conference-president-farooq-abdullah-reports-pti/story-JBpU9I5D1JM6NU0DAnwxpM.html
19-12-2020||India||Banks pursue UK bankruptcy order against Vijay Mallya||A consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) returned to the High Court in London for a bankruptcy application hearing against liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya, as they pursue the recovery of debt from loans paid out to his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.At a virtual hearing before Chief Insolvencies and Companies Court (ICC) Judge Michael Briggs on Friday, both sides deposed retired Indian Supreme Court justices as expert witnesses on Indian law in support of their arguments for and against a bankruptcy order against Mallya in the UK.While the banks argued a right to waive their security over the Indian assets involved in the case in order to recover their debt in the UK, lawyers for the 65-year-old businessman argued that the funds in question involved public money held by state-owned banks in India which precluded them from such a security waiver.“As a commercial entity, a bank has a right to exercise its commercial wisdom to decide what it wants to do with its security,” noted barrister Marcia Shekerdemian, arguing on behalf of SBI and others.She cross-examined Retd Justice Deepak Verma, who deposed via video link from India on behalf of Mallya to establish that the banks cannot give up their security on the Indian assets and then pursue a bankruptcy order under English law because public money and public interest is involved in the case in India.Retd Justice Gopala Gowda argued the reverse in his cross-examination by Mallya’s barrister Philip Marshall, saying the banks had a right to relinquish their security in pursuit of unpaid dues.The exchange between the lawyers got heated at several points during the course of the virtual hearing, also being followed by Mallya, with Judge Briggs stepping in to urge a focussed question and answer approach to expedite the proceedings.However, the depositions left no time for closing submissions in the case, which has now been adjourned to a yet-to-be-agreed date in the New Year.Meanwhile, Marshall once again raised the issue of access to court-held funds from the sale of a French property for Mallya to be able to cover the legal fees of the next hearing as he no longer has a source of income from his consultancy work.The SBI led consortium of 13 Indian banks, which also includes Bank of Baroda, Corporation Bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd, had initiated the proceedings against Mallya in December 2018.There have been a series of hearings in the case since then as part of their efforts to recoup around1.145 billion pounds in unpaid loans.Mallya, meanwhile, remains on bail as the UK Home Office deals with a “confidential” legal issue before UK Home Secretary Priti Patel can sign off on his extradition sought by the Indian government, on charges of fraud and money laundering related to loans acquired for Kingfisher Airlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-banks-pursue-uk-bankruptcy-order-against-vijay-mallya/story-Y1CERgMpvANZfVhkCyCA6L.html

He also asserted that the party was not built in one day with the contribution of one person. It was a continuous effort on a mammoth scale, the culmination of which was the TMC’s coming to power in West Bengal in 2011, he wrotePolitical heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari joined the BJP today at home minister Amit Shah’s rally in Midnapore. During the rally, Adhikari vowed to oust the Banerjee regime in the upcoming 2021 assembly elections in West Bengal.He also alleged that the TMC wants to divide the state on the lines of “insider” and “outsider”, while the BJP believes in nationalism and pluralism. “Shame on the TMC for such narrow politics,” Adhikari also said.“I am being called a traitor by those who themselves (TMC) are traitors. Had the BJP not been there, TMC would have never come into existence. In the next assembly polls, BJP will win Bengal and TMC will be defeated,” he also said.Adhikari resigned from the Trinamool Congress earlier this week. He was the legislator from Nandigram in East Midnapore district. Along with Adhikari, nine other MLAs of different parties and a TMC MP also joined the BJP.

The Archaeological Survey of India, in its notification issued on Friday, however, said that the number of visitors to the monuments may be limited by the superintending archaeologist with concurrence of the District Magistrate. Selling of personal tickets and sound and light shows have also been allowed to resume. The monuments will be expected to follow the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to prevent the transmission of Covid-19, including norms of social distancing and preventive practices. The cap on the number of visitors was issued to monuments, which after being shut for over two months due to the Covid-19 crisis, were allowed to open from June 8, Hindustan Times reported. The list included temples, mosques and churches, with 114 monuments in the North region, 155 in the Centre, 170 in the West, 279 in the South and a 103 in the East circles. Places of worship were officially closed on March 24, after the nationwide lockdown was announced.

The tour of Shah is seen as a game-changer. As many as 11 MLAs, one former and one sitting MP of TMC are set to join BJP today.Among the ministers likely to visit the state are Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Prahlad Patel, Sanjeev Balyan, Arjun Munda and Mansukh Mandaviya to name a few. The party has also roped in Uttar Pradesh’s deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and Madhya Pradesh’s home minister Narottam Mishra in the process. The senior leaders are expected to interact with the party cadre and also attempt to garner grassroots level sentiment prevalent in the state apart from wooing TMC leaders in its fold to damage the ruling state government. The Union Ministers are expected to visit different parts of the state and apprise the party workers regarding the various central schemes that have benefited the state. They are also likely to inform them about the various schemes that have not been implemented in the state by the TMC government. Earlier, BJP had sent its party’s national office bearers to collate a detailed report on ground situation and issues that can echo in assembly polls. While BJP chief JP Nadda is currently in self-isolation due to Covid-19, he is also expected to send teams of organisational functionaries to the state to oversee the poll preparedness. BJP hopes to do well in the forthcoming West Bengal assembly polls likely to take place next year.BJP had stunned the Trinamool Congress in 2019 Lok Sabha polls as it wrested 18 parliamentary constituencies in the state, coming up with its best-ever performance in the state with 42 lower house constituencies.Post the historic Lok Sabha victory of BJP under a Narendra Modi-led campaign, the party considers winning upcoming assembly polls as crucial and wants to send out a strong message to the opposition by winning in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-ropes-in-cabinet-ministers-to-win-west-bengal/story-ooGKysnepBvPrxJv8lwU1O.html

19-12-2020||India||Amit Shah has lunch at Bengal farmer’s house||Union home minister Amit Shah, along with a section of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s top leaders in West Bengal, had lunch with a farmer’s family on Saturday afternoon before heading for a public rally. On Sunday, the Union minister is scheduled to have lunch with the family of a baul singer in Birbhum district, where he is also scheduled to attend a road show and visit the Visva Bharati. On Saturday’s menu were rice, roti, cauliflower, three types of fried vegetable, dal with bottle gourd, papad, chutney and the Bengal’s iconic sweet rasogolla dipped in jaggery tonic, which is usually found during the winter. “I arranged whatever I could with my limited resources. I am very happy that Shah was coming to my house to have food,” Sanatan Singh, the famer, told media persons at West Midnapore. He owns around 3.5 bighas of land. The last time Shah had lunch with a tribal family at Bankura during his two-day visit to the state in November, Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee had alleged that the food was brought from five-star hotels, triggering a controversy. The BJP, however, refuted that allegation, saying that the TMC can stoop to any low to malign the prime minister and home minister. Shah arrived around 1:30 pm after visiting the family members of freedom fighter Khudiram Bose and offering prayers at the Siddeshwari Temple. A festive mood was prevailing in the household at Balijuri village of West Midnapore as the Singh family was eagerly waiting since morning. Shah was served lunch in the courtyard of the mud hut of Singh with plates made of banana leaves and earthen water bottle. The visit comes when thousands of farmers are protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws in the National Capital Region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-has-lunch-with-bengal-farmer-s-family/story-LW9tVFnnSRT8V4Mj9ByU3M.html

The accident victim, too, succumbed in the incident, the police said. The incident happened at Raghavampalli village of Bathalapalli block at around 7 pm. The deceased were identified as Rajasekhar (20), Srinivasulu (40), Sivamma (50), Suri (45) and Vali Saheb (50). According to Bathalapalli police, Rajasekhar, a farmer belonging to Raghavampalli village, was returning to his village on his motorbike when an unknown vehicle hit him from behind and fled from the spot. “He was flung off the vehicle and fell on the other side of the road. He collapsed on the road and was battling for his life, when some construction labourers and local villagers passing by rushed there to rescue him. Even as they were giving him first aid, a truck laden with cement bags going towards Kadiri hit them,” the police said. While Rajasekhar died of his injuries caused due to the bike accident, Srinivasulu, who runs a chicken centre at neighbouring Narsimpally village and Shivamma of Mushtur village – were crushed to death under the lorry. Two others – Suri and Vali Saheb, both construction workers from Sanjeevapuram village, succumbed to injuries while undergoing treatment at the Anantapur government hospital. “Another construction worker Raju, who also received injuries, has been rushed to hospital and he is out of danger,” the police said, adding that the cement truck, too, did not stop after causing the accident. This is the second such incident in the Telugu states in the last two weeks. On December 4, a speeding car travelling from Telangana’s Karimnagar to Hyderabad hit the road divider, resulting in the death of three passengers inside. Some passers-by and local police officials rushed to the spot to take up rescue operations, when a truck coming from the opposite direction rammed into the crowd, killing two more people at the same spot. In all, 12 people, including a police inspector and a constable of Siddipet police station, sustained injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-killed-in-accident-in-andhra-s-anantapur-while-trying-to-rescue-another-victim/story-6BOe2120NOvZrnvlLDQgWJ.html

As he started addressing the crowd at Midnapore College Ground, Amit Shah himself said the star of today’s show was Adhikari whose exit from the party is believed to have a future impact on West Bengal Assembly election 2021. As Suvendu joined the BJP severing decades-old ties with the Trinamool, he recalled the first time he met Amit Shah. It was during the Lok Sabha Election 2014. Suvendu met Shah through BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh . “Now he is the health minister of Uttar Pradesh Cabinet. They never asked me to join the party at that time,” Suvendu said recalling.When Suvendu tested positive for Covid-19, Amit Shah called him twice, he said. “None of my party colleagues with whom I have worked for years called me, But Amit Shah ji enquired about my health,” he said.“I am assuring all local leaders I am not here to dominate or dictate terms to you. I will work as an ordinary worker of the BJP. My background is rooted in student politics. If you ask me to put up posters, I will do that,” he said addressing the local leaders of the BJP.After resigning from the post of the transport minister, Suvendu submitted his resignation as MLA on December 16. The resignation, however, has not been accepted yet. West Bengal Assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee on Friday said that he has not accepted the resignation as it does not conform to the provisions of the Constitution and the rules of the House.“Unless and until I am satisfied that the resignation is voluntary and genuine, it is not possible for me to accept the same in the light of the provisions of the Constitution of India and the rules of procedure and conduct of business in West Bengal Legislative Assembly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-i-was-covid-19-positive-amit-shah-called-me-twice-says-suvendu-adhikari-recalls-his-first-meeting-with-shah/story-8ZH0kzpN46lpK73G2n0jUK.html
19-12-2020||India||Mayawati again seeks withdrawal of new farm laws||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Saturday reiterated her demand that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre should withdraw the three contentious farm reform laws that have triggered protests by farmers. Mayawati took to Twitter to demand that the Centre should drop its “stubborn attitude” towards the farmers’ demands. The BSP chief had earlier backed the December 8 Bharat Bandh call given by farmers’ groups.“The government at the Centre should not adopt a stubborn attitude towards the farmers who are agitated over the three farm laws. It should instead adopt a sympathetic approach towards them by accepting all their demands, including recalling the farm laws,” Mayawati tweeted. This is the third time in the past 20 days that Mayawati has demanded withdrawing farm laws even as the BJP hit back.“She is desperate. It is showing. But all her efforts to mislead the farmers won’t have any impact as the country has full faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has repeatedly assured that farmers’ interests won’t be compromised,” said UP BJP spokesman Navin Srivastava. The BSP chief’s latest demand came a day after the Prime Minister reached out to the farmers to allay their major concerns, including one over the minimum support price (MSP). On Thursday, the BJP government also rolled out a major farmer outreach initiative that included an eight-page letter from union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, in which he had stated that while the government would continue the process of dialogue with farmers, it would not entertain any Opposition agenda. Modi, too, in his appeal to the farmers, had hit out at the Opposition stand on the issue. The Yogi Adityanath government, as well as the ruling BJP in Uttar Pradesh, have launched farmers’ meets. On Friday, the government also decided to hold Kisan Samvad Sammelans (dialogue meets with farmers) on former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s birth anniversary on December 25. These meets would be held via video conference and would include Modi’s appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mayawati-again-seeks-withdrawal-of-new-farm-laws/story-Z7CQLgZm8bTzsoQTxFLhSO.html
19-12-2020||India||After victory in local civic body polls, ruling CPI (M) eyes assembly election in Kerala||Buoyed by the unexpected victory in the local body elections, the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPIM)) has showcased its ambitious plan to retain power in the state. Usually the state never gives a second chance to the incumbent government and tries two dispensations alternately, the CPI (M)-led Left Democratic Front and Congress-controlled United Democratic Front. But this time the CPI (M) thinks it can rewrite the poll history of the state. To set the ball rolling, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will carry out a state-wide tour from next week onwards and meet important personalities, social leaders and religious heads. The party has asked its cadres not to get victory into their heads and utilise the next three months to the maximum to ensure continuance of the government. “Situation is conducive for continuance of power. We will continue our welfare and development measures with more vigour and commitment. Results have shown there is no room for slander and unnecessary controversies,” said party acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan. He said during the state-wide tour, the CM will interact with a cross section of the people and discuss the state’s resource utilization and developmental issues. In Delhi, party general secretary Sitaram Yechury also said situation was favourable for the LDF to continue in power and the party will do everything possible to ensure this. Kerala is the only state where the CPI (M) is in power. The party has also asked the government to continue its food kit distribution for at least three more months. The government has also decided to increase the monthly welfare pension to Rs 1500 from January onwards. “Next three months are crucial for the government. We will continue all welfare measures. Let opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala raise more allegations, they will only cement our victory,” said state law minister A K Balan adding people were more concerned about their day to day life not a series of trumped up charges. The government has also decided to earmark enough funds for sops and big-ticket infrastructure development projects. The CM has also asked all departments to submit a progress report of all ongoing projects. The Left Front’s next manifesto will be based on suggestions and remarks of dignitaries the CM will be meeting on his state-wide tour, said Vijayaraghavan. He said workers were given special instructions to avoid controversies and do enough grassroot work involving local people. In the fiercely-contested local body election out of 941 panchayats, LDF won 514 and UDF 375, 152 block panchayats LDF 108 and UDF 44 and in 6 corporations LDF won in four and in Kochi it is a fractured verdict. The Congress-led UDF managed to win only the Kannur Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-victory-in-local-civic-body-polls-ruling-cpi-m-eyes-assembly-election-in-kerala/story-cUPsp7qZxxmhEwLOy9UUwJ.html

The facility of Wistron Corporation, which manufactures iPhone, is located at Narasapura Industrial Area of Kolar district, 51 kilometres from Bengaluru, India’s tech and investment hub. The vandalism by the workers — setting cars on fire, breaking windows, doors etc — raised concerns as it could impact investment in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his concern, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa said.A week later, the government submitted its report probing what caused the violence and why the workers were disgruntled.Here is what happened:1. Over 150 people were arrested in connection with the violence.2. As industry bodies termed the incident as a blot in the industry-friendly image of Karnataka, the Centre asked the state government to expedite its inquiry. 3. The department for promotion of industry and internal trade asked the state government to ensure that the “investor sentiment is not affected due to such one-off incident”.4. The Karnataka government in its probe has said that the unit could not manage the increased operation. The plant became operational earlier this year. There were 5,000 workers initially. But the number rose to 10,500, according to Karnataka factories department report.5. The HR department has not been adequately set up with personnel of sound knowledge of labour laws, resulting in various violations.6. In October, the plant introduced 12-hour shift replacing the earlier eight-hour shift. There were glitches in attendance system as well.7. Wistron on December 19 decided to remove the vice-president who was in-charge of business in India. In a statement, it has apologised for the payment delays and said some restructuring measures are being taken so that this does not happen again.8. The unit was shut following the rampage but the authorities are hopeful that it could restart function in a few days,9. Wistron said no manufacturing equipment has been damaged, though it lost in the range of New Taiwan Dollar 100 to 200 million, which is about Rs 52 crore. 10. As per a statement issued by Apple, it is putting Wistron on probation and the company is not going to receive any new business from Apple till corrective measures are enforced and completed.

19-12-2020||India||‘Each and every test done in Delhi is true and genuine’: Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday when the Capital witnessed a rise in the cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) people advised him to reduce the number of tests or indulge in fudging the results but his government did not pay heed to such unethical advice. “Once cases started going up people started wrongly advising me to reduce testing or fraudulently improve testing results,” Kejriwal said during a press conference. Without naming any particular state, Kejriwal said that people who advised him to fudge the numbers were influenced by instances of other regions indulging in unfair testing practices. States fraudulently improved results to show they have successfully controlled the spread of the virus, he claimed. “A video from another state showed one doctor swabbing his nose for 50 negative test samples,” he added. The number of Covid-19 cases in the Capital stands at 614,775 as of Friday. According to the bulletin issued by the Delhi health department on Friday, 88,400 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, out of which 48,180 are RT-PCR tests and 40,220 rapid antigen tests.The Delhi chief minister made similar comments on Twitter on Wednesday, while responding to a report of fake names being registered in order to show increased Covid-19 testing in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly. “Yogi ji, the great work on our corona is being discussed in the street mohallas of UP. Like you, we do not do fake corona tests. Manish ji is coming to Lucknow to debate on 22 December at the invitation of your minister,” he had tweeted. Emphasising that his government’s goal was to get the coronavirus disease under control, Kejriwal said by keeping people’s well being in mind and not increasing numbers the Delhi government soldiered on and now the positivity rate has come down to 1.3% as opposed to 15.26% in November. “If we commit fraud, how will we rein in this disease? How will we properly test and isolate people?” Kejriwal asked. Kejriwal thanked all healthcare workers for sticking to ethical practices as per his instructions and lauded them. “I instructed all the doctors and officers against such acts because numbers are not important for us, people’s lives and health are important. Each and every test done in Delhi is true and genuine. We did not commit any frauds, I salute my doctors for their efforts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/each-and-every-test-done-in-delhi-is-true-and-genuine-arvind-kejriwal/story-vI9fSfCcs0DMbc8abujmxO.html

19-12-2020||India||On Bengal trip, Amit Shah takes veiled dig at Mamata’s Trinamool||Union home minister Amit Shah, who is on a two-day visit to West Bengal, launched a veiled attack against the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress for trying to brand Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders as “outsiders”. “Today, in Bengal, those who resort to narrow politics, I would like to tell them that (freedom fighter and martyr) Khudiram Bose belongs to India as much as he belongs to Bengal. Ram Prasad Bismil (freedom fighter and martyr) belongs to Bengal as much as he belongs to Uttar Pradesh,” Shah said, while speaking to media after meeting Bose’s family members and garlanding the freedom fighter’s statue at his ancestral home in East Midnapore district. Khudiram Bose was the youngest revolutionary freedom fighter who was executed on August 11, 1908 for his role in the Muzaffarpur conspiracy case. On December 19, 1927, freedom fighters Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq Ulla Khan and Thakur Roshan Singh were martyred. “These freedom fighters never thought of such narrow politics. Today is their martyr’s day (Bismil, Khan and Singh). We should transcend above such narrow politics,” the Union minister said. Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee and other leaders of her party have been desperately trying to brand the BJP as an outsider trying to come and rule Bengal, and have even tagged them as “Dacoits from Chambal”. “India can never forget the contribution of Bengal and her sons in the freedom struggle. Bose was a bearer of the tradition who kissed the gallows with a Gita in his hand while fighting the British. His popularity across India was such that some people wrote his name in their dhotis, which became a symbol of freedom struggle and inspiration for the youth of Bengal. His slogan of Vande Mataram on his way to the gallows became a slogan of freedom struggle,” Shah said while also saluting Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq Ulla Khan and Thakur Roshan Singh. “I am fortunate that I could come at the birthplace of Khudiram Bose and touch the soil with my forehead,” he added. Shah also offered prayers at the Siddheshwari Temple in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-bengal-trip-amit-shah-takes-veiled-dig-at-mamata-s-trinamool/story-pBZiM54NqBfH3dRZpFPH2M.html

Singh, whose son Brijendra is a sitting BJP MP, said it was his moral responsibility to stand with the farmers who he said are “worried” as they fear the new legislations will have an “impact” on their economic condition.“Whatever I have achieved in politics, would not have been possible had I not been the grandson of Sir Chhotu Ram,” Singh said on Friday.“Therefore, it is my moral responsibility to stand with the farmers in their fight today and, therefore, I have decided to support this (farmers’) fight,” said Singh, a prominent Jat leader in Haryana.Singh further said that he along with his supporters will soon observe a symbolic hunger strike in Haryana’s districts bordering Delhi. Under the banner of Chaudhary Chhotu Ram Vichar Manch, the former Union minister along with his supporters had sat on a protest at Rohtak on Friday.Farmers from different parts of the country, including Haryana and Punjab, have been camping at various border points of Delhi for three weeks to demand a repeal of the farm laws.Farmers worry these laws will eliminate the safety net of the Minimum Support Price (MSP), do away with mandi system and will leave them at the “mercy of big corporates”, apprehensions the government has been insisting are misplaced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-and-ex-union-minister-birender-singh-extends-support-to-farmers-agitation/story-JZ1KA2ooFddzzNiSt6uwpN.html
19-12-2020||India||Court orders release of 2 brothers held under anti-conversion law||An Uttar Pradesh court has ordered the release of two brothers who were arrested earlier this month under the anti-conversion law, an official said on Saturday. The Muslim man and his brother were arrested on December 4 after they visited the registrar’s office in Moradabad to record his marriage to a Hindu woman, whose family filed a complaint. A video purportedly showed Bajrang Dal activists asking the couple if the woman had given notice to the district magistrate over her intention to change her religion, a requirement under the new ordinance. The Kanth police had submitted a report that it could not find evidence of the case after Pinki denied the allegations of forceful conversion by Rashid and his brother Salim, following which the chief judicial magistrate ordered the release of the two from jail, prosecuting officer Amar Tiwari said. The jailor of the district jail, Manish, said they had received the releasing order and the two would be be released later in the day. Meanwhile, the mother-in-law alleged that Pinki suffered miscarriage after she was tortured at the government shelter home. The recently-promulgated Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance nullifies marriages if they are carried out for the sole purpose of religious conversion. The state government had on November 24 approved the draft ordinance, which provides for a jail term of up to 10 years for violators. It was promulgated amid assertions by BJP leaders that a strict law was needed against “love jihad”, a term coined by right-wing activists to discredit interfaith marriages by describing it as part of an alleged conspiracy by Muslim men to convert Hindu women in the guise of love. The Allahabad High Court had asked the state government on Friday to respond to a petition challenging the ordinance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/love-jihad-court-orders-release-of-2-brothers-held-under-anti-conversion-law/story-61ccQb1LxjtY4Upj3HMVUJ.html
19-12-2020||India||India is ready for any situation: Rajnath Singh over Ladakh row||Defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday China’s attitude towards India during the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic shows the intention of the neighbouring country. While noting the military and diplomatic attempts to resolve the current stand-off between the two neighbours in Ladakh, Singh asserted that India wants peace but pointed out that any harm to the country’s self-esteem will not be tolerated.“We are fully prepared to deal with any situation. We have shown that this is no longer our weak India. This is a new India that has the capacity to respond to any kind of transgression, aggression or any kind of unilateral action on the borders,” Singh added.The defence minister was addressing the newly-graduated cadets of Indian Air Force after attending the combined graduation parade at the Airforce Academy in Dundigal during his two-day visit to Telangana. The minister spoke about the history of the air force and its achievements. “The Indian Air Force has a glorious history. It has always displayed episodes of gallantry. From the Battle of Longewala in 1971 to the recent Balakot airstrikes, all these episodes will be considered as golden chapters in our country’s history,” he added.The minister while remembering flying officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon and his sacrifice defending the Srinagar airbase against the Pakistan air force said that this year marks the golden jubilee of India’s war with Pakistan in 1971. Sekhon was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India’s highest military decoration during wartime, in recognition of his defence of the Srinagar airbase in 1971. He said this is the year to remember all the warriors who wrote the story of valour and might for India and many heroes who have sacrificed their lives for the country.मैं मानता हूँ कि आने वाले दिनों में Defence केवल जल-थल-वायु की रक्षा तक ही सीमित नहीं रहेगा। यह एक ऐसा dynamic challenge होगा जिसके लिए हमें आने वाले दिनों में खुद को तैयार करना होगा: रक्षा मंत्रीThe minister, who was the chief guest and the reviewing officer at the parade, also told the newly-graduated cadets of IAF that the plans for airtime defence and maritime forces have reached an advanced stage and will facilitate the forces to work in an integrated and comprehensive manner. He also said, “While we have induced and operationalised the indigenous ‘Light Combat Aircraft’ Tejas, we have also included the second and Fifth Generation Multirole fighter plane, the Rafale. This has increased the capabilities of the Airforce as well as a new confidence in the Airforce.”“I once again wish you all a bright future. I am confident that you will make your trainers, parents and the whole country proud of your achievements. A golden future awaits you. I wish you all, a bright future and happy landings,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-ready-for-any-situation-rajnath-singh-over-ladakh-row/story-yVScrtRCk37kqw37feH5zJ.html

The defence minister recalled the recent aggression by China despite the coronavirus pandemic. “When the country was passing through difficult times of the Covid-19 pandemic, China displayed its poor intentions at the border. But we have proved to them that India is not a weak nation and have given them a befitting reply,” Singh said. He reminded that India had received a lot of appreciation from various countries for its posture during the stand-off with China. The defence minister said India always believed in dialogue and peace. “As of now, both the nations are amid bilateral and diplomatic talks. I am repeating again, we do not want conflict but only peace. But we will not tolerate if there is any harm done to the nation’s sovereignty. In that case, we are well equipped for giving a strong reply,” Singh said. Taking a dig at Pakistan, he said the neighbouring country had not learnt a lesson despite losing four wars with India. “It is still fighting proxy wars with India through sponsoring terrorism,” he alleged. Stating that the Indian armed forces were fighting a relentless battle against terrorism, Singh called upon the forces to be prepared to wage any kind of war, be it on ground, air and water. “There is also another threat in the form of Cyber war. We have to be prepared to face it,” he said. The Union minister lauded the services of the Indian Air Force stating that it had been doing a commendable job in fighting the enemy and protecting the integrity of the country. The arrival of the Rafael aircraft has reinforced the strength of IAF and enhanced its self-confidence, he said. After inspecting the passing out parade, the defence minister conferred the ‘President’s Commission’ to the graduating trainees. The ceremony included presentation of ‘Wings’ and ‘Brevets’ to the Flight Cadets. First in the Order of Merit was flying officer Aishish Khateri, who was awarded the Chief of the Air Staff Sword of Honour for excelling in overall training by the defence minister. The event also had an aerobatic display by the SU-30 aircraft, the famous Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team, Sarang Helicopter Display Team, Pilatus PC-7 trainer and a flypast by formations of PC-7, Kiran and Hawk aircraft. Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy and Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria also took part in the combined graduation parade ceremony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-not-weak-won-t-tolerate-any-aggression-rajnath-singh-at-iaf-graduation-parade/story-2PoDoBnZWFcwlh1segJiQK.html

Kejriwal said Delhi saw the first wave of Covid-19 in June, the second in August-September, and the third strong wave towards the end of October and November. He also said that pollution induced by stubble burning led to the third wave of coronavirus in November.“It appears that the third wave of Covid-19 in Delhi is now ending. Around 90,000 daily tests are being conducted in Delhi today. This is the highest number of daily tests in the country,” he said while addressing a press conference.Talking about the tests, Kejriwal took an aim at other states as well. “When Covid cases started increasing here, some told me that the number of tests should be decreased or to commit fraud in testing. Similar fraud was being committed at other places to show a lower number of cases. I instructed doctors and officers that the lives of people are most important,” he said.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief thanked frontline warriors, the central government and the people of Delhi for their cooperation. “With the efforts of the people of Delhi, we have effectively and successfully surpassed the third wave of Corona. I salute Covid-19 warriors, frontline workers; thank Centre, political parties, religious institutions for cooperation,” he said.He also warned the people of Delhi, advised them to be vigilant and observe all safety norms. “We can’t afford to be complacent about Covid-19 situation in Delhi.”CM Kejriwal compared Delhi’s Covid-19 tally with that of Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat where he said the daily test numbers are at 670 per 1 million population and 800 per 1 million population, respectively.Delhi on Friday recorded 1,418 new coronavirus disease cases with over 88,000 tests being conducted and the positivity rate stood at 1.6%, as per authorities.

Notice was also issued to one Vinit Goenka, a BJP functionary, who had alleged the firm had taken financial consideration to promote the alleged tweet.Twitter India, in its plea, had said in the past months, Goenka and his supporters have held webinars asking for Twitter to be declared a terrorist organisation, for its officers to be charged with sedition and to encourage a mass filing of cases against Twitter and its employees.Senior advocate Sajjan Poovayya, who appeared for Twitter India, contended that there cannot be multiple FIRs for one incident and sought directions to quash them.Poovayya said Twitter India has no control over the content on the Twitter website and that the same is monitored by the Twitter Inc based in the USA.Multiple FIRs were filed against Twitter Inc in eight states for allegedly promoting the tweet of one Gurpatwant Singh Pannum on ‘Khalistan’.

Vivek Doval had filed a defamation case against Ramesh and Caravan Magazine for their alleged defamatory statements and articles against him. He has accepted Ramesh’s apology. Vivek Doval had filed the defamation case against Ramesh, as well as The Caravan and journalist Kaushal Shroff, after the article The D Companies was published in the magazine. The court had taken cognizance of Doval’s criminal defamation complaint in January 2019 and Ramesh was granted bail in May 2019. Defamation proceedings against The Caravan and Shroff will continue.Ramesh said while tendering the apology that his remarks were based on a news article and said “perhaps some independent verification may have been in order.” The matter was heard by additional chief metropolitan magistrate Sachin Gupta on Saturday. Also read | Court grants bail to Jairam Ramesh in defamation caseThe Congress leader had, in a press conference on January 17, 2019, made certain statements against Vivek Doval, his family and his business venture GNA Asia Fund. “I understand these statements have hurt you deeply.

As the case progressed, I realized that perhaps some independent verification may have been in order. However, the General Elections were close, and the questions raised in the article seemed appropriate for being highlighted in public. In retrospect, I may have gone overboard in making certain insinuations against you and your family,” Ramesh said in his letter to Vivek.“Thus, I would like to offer my apologies to you and your family for any hurt the statements have caused. I would also urge the INC to remove the press conference from the press releases available on their website,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jairam-ramesh-apologises-to-vivek-doval-in-defamation-case-says-may-have-gone-overboard/story-9HDIugrxeuxa0gGyFjNYeM.html
19-12-2020||India||NGT extends time for constitution of biodiversity management committees||The National Green Tribunal has extended the time limit for the constitution of biodiversity management committees (BMCs) and preparation of people’s biodiversity registers (PBRs) on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel was assured by the member secretary of the National Biodiversity Authority that monitoring will be faithfully conducted with all the state biodiversity boards concerned and necessary steps for compliance of law will be taken. “We also find that in view of Covid situation, it will be necessary to take a liberal view about the delay caused. Accordingly, the time for remaining compliances is extended up to June 30, 2021, and compensation amounts will stand waived if compliances are ensured by that date,” the bench said. The green panel noted that it has already monitored the matter for the last more than four years and there is substantial progress in compliance with the requirements of setting up BMCs and maintaining PBRs. The order was passed after some states sought extension of time on account of the pandemic and also waiver of the requirement to pay compensation for the delay. The NGT noted that India is one of the recognised mega-diverse countries of the world, harbouring nearly seven to eight per cent of the recorded species of the world, and representing four of the 34 globally identified biodiversity hotspots. “So far, over 91,200 species of animals and 45,500 species of plants have been documented in the 10 biogeographic regions of the country. The indigenous and local community are a repository of traditional knowledge and their knowledge and practices help in conservation and sustainable development of the biodiversity,” the tribunal said. “In the past, India has already faced biopiracy. There is, thus, urgent need to document the knowledge of the local community in the form of PBR,” it added. The NGT was earlier informed by a monitoring committee formed by it that as against 2,52,709 panchayats where biodiversity management committees were to be constituted, a total of 1,44,371 BMCs have been formed, which shows a gap of more than one lakh. With respect to people’s biodiversity registers, 6,834 have been documented so far and another 1,814 are in progress, it had noted. The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by Pune resident Chandra Bhal Singh seeking implementation of provisions of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 and Biological Diversity Rules, 2004. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 aims to preserve biological diversity in India and provides mechanism for equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of traditional biological resources and knowledge. “The blatant non-compliance of the provisions of the said act and rules has frustrated the whole efforts of enacting such a legislation owing to the International obligation of India while being a signatory to the Rio Declaration and Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992,” the plea had said. It was alleged that various states in the country have failed to give proper attention to the unique biodiversity prevalent in India and they have also not undertaken their statutory obligations with “seriousness and have remained oblivious in discharging the statutory provision in last couple of years”. Seeking constitution of biodiversity management committees at the local level in every state under Section 41 of the Biological Biodiversity Act, 2002, the plea claimed that several state biodiversity boards have not constituted a BMC at the local level “for the purpose of promoting conservation, sustainable use and documentation of biological diversity”. It further said the People’s Biodiversity Register, a document which records diversity of flora and fauna, has not been prepared and maintained by the Biodiversity Management Committee in some of the states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-extends-time-for-constitution-of-biodiversity-management-committees/story-kayvufd6tXY8PK99cGJuWL.html

Gupta, who is the latest in a long line of leaders to have left the Congress, confirmed to Hindustan Times that she has resigned from her post and quit the national party. Congress has been battling mass defections and internal dissension, with 23 senior leaders asking for a massive organizational overhaul. Repeated losses in the recent elections, from Bihar assembly to local body polls, have left the party scrambling.Interim president Sonia Gandhi is meeting party leaders on Saturday to discuss organizational changes, party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said on Friday.Gupta has laid the blame at the door of general secretary (organization) KC Venugopal, who is known to be a close confidante of former party chief Rahul Gandhi. In her message, Gupta states that Venugopal is responsible for continuous delays in organizational changes and the matter cannot always be escalated to the level of the party president. “Dear all, I am writing to you to announce that I have resigned. As you know, important organisational changes have remained pending for very long: the national committee took 1 year 3 months; state president orders have remained pending for months. Many other state units are waiting for reorganisation to make space for new activists. These continuing delays by the GS(O) are damaging the organisation but in the present circumstances, it is not possible to escalate repeatedly to Congress President. The situation has thus become untenable,” she wrote in her resignation message.“Thank you all for your hard work, especially in these difficult times of the pandemic. I want to make sure that your hard work is not lost in the transition and will be sending a write-up on each of you to Rahul ji. My best wishes for all your future endeavours,” Gupta added. HT reached out to Venugopal for a response via text message but did not receive a reply immediately. In her article in Hindu on Saturday, Gupta said that the party needs to address issues of party organization, address grassroots level connect and establish a strong top-down leadership.“None of the above can be done without a strong and interventionist Congress President. Political parties — the Congress in particular — are defined as much by internal conflicts as external. Politics is dynamic with constantly opening and closing pathways to power. Without a strong leader at the top to take and enforce decisions, the Party will continue to be pulled in different directions,” Gupta wrote. “Moreover, only the active facilitation of the Congress President can create space for substantive deliberation required right now — both as a political process to draw everyone together and to form a political platform expansive enough to accommodate the Congress’s historical big tent positioning.”She added that the “this leadership can only be provided by Rahul Gandhi”. “This is not a sycophantic statement — if any other leader had to emerge in the party, he would have done so over the last year. Instead, different factions prefer status quo rather than allowing one group to ascend and upset the balance of power for everyone. Organisational power thus continues to reside in Mr Gandhi.

19-12-2020||India||India waits for Pakistan to end terror before resumption of dialogue||When Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an impromptu landing at the Lahore airport on December 25, 2015, he hugged his then counterpart Nawaz Sharif who had come to receive him. During his four-hour visit, Sharif recalled that his mother Begum Shamin Akhtar had told him that Modi was a good man after she saw the Indian PM on Indian television news channels taking the blessings of his mother Heeraben by touching her feet. PM Modi met Sharif’s mother at a family function in Raiwind near Lahore and exchanged notes with her. Sharif sent an embroidered shawl for Heeraben, which was duly reciprocated by PM Modi for the then Pakistan PM’s mother with Indian High Commission scouring the entire security locked Lahore to secure a gift. It was this gesture of warmth that stuck with PM Modi who condoled the demise of Sharif’s mother Shamim Akhtar on November 22, 2020, by writing a letter to the former PM. The letter was conveyed to Nawaz Sharif through his politician daughter Maryam Nawaz by an Indian diplomat based in Pakistan. “I recall my interaction with her during my brief visit to Lahore in 2015. Her simplicity and warmth were indeed very touching,” wrote PM Modi in his condolence message.Although political detractors of PM Modi accuse him of reaping electoral benefits for blaming Islamabad time and again, the condolence letter shows that India has no ill-will towards the civilian, democratically elected leadership in Pakistan.At a launch of a book on Friday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar made it clear that for India to engage in a dialogue with Pakistan, the neighbouring country must put an end to cross-border terrorism. “As far as PM Modi is concerned, we have shown a lot of clarity that they (Pakistan) can’t continue with terrorism and then expect diplomacy to carry on,” he said at the function. This is no different from the message conveyed by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to his then Pakistan counterpart Nasser Janjua in Bangkok before PM Modi visited Lahore on December 25, 2015.Also read | 4 out of every 5 Pak citizens believe country headed in wrong direction: ReportDoval told Janjua that India will deal with terror but Pakistan must give a commitment that there would be no state protection to the proscribed anti-India terrorist groups in that country. However, the entire bold Indian diplomacy of December 2015 came to a nought with Pakistan based Jaish-e-Mohammed group targeting the Pathankot airbase within a week of PM Modi’s Lahore visit. Documents recovered from the terrorists revealed that the foiled terror attack was planned on the day PM Modi landed at Lahore, showing that the Pakistan deep state was totally opposed to any détente with India and was using Islamists to scuttle any rapprochement.Today, with the Pakistani deep state and army controlling the levers of political power in Islamabad, the Indian establishment is at a loss of a committed and credible interlocutor in the Islamic Republic who has the power to defang the terrorist groups. It is quite evident to the Indian leadership that Pakistan army will not allow any civilian leader to have a dialogue with New Delhi to normalise bilateral relations. Nawaz Sharif tried it twice and failed. His daughter Maryam is now being painted as an Indian agent and there is clearly a threat to her life. Also read | Nearly half of China’s investments in India’s neighbourhood went to PakistanInstead, the Pakistani leadership time and again cries wolf over non-existent impending surgical strikes by the Indian Army in an effort to defame India as an aggressor and reiterate the tired nuclear flashpoint theory. Statement to this effect by Pakistan’s foreign minister in the UAE, duly tweeted by National Security Advisor, on Friday is a case in point.Fact is that the Indian retaliation in the form of surgical strikes in occupied Kashmir and air strikes at Balakot in Manshera came only as a response to terror attacks by Pakistan based proscribed groups after the complicity of Rawalpindi GHQ was established by Indian security agencies.The Pakistani alarm from a non-existent surgical strike came after India was totally unfazed by a Sino-Pak air combat exercise across the Gujarat border in Sindh province earlier this month. The two iron brothers also signed a defence MoU during the visit of Chinese defence minister and State Councillor General Wei Fenghe to Islamabad.Given that Pakistan under PM Imran Khan Niazi is behaving like a tributary state to the Middle Kingdom and proscribed terrorist groups continue to spew poison against India, New Delhi’s desire to have normal ties with all its neighbours will remain an unfulfilled dream.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-waits-for-pakistan-to-end-terror-before-resumption-of-dialogue/story-jEYKFtS5EMltHSfJmKSBwI.html

There is no scope for negative, divisive and anti-national forces in the state, which is the ultimate truth. It has been proved time and again in the state,” he said.“I take full responsibility of preserving the environment while implementing development projects in the state,” Sawant added.Several protesters blocked the railway track at Arossim village in the early hours of Saturday against the track-doubling project of South Western Railway, saying that the move was aimed at facilitating private companies to transport coal. They said that the government was allowing the state to be turned into a coal hub.Several NGOs and political parties have been opposing the project claiming that it is being done by cutting trees in Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and the National Park to help the coal handling companies transport the raw material from Mormugao Port Trust to their plants in Karnataka.During the function, Sawant further said that the state government helped the citizens during Covid-19 pandemic by providing essential services, health care facilities to them, besides assisting farmers and conducting school examination, among other things.“The sincere attempts of the state government were acknowledged by the people, which was reflected in the results of the recently-held Zilla Panchayat elections (where BJP won most of the seats),” he said.The chief minister said the government has embarked on a mission to make Goa self-sustainable through its flagship ‘Swayampurna Goa’ programme.He acknowledged the contribution of freedom fighters, health workers and frontline Covid-19 warriors during the speech.Union Minister of State for AYUSH Shripad Naik, Goa Legislative Assembly Speaker Rajesh Patnekar were present for the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cm-seeks-to-allay-fears-surrounding-track-doubling-project/story-EwVhLnDVohwgzaeoTQHqTI.html

Taking to Twitter on Saturday, the Delhi Traffic Police alerted commuters about the closure of certain roads and suggested them to take alternative routes.It said the Ghazipur border is closed for traffic coming from Noida and Ghaziabad due to the ongoing protest.However, those travelling to Delhi can take alternative routes via Anad Vihar, DND, Apsara and Bhopra borders, it said. “Tikri, Dhansa Borders are closed for any Traffic Movement. Jhatikara Borders is open only for two wheelers and pedestrian movement,” it said in a tweet.However, for those travelling to Haryana, the Delhi Traffic Police said some borders are opened -- the Jharoda border (only for single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera.The Chilla border between Noida and Delhi is open for traffic but just one carriageway. However, the other carriageway from Noida to Delhi is closed, according to the traffic police. “Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Sabholi & Mangesh borders are closed. Please take alternate routes via Lampur, Safiabad & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road,” the traffic police said.“Please avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK road, NH-44,” it tweeted. Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at various border of Delhi for almost four weeks now as formal talks between the government and representatives of farmers’ unions remained deadlocked with protesting peasants refusing to accept anything less than a repeal of the newly enacted laws. The farmers have been saying these new laws will pave the way for a dismantling of the Minimum Support Price mechanism and the mandi system, leaving them to the “mercy” of big corporates, apprehensions the government insists are misplaced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protesting-farmers-steadfast-in-their-demands-as-delhi-temperature-plummets-to-season-s-lowest-yet/story-uBtWlg73a8vvPdJpHXP7UN.html

Shah arrived in Kolkata late on Friday night and is scheduled to camp in the poll-bound state for the next two days, during which he will visit two districts, address a rally, hold a road show, have lunch with families of a farmer and a baul singer, and visit Visva Bharati in Santiniketan. “Today I am very happy and fortunate that I am visiting a place which inspires not just Indians but the entire world. This is the birthplace of Swami Vivekananda. Swamiji, during his life, had spread India’s knowledge and culture to the entire world. He acquainted the entire world with universal brotherhood through his speech at the parliament of religions in USA. He was the person who tied modernism with spiritualism. He urged India to worship Bharat mata. Within 50 years, India achieved Independence. Swamiji’s values hold the same relevance today as that time,” Shah said. An 11-member team comprising BJP leaders such as national vice president Mukul Roy, state president Dilip Ghosh and national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya were there with Shah. The Union minister, however, didn’t respond to any media queries. Meanwhile, TMC supporters staged a protest on Sukhiya Street, less than two kilometres away. Top BJP leaders in the state had earlier said that Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda would visit West Bengal every month till the elections, slated for early-2021. While Shah had come to West Bengal in early-November, Nadda was on a two-day visit last week. Some former TMC leaders, who have resigned from the party in the last 72 hours, are expected to join the BJP at Shah’s rally in East Midnapore. The buzz is that former TMC heavyweight Suvendu Adhikary could join the BJP during Shah’s visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-begins-2-day-bengal-trip-with-visit-to-swami-vivekananda-s-house/story-tNA30kMd8WfjhgAsEhlv5I.html

The farmers’ protests entered day 24 on Saturday as the stalemate between the Centre and agitating farmers continued.Meanwhile, Congress on Friday said the government should stop “deceiving and betraying” the farmers. Party president from Haryana Kumari Selja said, “Farmers of the country have been forced to protest on the borders of national Capital in bitter cold for the last three weeks. But the government is not ready to listen to them under the pressure from the capitalists.”She also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) of spreading misconceptions about the farmers’ protest and accused the party of engaging in politics of division. “The BJP wants to turn farmers into labourers, which cannot be tolerated. The BJP had promised to implement the recommendations of Swaminathan Commission report. It promised to double the income of farmers, but not a single promise has been fulfilled”, she said.Widespread protests are taking place against the three laws— Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. While Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has assured that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism will stay, farmers believe the laws will put them at the mercy of corporate farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/find-content-on-how-agro-reforms-help-farmers-on-namo-app-tweets-pm-modi/story-wUAhanXnjWjoBxnSA5YpUJ.html

Ghulam Nabi Azad, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and one of the 23 Congress leaders who wrote to Gandhi earlier this year seeking a complete overhaul of the organisation as well as internal elections from top to bottom, and another letter writer, Anand Sharma, reached the 10 Janpath residence of the party chief for the meeting. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and state Congress president Kamal Nath, and senior leaders Ambika Soni, AK Antony and P Chidambaram were also attending the meeting. Former Union ministers and letter writers Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda (a part of the group of 23 leaders), the Congress general secretary incharge of Punjab, Harish Rawat, and the party’s interim treasurer, Pawan Kumar Bansal, too, reached Gandhi’s residence.

19-12-2020||India||Why Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat cautioned Nepal about China’s footprint||In a remark aimed at China, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat this week advised Nepal against signing off on loans from other countries in the region and nudged Kathmandu to learn from Sri Lanka’s experience which had signed agreements with “other countries in the region”, a pointed reference to Chinese financial institutions that have quietly extended billions of dollars in loans to developing countries that has been used to gain strategic leverage.In his keynote address at an online event hosted by a Nepal think tank, Gen Rawat underscored the deep and extensive ties between New Delhi and Kathmandu before pointing out that Nepal was opening to other countries including China based on its independent foreign policy.“Nepal is free to act independently in international affairs but must be vigilant and learn from Sri Lanka and other nations which have also signed agreements with other countries in the region,” India’s top military officer said.Also Watch | ‘Learn from Sri Lanka’: CDS Gen Bipin Rawat cautions Nepal on ties with ChinaSri Lanka is just one example. It had to hand over the port of Hambantota to China on a 99-year lease in 2017 after struggling to pay debts incurred from its construction executed by Chinese companies. The $3.3 billion debt outstanding to China is only one part of Lanka’s financial mess made worse by borrowings from international markets by successive governments. Lanka, however, isn’t the only one. A senior Indian government official said China had extended loans to the tune of at least $31 billion to five South Asian countries; Pakistan, Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.“These are the reported figures but the real figure could be much higher,” the official said.No one really knows the real figures since Chinese lenders forbid governments from revealing the numbers. Zambia, the first African country to default on its debts since the pandemic, said, according to a report in the Guardian, asset and fund managers wanted transparency over its estimated $3 billion debt to Chinese lenders who had barred them from giving out the details unless recipients of this information sign confidentiality pacts.Zambia has been careening toward a debt debacle for months, even years. Now it has become the first African nation to default on sovereign payments since the pandemic began.A study published in the Harvard Business Review in February this year estimates that nearly 50 per cent of the loans extended by Chinese institutions were not reported. It concluded that the Chinese state and its subsidiaries have lent about $1.5 trillion in direct loans to more than 150 countries around the globe.This makes China into the world’s largest official creditor surpassing traditional, official lenders such as the World Bank, the IMF, or all OECD creditor governments combined, the study said.Add the portfolio debts and trade credits to buy goods and services, and the Chinese government’s aggregate claims to the rest of the world exceed $5 trillion. That implies countries worldwide owe more than 6% of world GDP in debt to China as of 2017, it said.In South Asia, however, it isn’t Sri Lanka but Pakistan and Bangladesh that have taken the biggest loans from China.Bangladesh owes $ 4.7 billion to China and has sought $18 billion in loan on a concessional and preferential basis to implement mega projects. China did promise $ 24 billion in loans a few years ago but has, by July 2019, disbursed only $981, according to the Diplomat website.Pakistan is estimated to have already borrowed $ 22 billion for its mega projects including the China Pakistan Economic Corridor that Prime Minister Imran Khan had questioned before he was voted to power. This week, Islamabad picked up $1 billion more to pay the second instalment of a $3 billion soft loan. Next month, it expects the third instalment to repay Riyadh.For now, the State Bank of Pakistan underplays concerns around Chinese debt, insisting that the loan for CPEC is only about $5.8 billion, which accounts for only 5.3 per cent of Pakistan’s total foreign debt of 110 $ bn.It is Maldives that is worried that the previous Abdulla Yameen regime may have dragged the Indian Ocean island chain into a debt trap. Former president Mohamed Nasheed, now speaker of parliament, has announced that the Chinese debt bill was in the vicinity of $3.1 billion including government-to-government loans, the money given to state enterprises and private sector loans guaranteed by the Maldivian government.Analysts said Maldives may struggle to repay the Chinese loans by 2022-23 given how the $4.9 billion economy was struggling due to drop in tourism revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-chief-of-defence-staff-bipin-rawat-cautioned-nepal-about-china-s-footprint/story-Kts0UwJLTaZqq9aTxyVYON.html

Poonawalla, who made the comments during a virtual panel discussion on the challenges to vaccine development, said it is because such issues could potentially increase fear against getting vaccinated and also “bankrupt or distract” companies making these shots. He said his company plans to propose this to the government.“We need to have the government indemnify manufacturers, especially vaccine manufacturers, against all lawsuits. In fact, COVAX and other countries have already started talking about that,” he said on Friday during Carnegie India’s Global Technology Summit. “This is especially important only during a pandemic to indemnify vaccine manufacturers against lawsuits for severe adverse effects or any other frivolous claims which may come about because that adds to the fear (about vaccines),” he added.Also read | Expert panel seeks more data from Serum Institute of India, Bharat BiotechThe government, Poonawalla said, should bring a law as it would help companies focus on developing and manufacturing the vaccines rather than having to address legal issues. “The government can act. The US, for example, has in fact invoked a law, to say that during a pandemic and this is especially important only during a pandemic to indemnify vaccine manufacturers against lawsuits for severe adverse effects or any other frivolous claims which may come about. Because that adds to the fear and also will bankrupt vaccine manufacturers or distract them if they have to just all day just fight lawsuits and explain to the media what is happening,” he said. Also Watch | How to ensure vaccine reaches every Indian? SII’s Adar Poonawalla answersPoonawalla said that when “frivolous” claims crop up and are blown out of proportion, it affects the confidence of not just people opposed to vaccination but the general public too. “Anyone may have a thought and scepticism then sort of sets in (that) definitely something can happen due to the vaccine … to dispel that, the government needs to step in (with) messaging with influencers to spread, also, the right information,” the CEO of the Pune-based SII said.Also read | 10 million Covid+, but India on recovery roadHis comments came after one of the participants, who had taken SII’s Covishield as part of mid-to late-stage clinical trials to test the safety and immunogenicity of the Covid-19 vaccine in India, sent SII a legal notice seeking Rs 5 crore in compensation. The participant had alleged that the vaccine had caused severe neurological side-effects. SII, however, rejected the charges as “malicious and misconceived” and threatened to sue the participant in excess of Rs 100 crore, according to reports.Also read | Covid-19: When, where and how to receive vaccine?

In India, the vaccine’s trials are being carried out by SII, which is also producing a billion doses of the shot.The expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has sought additional safety and efficacy data from SII and Bharat Biotech for their coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, after deliberating upon their applications seeking authorisation for the shots||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-must-protect-vaccine-makers-against-lawsuits-sii-s-adar-poonawalla/story-fKu7pHjM9wBU247xQ7u7IJ.html

Union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal, who also addressed the chamber on Tuesday, said that the first cut of a genuine single window is likely to ready by March or April 2021 to ease the compliance burden on the industry.Union agriculture and farmers welfare minister Narendra Singh Tomar in his address on Wednesday said that there is an atmosphere of excitement about the new farm laws with lakhs of farmers supporting the ‘’historic reforms’’ in India’s agriculture sector and lauded the chamber for its appeal to end the current impasse on the new agriculture laws.Minister for road, transports and highways Nitin Gadkari in his address announced that India would be tollbooth free in a span of two years.

19-12-2020||India||Man held after Odisha family alleges ‘love jihad’: Police||Police in Odisha’s Jajpur district on Friday arrested a 24-year-old Muslim man on charges of forcibly marrying a 21-year-old woman and raping her repeatedly, officials said.Officials said the woman was rescued from Cuttack on Thursday evening, 12 days after she was allegedly abducted by the man while going to college. Police initiated action against the accused following a complaint by the woman’s father.According to Dharmasala police station inspector-in-charge Saroj Sahoo, the father complained that the accused forcibly married the woman after abducting her on December 5 and then raped her several times over 10 days.“The medical examination has proved that the girl was raped by the accused several times. The victim’s statement was recorded before a judicial magistrate today. The accused youth has been forwarded to judicial custody after his bail was rejected,” said Sahoo. A case under sections 366 and 376(2)(n) of Indian Penal Code has been lodged against the accused.Police on Wednesday arrested the father of the accused after he allegedly threatened the parents of the woman.On December 5, the woman had gone to her college to collect her migration certificate when she was allegedly abducted by the accused. Later in the evening, her mobile phone was found to be switched off. Her father searched for her at various places and later lodged a first information report, or FIR, alleging that the accused abducted his daughter.“He was earlier forcing my daughter to marry him and change her religion. As my daughter refused to do so, he had threatened to abduct her,” the woman’s father said in his FIR. The incident comes in the backdrop of a raging debate over “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing activists to describe marital relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women, though the courts and the Union government do not officially recognise the term. While Hindu right-wing activists claim gullible Hindu women are being coerced into conversion on the false pretext of marriage, many experts reject these allegations and say that adult men and women are free to convert under the constitutional right to freedom of religion.Several Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states are considering laws against such conversions, with Uttar Pradesh being first off the blocks to promulgate an ordinance to that effect. Arabinda Das, in-charge of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Jajpur and Kendrapara unit, said the organisation has registered an FIR in this connection. “There have been many such cases in Jajpur and Kendrapara districts as the number of minorities here are quite large. Many unsuspecting girls are falling prey to such love jihad conspiracies,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-held-after-odisha-family-alleges-love-jihad-police/story-Pe8zj402NQeccE94XxG1DK.html
19-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest latest updates: Rajasthan MP Beniwal resigns from parliamentary panel in support of farmers’ stir||Farmers’ agitation against the three contentious farm laws entered day 24 on Saturday as the impasse between the government and farmers’ unions continues. Amid the ongoing deadlock, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday virtually addressed the farmers of Madhya Pradesh in ‘Kisan Kalyan Sammelan’ which was telecasted across 23,000 villages of the country and at all the district headquarters of Madhya Pradesh. During the hour long address, Prime Minister Modi reiterated his government’s commitment to the welfare of farmers and explained how the three farm laws are a step towards making farmers’ lives better. Towards the conclusion of his speech, PM Modi said the welfare of the farmers is the top priority of the government. “But still after all these, if our farmers have any concern, we will bow our heads in front of them and will listen to what they have to say. Their benefit is our utmost priority,” he said concluding his address.Responding to PM Modi’s address to Madhya Pradesh farmers, a statement from the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee said, “The Prime Minister has launched an open attack on the farmers of India by claiming that they are linked to opposition parties. In place of addressing the issue of repeal of the three Farm Acts which erode farmers’ hold on land and farming and establish the MNCs and big business to grow in agriculture, he has reduced himself to a party leader, undermining his role as a responsible executive head of the country, expected to solve problems.”Also read: Farmers’ protest: Solution hopefully before year ends, says Tomar | 4 key pointsAgriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar in an interview to PTI on Friday said that the government is hopeful of resolving farmers’ agitation before the new year and is continuing its informal dialogue with various groups to diffuse the crisis.

Record foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) during the pandemic is a testimony to the faith that the world now has in India, he said.“Agriculture reforms initiated six months back have started benefitting farmers,” he said without elaborating.BJP leader and ex-Union minister Birender Singh extends support to farmers’ agitationFormer Union minister and senior BJP leader Birender Singh has extended his support to the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three agriculture-marketing laws passed by the Centre. Singh is grandson of Sir Chhotu Ram, a prominent politician during the pre-independence era who championed the interest of farmers. Singh, whose son Brijendra is a sitting BJP MP, said it was his moral responsibility to stand with the farmers who he said are “worried” as they fear the new legislations will have an “impact” on their economic condition.“Whatever I have achieved in politics, would not have been possible had I not been the grandson of Sir Chhotu Ram,” Singh said on Friday.Government needs to resolve farmers’ issue, not Supreme Court: AIKSThe All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) on Friday said the issue of the ongoing farmers’ protests against three new farm laws needs to be resolved by the government and not the Supreme Court. The AIKS, a key member of the “Samyukta Kisan Morcha” that is spearheading the “Dilli Chalo” agitation against the three farm laws, asserted that no farmer organisation approached the court in the first place and asked for its intervention in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-live-updates-december-19-2020/story-ulxXNsoLYaLWOMdhEFFvLP.html
19-12-2020||India||Govt ‘fully responsible’ for burdening this court: Supreme Court||The government is “fully responsible” for burdening this court, a bench of Supreme Court judges said on Friday while hearing an intervention sought in connection with cases on seniority and promotion.The top court bench, headed by justice Sanjay K Kaul, expressed displeasure at multiple petitions filed in appeal against job-related benefits to serving or retired government employees.The Union of India was in appeal before the Supreme Court in two such cases where it was aggrieved by the orders by the high courts. In both these matters, the central administrative tribunal (CAT) had ruled in favour of the employees.In the first matter, the government’s case was argued by additional solicitor general Madhvi Divan for the ministry of defence.This was an appeal against a ruling from the Kerala high court, which affirmed benefits of pay upgradation and seniority in favour of an ex-serviceman, who was now working in a civil post in the navy.As soon as the matter was taken up, the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, put forth its disinclination to entertain the matter.“How many such cases will the government bring before the court? Such a matter, we think, is coming for the third time before us. Will it ever end?” it questioned Divan.As Divan sought to mollify the bench by underscoring the repercussion of the high court order of November 2019 in several other cases, the court told the law officer that this explanation was not good enough.“Government is fully responsible for burdening this court. It takes everything to this court irrespective of the merits of the matter. And we have to then examine everything whether or not it has any merit,” said the bench.The judges then asked Divan: “Here is an officer, who has served you for more than 10 years in the army. Now, he is serving you in another wing, the navy. But you drag him till this court on certain benefits. Why would you do this?”A short while later, another appeal by the government came up, represented by additional solicitor general Jayant Sud.This case pertained to granting benefit of seniority to a customs officer, as had been directed by the Punjab and Haryana high court.Before Sud could even begin, the bench was piqued: “What is this now? Mr Sud, there must be an end to the litigation too. It just cannot go on and on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-fully-responsible-for-burdening-this-court-supreme-court/story-jcW5Ux1IfK6viRRUxJAusI.html
19-12-2020||India||Lawmaker’s vote before conviction is valid: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Friday held that the vote cast by a lawmaker on a day when a court of law convicts them in a criminal case will not be treated as invalid, in a judgement that has far-reaching consequences.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said that the disqualification will follow through from the point in time when the court order convicting and sentencing the legislator was passed and not the entire day.The question came before the court in an election petition filed by rival members of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Indian National Congress (INC) who stood for Rajya Sabha elections from Jharkhand in March 2018.On March 23, 2018, the voting for selecting the candidates to the Rajya Sabha began at 9.15 am. One of the members of the 80-member Jharkhand assembly, Amit Kumar Mahto, belonging to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) cast his vote in favour of Congress candidate Dhiraj Prasad Sahu, who was declared elected. The candidate who lost the election was BJP’s Pradeep Kumar Sonthalia. Later that day, at about 2.30pm, Mahto was convicted by a Ranchi sessions court and sentenced to jail. His conviction disqualified him to continue as a member of the legislative assembly under section 8(3) of Representation of Peoples Act. The losing candidate Sonthalia approached the Jharkhand high court to set aside the election of Sahu on the ground that Mahto’s vote should be treated as invalid. The court dismissed the petition on January 17 this year against which he approached the apex court.“Conviction is the cause and disqualification is the consequence. A consequence can never precede the cause,” the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, concluded, and held the vote cast by Mahto as valid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lawmaker-s-vote-before-conviction-is-valid-supreme-court/story-HWmRrQh1PVirqYblmHQ8rM.html

It said that the contest in the open category must purely be on merit.The bone of contention was the manner in which vacancies under the special classes were to be filled for posts of female constable in Uttar Pradesh. With a policy that all male candidates securing marks more than the cut-offs for the general category will be selected, the same rule was not applicable for women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quota-policy-not-meant-to-deny-merit-says-supreme-court/story-dJoUfv4tIowN85ktyDIv3L.html

The bench was hearing a criminal writ petition filed by Nadeem, from Haridwar, who was booked by UP Police on November 29 on a complaint filed by one Akshay Kumar of Muzaffarnagar. This is the first time that a person booked under the new law approached the HC.Senior advocate SFA Naqvi, representing Nadeem, argued that the ordinance is ultra vires of the Constitution and any criminal proceedings initiated under its provisions shall be quashed. “The Special Marriage Act is a central act which provides a special form of marriage for interfaith couples. It provides prohibited degrees for marriages like real brother and sister, etc. Once prohibited degrees for marriage beyond religion and castes are defined by the central act and then by the impugned ordinance new prohibited degrees are created on religious grounds, this amounts to creating a communal and divisive legislation which is not at all permissible in our constitutional scheme. Once the central government has made the law over the subject of marriage then there is no space available for the state government to pass the impugned ordinance,” he said.It was alleged in the FIR that Nadeem developed a relationship with the complainant’s wife with the purpose of converting her religion by marriage.Nadeem has denied the allegations, asserting that he was being falsely implicated merely to avoid payment of some dues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allahabad-high-court-stays-man-s-arrest-under-love-jihad-law/story-N7TxIEJ3YLKQev8BfFj85M.html

However, it is subject to regulatory approvals and countries’ readiness for delivery.“We have had promising vaccine candidates in less than a year of the pandemic, and now we are engaging with manufacturers from around the world for procurement to ensure equitable acces,” Richard Hatchett, Chief Executive Officer, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations said during a press briefing.Also Read: 10 million Covid+, but India on recovery roadAt least 1.3 billion donor-funded doses will be made available to 92 countries eligible for the Gavi COVAX AMC (advance market commitment), targeting up to 20% population coverage by the end of 2021 . “WHO is working on ensuring that in the first year of limited supply of vaccine doses, there is equal distribution among all eligible countries…said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covax-gains-access-to-2-billion-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-bU6koJPW3L4tTaTIXLyHgO.html
19-12-2020||India||Supreme Court for capping Covid-19 treatment charges at private hospitals||States should make adequate arrangements in government hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients or cap charges in private facilities, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday, saying that the “right to health included affordable treatment”.The court’s direction came on a suo motu case assessing efforts to control Covid-19, a challenge the judges said was like “fighting a world war” against a disease, while also noting that people who violate protocols should be dealt with strongly. The bench, headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, said it is the duty of the State to make provisions for affordable treatment and provisions in hospitals run and managed by them. But when these do not meet expectations, state governments should exercise powers under the pertinent law.“Therefore, either more and more provisions are to be made by the state government and the local administration, or there shall be (a) cap on the fees charged by the private hospitals, which can be in exercise of the powers under the Disaster Management Act,” held the bench, which also included Justices RS Reddy and MR Shah.The court said treatment costs have only risen, and it is not affordable for common people. Even if one survives Covid-19, a person often is ruined financially and economically, the judges said. This is the first time the top court has issued an order favouring a ceiling on charges by the private hospitals.While hearing a bunch of petitions on the same issue, another SC bench, led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, earlier said that it would be inappropriate for the court to impose a ceiling. “We are not equipped with what could be the best model of treatment for Covid patients,” the CJI-bench noted in its order in July, leaving it to the government for issuing suitable advisories.The latest order, however, is unequivocal in stating that when the State is not well-equipped to provide affordable treatment to everyone, it must ensure private hospitals cater to Covid patients at fixed and inexpensive rates. It has also ordered that wherever a state government has issued orders to the private hospitals for reserving a certain percentage of beds, they must comply.In its order on Friday, the bench also sought a crackdown on people not wearing masks or following norms such as social distancing. “They cannot be permitted to play with the lives of the others and they cannot be permitted to infringe the rights of other citizens, like right to health, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.”The bench further said that states may consider imposing night curfew or curfew over the weekend, wherever required, adding people should be informed well in advance of any such decision. It added that local authorities should not ordinarily give permission for gatherings or any function and if a nod is granted, a strict vigil is a must on number of people and if they are following all protocols. About political events too, the top court said that states must issue guidelines in terms of the restrictions announced by the Election Commission of India on such events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-for-capping-covid-19-treatment-charges-at-private-hospitals/story-3CoFVxQXwJuCEDEBg4NmyO.html

Also, if you want to discuss every other issue under the sun and not deliberate on our key demands for the revival of the party, then what is the purpose of this meeting?” asked one of the dissenters who refused to be named. “We will now have to decide whether to attend tomorrow’s meeting or not,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surjewala-s-remark-upsets-section-of-congress-letter-writers/story-fkfzaceB5lGCYtosK7JKIP.html

The complex also includes a hospital, an Indo-Islamic centre, a community kitchen and a museum.The mosque is coming up on five acres alloted to the board following the November 2019 order of the Supreme Court in the Babri Masjid- Ram Janmabhoomi case. The court ruled in favour of the Hindu parties to the case, and ordered the creation of a trust to build a Ram temple at the contended site. However, it also criticised the demolition of the Babri Masjid.The ground breaking ceremony for the Ram temple happened on August 5 this year.Athar Hussain, spokesperson of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), said the blueprint of the entire complex will be shared on Saturday. “In Islam, there is no concept of holding a ground-breaking ceremony for a mosque...it’s just going to be a formal launch,” Hussain clarified. IICF is the trust formed by the UPSCWB to ensure the construction of the mosque complex. Trust officials speaking on condition of anonymity said chief minister Yogi Adityanath will be invited for this ceremony.The blueprint will be released in the presence of Professor SM Akhtar, a Lucknow-based architect and town planner who is also founding dean, faculty of architecture, Jamia Milia University, Delhi, hired to design the mosque complex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-sunni-waqf-board-to-release-ayodhya-mosque-blueprint-today/story-LuNXRfssTXOVw7QCvV5j5H.html
19-12-2020||India||Farm laws led to jump in agri firms: Govt data||There has been nearly a 54% jump in incorporation of new agribusinesses this year, the most since June when three agricultural laws came into force, even as thousands of farmers protest the changes in policies to liberalise the farm sector. Agricultural firms are leading a revival in new businesses set up this year, buoyed by the farm laws and a national farm investment firm, as the economy starts emerging from a pandemic-induced slump. New agribusiness registered as companies and limited liability partnerships in 2020 so far, especially since the promulgation of three farm laws, has jumped 53.6%, from 5,104 to 7,840, the highest in five years, according to data from the corporate affairs ministry. Also Read| ‘Bow to farmers’: PM Modi backs laws, slams OppositionFirms set up in the farm sectors lead the growth of new incorporations following those in manufacturing, overtaking registrations in construction, finance and ‘others’ categories, the data show. Registration of firms under the broader ‘agriculture and allied activities’ category has increased 35%, the highest in any category. Entrepreneurs are borrowing steadily from the Rs1 lakh-crore Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, part of the first Covid-induced economic stimulus package, to build assets in India’s food supply chain, according to separate data obtained from the agricultural ministry. The brisk investments by the agri-led firms have been aided by laws aimed at liberalising the agriculture sector, incentivised funding and easing of restrictions on food trading farms, analysts say. Official data shows that 161,589 companies and limited liability partnerships were incorporated from January to November 2020 on the whole, the most after June when the new laws came into force and a nationwide lockdown was lifted. This represents an 8% rise over the corresponding period of 2019. Investors have so far borrowed Rs1,566 crore from the agri infrastructure fund, showing a preference to invest in long-neglected post-harvest facilities, such as warehouses, cold chains, food grading-cum-sorting units and processing units. The fund was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 9. Also Read: MSP only real risk protection for farmers, says new studyA deficit of post-harvest infrastructure, crucial for a resilient food-supply chain, causes physical wastage and annual loss of food items worth Rs2.15 lakh crore, according to data from the ministry of food processing. The fund is designed to address this investment gap because of its concessional rates. Besides the Rs1566 crore disbursed, applications for nearly 10,000 new assets worth another Rs993 crore are currently under evaluation or due to be taken up soon, data till November 5 reviewed by HT showed. All of the country’s 12 public-sector banks and nine private lenders are part of the fund. “The Rs1,566 crore tranche has gone to over 3,000 primary agricultural credit societies or PACS,” an official said, requesting anonymity. PACS are village-level credit cooperatives and therefore the most accessible financial institution for a farmer. Additionally, PACS have submitted fresh applications for 9,435 infrastructure projects worth Rs690.56 crore. Banks have also picked another 352 applications from other agri-investors for projects worth Rs302.71 crore. The top five states from where investment proposals have been received are Madhya Pradesh (119 applications), UP (46), Bihar (30), Rajasthan (28) and Odisha (22). The fund aims to offer medium-to-long term debt fina-ncing for investment in farm projects and provide loans on totalling Rs1 lakh crore over four years, starting with a sanction of Rs10,000 crore for 2020-21 and Rs30,000 crore each for three financial years. Borrowers get an interest subvention of 3% per annum up to a loan limit of Rs2 crore for a period of seven years. “The new agricultural laws open up farm trade considerably. The assumption is that a liberalised farm sector will lead to higher private investments,” says Raj Kathpalia, an advisor to Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. The laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled “mandi system”, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, which earlier only government-approved agents could, and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers, however, are protesting the reforms, saying they would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, under which the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-led-to-jump-in-agri-firms-govt-data/story-Lk8ZHmpGHkLnUAEc4pze2K.html

19-12-2020||India||Absconding godman Nithyananda offers 3-day visa to ‘nation’||Controversial self-styled godman Nithyananda, who was reported to be on the run last year after facing charges of rape and kidnapping, and who went on to set up a new “nation” called Kailasa, has now begun issuing special three-day visas for tourists to visit the mysterious island nation, several news websites reported on Friday. Kailasa visa-holders will have to travel from Australia aboard a newly launched private chartered flight service “Garuda”, Nithyananda announced in a recent video. “Today, you can start applying for Kailasa visa. You have to reach Australia on your own. From Australia, Kailasa has its own chartered flight services,” he said in a video from his official Facebook page. “Please do not ask for more than a 3-day visa. Kailasa can accommodate anyone only for three days for now.” Nithyananda said all visitors will be provided with free food and accommodation during the course of their stay but will only be allowed to meet or see him once during their visit. While travellers will have to make their own arrangements to arrive in Australia, airfare to and from Kailasa will be covered by Nithyananda’s organisation, he clarified. The island nation has also created an e-mail ID (contact@kailaasa.org) through which visitors can apply for the visa, reports said.While the exact location of Kailasa is unknown, it is believed to be close to Australia. Several news reports suggested that the “nation” is located in a small private island near Trinidad and Tobago.Nithyananda has also promised that the visitors will be allowed to visit “param Shiva” during their stay. Nithyananda, 42, founder of a trust, Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam, which has temples, gurukulas, and ashrams across many countries, went missing last year after an FIR was registered against him in November on charges of alleged kidnapping and wrongful confinement of children to make them collect donations from followers to run his ashram, Yogini Sarvagyapeetham, in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, police said. He was also an accused in a rape case filed against him in Karnataka.In December, a few days after the Gujarat police confirmed that Nithyananda had fled the country, a website – kailaasa.org – came up that said he had set up a new “nation” called Kailasa that aims to provide a haven for “dispossessed Hindus”.India had dismissed reports of a “nation” being set up, with the then external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar saying: “Setting up a website is very different from creating a nation.”According to the website, Kailasa has its own flag, passport and emblem. In August this year, Nithyananda unveiled freshly minted currency of Kailasa called “Kailashian dollars”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/absconding-godman-nithyananda-offers-3-day-visa-to-nation/story-lnZiV5PSL07tuvOtgsZeTL.html
19-12-2020||India||‘Bow to farmers’: PM Modi backs laws, slams Opposition||Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended the three new agriculture laws on Friday, saying the legislation would ensure that Indian farmers kept pace with global standards, and attacked the Opposition for misleading cultivators in his strongest appeal yet to break the stalemate with protesting groups. Addressing a farmers’ meeting in Madhya Pradesh virtually, Modi reiterated his administration’s commitment to state-set crop prices and government-regulated market yards, or mandis, and underlined that he was willing to address all concerns of farmers, who have camped outside the Capital for three weeks now. “Even after my words and the efforts of the government, if someone has any concerns, then we are ready to bow our heads humbly and discuss the issues with folded hands, for the welfare of the farmers,” the PM said. “I believe there is no reason for distrust or place for lies in the farm reforms we have passed.”His comments came on a day agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government was hopeful of resolving the crisis by the new year with the help of backchannel talks with farmer groups. Five previous rounds of talks bore no fruit as protesters were firm in their demand of a repeal of the laws, a possibility the government didn’t entertain. Modi said he will again speak on the issue in greater detail on December 25.In his virtual address, Modi said three farm laws weren’t introduced overnight and should have been enacted three decades ago. “The global scenario is changing and it can’t be accepted that Indian farmers lag behind and become helpless in the absence of facilities and advanced technologies…the new laws have not been introduced overnight. Every central government and state governments had discussed it in the past 20-22 years,” he said. He also alleged that the Opposition was using farmers for politicking and trying to win lost political ground by misleading the agriculturists. “I don’t think the opposition has any problem with the farm reforms but have a problem that Modi fulfilled promises that they made and couldn’t fulfil. They didn’t get credit for it. I am ready to give all credit to you and manifestoes of the political parties but please don’t mislead the farmers,” said the PM. The massive farmers’ protest was set off by the three controversial laws pushed through Parliament by the government in September. These allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules.Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business, gut the mandi system and gradually end the regime of minimum support prices (MSP) that acts as a protective net for cultivators. Protesters decided to call off further negotiations on December 8, after a meeting with home minister Amit Shah. They have threatened to intensify their strike and block more roads if the impasse continues. In his speech, Modi made a strong pitch for MSPs and said it was a lie to suggest that the government was thinking of ending them. “Opposition leaders are spreading lies about MSP. But I want to assure every farmer that the MSP system will not be discontinued. If we actually want to discontinue this system, why would we implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission?” he asked, referring to a 2004-06 commission headed by agricultural scientist MS Swaminathan and set up for the welfare for farmers. “The laws came into force six months ago and like the past, we still declared MSP…we are so serious about MSP that we declare the prices even before cultivation,” the PM added. He presented a set of statistics to prove that his government declared higher MSPs than the United Progressive Alliance administration that was in power between 2004 and 2014. He also strongly countered the notion that mandis would close due to the new laws. “The Opposition’s second lie is about the closure of mandis. The businessmen have a freedom to sell their products anywhere in the world but even after 70 years, the farmers didn’t have freedom. The government used to instruct the farmers to sell their produce at mandis only. But with this new law we have given freedom to framers to take decision whether they want to sell the produce in mandi or outside,” said the PM. “Has one mandi closed after the new laws? Then why is this lie being spread?” he asked. He took on the Opposition over the contract farming law, which many say will leave small farmers vulnerable. “We have just made the law to save the farmers from fraud. The agreement will be of crop and production and it has nothing to do with the land. We have given rights to farmers to break the contract but the businessmen can’t do so. If they do so, they have to pay money to farmers,” said the PM. Taking a jibe at the Congress, Modi said, “In every 10 years, Congress announced a farm loan waiver scheme. But we all know what they promised and what they gave. In Madhya Pradesh, they promised to waive off loans in 10 days but farmers know what they got. They made the farmers loan defaulters. In Rajasthan too, farmers are still waiting.” During the programme, state chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan transferred Rs 1,660 crore to the accounts of 3.5 million farmers as relief for crop loss.Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged the PM was deceiving farmers and added that the Centre should shed its arrogance and repeal the three farm laws at the earliest. “Listen to the farmers, take back the anti-farmer laws,” tweeted Rahul Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bow-to-farmers-pm-modi-backs-laws-slams-opposition/story-BLGVqDMJ0x9ceCkHdK5baP.html
19-12-2020||India||10 million Covid+, but India on recovery road||India on Friday became the second country in the world to see the total number of Covid-19 infections surpass 10 million, although this comes at a time when the country is at the best position in months in its fight against the pandemic, and with the roll-out of a vaccine imminent.The only other country to have crossed this mark is the US, which did so on November 7, and which is currently in the grips of a strong third wave of the pandemic that has taken daily cases and deaths, as well as hospitalisations to record highs. The US has seen 17,661,064 cases and 318,522 deaths to date.In contrast, almost all of India’s indicators are exhibiting positive signs – the rate of new cases and deaths are the lowest in at least five months and have dropped over 70% from peak of the first wave, and the positivity rate is the lowest ever recorded.Also Read: The spread of India’s 10 million Covid-19 casesIndia ended Friday with 10,004,807 cases, 145,188 deaths, and a cumulative positivity rate of 6.3%. The global battle against the disease has received a major boost in the last two weeks as two countries – the United States and United Kingdom – have started the rollout of the first Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said on Thursday it is working “rapidly” to give emergency use authorisation to a second vaccine candidate developed by Moderna Inc. An approval was expected later on Friday, US time. In India, Pfizer is among three companies that have sought an early approval for a coronavirus vaccine. The country’s drugs regulator is assessing these applications, and has asked the other two – Serum Institute of India (which filed for the Oxford-AstraZeneca candidate) and Bharat Biotech to present more data. Pfizer is slated to make a presentation to the agency soon, following which its assessment will proceed.The viral disease that began in Wuhan, China, a year-and-a-bit ago has infected at least 75 million people around the world and killed 1.7 million people, although experts say that both numbers are likely underestimations. One in every eight people infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, is from India, but the country fares better in terms of deaths. Its case fatality rate (CFR) — the proportion of infected people who have died from the disease — is 1.45%, which is not only better than the global average of 2.22%, but also better than other countries such as the US (1.8%) and Brazil (2.60%) that have been severely hit by the disease.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageIndia’s first wave of infections peaked in the middle of September with the seven-day average of daily cases touching 93,617. This number has been receding at a rapid pace since, and in the last week has touched 26,851 – a decrease of over 71%.This improvement in the case rate has come along with improvement in another crucial metric – the positivity rate, which is at its lowest ever. In the past week, 2.6% of all samples tested in India have come back positive for Covid-19 — the lowest this number has ever touched since the government started releasing testing figures in April. According to the World Health Organization, if the positivity rate remains 5% or below for two weeks, a region can be said to be keeping its outbreak under control and is testing adequately. India’s positivity rate has been below this threshold for 25 days now.This improvement is reflected in every major hot spot state. As recently as October and November, states such as Delhi, Kerala, West Bengal and Rajasthan were still defying the larger trend and reporting rising cases. But for the first time, numbers are receding in the past three weeks in every major state in the country. States such as Maharashtra, which is responsible for the highest number of infections so far (1,888,767 as on Friday), has seen new infections drop by 83% from mid-September levels. Similarly, new infections are down 88% from peak levels in Karnataka, 95% in Andhra Pradesh, 82% in Tamil Nadu and 73% in Delhi. Experts said they don’t expect another massive wave of infections like the country did in September.“The downward trend in cases has come right after the festive season and the Bihar elections – both factors that many of us were predicting would lead to another spike, but that never happened,” said Dr Shahid Jameel, virologist and director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University. “Part of the reason for that is that while officially 10 million people have been infected, this number is at least 15-to-20 times more if we look at the findings of sero-surveys. This, and the fact that millions will get the vaccine in the near future, should see us avoiding another wave.”THREAT OF A SECOND WAVETrends in Europe and the United States, however, have shown that subsequent waves are significantly more severe than the first onslaught of the disease. Countries such as the US, France and the United Kingdom have all seen devastatingly strong second (in the case of the US, third) waves. In the US, seven-day average of new cases in the first wave peaked at 32,809 new cases a day. In the second wave, it was 70,511 – a 115% increase from the first wave. And the number is currently at 220,690 – another 213% increase. The trend is just as clear in other nations as well. In Britain, the second wave was 407% more severe than the first wave: the first wave peaked with a seven-day average of cases at 4,999 while the second wave touched 25,331. In France, the second wave surpassed the severity of the first wave by 1,172% — the first wave touched 4,433, while the second wave peaked at 56,377 new infections a day.“This virus is going to stay with us for at least a couple of years. Over the next year or two we will see localised spurts in cases, but it will be nothing of the magnitude of the first wave... The vaccine is really needed because it will help in keeping in check these pockets of infections,” said Dr Jameel.Other experts warned that measures like masks will remain the key defence against the spread of the disease. “A vaccination campaign, anywhere in the world (and much more so in India), is going to take several months to reach the large numbers that would make a strong difference to rates of transmission. So the short-term future of infection spread patterns is still going to be dependent on the use of standard physical distancing steps such as masks,” said Dr Satyajit Rath, immunologist and visiting faculty at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-million-covid-but-india-on-recovery-road/story-3gfrCF9MECGqHqNDJpMtaP.html
19-12-2020||India||The spread of India’s 10 million Covid-19 cases||The number of people confirmed to have been infected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India crossed the 10 million mark on Friday, about 10 months after the pandemic started spreading in the country. The confirmed cases have been reported from almost all states, but are largely concentrated in a select few districts.50% of cases from 47 districtsAt least half of the confirmed Covid-19 cases have been reported from only 47 of India’s 700-plus districts, according to a Hindustan Times analysis of data compiled by How India Lives. Delhi’s 11 revenue districts have been clubbed together into one single unit for this analysis because the Delhi government does not release disaggregated figures. These 46 districts are spread across 16 states and Union territories. Delhi, as one single unit, has the highest caseload, 6.3% of the country’s total cases, followed by Bengaluru, Pune, Mumbai, Thane, and Chennai. These six urban centres have together reported more than two million confirmed infections, nearly 22% of the country’s total. The Covid-19 related deaths are even more skewed. At least 50% of deaths have been reported from only 24 districts.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageA majority of the country’s districts have reported less than 5,000 cases so far, while there are only 11 districts which have reported more than 100,000 confirmed cases. While these 11 districts are home to 7.8% of India’s population, they account for nearly 28% of the total confirmed cases so far. Urban to slightly rural, to urban againThe coronavirus pandemic first started spreading in India from highly urban areas such as Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai. It later spread to the hinterland as the country opened up from a complete lockdown and people started travelling. This led to a surge of cases in rural areas. In May and June, 45% of all new cases were reported from 16 entirely urban districts (where more than 80% people live in urban areas). Entirely rural districts (where more than 80% people live in rural areas) reported only about 12% of new cases in these two months. This changed with time. In August, only about 13% new cases came from the entirely urban districts while more than 20% cases came from the entirely rural districts. However, the trend seems to be reversing now with the share of cases rising in urban areas again. In November, nearly 25% of new cases came from the entirely urban districts. This has happened even as the number of new cases, which peaked in September, has significantly dropped across India. The drop in cases is way steeper in the less urban regions compared to the entirely urban districts. Entirely urban districts reported the least number of new cases in September but the highest number of new cases in November. Trajectory in urban areasRecent trends from most of these districts show that cases are actually on a decreasing trend. For example, Delhi has recently passed its third wave of cases; and cases in other districts such as Bangalore, Kamrup Metropolitan (Guwahati, Assam) and Chennai have also significantly decreased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-spread-of-india-s-10-million-covid-10-cases/story-HgHpG3TKozHOwIqX7DsXHP.html
19-12-2020||India||Hathras horror: CBI files charge sheet against four||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday charged four Thakur men with the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district in September, basing its findings on the dying declaration of the victim and rejecting earlier statements by state government officials and the police that disputed the occurrence of rape.After a two-month-long investigation into the crime that galvanised India and sparked street protests, CBI filed the charge sheet in the court of the special judge in Hathras. The document said the four men — Sandeep, Ravi, Luv Kush and Ramu — allegedly gang raped and murdered the woman when she went to the fields to collect fodder in the early hours of September 14. They were charged under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections pertaining to assault, rape, murder and gang rape, apart from those under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The maximum sentence under these charges is death.“It took time but the truth prevailed. Now, we are getting the impression that justice would be delivered to us,” said the victim’s brother. “My sister’s soul would be at peace when the guilty are punished.” “It has been a period of agony for us but if CBI finds these four accused guilty of gang rape and murder of my sister, we are optimistic about getting justice in the near future,” added the victim’s brother. Opposition parties attacked the UP government and blamed senior administration and police officials, who had claimed there was no rape in the case on the basis of medical tests that experts deemed faulty. These comments were also seen as undercutting the investigation, especially at a time when state police was under fire for its alleged delay in responding to the victim, forcibly cremating her body, and blocking media access to the Dalit family even as upper-caste Brahmin and Bania communities held massive gatherings to corral support for the four accused men. The government rejected the charges.“In the Hathras case, immediately after the victim’s statement, the UP police altered the sections in the FIR and arrested the four accused and sent them to jail. The chief minister himself announced recommending a CBI probe. On October 3-4, the government sent a letter asking for CBI probe and on October 10, CBI took over the case and began probe on October 11. Before CBI took over the case, the UP government submitted an affidavit in Supreme Court saying that the government wants CBI probe. The government had requested to the SC to get the case probed in whichever way it wants (including under its supervision) by the CBI so that the truth comes out and victim get justice,” said a state government spokesperson. The woman was gang raped on September 14 and rushed to a hospital in nearby Aligarh town, where she also recorded her statement. As her condition deteriorated, she was moved to Delhi on September 28, and died in the early hours the next day at Safdarjang hospital. Later that evening, her body was taken to the village, and against the wishes of the family, she was forcibly cremated in the middle of the night by local officials. The next day, the village was barricaded and the family cut off from speaking to the media. The restrictions were only lifted a couple of days later amid growing outrage over the heinous crime and the alleged police laxity.Senior administration and police officials also disputed that the victim was raped, pointing out that no proof was found in the medical examination. But experts pointed out that the examination was conducted in violation of protocol and too late to find any conclusive evidence. CBI, whose investigation is being overseen by the Allahabad high court, appeared to have not gone by the statements of the officials and concluded that the victim suffered gang rape. Its findings were based on the dying statement of the woman — in which she named the accused and the crime committed on her — in addition to scientific and forensic evidence, and statements of witnesses and the victim’s family.“The public is reminded that the above findings are based on the investigation done by CBI and evidence collected by it. Under the Indian law, the accused are presumed to be innocent till their guilt is finally established after a fair trial,” read a CBI statement. Days after the crime, the state government constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the case, but the matter was handed over to CBI on October 10. On October 27, the Supreme Court asked the Allahabad high court to monitor the probe conducted by CBI. The court took suo-motu (on its own) cognisance of the incident and the controversial cremation and criticised local officials. The UP government is conducting a separate probe into an alleged international plot to defame the state administration. MS Pundheer, the counsel for the four accused, said, “The charge sheet has been filed against all four accused namely Sandeep, Luv Kush, Ramu and Ravi. The court has taken cognisance.”The Opposition attacked the government over the case.“The BJP government, despite its reluctance and resistance, had to refer the Hathras case to CBI because of immense pressure from people, the Opposition and the media. Now, finally, on the basis of the dying declaration of the victim, charge sheet has been filed against four accused. Without struggle, one can’t get anything under BJP rule, be it justice or rights,” said former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who visited the victim’s family in October along with her brother Rahul Gandhi, said the charge sheet raised serious questions about the Yogi Adityanath government.“This development raises serious questions on the Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, UP police, ADG law and order, district magistrate of Hathras and senior functionaries of the state administration,” said Gandhi Vadra in a statement. “The state left no stone unturned to deny the victim dignity in life and death…however, the entire might of the Uttar Pradesh government and police could not suppress the truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-horror-cbi-files-charge-sheet-against-four/story-ZHmlyi1fXE0cWaggR6YPnK.html
19-12-2020||India||‘Learn to accept rejections — in work & life!’||Actor Poulomi Das broke the shackles of fair-skinned obsession in modelling and glamour industry. Her successful stint on the ramp, then on TV and now on OTT, are fair examples of how the dusky actor carved a niche for herself. During her visit to Lucknow, the ‘Kartik Purnima’ actor described her journey. “Every industry has different requirements; so to our industry. One needs to find out where one fits and how one can change people’s perspective and perception. In my case, I am very ‘dheet’ (firm in belief) so I give my best wherever I feel like it.”Das said one needs to accept rejection not just in work but in life too. “If you don’t accept rejection, you’re gonna be nowhere! It’s part of life. As a kid, no one thought I would be a model or an actor, but today, I am one.” The strength she got was from her parents. “I am blessed that my mom and dad always said ‘you are the best!’ I always kept that in mind and marched ahead. I was a national institute student and one day I said that I have to go to Mumbai. They were surprised but supported my belief. So, I will say parents should support their children’s calling and dreams. And, once they do, it does not matter what others say.”She played the parallel lead in OTT series ‘Dil Hi Toh Hai’ and a negative character in ‘Baarish’ starring Sharman Joshi.Having done both TV and web she said, “As we have to shoot an episode every day, so somewhere quality is compromised, whereas on OTT, we shoot very high quality content like a movie. Also, our audience is different so is the treatment.” Das is excited for her upcoming show that was shot during the unlock phase. “I play a ‘dasi’ in ‘Paurashpur’ who becomes queen. We shot in extreme Covid conditions where we were being tested every two days. I learned sword fighting and even hurt my leg as it was too heavy to handle.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/learn-to-accept-rejections-in-work-life/story-iaoT32Nqj25RLVUYd4f4fM.html
19-12-2020||India||Placards welcoming Amit Shah placed Tagore below him, kicks up a row||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) drew people’s ire after placards bearing Union home minister Amit Shah’s picture above Rabindranath Tagore were found all over Bolpur and Shantiniketan in Bengal’s Birbhum district on Friday. Shah, who will be on a two-day tour of Bengal this weekend, will visit Bolpur on Sunday. He will take part in a roadshow and address a rally. He will also have lunch at the village home of a folk singer. The placards also had bold images of Bolpur’s former Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Anupam Hazra who joined the BJP in 2019 and is now the party’s national secretary. Hazra was also a student and teacher at Visva Bharati. The images were printed against a saffron background. The placards bore the name of a cultural organization as the sponsor. On December 9, BJP’s Bengal unit quoted JP Nadda as saying that Tagore’s birthplace is Visva Bharti. The tweet was later deleted. The TMC, however, used the tweet to criticise the BJP chief for not knowing the land’s history. The Nobel laureate was born in erstwhile Calcutta’s Jorasanko. BJP leaders quickly removed the placards after local people, for whom Tagore is cultural pride, and students of Visva Bharati, Bengal’s only national university set up by the poet, raised objections. Hazra, who has been put in charge of the arrangements being made to welcome Shah, claimed that the placards were neither made nor put up by the BJP. “This was planned by the TMC. We were brought up in Shantiniketan. I was a student here. We know how to pay respects to Tagore. This was a sabotage. In this same manner a bust of Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar was vandalised (in 2019) in Kolkata during a roadshow of Shah. The placards were placed around the spot where the roadshow and rally will be held,” said Hazra. “Our men are removing the placards because we cannot see Tagore insulted. The TMC should have removed these. The organization named in the placards does not even exist,” said Hazra. Bikash Mishra, the BJP’s Bolpur town unit president however said the placards, and similar ones with photos of Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, had been made for the rally. Anubrata Mondal, the TMC district president known for his provocative speeches, said, “Is Tagore’s place below Amit Shah? Can Bengal be insulted like this? People will not tolerate this.” Hours after the TMC shared photos of the placard on social media, the Bengal BJP tweeted an old old photo showing a placard with a life-size image of Mamata Banerjee hanging against the trunk of a tree with a little bust of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose kept below it. “Don’t teach us about respecting Bengali icons! Be it Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose or Rabindranath Tagore, TMC cadres have scant respect for Bengali culture. All they do is compete with each other to appease Pishi at the cost of dishonouring national heroes like Netaji or Kabiguru,” the BJP tweeted at 11.36 pm. During the day, Visva Bharati students owing allegiance to several Left organisations also protested against Shah’s proposed meeting with vice chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty on Sunday. Shah will also be visiting some sites inside the sprawling university campus. Stating that Rabindranath was the face of the fight against fascism, the organisations submitted a memorandum to Chakraborty. “We appeal to our VC and other officials not to welcome this kind of a person (Shah) to Shantiniketan and tarnish the ideology of Rabindranath and Shantiniketan,” they said in a letter to the VC. The Visva Bharati authorities did not react to this till Friday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/placards-welcoming-amit-shah-placed-tagore-below-him-kicks-up-a-row/story-sLy1RV8aG4R2Mv6urEDZ6L.html
19-12-2020||India||88% of Covid-19 fatalities, 40% of cases in 45+ age group: Govt data||Nearly nine in every 10 people (88%) who lost their lives due to Covid-19 in India till December 16 were above the age of 45, even only four out of every 10 (40%) reported infections fell in that age group, according to yet-to-be-released case and mortality data from Union ministry of health and family welfare accessed by HT.People under the age of 45 years accounted for 60% of all Covid-19 infections in the country, but constituted only 12% of total deaths, the data showed. The findings from India reflect global trends that show the disease is disproportionately fatal for those who are older, even though it infects people in the younger age groups far more.Also Read: 10 million Covid+, but India on recovery roadThe data also showed that men are a lot more likely to be infected as well as die from the disease, accounting for 63% of all cases and 70% of all deaths. The numbers suggest that more than half (52%) of the people infected in India so far were between the ages of 18 and 44 years, while a majority (55%) of those who died of the viral disease were 60 years and older. People in between the ages of 45 years and 60 constitute 33% of all fatalities, while about 10% of the deaths were among people between the ages of 26 and 44. Those between 18 and 25 years, and those below 17 years of age, account for only 1% of fatalities each.Also in line with the global pattern, at least 70% of the deaths were in patients with at least one more underlying medical condition such as hypertension, diabetes, or cardiac, liver or kidney disease.Also Read: The spread of India’s 10 million Covid-19 cases“The pattern visible in India is not really different from the data that is coming from other countries; and it says that the infection is relatively less common among children, and mostly affects the adult population. Elderly people, and those with comorbidities, are at a higher risk of developing severe form of the disease. The trend largely has remained the same over the months with slight variation in numbers,” said a health ministry official familiar with the findings who did not want to be identified.India’s cumulative case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of patients dead among those having tested positive, currently stands at 1.45%, which is far lower than the global CFR of 2.26%. Immunology experts say that because of the high transmissibility of the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19, the infections could rise in future but with less severity. Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“Since it is a highly contagious virus, everyone runs the risk of exposure. However, we are seeing lower severity of the infection, because of which our death rate is also very low, and that could be attributed to the fact that our immunity levels are modulated to fight any infections better as compared to say Europeans or Americans. Young population getting infected could also be movement related as we have managed to quarantine to a large extent our vulnerable population,” said Dr NK Mehra, immunology and immunogenetics expert, who was formerly associated with New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Doctors also attribute the low death rate to standardised treatment protocol that hospitals had started following in hospitals across the country based of Union health ministry guidelines. The technical wing of Union health ministry prepared 30 training modules on various topics -- such as clinical management, ventilator support, infection prevention and control, and quarantine management -- to train its frontline health care workers. “We know a lot more about the disease now then we knew in the beginning of the outbreak, and government guidelines have also been upgraded from time to time based on the latest evidence emerging from across the globe that also helped in knowing what worked better. These protocols are being followed across the board, and have managed to save more lives,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director, department of pulmonology and sleep disorders, Fortis Healthcare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/88-of-covid-fatalities-40-of-cases-in-45-age-group-govt-data/story-0RvZ2kT1CXMRonZjl6pGlL.html
19-12-2020||India||BJP Bengal unit gears up for Amit Shah’s rally today||The West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) geared up on Friday for Union home minister Amit Shah’s rally in Midnapore on Saturday where he is expected to induct leaders from the ruling party in the poll-bound state into the saffron camp even as defections in the ranks emerged as a headache for the Mamata Banerjee regime.Till Friday night, efforts were on to ensure that at least a dozen leaders of significance join the BJP on Saturday, according to party insiders aware of the developments.“I cannot tell you the exact number because hectic calls are being made and this will continue till the last minute. Many TMC leaders are willing to quit the party but quite a few of them are under pressure from ruling party leaders,” a senior BJP state leader told HT on condition of anonymity on Friday night. Shah’s plane was scheduled to land in Kolkata around 11.30pm. He will be staying in a hotel in New Town in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata and attend rallies and internal meetings of the party in Kolkata, East Midnapore and Birbhum districts on Saturday and Sunday. He will also have lunch with local villagers in the two districts, BJP leaders said. Shah will return to Delhi on Sunday afternoon. Security arrangements were beefed up by the Union home ministry and the state police in view of the stone pelting on BJP national president JP Nadda’s convoy on December 10. Shah will fly to the districts by helicopter.Suvendu Adhikari, former minster from East Midnapore district, is the most prominent name among those likely to join the BJP on Saturday. Adhikari remained tight-lipped before the media even as BJP leaders said Z-category security was being provided to him by the Centre. Adhikari drove to Bhubaneswar on Friday and took a flight to Delhi to meet Shah. “Suvendu and Shah will arrive in Kolkata on the same flight,” the former TMC leader’s close aide Kanishka Panda said on Friday night. Panda was expelled by the TMC earlier this week. Adhikari and his family are residents of Kanthi town. Adhikari’s father Sisir Adhikari is the local Lok Sabha MP while his elder brother Dibyendu Adhikari is the Lok Sabha member from Tamluk in the same district.Meanwhile, Banashree Maiti, the TMC lawmaker from the Kanthi North assembly seat in East Midnapore, resigned on Friday night and said she will join the BJP on Saturday. Retired army colonel Diptangshu Chowdhury, who quit the BJP in 2017 and joined the TMC, has stepped down from the posts of chairman of the South Bengal State Transport Corporation and advisor to the monitoring cell on programme implementation of government welfare services in the chief minister’s office. There was speculation that he, too, might return to the BJP. Making things difficult for Adhikari, state assembly speaker Biman Banerjee announced on Friday afternoon that he will not accept the resignation of the TMC legislator on technical grounds. When Adhikari went to the assembly house on Wednesday afternoon to submit his hand-written letter, the speaker was not present in his office. Though received by the assembly secretary, the letter raised several questions since Adhikari did not put any date on it and did not write or sign it before the speaker, something anti-defection rules of the assembly demand. “I have asked Adhikari to appear before me at 2pm on December 21 and declare whether he voluntarily wrote the letter and when it comes into effect. If I am satisfied with his answer, I will accept the resignation,” said Banerjee. “There is no hard and fast rule that one has to resign from the assembly before joining the BJP. They may resign later,” said a senior state BJP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-bengal-unit-gears-up-for-shah-s-rally-today/story-GUaEs46WRFEvMw4RArbd2N.html
19-12-2020||India||Sonia Gandhi to meet dissenters today, discuss key issues||Congress  president Sonia Gandhi is scheduled to meet on Saturday, in one of the most anticipated internal meetings for the party, at least seven of the 23 signatories to an August letter seeking more hands-on leadership and a clearer revival path. The decision to have the first discussion on the issues raised by the senior leaders in the letter was taken more than a week ago, according to the two leaders invited for the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity. Gandhi was open to the idea but she did not want it to be a big meeting since she has been avoiding large gatherings, one of the leaders said. “Since the pandemic started, Mrs Gandhi has not had any in-person meetings. Even when someone went to see her at home, they sat in different rooms and spoke on the phone,’’ said one of the two leaders. Also Read| 99.9% Congress leaders, workers want Rahul Gandhi as chief: SurjewalaA spike in pollution levels in Delhi even forced the Congress president to leave the city for some time for Goa. Rajya Sabha MP and senior leader Ghulam Nabi Azad (one of the signatories to the letter) drew up a list of representatives, a second leader said, adding that Rajya Sabha MP Anand Sharma, Lok Sabha MPs Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tiwari, Haryana CLP leader and the state’s former chief minister Bhupinder Hooda, Maharashtra’s former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan and Vivek Tankha were expected to attend. Tharoor confirmed his attendance. Another Congress leader and signatory to the letter, Kapil Sibal, will be travelling outside the country (he leaves Saturday morning) and will therefore not attend. The meeting will be held on the lawns of her residence at 10, Janpath. HT learns that all leaders attending the meeting have undergone testing for Covid-19. The meeting will also be attended by other senior Congress leaders. Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath confirmed that both he and former Union finance minister P Chidambaram will be attending. The party’s general secretary ( organisation) KC Venugopal, former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, and former defence minister AK Antony are also scheduled to attend. While Rahul Gandhi’s team didn’t confirm his attendance, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is expected to attend.“We expect to have sincere engagement,’’ said one of the two leaders. “A discussion on the road map to revive the party is required because our footprint cannot be diminished. We are concerned and the results of various elections, Bihar, Kerala and UP, have vindicated what we said.’’He added: “The letter was triggered by the fact that Mrs Gandhi’s interim term of a year was coming to an end and Rahul had indicated he didn’t want to come back as president. So, we all wanted to know what’s next.’’One of the other signatories to the letter said he does not expect much to come out of the meeting. But many of the others are more hopeful and see the meeting as an indication that the party’s leadership is willing to listen to their concerns. While the letter didn’t attack Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi directly, it did point out the failure of the party to discuss the real reasons behind the 2019 Lok Sabha election loss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-to-meet-dissenters-today-discuss-key-issues/story-0993jCnvZB9oitMWCNSa3O.html
19-12-2020||India||99.9% Congress leaders, workers want Rahul Gandhi as chief: Surjewala||Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala on Friday said that the process to elect a new party chief was underway and 99.9% of its leaders and workers wanted former president Rahul Gandhi to return. “The president of the party will be chosen by the electoral college, AICC (All India Congress Committee) members and Congress workers,” Surjewala said addressing a press conference. “Congress workers will choose a person best suited for the post. 99.9% of the party workers and I believe Rahul Gandhi should be elected president.” Surjewala added that Gandhi belonged to the rare brand of leaders willing to take on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government. “This has endeared him to Congress workers and the common people alike,” he said. Surjewala dismissed suggestions that interim chief Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with a host of party leaders, including some from the group who wrote a letter asking for an organisational rehaul, was a meeting with “rebels or dissenters”. The meeting is scheduled to be held on Saturday. “On account of Covid-19 protocols, the Congress president was unable to conduct meetings,” Surjewala said. “She has decided that over the next fortnight, a number of meetings will be held to address organisational issues. This is not a meeting of rebels or dissenters because we in the Congress party believe everyone is a part of the same family.” He added that the issues of the G-23, as the leaders had come to be referred, had been resolved with the announcement of party elections. “The BJP continues to propagate such insinuations, we are one family and we will stay united and work to strengthen the Congress party,” Surjewala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/99-9-cong-leaders-workers-want-rahul-gandhi-as-chief-surjewala/story-IL9KnriDB0uJA3lOr9jAeM.html
