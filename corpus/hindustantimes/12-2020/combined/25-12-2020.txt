Schools were ordered to shut overnight for an indeterminate period to prevent children from getting infected as social distancing emerged as, and still is, the most-effective solution to contain the virus’ spread. Educational institutions quickly turned digital, embracing e-learning and online tools to impart education remotely. Virtual classrooms were promptly created where students from kindergarten to higher grades connected through a choice of online conferencing platforms, attending classes from homes. No one knew, and still do not know, when the physical classrooms will again be filled with the curiosity of eager students. The next best alternative, therefore, was to adapt to the virtual world.Over the last several months, students, teachers, parents, and schools swiftly settled into the new world of screen-based learning from homes. The pedagogical quality of such a system is a matter of debate, but simulated teaching spaces persist as the best substitute when schools continue to remain shut.The dominant argument favouring such an approach is that, at the very least, it establishes continuity in education, even if it is imparted remotely. There is no gainsaying the fact that a wider digital footprint can serve as a powerful force to spread literacy and building a knowledge-based society. For the disadvantaged and the marginalised, education opens a whole new array of opportunities.While, on the face of it, there can be no dispute over imparting education digitally given the current conditions, there is a more essential question that needs deeper scrutiny. Is online, remote teaching widening the gender-bias against girl students?A few data points can be helpful to examine this. According to The Mobile Gender Gap Report 2020 of Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA) that represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, only half of the women in India use mobile internet compared to men—21% among of women compared to 42% of men.This disparity appears to have manifested even more adversely during the Covid-19 pandemic. A September 2020 study by Centre For Catalysing Change, a not-for-profit organisation, shows how adolescent boys had more access to digital infrastructures such as mobile phones, internet services, radio, and media. This evidence is particularly troubling, demonstrating how lack of access to gadgets and technology may have forced many girls to stay away from any form of digital schooling over last few months.A study by Young Lives, on childhood poverty worldwide, mirrors that same disturbing gender dimension to digital access in India. According to the study, “Boys in India are much more likely than their female peers to use a computer and the internet (as well as other forms of technology, such as a smartphone) regularly”.As much as 80% or four in five girls in the sample that Young Lives collected in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have never accessed the internet, while nearly two among three (62%) have never used a computer. What does this data tell us? These numbers expose the vulnerability of girl students many of whom are also likely to be subjected to a deep gender bias. This hushed segregation at home can force many girls to drop out of the school system forever. This also raises the worrying possibility of their being forced into early marriage and child labour. The government’s official statistics also broadly corroborate the hypothesis. In a survey Key Indicators of Household Social Consumption on Education in India, nearly a third (30.2%) of the women cited household tasks as their reason for discontinuing education.While these biases have dealt a severe blow to girl education, there is now growing fear that the continued absence from physical schools can also push many girls towards under-nourishment. India’s Mid-Day Meal (MDM) scheme, launched 1995, is among the world’s largest state-funded school feeding programme. The MDM provides free and nutritious lunch to approximately 100 million children, aged 6-14 years, across 1.3 million government primary and upper primary schools, for at least 200 days a year.The scheme has been particularly effective for key target groups such as children of migrant workers, many of whom were rendered jobless overnight as the pandemic swept through the country. Children of domestic help, carpenters, electricians, mechanics and other self-employed service providers have been beneficiaries of the MDM scheme in urban areas.This incentive has collapsed because of the Covid-19-forced school shutdowns that may have compelled many families to withdraw their daughters from school. A time-series school enrolment data that may be available a few years from now could throw up some worrying trend lines on dropouts.This has struck a double blow for poor girl students. Staying away from school has denied them the necessary mid-day meals and nourishment for months on end, while lack of access to gadgets and basic digital devices has deprived them of school education. These prevailing digital gaps may well mirror the biases that currently exist in India, manifesting in inequalities in many places, including between boys and girls.The ed-tech sector, rightly so, has been toasted for quickly and efficiently making education accessible through technology in a highly disruptive pandemic-created environment. But the gender-specific digital divide even among the poor and disadvantaged is reason for disquiet. A strong political will and sharp policies are the need of the hour to bridge this gap swiftly before it becomes an issue of grave social prejudice.Sourav Banerjee is country director, India, Room to Read The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/girls-and-boys-need-equal-tech-access-for-online-school-classes/story-yB0qwTMIYT9yTf8gpRqLbM.html
25-12-2020||News||In the farm debate, focus on access to food||As the farmers’ protest continues, there is a case for convening the National Development Council, a forum of state chief ministers and the central government. A lapse in the passing of the farm laws was that the views of the states were not sought directly. Given that agriculture is a State subject under the Constitution, and there exists considerable variation between the states in the cropping and the land-holding pattern, this lapse ended up deepening the political divide. However, consulting the states on the question of the recently-enacted farm laws cannot be a substitute for a thorough review of agricultural policies in India.In a way, the government and the protesting farmers have one thing in common. They are both concerned with achieving higher farm prices. The government claims that the new laws will lead to farmers realising a higher price for their produce. Indeed, they are part of the government’s stated objective of doubling farm income. The farmers, on the other hand, are concerned that the new farm laws will have exactly the opposite effect — of lowering the prices they will receive as the entry of corporates will lead to a buyer’s market. However, for at least a third of India’s population, the price of food is already too high. We can see this in the share of food in the expenditure budget of households. In the National Sample Survey (NSS) report for 2011-12, this share ranged from close to 60% for the poorest 5% of households to a little less than 30% for the richest 5%. Actually, even 30% is high in an international comparison. For instance, the share of household expenditure on food in China is substantially lower than this figure. The “food problem” needs to be understood in terms of a population’s access to food, not merely its availability. Before considering the relevance of this, it is important to note three things. First, the expenditure on food referred to includes processed food, or food that has gone through a manufacturing process. Second, farmers do not receive the entire price paid for food by consumers. There is a margin due to intermediation and the movement from farm to home. Finally, cereals are only a part of household expenditure on food, so high minimum support prices for wheat and rice are only part of the food problem in India.The price of food has implications for both well-being and economic growth, and thus livelihoods. It is one factor determining access to food. The stubborn prevalence of malnutrition is revealed in the most recent report of the National Family Health Survey. The high price of food contributes to it. Of course, a rise in non-farm incomes can overcome this failure, but the price of food is also a determinant of non-farm income. The greater the share of household income spent on food, the less there is of it to spend on other goods and services. In this way, a high price of food stymies the expansion of the non-agricultural sector, notably manufacturing. This impacts the future of agriculture in a way that is not readily recognised. When opportunities outside agriculture are limited, there is a pressure of population on land, which leads to the fragmentation of land-holding through partitioning of the farm. This leads to unviable farm size, reflected in the response of a significant section of rural households in the NSS that they would leave agriculture if they had an option. The agrarian constraint can be overcome through exports, but to compete in the world market, a country must first grow a dynamic domestic manufacturing sector.Globally, the path to economic prosperity has been via a prosperous agricultural sector, but it has been accompanied by improving yields and a declining relative price of food — ie, of food becoming cheaper in relation to other goods. As food becomes cheaper, the non-agricultural sector expands as household expenditure is released, providing employment to some rural households. Farms do not fragment and their profits rise, for yield would have increased. Raising the yield of land would require public intervention and funding. Some of this funding will come from re-configuring the agricultural policy of the government of India.A group of economists have shown that, contrary to claims, the procurement of foodgrains in India is not confined to either the farmers of Punjab and Haryana nor large farmers. Actually, from the point of view of provisioning the public distribution system, for which purpose alone procurement exists, geography and the size of farm-holding should not matter. We are one country after all, and if the providers are from Punjab and Haryana, or even large farmers, so be it; we should be grateful to them. However, public intervention must be justified in the public interest. We are procuring far too much wheat and paddy in relation to what is needed. Public stocks have at times been more than twice the official norm, with some of it rotting while in “storage”. This ties up funds which can be used for the public expenditure needed for increasing yields, which ranges from extension services to the marketing infrastructure. The debate on the farm laws must be used as a moment to have a larger debate on the inter-linkages between farm holdings, farm incomes, access to food, enhancing the productivity of agriculture, and creating enough room for the growth of other sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-the-farm-debate-focus-on-access-to-food/story-Cc4Z3dNW2edGTtsgYP1tFL.html
25-12-2020||News||In Nepal, an attack on democracy||When Nepal’s Prime Minister (PM) KP Oli dissolved Parliament and announced elections on December 20, he clearly overstepped his executive authority. Nepal’s entire political class, barring Oli, and Nepali civil society, including constitutional experts, overwhelmingly believe that the move was unconstitutional and illegitimate.Oli’s decision needs to be seen in a larger global context of democratically-elected leaders undermining democracy. Democracies now face a new challenge — where elected leaders can unleash democratic backsliding and carry out executive takeovers by taking a series of what appear to be “democratic” decisions.PM Oli has had a history of trying to use parliamentary acts and executive decisions to limit people’s freedoms. He has hollowed out independent institutions and sought to use them as mechanisms of political control, in order to reduce executive accountability and undermine opponents. Oli has packed in institutions such as the Election Commission, Department of Money Laundering Investigation, and most recently, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, with loyalists, often bypassing bipartisan constitutional methods of appointment, to maintain control. The dissolution of Parliament needs to be understood in this backdrop. Oli has expanded his control over the State, while bypassing the institutions that have tried to keep him accountable — Parliament, political party, and civil society.Oli has also, opportunistically, used political principles only when it has suited him, driven by a psychology that puts individual needs above that of democracy and constructs political ideologies to suit that need. For example, he is driven by a need for social affirmation of his personality and the desire to be seen as a statesman. To achieve this end, he replaced political ideology with a populist ideology that could camouflage his authoritarian streaks. He used the agenda of “nationalism” and development in theory while abandoning the democratic processes that could in fact strengthen the nation and unleash economic development.Given its history of political instability — Nepal has had over two dozen PMs in the last three decades — Nepal adopted a revised multi-party system that was different from the Westminster model. The new Constitution deliberately cut off possibilities for dissolution of Parliament at the whims of the executive or political parties. During the elections, the unified Nepal Communist Party (NCP) — a product of the merger of the Maoists and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) — promised political stability and development and claimed that only a political party with a clear majority can deliver political stability.Oli points to the opposition within the NCP — he has faced a severe challenge from former PMs Madhav Kumar Nepal and Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” — as the reason for his non-performance and his decision to go for fresh people’s mandate. But this is disingenuous. In a multi-party democracy, political parties are the central means through which accountability is ensured. In any case, how the party ensures accountability is a matter internal to the party and the country cannot be held hostage to resolve petty internal differences. Oli did not want this accountability — and the more he got squeezed within his party, the more he unleashed his authoritarian impulses.Oli’s move shows that there is a clear disconnect between his personal needs and the nation’s challenges, especially in the face of Covid-19. At a time when the government should be focused on implementing the new Constitution, tackling the pandemic and protecting people’s livelihoods, the country will be — on paper — heading to uncertain and costly elections.Although the idea of obtaining a fresh electoral mandate sounds tempting, Nepal‘s political history is replete with instances where elections have been not held after being announced; the unconstitutional nature of Oli’s announcement will make it even more unlikely this time around. All of this will further undermine Nepal’s democracy and people’s trust in the process. There are extreme Right and extreme Left forces waiting for precisely this to overthrow the entire structure of a federal, democratic, secular, republican Nepal.The PM’s move also comes at a time when Nepalis are tired of the geopolitical rivalry between China, India and the United States in the domestic theatre. Many people perceive these great and emerging powers as interfering in Nepal’s internal politics and shaping policies to favour their strategic interests. Political instability in Nepal allows amoral political actors, especially non-democratic States, the opportunity to intervene.Nepalis want good governance, democratic stability and economic development. Supporting PM Oli’s move undermines all these principles. All external powers — particularly democracies — must recognise the true nature of what has happened in Nepal, the corrosion of democracy and the emergence of authoritarianism, and the possibility that this will invite a period of prolonged instability which will make it even more vulnerable to geopolitical actors.Vijay Kant Karna is a political scientist, former ambassador, and executive chairperson of the Centre for Social Inclusion and FederalismAjaya Bhadra Khanal is a former editor and research director at CESIFThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-nepal-an-attack-on-democracy/story-YpxtBe1sp8sFEVZSB0peqK.html
25-12-2020||News||The world of Atal Bihari Vajpayee||One of the troubles of understanding even a well-known public personality such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee — whose birth anniversary is on December 25 — is that unlike Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru, who left behind troves of written work, Vajpayee rarely maintained dairies and journals. While researching for my recent book — Vajpayee: The Years That Changed India — I read many of his speeches and poems to try and understand his philosophical outlook, which he never articulated specifically but which can be gleaned from his words and actions.I was aware of a detailed essay that Vajpayee wrote for his friend NM (Appa) Ghatate, who was then editing a book of Vajpayee’s speeches, titled Decisive Days. I was also lucky to have with me a very detailed biographical note that Vajpayee wrote for Chandrika Prasad Sharma who was editing a book of his speeches. My understanding of Vajpayee’s worldview, particularly how he internalised his conception of history and how he saw contemporary circumstances, has benefitted hugely from reading these essays.There were five key tenets of what can be broadly considered as Vajpayee’s worldview. First, Vajpayee was convinced, as most associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) are, that social divisions in Indian society had led to the nation becoming an easy victim of foreign aggression. He argued that the caste system fragmented Indian society, leaving only the Kshatriyas with the right to bear arms. Similarly, it denied almost everybody access to the Vedas and the Upanishads. He was sarcastic that the number of defenders at the Battle of Plassey was outnumbered by the audience, which wanted to know the outcome but would not participate in the battle. When the former sarsanghchalak of the RSS, Balasaheb Deoras, passed away, Vajpayee recalled that the former had said that if untouchability was not a sin, then nothing could be a sin. These divisions had to go.The second key driver in his mental make-up was a strong belief in Hindu traditions, but more in the cultural and philosophical sense rather than a religious or ritualistic sense. Vajpayee, like others from the RSS, held that the concept of “religion” was alien to India. What India had was different methods of worship, or upasana padhati, none of which had a monopoly on truth. The obverse side to this worldview was that loyalty to the motherland should trump any belief system. That is how they defined the term “Hindu”. This did mean that the followers of the Abrahamic faiths, which believe that they alone possess a monopoly on truth, and generally in the dominance of religious beliefs over civic nationalism, would have difficulty in accepting this hierarchy of systems. Vajpayee was also clear that the State should not discriminate on the basis of beliefs, rather it should respect all belief systems since they were a part of society.The third strong pillar of Vajpayee’s worldview was his obvious discomfort with conversions. He recalled, during a longish speech in Pune in 1988 felicitating the writer Pu La Deshpande, that even though Indonesia and Afghanistan had become Muslim, they had not given up their pre-Islamic heritage. He specifically mentioned that the Ramayana was part of Indonesia’s living traditions, and wondered why religious conversion meant discarding of cultural and historical heritage. Without specifically saying it, one can impute his meaning, which was that Muslims particularly should own up to Indian traditions, a sentiment that Jawaharlal Nehru conveyed to the students of Aligarh Muslim University on January 24, 1948. Nehru had said then that he was proud of India’s heritage and of “our ancestors who gave us an intellectual and cultural pre-eminence”. He then went on to question the Aligarh students and asked whether they felt the same or did they feel that this heritage was alien to them?Fourth, Vajpayee’s worldview was deeply rooted in the soil of India, and its literary traditions helped forge his mental make-up. The writers and works that he admired included Tulsidas’ Ramacharitmanas, Jaishankar Prasad’s Kamayani, Nirala’s Ram ki Shakti Puja and the poems of Mahadevi Verma. Premchand’s realism impacted him deeply. Other favourites included Jainendra (Patni aur Preyasi), Ageya (Shekhar: Ek Jeevani) and the many works of Vrindavan Verma, which included historical tales and folklore of his and Vajpayee’s Brajbhumi. These writers reminded him of past glories but also forced him to think about the challenges that needed to be overcome.And finally, Vajpayee seemed convinced that India was destined for greatness and, that, in fact, greatness was denied to it. The past was important to ground us but not to imprison us. Politically, the Cold War had ended and the emerging world seemed hostile to India. Vajpayee was able to fashion an approach to the United States (US) even as he defied it and went ahead with the nuclear tests. But he wanted India and the US to be on the same side since he foresaw that the rise of China would be deeply unsettling. He was open to improving relations with China but ultimately, believed India and the US were “natural allies”. Economically, he wanted to unshackle India’s entrepreneurial spirits. He was a natural reformer and made known his distaste for the licence permit raj, which held India back.Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a complex political figure — but there is little doubt that his complex worldview, which defies easy categorisations, helped shape the India of today.

25-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC sentences school teacher to 20 years for sexually assaulting three minors||Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has reversed the acquittal of a school teacher on the charge of sexually assaulting three of his minor girl students and sentenced him to 20 years rigorous imprisonment, without any parole or furlough leave in the first decade of his jail term.The bench of justice ZA Haq and justice Amit Borkar convicted the teacher, Gopal Janbandu, primarily on the strength of the testimony of the survivors.According to the prosecution, on December 2, 2017, one of the three survivors informed her mother about intermittent sexual assaults being committed by the teacher on her and two other students from her class, during school recess. The women then spoke to parents of the two other girls and they lodged police complaints.Jalbandu was arrested and prosecuted. The prosecution examined 12 witnesses, including the three survivors, but on January 5, 2019, an additional sessions judge at Gondia acquitted the teacher of all the charges levelled against him - rape under section 376 of Indian Penal Code and penetrative and aggravated sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012.The survivors had in detail explained their ordeals while testifying before the special Pocso court. But, special court disbelieved them and acquitted the teacher, saying the cumulative effect of their testimonies was that the teacher sexually assaulted them simultaneously, which according to the trial court was highly improbable.The state government had moved HC, appealing against the acquittal. Acting on the appeal, HC disapproved the trial court’s approach, saying its conclusion was based on misreading testimonies of the survivors.“This approach of the learned trial judge in disbelieving victim girl of 10 years, in our opinion, is a gross case of perversity,” said HC. “The reason for brushing aside the testimony of the victim, who had gone through the trauma of aggravated sexual assault shows complete insensitivity on the part of the learned trial judge,” the bench added.HC, on the contrary, found that the evidence of the survivors inspired confidence and was even corroborated by the evidence of some other witnesses in the case, and reversed the teacher’s acquittal. The court convicted him for rape and aggravated penetrative sexual assault and sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment.HC also imposed a fine of ₹1.80 lakh on the teacher, Gopal Janbandu, and directed that the fine amount be recovered as arrears of land revenue from him if he fails to pay the fine amount. The teacher will not get furlough or parole even during the remaining term, if the fine is not recovered, even as arrears of land revenue.HC also disapproved the trial court’s view that the presumption of guilt under section 29 of the Pocso Act comes into play only when the prosecution proves its case beyond reasonable doubts. HC said the view was erroneous and the presumption comes into play as the prosecution proves foundational facts. “This finding by the trial court is based on a complete misconception of law on sections 29 and 30 of the said Act,” said the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-sentences-school-teacher-to-20-years-for-sexually-assaulting-three-minors/story-EWAJ2l9HjHKKsXZ2IRT9ML.html

Residents left for nearby getaways such as Pune, Alibag, Lonavala and Mahabaleshwar to enjoy the holiday. Many others left for their native places in Raigad, Satara, Ratnagiri, among others. On Friday, traffic congestion started mainly near Khalapur, Khopoli and some other places in Raigad. Subhash Pujari, assistant police inspector of the state highway traffic, said, “Usually, a large number of people travel outside the city at night on the eve of a long weekend. However, because of the night curfew imposed by the government, people left their homes on Friday morning.” The traffic movement was extremely slow after 9am as more vehicles hit the road.“The problem was mainly on the Mumbai-Pune lane. There were no traffic congestions on the Pune-Mumbai lane. The traffic department had to deploy extra manpower to tackle the situation, which got better after 3pm,” said Pujari. “The Mumbai-Pune Expressway usually witnesses more traffic every Saturday and Sunday. This time, however, the situation got worse as citizens have a long weekend ahead,” said a senior officer from Raigad police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/long-weekend-leads-to-traffic-snarls-on-mumbai-pune-expressway/story-C4WnaJh7xgoMzgDyEXO3GK.html

Altaf Bukhari welcomes them into Party-fold,” announced Apni Party while posting the pictures of the independent candidates along with party president Altaf Bukhari.So far, three independent candidates — two from Shopian and one from Srinagar districts — have joined Apni Party. With this, the party now has four members in the 14-member council, the highest any party has in Srinagar district.However, the NC leadership has blamed the administration for forcing independent candidates to join Apni Party.Taking a dig at newly elected members of Apni Party, Omar tweeted that one of them got elected on NC mandate. “This explains why our leaders in Shopian district are being put under “preventive arrest” by the police. J&K police and the administration are facilitating horse trading and defections. The woman shown here joining the BJP’s B-team contested and won elections on a NC mandate,” Omar wrote.Omar went on to tweet that the administration was playing partisan to help the ‘ruling party’.“Shame on this administration for playing partisan politics to curry favour with the ruling party and their stooges. These parties couldn’t win seats so now they are using money/muscle/threats and government coercion to make up the numbers. So much for “democracy has won!” Omar said.The NC has also alleged that two prominent leaders have been arrested in south Kashmir and Bandipora district as the administration is trying to influence independent candidates. Three PDP leaders were arrested by the police a day before the results of DDC polls were announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/independents-join-apni-party-omar-says-one-of-2-won-on-nc-mandate/story-A9RrU8gNjGJzfWF2iOJ5aI.html

Regional provident fund commissioner (zone 2), Sushant Kandwal, said that the number of PF accounts, in which contributions were deposited, has gone down to a little over 650,000 in October. “Contributions have not been made to as many as 1,20,673 PF accounts as compared to February. Even the difference between the amount deposited in February and October in PF accounts of Noida region is over Rs 23.22 crore,” he said. Entrepreneurs also agreed that decline in PF contribution indicates that people have lost their jobs during the pandemic. Lalit Thukral, chairman of Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC), said that most of the industrial units in GB Nagar district are still running with limited capacity and the maximum strength of a unit is not more than 50% in any unit. “We’ve not fired any of our employees, not even at the time of complete lockdown. Most of our workers, who preferred to go home leaving their jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic, have not resumed their duties yet. It is very natural that PF deposits are directly proportional to number of employees,” he said. Echoing similar views, Neeraj Prakash, who runs an apparel export company in Noida, said that the number of employees has started increasing in all industrial units. “I hope that once the units start running with full strength, there will be a huge surge in employment and PF contributions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/over-120k-people-lose-jobs-during-covid-19-pandemic-in-gautam-budh-nagar/story-qMkm2lvuiJZmbuotSmt64J.html

The announcements were being made from the vehicles, but people manning the vehicles didn’t come to the doorsteps to collect garbage.”In some areas, residents complained that MC vehicles didn’t even turn up. Colonel Gursewak Singh (retd), adviser of the Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC), said, “At Modern Housing Complex, Sector 13, no MC vehicles came to collect garbage.”Some garbage collectors have started working with the MC manning the vehicles. Meanwhile, another section continued to collect the garbage from people’s houses.Shemsher Lohitya, president, Akhil Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangathan, said, “Our members collected garbage from many areas like sectors 8, 9, 10, 16, 27 and 28. People preferred us over the MC vehicles.” He added that the vehicles mostly returned empty as people didn’t use them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/segregated-waste-collection-in-chandigarh-remains-plagued-with-issues/story-qokTc9ybsWSpxTq5LquCHK.html
25-12-2020||Noida||Gzb health team struggles with 35 from UK: 30 wrong addresses, 5 refuse test||Thirty travellers from the United Kingdom (UK) had given wrong addresses, while five others refused to give their samples for Covid-19 testing, said Ghaziabad chief medical officer (CMO).A new variant of the virus, VUI-202012/01, was detected in the UK earlier this month that was found to be highly transmissible. The state government in its standard operating procedure (SOP) had directed directed that those who have arrived from that country between November 23 and December 8 had to be in 28-day isolation and tested using the RT-PCR method if they showed symptoms. Those who came later would need to be tested mandatorily.Health department officials said that they had a list of 231 confirmed travellers who mentioned Ghaziabad as their destination address, but 76 of them were not found as they had either left for their home districts or even returned to the UK. “Of the 231, people our teams traced 221 out of which samples of 110 have been collected so far while samples of 111 are pending. Of the 110 samples tested, we have received 26 test reports and all were negative. Of the 111, 76 travellers will be cross-notified to their home districts. With the pending 35 we have major issue as five of these were found at home and have outrightly denied giving any samples. The addresses of other 30 could not be traced as they are wrong,” said Dr NK Gupta, CMO. The department had initially received a list of 334 travellers who had a Ghaziabad address. “Of the 334, there was double entry of 103 names. So, after removing them, we got the list of 231. Now, we are left with no option but to give the names of 35 persons to the police who will intervene and will also track people whose addresses could not be found,” Dr Gupta, added. The UP government has already laid down set of SOPs and have laid special emphasis on tracking of those travellers who have returned from UK on December 9 or thereafter. As per the SOP, such people will mandatorily get tests done through the RT-PCR method and will stay in home quarantine. Once their tests turn positive, they will be isolated in facility and a part of their sample will also be sent for genome sequencing to figure out if they are infected with prevalent variant of Sars-Cov-2 or the latest variant, VUI-202012/01. The health department has already come up with separate isolation wards at Sanjay Nagar and Santosh Medical hospitals while the private hospitals have also been asked to come up with a separate facility isolation ward for travellers whose RT-PCR test indicates positive result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gzb-health-team-struggles-with-35-from-uk-30-wrong-addresses-5-refuse-test/story-FwFudxeSRuoKxlU6esWlzJ.html
25-12-2020||Noida||Short supply of rapid kits hits overall testing in December, affects focussed testing as well||The Covid-19 focussed testing activity in the district has taken a hit as health department officials said that they are facing “short supply” of rapid antigen kits. The focussed testing is getting done in areas having high caseload on directions of the state government. The official records also indicate that the overall daily average testing by rapid kits is the lowest in December.In the first 20 days of the focussed testing drive taken up in December in high caseload areas of Indirapuram, Vasundhara, Vaishali and Raj Nagar, among others, a total of 20,400 tests were conducted with the help of rapid antigen kits and yielded 226 positive cases. However, during the initial three days of the drive, the health department conducted on average about 1,420 tests per day and later the rapid antigen tests fell down to an average of 1,038 tests per day. In the last two days of the period, the department could conduct only 282 average tests per day. “The short supply of rapid antigen kits has affected the focussed testing as well as the overall testing. Whenever we send vehicles for procurement, we get only 5,000-6,000 kits which get exhausted in 3-4 days. There is a short supply of and we are trying to increase our RT-PCR testing instead,” said an officer from the district health department who wished not to be named. Apart from impacting the focussed testing, the shortage of rapid antigen kits has also affected the overall testing in December.The use of rapid antigen kits was started on June 26 and the department conducted 1,493 rapid tests in that month. According to the district health department data, a total of 59,765 rapid antigen tests (with daily average of 1,928) were conducted in July, 51637 (daily average 1,666) in August, 72904 (2,430) in September, 69553 (2244) in October and 66900 (2230) in November. The figure has dropped down considerably to just 34,679 tests in first 24 days of December, with the daily average of 1,445, which is the lowest. On the other hand, the focussed testing through RT-PCR method is almost consistent with an average of about 520 tests per day. During the first 20 days of December, a total of 10,403 RT-PCR tests were conducted which resulted in 244 positive cases. “In December, there has been considerable decline in number of new cases. Since rapid kits are in short supply, we are now focussing that majority of testing gets conducted through RT-PCR method which has more sensitivity. So, we will now make use of rapid kits in cases where immediate results are required, like in cases of deliveries or patients having symptoms,” said Ajay Shankar Padney, district magistrate. The experts said that more rapid kits should be procured and the testing should not be allowed to drop down for another couple of months. “More testing, especially the focussed testing, should continue with the help of rapid antigen kits and the number of tests should not be allowed to drop down. Rapid kits give fast results, while in Ghaziabad it generally takes 2-3 days to get RT-PCR test reports,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “If the test results of RT-PCR can be turned around to a day or less, then increasing the RT-PCR tests will be more feasible. Otherwise, rapid antigen tests should also be taken up and more stocks should be procured,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/short-supply-of-rapid-kits-hits-overall-testing-in-december-affects-focussed-testing-as-well/story-xU8wQynvPJQw7D1aZrp0gL.html

25-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Transport department launches drive for reflective tapes on vehicles||Noida: To cut down on accidents at night, the Gautam Budh Nagar transport department has launched a drive to ensure all heavy and commercial vehicles must have reflective tapes. These tapes play an important role in road safety during the foggy weather conditions, the officials said, adding that there is a fine of ₹10,000 for vehicles violating the rule. Prashant Tiwari, assistant regional transport officer (enforcement), said that during the winter, fog reduces visibility and often leads to accidents. “We have launched an enforcement and awareness drive to paste reflective tapes on the vehicles. We are also advising people to drive carefully during the inclement weather,” he said. The move comes in the wake of some accidents on the Yamuna Expressway in the past few weeks. Tiwari said that the reflective tapes are designed to enhance visibility in low light and night conditions. “When the back lights of vehicles do not function properly, the reflectors play an important role in alerting commuters driving in the same direction,” he said. The transport official said that the department will soon organise a camp near Phool Mandi in Phase 2 as a number of heavy commercial vehicles visit the place. Gautam Budh Nagar has around 7.34 lakh vehicles registered. The district transport department has 4,50,159 two-wheelers, 2,11,853 four-wheelers (private), 2,210 two-wheelers (commercial), 14,392 cabs, 17,720 goods carrier, 18,393 autos, 5,045 e-rickshaws, 3,206 buses, 1,332 school buses, 490 ambulances, 7,291 tractors and 2,730 other vehicles registered with it. All the commercial vehicles need reflective tapes. Ashutosh Singh, Noida traffic inspector, said that the traffic police have also planned the enforcement drive for reflective tapes. “We will coordinate with the transport department and conduct the programme jointly,” he said.Gautam Budh Nagar had recorded 162 deaths and 205 injuries in 317 accidents from March 1 to September 15 this year. During the same period in 2019, 278 people died while 486 people were injured in 653 accidents in the district. “The fall in accidents and fatalities this year is due to coronavirus outbreak as many have restricted themselves indoors,” said Tiwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-transport-department-launches-drive-for-reflective-tapes-on-vehicles/story-25xzQhsnumPMZFmXL53wqL.html

However, despite the improvement, Ghaziabad and Noida continued to be the top-two cities in the country with the worst. Greater Noida was the fourth most polluted and neighbouring Bulandshahr was third of the 127 cities mapped on Friday. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale from 0 to 500, on Friday was 386, as against 441 and 462 on Thursday and Wednesday, respectively.

The AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. The India Meteorological Department forecasts better ventilation and wind speed on Saturday and Sunday leading to further improvement. “The wind speed on Thursday reached up to 18 kmph during the afternoon, while for the entire day it was around 15 kmph on an average. Which is better than 4-5 kmph a day earlier. The wind speed may pickup on Saturday as well leading to further improvement but will soon start falling towards the year end,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.

25-12-2020||Chandigarh||Dengue cases in Chandigarh remain below 300 for second consecutive year||The number of dengue infections in the city dropped by 8% this year and the absolute number remained below 300 for a second consecutive year, official data shows.The cases of dengue reported in the city had seen a spurt in November; 46% of the total 262 cases of the mosquito-borne viral disease came in the same month. The number, however, decreased to 30 in December.Compared to the 286 cases last year, the figure stands at 262 till December 25.The pattern of the last six years shows that dengue cases are unevenly reported through the year, and the cases begin to rise after September and reach a peak in November and thereafter see a downfall in December.This year, as many as 19 cases were reported in September followed by 89 cases in October, which went up to 121 in November. Last year, too, a similar trend was reported with 30 cases being reported in September followed by 82 and 124 in the months of October and November, respectively.However, compared to 17 cases in December last year, the number of cases are touching 30 so far this month.“The cases would have decreased further if the employees involved in the fogging process had visited the homes and checked for possible sources like coolers, tyres, refrigerator plates etc. Even though there was stiff resistance, fogging was carried out in all possible manner especially in the vulnerable areas,” a senior official of the UT health department, wishing anonymity, said.Most of the dengue cases were reported from Manimajra and Bapu Dham Colony, officials said.“The life-cycle of the mosquito starts in the later parts of August and September and reaches the adult stage in November when they bite the most. Additional reason for the spike in November is that conditions are most conducive inside the houses due to relatively high temperature,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director of the UT health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dengue-cases-in-chandigarh-remain-below-300-for-second-consecutive-year/story-22YpFSopvZl1uen2oGyzLN.html
25-12-2020||Noida||After PM’s address, more farmers join protest at UP Gate to continue agitation against farm laws||On the day the Prime Minister released the next instalment of financial benefits under the ‘PM Kisan Samman Nidhi’ through video conferencing, farmer protesters at UP Gate reiterated their demand for the repeal of the three new farm laws. Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab are part of the ongoing agitation at UP-Gate since November 28. Coinciding with PM Modi’s programme, Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Piyush Goyal was in western UP’s Hapur district and said that some of the opposition parties were trying to mislead the farmers over new laws. “When every trader, industrialist or a businessman is free to sell their product across the country or outside at any time or at any price, why should farmers remain in restrictions about where to sell and when to sell. So, these laws have tried to free farmers from old practices and want to give them freedom so that they get proper price. I remember that the day the ordinance was passed, newspapers in UP reported that Baba Tikait had demanded similar changes 27 years ago and these have been fulfilled by PM Modi,” Goyal told gathering in Hapur. ‘Baba Tikait’ refers to Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU) founder leader Mahendra Singh Tikait. The BKU has major influence on farmers in western Uttar Pradesh and its leaders ate also spearheading the ongoing protest at UP-Gate. Many Union Ministers, MPs were sent to different areas to join events coinciding with PM’s programme. “Some opposition parties are trying to mislead farmers and some wrong powers are putting farmers in dark and trying to spread misinformation. These laws will give more opportunities to farmers and old practice will not be touched. Entire country, especially the farmers in UP, have accepted the laws while people are trying to mislead farmers in an area. I hope people will understand,” Goyal said. Gaurav Tikait, a young farmer leader who is also son of BKU national president, Naresh Tikait, countered Goyal’s statements about ‘Baba Tiakit.’ “Chaudhay Sahab (Mahendra Singh Tikait) said that everyone should be able to sell his crop anywhere. Why not the government brings out one rate and one law on MSP? It should be one nation, one crop and one rate. For instance, if a farmer from Muzaffarnagar can get a good price, why will be go to other cities. Also, there is no point in saying that the agitation is run by opposition parties, this way they will lose their voters just because they want to favour corporates. We voted for them and outcome of this movement will impact next elections,” he said at UP-Gate. BKU’s state president, Rajbir Singh Jadaun, said that the government nowadays sees everything in political perspective. “They did not call us political when they wanted votes. The DBT amount transferred to farmers is not ‘Ehsaan’ (favour). The amount should increase and should be respectable. The situations 30 years ago were different. There are groups who have surfaced recently and supporting the new laws. It should be checked who are these people and whether they are farmers or not,” Jadaun, added. Hundreds of BKU volunteers joined the protests at UP-Gate on Friday and their leaders said that hundreds of more tractor-trolleys were on way to join the protest from Uttarakhand. Despite call for talks, the farmers have maintained that they want repeal of three new laws. At least six talks between the farmers’ leaders and government representatives have so far failed to break the deadlock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-pm-s-address-more-farmers-join-protest-at-up-gate-to-continue-agitation-against-farm-laws/story-mgbc4kwdzMHdACo9Z60OYL.html
25-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh celebrates low-key Christmas||Residents of the city on Friday celebrated a low-key Christmas amid the pandemic this year as various churches of the city adopted a slew of measures to ensure that people could come pray while maintaining Covid-19 protocol.The Christ the King Cathedral in Sector 19 was decked with lights while people could be seen entering the church in a long queue. Bishop Ignatius Mascarenhas of the Roman Catholic Church, Simla and Chandigarh Diocese, said, “We conducted a morning service at 8.30am. The same service was also carried out in Hindi at 10am along with a mass.” He added that he had asked many people to pray from home and to celebrate the festival as simply as possible.At the CNI Church in Sector 18, general secretary Parkash Masih said, the morning service was held online this year, and in the afternoon people came to church just to pray for a few minutes: “Instead of lunch, we prepared sealed portable handouts for people to take home.” The service was performed by Reverend Denzal Peoples.Midnight mass was also organised in a staggered manner to ensure crowding doesn’t take place. Instead of one midnight mass at the Sector 19 church, three services were held at 5.30pm, 7pm and 9pm on Christmas Eve.The Tricity Churches Association also organised services throughout the tricity. President Lawrence Malik said all churches said a special prayer for all Covid warriors who had worked throughout the year.At Jeevan Parivartan Kendra Church in Maloya, pastor Bashir Gill conducted the service and special programmes were organised by children and women there.Service on New YearAfter Christmas, the churches will also be organising special services for New Year’s Eve, but the timing of the services is likely to be changed. As per Bishop Ignatius, there won’t be a midnight service on New Year’s Eve, instead services will be held in a staggered manner on December 31. On January 1, too, two services will be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-celebrates-low-key-christmas/story-YPUJDgO9yFwyO2PnyBDVcL.html
25-12-2020||City||Chairman, director of Dwarka private school summoned as accused in connection with minor’s sexual assault||New Delhi: A Delhi court has summoned the chaiman and director of a private school Dwarka, as accused in connection with the sexual assault of a four-and-a-half-year old girl in 2017 by her classmate of the same age.The court emphasised that it was their responsibility to ensure that all classrooms had CCTV cameras in accordance with the guidelines of the Delhi government’s directorate of education. The incident, according to the chargesheet, had taken place inside a classroom but there was no evidence, in the absence of CCTV cameras.The court said “there has been a prima facie neglect by the chairman towards his duty in installation of the CCTV cameras” as it rejected the investigating officer’s decision to not make the duo as accused for want of sufficient evidence.Additional sessions judge Purva Sareen directed the chairman and the director to appear before the court on February 24 next year after the mother of the child victim had filed a protest petition against the supplementary charge sheet filed, where both were not named as accused for lack of sufficient evidence.The judge, in their December 24 order, said “it goes without saying that if a parent sends a child to the school, the school authorities have to ensure the safety and security of the child”.“In my considered opinion, it was also a responsibility of the chairman and the director to ensure that all the guidelines of the directorate of education which had been made compulsory for the safety and security of the children had to be followed and as the classroom had no CCTV cameras and the same was against the guidelines,” the court said.On September 15, 2017, the DoE had made it mandatory to install a sufficient number of CCTV cameras in school premises so as to mandatorily cover all classrooms, labs, corridor, parking, library, vacant rooms, areas outside washrooms and all isolated areas. The order was passed to ensure 360 degree coverage of the entire school premises.The city government had also directed that the CCTV camera should be functional around-the-clock, along with a recording facility of minimum 15 days or above.The court noted that as per the final report of the police, the CCTV footage of only the ground, main gate and corridor were given to the investigating officer by the school.“Other this footage, no other footage was provided by the school and as per the final report filed by the IO, no CCTV had been installed in the school which was against the DOE recommendation,” the court said.According to the FIR filed by the victim’s mother, the girl had complained to the school teacher through a text message of the sexual assault on her daughter by her classmate on November 17, 2017 inside the classroom.She had alleged that she had informed the school authorities who allegedly did not cooperate with her and instead asked her to give a written complaint. Since her daughter’s pain did not subside, she rushed her to a hospital where she was treated as well as a medico-legal case made. A police case was then registered.The mother alleged that there was no class teacher or even an helper, or help, in either the classroom or washroom at the time of the assault. She said her daughter’s delayed exit from the classroom, as she saw in CCTV footage, corroborated the sexual assault allegation.No charge had been invoked against the boy since the juvenile justice law gives complete immunity from prosecution to children below seven years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chairman-director-of-dwarka-private-school-summoned-as-accused-in-connection-with-minor-s-sexual-assault/story-OtvU8WQfMn8RqGNPeRm3zL.html

The MC charges property tax at the rate of ₹10 per square foot from institutional buildings.“Institutions that are involved solely for public causes and for the benefit of the society, with no motive of profit generation, should not be burdened with tax liabilities,” said an MC official, privy to the development.The MC gives property tax exemptions to the economically weaker sections, defence personnel and veterans, widows, differently-abled people entitled for benefits under the I-T Act and religious institutions (except areas being used for commercial activity).MC panel recommendationsThe matter was placed before the MC House’s tax assessment committee for the first time on September 12, 2019, and was approved.The recommendations of the committee were placed before the MC General House in its meeting held on November 26, 2019. But the House considered and deferred the agenda.Again the matter was placed in the tax assessment committee on December 18, and the committee unanimously decided to exempt charitable institutions.Certain conditions for the institutions to avail the exemption were, however, laid down.Must be registered under Charitable Endowment ActThe committee stated that such an institution should be registered under the Charitable Endowment Act. The institutional building must have the benefit of deduction under sections 12AB and 80G of the Income Tax Act.No commercial activityThe exemption will be given only if there is no commercial activity being carried out from the premises of an institution seeking such an exemption. The institution would also have to give an undertaking to the MC that no commercial activity was being carried out. If at any stage any commercial activity is noticed, the institution will be liable to pay full tax from the date of exemption.The agenda for giving exemption to charitable institutions will now be placed before the MC General House for its approval on December 31.In 2019-20, the MC had collected ₹52 crore in tax, covering over 80% assessees across all categories. This year, the MC has already crossed its target of ₹49 crore in property tax collections, and has revised it to ₹54 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/charitable-institutions-to-be-exempted-from-property-tax-chandigarh-mc/story-Ocr8BkpPJZaFStEydcMxXI.html

The institute would continue to extend its full support to the police in the investigation,” she said. Manipal Sharma alleged that, before getting retired on July 31 this year after 37 years of service at the IIT, he raised the issue before the administrators for taking action on it but they didn’t pay any heed to it, instead behaved improperly against him. It was then he filed the petition before the court to seek action. HT has a copy of the three-page order. The Roorkee Kotwali police station, which has been directed by the court to register a case, is, however, yet to register a case.

25-12-2020||Gurugram||Farmers block second carriageway of NH 48 after police stop them from entering Haryana||Farmers camping on the Delhi-Jaipur national highway at Jaisinghpur Khera to protest against the new farm laws on Friday blocked the second carriageway of the Delhi-Jaipur national highway after Rewari police prevented them from crossing the border. One carriageway of the Delhi-Jaipur national highway has been occupied by protesting farmers since December 13. Protesting farmers had earlier announced that they would start proceeding towards Delhi on Friday, signalling their intent to further escalate the ongoing agitation. However, amid heavy police presence and barricading, farmers could not enter Haryana as planned. Farmers from across the country have been protesting against the three new farm laws that were passed by the Centre in September this year. They fear that the new laws will put them at the mercy of corporations and put an end to the minimum support price MSP on important crops. In order to join the farmers’ agitation in Delhi, farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana, and Gujarat had started proceeding towards the national capital earlier this month, but were stopped by the Rewari police at the Haryana-Rajasthan border. Since then, they have been protesting at Jaisinghpur Khera, located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district, at the Rajasthan-Haryana border, for the past 13 days. On Friday, over a thousand farmers from Maharashtra also reached Jaisinghpur Khera and joined the agitation. “Hundreds of farmers from Maharashtra also reached here in the morning while we were preparing to march towards Delhi. When all the farmers started walking towards Delhi, the Haryana Police installed barricades on the other carriageway of NH-8 to prevent us from moving forward. In response, farmers are now peacefully camping on the other carriageway as well. We will sit here till the Haryana government allows us to move forward,” said Sanjay Madhav, member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan. Farmers said that they were going to Delhi in protest against the new laws in a peaceful manner, but the Haryana government was blocking their way. “Our aim has always been to reach Delhi. The Haryana government has been blocking our path. We will protest peacefully till we are allowed to move to Delhi,” said Madhav. With both the carriageways of the national highway being blocked, the Gurugram police is diverting traffic headed towards Jaipur from Delhi at Bilaspur and Kapdiwas Chowk. The blocking of road also led to heavy congestion and the city police had to divert traffic to adjoining link roads from the national highway. Usha Kundu, assistant commissioner of police (headquarters), said that the traffic movement was slowed down on expressway on Friday as both the carriageways near the Rewari border connecting to Rajasthan were blocked. “Protestors who wanted to head towards Delhi had gathered near the expressway,” said Kundu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-block-second-carriageway-of-nh-48-after-police-stop-them-from-entering-haryana/story-s1IqwP8AUb4yvjw5FxvqII.html
25-12-2020||Gurugram||21 pvt hospitals added as Covid-19 vaccination sites||At least 21 big private hospitals of the city will be designated as session sites for Covid-19 vaccination, according to district health department officials. These sites will be in addition to 58 sites already identified by the department for inoculation of the vaccine. Officials said that the number of session sites will increase further as spacious locations at block level are being identified.“More than 32,000 health care workers are to be vaccinated in the first phase. In all likelihood, they will be vaccinated at these hospitals,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. “The other 58 sites are mostly schools, community centres and community health centres. More such sites are being traced where crowd can be easily managed, while maintaining social distancing,” said Singh, adding that vaccination is likely to place three days in a week without affecting the routine immunisation programmes already running.According to him, private hospitals have also been designated as Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) centres.An Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) is an untoward medical occurrence following immunisation, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine, as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO). There are three categories of adverse events. Minor AEFI includes common reactions like pain and swelling at the injection site, fever and irritability. Second is severe AEFI which can be disabling and rarely life threatening but do not lead to long term problems, while the serious AEFI can require hospitalisation and may cause death. Serious cases are extremely rare since vaccines are introduced only after meeting stringent safety guidelines during vaccine trials. As per Covid-19 vaccine guidelines, beneficiaries are to observed at the session site for 30 minutes post-vaccination to detect, manage and treat immediate adverse reactions, if any. For this an AEFI management centre has to be identified in each block, which will be linked with the session site. At the session site, the vaccine beneficiaries will be counselled about these events.“These private hospitals will serve as AEFI centres. Also, they will be linked with other session sites in their nearby areas to tackle cases of adverse events,” said Singh, who was part of the meeting with AEFI committee members on Friday. The district level AEFI committee was revamped on December 7, increasing its strength from 12 members to 16 members. Expert in neurology, cardiology and pulmonology have been included in the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/21-pvt-hospitals-added-as-covid-19-vaccination-sites/story-UWm2evXB0tTTcRkRfMLplN.html

The family of the girl alleged that the sarpanch did not get a boundary wall constructed following which the girl, who was playing outside the house, fell in the pond, said police. According to the police, they received a call from hospital that a girl had died due to drowning, following which a team from Sector 65 police station visited civil hospital. The body was sent for post mortem. Satish Kumar, father of the deceased, said that he drives an auto-rickshaw and has been living with his wife and four children in the village for the last many years. On Thursday when he returned from work around 12.30 pm, he found his younger daughter missing. “I asked my wife about the children and she said they are playing outside. Around 12.45pm all children returned home, but Madhu was nowhere to be seen. I went out in her search and found her struggling to stay afloat in the pond,” he said. Kumar said he raised the alarm and shouted for his brother. They jumped inside and fished the girl out. She was still breathing “We took her to a private hospital in Badshahpur, where doctor declared her brought dead,” he said. The pond has no boundary walls and the villagers have several times requested the sarpanch to get it constructed as its risked the lives of children playing in the area. But all their requests apparently fell on deaf ears, the father of the victim alleged. A case under section 304 A(causing death by negligence) was registered against Brahm Prakash Tyagi, village sarpanch at Sector 65 police station on Thursday, said police. Tyagi said that the families are living on unauthorised area adjacent to the pond and authorities have multiple times asked them to vacate the area. “Police have booked me for negligence but I played no role nor was I in the village when the incident took place. This is shocking that a sarpanch is held responsible for anyone’s death in the village. The parents should equally be held responsible and when they knew there is no boundary wall, why did they allow their child to play there,” Tyagi said. The body was handed over to the family members after the post mortem, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sarpanch-booked-for-negligence-after-five-year-old-drowns-in-sector-64/story-6IMNq5OmnEmxC9KXpldR6M.html

The Centre had later issued guidelines that mandated tracing of monitoring of all travellers who arrived in the country from November 25 and compulsory RT-PCR testing of everyone who arrived after December 9.The district health department has also directed private labs to directly collect samples from homes when approached by any suspected case having a travel history to the UK.The state health department on Thursday night received a comprehensive list of 695 travellers who arrived in Gurugram from the UK in the last four weeks. Of these, at least 438 travellers arrived after December 9 and over 257 people arrived between November 25 and December 8. Of the 438, the health department has to collect samples of 359. The health teams are also in the process of identifying those who arrived before December 9.Officials, however, did not share much information about it. “After removing duplication from the list of 438, there are 407 travellers who are under monitoring,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. “Of these, 48 belong to other states or districts but had given a Gurugram address. Their names have been shared with the state government.

25-12-2020||Gurugram||City air continues to be ‘very poor’ for fourth day in a row||Air quality in the city remained “very poor” for the fourth consecutive day on Friday, recording 302 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin. This was a marginal improvement from the previous day’s recording of 361 in the same category. The level of particulate matter (PM) 2.5, the city’s primary pollutant, was 427.8 µg/m³ on Friday, as per the data recorded by the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to deteriorate marginally owing to slow winds and poor ventilation but remain in the “very poor” category on Saturday. Air quality is expected to stay in the upper end of the “very poor” to “severe category” on Sunday. Subsequently, air quality is likely to remain in the “very poor” category over the next five days. Experts attributed the marginal improvement in air quality to stronger surface winds, which aided ventilation thereby resulting in improvement in air quality. On Friday, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 6.5 degrees Celsius — a slight decrease from Thursday’s 6 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature on Friday was recorded at 21.1 degrees Celsius, a degree below 22.3 degrees Celsius the previous day. The maximum temperature is expected to stay around 23 degrees on Sunday while the minimum temperature is expected to hover around 6 degrees, as per the IMD’s weekly forecast. Dense fog is expected to prevail in the morning hours followed by clear skies during the day as per the forecast. Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist, said that winds blowing at eight to ten kilometres per hour could have aided the improved movement of pollutants.As per the IMD’s official bulletin issued on Friday, isolated dense fog over Haryana is likely in the morning hours on Saturday. Further, an active Western Disturbance is likely to affect Western Himalayan Region and adjoining plains of northwest India from December 27. Dense fog conditions over Punjab and Haryana are likely to improve further under the impact of the Western Disturbance, stated the bulletin. Kuldeep Shrivastava, heads of the IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said that the approaching Western Disturbance may cause light rain in Delhi-NCR on December 27 following which temperatures were likely to fall again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-air-continues-to-be-very-poor-for-fourth-day-in-a-row/story-ScYHnSTwpdVPwoHy7FUkZJ.html
25-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG to convert Sector 23 market into a polythene-free zone||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is looking to turn the Sector 23 market into a polythene-free zone. This is the first public area in the city where the MCG is trying out such an initiative.As per MCG officials, the market has more than 120 shops and 60 street vendors, who cumulatively use around 40 kilograms of polythene every day.For this transformation, MCG has distributed more than 9,000 bags in the market, all sourced from its recently opened cloth bag bank. Further, officials have also been deputed at the market for enforcement measures.“The process for converting Sector 23 market into a polythene free area has started. In the first stage, all shopkeepers have been sensitised about the issue. They have been told that any polythene use will invite penalties. We have already distributed the first round of cloth bags to shopkeepers and street vendors for this purpose,” said Dheeraj Kumar, joint commissioner, Swachh Bharat Mission, MCG.Located just near the Delhi border, the Sector 23 market has restaurants, eateries, jewellers, electronic, clothing, daily need shops, among others. People living in the sector, residents from Palam Vihar and Bijwasan in Delhi are also frequent visitors to the market.Kumar further said that the MCG will declare the market as polythene-free by next month and have already deputed staff in the market to keep constant vigilance. He said that after the market is declared polythene-free, MCG will carry out surprise checks at random to ensure the shopkeepers are not violating their orders.In addition, depending on the size of the bag, the shopkeepers will have to pay a nominal fee to the MCG’s cloth bag bank for procuring the same. As per MCG officials, the price of their cloth bag varies from ₹3 to ₹20, depending on the size.“Simultaneously, we are also looking to limit the use of plastic in the market. In the initial phase, only single-use plastic would be permitted, and gradually a complete ban will be enforced. We are adopting this shift in a steady manner so that shopkeepers have enough time to adapt to the changes,” said Kumar.MCG officials said that the Sector 23 market area will serve as a pilot project for turning any public area into a polythene-free zone. Based on their learning, this model will then be replicated to markets across the city, with localised modifications, said MCG officials.“Replacing cloth bags with polythene has been seamless. Both of them can be used for carrying items. If the MCG offers us a convenient alternative to plastic bags, we will incorporate the same. Otherwise, it will be a major hassle for us,” said Deepak Kumar, an eatery owner in the market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-convert-sector-23-market-into-a-polythene-free-zone/story-qiTWzAXgC59wkaPaNIa9jO.html
25-12-2020||Gurugram||GMDA releases final mobility management plan for Gurugram||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority earlier this week published the final Comprehensive Mobility Management Plan (CMMP) for the city — a year behind deadline — after a draft version of the same received the chief minister’s approval during the GMDA’s authority meeting two weeks ago. The CMMP, which is based on traffic and transport surveys conducted by the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) in New Delhi, proposes long and short term interventions to improve mobility in Gurugram between the years 2021 and 2041.These interventions will be rolled out in four phases, with Phase 1 lasting until 2026, Phase 2 until 2031, and Phases 3 and 4 to be completed by 2041. The CMMP has 10 broad sections addressing the mobility concerns like regional connectivity enhancement, non-motorised transportation, public transport (or mass transit), intermediate public transport (such as autos and cabs), road network improvement, parking, freight management, road safety, travel demand management, and traffic signal management.Noting that nearly 66 percent of all traffic in Gurugram is Delhi-bound passenger traffic, the CMMP emphasizes the need to “develope strong regional linkages by mass transit system to enhance the regional connectivity for passenger movement” in and around Delhi-NCR. Solution for this have been presented in the form of the upcoming orbital rail corridor (from Kundli to Palwal), which has a proposed halt in Manesar, as well as the upcoming RRTS system from Delhi to Alwar, which will pass through Gurugram.The plan also mentions the need to enhance road connectivity in the region. “From the regional road network connectivity point of view, major traffic from Delhi and beyond is still dependent on NH-48 and MG road as there are no other connections developed. There is a need to develop the links between Delhi and Gurugram as the traffic share is also very high,” states the CMMP, which is available on the GMDA’s website.As such, new links like Dwarka expressway link between Delhi and the NPR road in Gurugram, a link road between Sectors 115/114 and Sectors 108/106, a link between NH48 to Old Delhi Gurugram road, between NPR to Sector 114, between Nelson Mandela road in Delhi and MG road in Gurugram has been proposed. Apart from this an outer ring road is to be developed along the GSPR, to enhance connectivity with Faridabad.Regarding the link between NH-48 (near Ambience Mall) and Mehrauli-Gurugram Road, it has been noted, “The resident advisory council of GMDA and some other citizen groups have expressed a concern about the environmental impact of this link as it may pass through or about the Biodiversity Park. It is recommended that at the detailed project report stage, the environmental impact assessment be taken up in detail and necessary mitigation measures be adopted for the proposed road link.”Yet another significant proposal is the creation of a Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) for Gururgam. “There are too many organisation involved in transport operations in the city. Everyone from the GMDA to Haryana Roadways to Delhi Metro to the MCG is involved in some capacity. There is a need to make them seamless, which is why this step has been proposed,” explained an official in the GMDA’s mobility division.“It can be observed that owing to different organizations being responsible for taking up various transport systems related activities in Gurugram its co-ordination becomes exceedingly difficult thereby devoid the citizens the benefit of an integrated transport system development. Hence there is need of an umbrella organization like UMTA to take up this responsibility of urban transport sector development,” states the CMMP.VS Kundu, CEO, GMDA, could not be contacted for a comment on Friday. However, the GMDA official quoted above said, “The UMTA will come under the GMDA’s purview, with the CEO acting as chairman. A separate Mobility Planning and Management Unit will also be constituted as the technical arm of the unifying authority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-releases-final-mobility-management-plan-for-gurugram/story-Ou0UzR4vfBM9Iw45qiqJtO.html
25-12-2020||Gurugram||Flying squad, excise department conduct raids on pubs, bars and liquor vends||The chief minister’s Flying Squad and officials of the excise and taxation department on Thursday and Friday nights raided more than 10 pubs and bars and 10 liquor shops in the city after receiving information on violations, said officials. The Flying Squad formed two teams, consisting of eight officers from excise and taxation department, along with their own squad members. The teams were led by an inspector and a sub-inspector during the raids. Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police, crime investigation department, said that on Thursday night, they received several tip-offs that pub, bars and restaurants across the city were operating beyond the permissible time limit. The liquor shops were also violating excise rules and regulations. “Many pubs, bars and restaurants have paid extra fees to the excise and taxation department to operate beyond midnight, but they were taking advantage and were operating till early morning. In some establishments parties were underway in full swing when we raided,” he said. There are nearly 350 pubs, bars and restaurants and 187 liquor shops across the city. As per rules, bars, pubs and liquor shops are only allowed to open until midnight. Harish Budhiraja, inspector, chief minister’s Flying Squad, said that they had conducted a reconnaissance of the areas, such as Sector 29, MG Road, Golf Course Road, Sohna Road and Golf Course Extension Road, before carrying out the raid. “We started raiding after 1am and found that many of the pubs and bars were still operational. The establishments were still taking entries despite the fact that their licence time was valid until 1am. They were serving liquor to the guests and had promised to entertain them until early morning,” he said. Budhiraja said they had also received several complaints against open drinking in the city. He added that they have formed special teams that will conduct raids to crackdown on people drinking in public spaces. He said that anyone who is found consuming alcohol in public will be arrested on the spot. Another major concern is the open flouting Covid-19 regulations by people present at the bars and pubs. Officials said that the areas where people flout Covid-19 norms have been identified and they plan to start raids from Friday night. Budhiraja said these checks will be in addition to the regular checks that are carried out at the markets and other public places on a daily basis. “The liquor shops were closed but the salesmen were selling from below the shutter and were operational throughout the night,” he said. The teams visited popular spots like Sector 29, Cyber Hub, Horizon 1 and Sohna Road, which are hubs of restaurants and bars and are frequented by thousands on a daily basis. Four pub and bars, along with four liquor vends were challaned, said officials. Aruna Singh, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (DETC), said that their assistant excise and taxation officer (AETO) and inspectors were present with the squad. “We have sent the challans to the headquarters in Panchkula. Our teams have challaned the establishments for violating the excise policy. Appropriate action will be taken against them,” she said. Singh said the annual license fees for a pub and bar is ₹18 lakh and for every additional hour ₹10 lakh extra has to be paid. The pub, bar and restaurants can operate until 3am with ₹30 lakh additional licence fees. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that any establishment found violating Covid-19 regulations will be sealed and the persons concerned will be booked. “We are also planning to announce a monetary reward for people giving information on violations,” he said. The police teams are deployed in all public areas in plain clothes and are keeping a close watch on people not wearing masks. Those violating the rule are being fined ₹500 on the spot, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/flying-squad-excise-department-conduct-raids-on-pubs-bars-and-liquor-vends/story-iciyrbvYTIdXhDm6Wp8uYI.html
25-12-2020||Gurugram||How pandemic impacted civic work, pollution control in Gurugram||For the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic not only affected its external operations but also its internal functioning. On two consecutive days in August this year, the city witnessed heavy waterlogging – a phenomenon that was second only to the infamous Gurujam in 2016. A major reason for this was the delay in starting the preparations for the monsoon season that left the city vulnerable to heavy rain. Later in the year, the civic body also sacked 557 outsourced employees — the highest in its 12 years of existence. Officially, the reason for sacking was administrative in nature. But those privy to the matter said that the ousting was meant to offset the financial crunch caused by its declining revenue. With the pandemic raging across the city, the civic body’s field visits also reduced. Consequently, enforcement measures on key issues, such as the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures, saw a major dip as compared to the last year. Cleaning of drains Normally, around late March, the MCG starts floating tenders for the upcoming monsoon season. The process of floating tenders, receiving bids and finalising a contractor usually take around two months to complete. By May, on-ground work for desilting of drains starts. However, this year, the nationwide lockdown imposed in March to curb the spread of Covid-19 deeply impacted the civic body’s preparations for the monsoon season. All MCG officials received an internal order to solely focus on ensuring that essential municipal services, such as sanitation, water, sewage and streetlights continue to operate uninterrupted while some staff members were reallocated for medical, shelter, and food supply services. It was only in late April, that the matter for allocating e-tenders for the upcoming monsoon season was raised during a meeting between senior MCG officials and councillors. The MCG only started the tendering process in May, at a time when cleaning operations on-ground should have already started. In many areas in the city, tenders were only allocated to contractors as late as July, when the monsoon season had already arrived. In fact, in some parts of the city, tenders for cleaning up drains were never floated altogether and some of the drains were left completely uncovered. Even in areas where tenders were allocated, work progressed at a snail’s pace as contractors faced a massive workforce shortage. A large number of migrant workers had returned to their home towns during the lockdown. The time taken for cleaning one leg of a drain, which used to take around 15 days, doubled, and the city’s preparedness was 40-45% weaker than it usually is when the monsoon arrived. The city was worst hit by rains on August 19 and 20, when a heavy downpour clogged the drains and left the city’s seven underpasses inundated and most of the roads under water. Such was the extent of the poor monsoon preparedness that it took officials more than 30 hours to clear the rainwater from the DLF Phase 1/Phase 4 underpass. 557 employees sacked Over a four-day period in September, the civic body sacked 557 of its outsourced workers deputed at its various wings. This was the highest number of terminations carried out by the MCG since its formation in 2008. The official reason cited by the civic body was that the workers were found to be in “surplus” to requirement. However, officials privy to the matter said that declining revenue prompted the civic body to take off 557 workers of its payroll. The MCG’s main source of income is property tax collection. Each financial year, the MCG nets around₹300 crore through property taxes. At the start of the financial year, MCG managed to collect only a paltry sum of₹12 lakh in April and May cumulatively. On average, MCG has monthly revenue of₹15-20 crore through property taxes. Although the MCG’s property tax collection started faring better from May onwards, the loss of revenue for two months led the civic body to explore various cost-cutting measures. Decline in Grap enforcement With its officials reducing field visits amidst the Covid-19 outbreak, the enforcement and vigilance measures regarding violation of environmental norms also took a hit. So far this year, the MCG’s issuance of fines for Grap violations has come down by 58%. As per official MCG data, between October 15 and December 1 this year, the MCG had issued only 267 fines for Grap violations. For the same time period last year, the civic body had issued 643 fines. The drop in Grap violations was even more startling, given the fact that MCG this year had increased its vigilance measures. In October, the MCG formed civil defence teams assigned with the task of surveying and monitoring Grap violations. It also started the city’s first air lab for analysing the data for the city’s 24 air quality monitors and accordingly alerting enforcement wing officials on-ground whenever a spike in localised air pollution levels was observed. Some common violations of Grap measures include open waste burning or large-scale construction activities. Additionally, the MCG also set deadlines for its officials to address civic complaints related to Grap violations. The MCG set a four-hour deadline for its officials to address any complaint related to garbage burning and uncovered construction materials and a 12-hour one for any matter pertaining to construction and demolition waste (C&D) waste. “Despite the setbacks and the complications arising from Covid-19, the MCG has remained committed to improving the city’s infrastructure and has prioritised the safety and health of the public in general. Our main aim this year was on executing operations to limit the spread of Covid-19 and provide food and medical aid to people who were the worst-hit by this virus. We also ensured that essential civic services remained available throughout the year. Even though non-essential civic matters will become secondary for a limited time period in the upcoming year, the MCG will ensure that the city continues to develop and operations gradually return back to normalcy,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/how-pandemic-impacted-civic-work-pollution-control-in-gurugram/story-Okry3DGziObNJrwDnETgQM.html

25-12-2020||City||Campaigning ends for MC elections in Panchkula||Campaigning for the civic body polls came to an end in Panchkula on Friday evening, with the two major parties in the fray holding road shows and several meetings to woo voters. Though there are six candidates fighting for the mayoral post, the contest is mainly two-cornered — between the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party.The voting will take place on Sunday, when about 1.89 lakh people will decide the fate of former mayor and Congress candidate Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia, real estate developer and BJP nominee Kulbhushan Goyal and four other mayoral candidates, besides electing 20 councillors from among 83 in the fray.The Congress had won the first MC election with a thumping majority in 2013, and Ahluwalia remained the city’s first mayor till 2018. However, as the BJP came into power in Haryana in 2014 and its leader Gian Chand Gupta got elected from Panchkula, infighting between the mayor and MLA hit the city’s development.Goyal has been reminding voters about these development pangs during Ahluwalia’s tenure, while asking them to choose a BJP mayor, as the party is in power in the state and at the Centre. Goyal, who moved to the BJP from INLD just two years ago, is also reminding people of works carried out by Gian Chand Gupta more recently in the city. On the last day of campaigning in various sectors and villages, he also claimed support of various social organisations and independent candidates.Meanwhile, the Congress has put its faith in Ahluwalia yet again, due to her “dedication” towards the city in the past tenure, even as the decision was disliked by some in the party. Congress national spokesperson and general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala on Friday addressed a rally at Khatauli village and said Ahluwalia had worked hard as the mayor for Panchkula’s development. Earlier in the day, some social organisations also extended their support to Ahluwalia.Who campaigned, issues they took upThe BJP was quite proactive when it came to starting the campaign, holding meetings at booth levels, setting up of the IT and media cell, and even announcing candidates and its manifesto before the Congress.It fielded its top leaders from the region, including Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his Himachal Pradesh counterpart Jai Ram Thakur, to campaign for the candidates. Khattar touched upon the ongoing farmers’ protest, calling it a “tamaasha” and putting his faith in the “intelligent people” of Panchkula to understand the issue and vote for the BJP. Other leaders who campaigned included Captain Abhimanyu, Om Parkash Dhankar and Vinod Tawde.The Congress, on the other hand, roped in party’s state chief Kumari Selja and former deputy chief minister Chander Mohan to head the campaign in the city. The main focus were rural voters, who were urged to vote for change. The burning issue of new agricultural laws was raised daily.The party targeted the BJP, raising questions on delayed projects, which were started in 2017 and are still incomplete. Its manifesto carried a list of such projects, included animal shelter and dumping ground. The two things that remained common between the two parties during the campaign was that both sought votes in the name of development and both gave the go-by to Covid-19 safety norms.1,400 cops to keep vigilThere are 275 polling booths in 20 wards, of which 98 are hypersensitive and 30 are sensitive.As many as 1,400 police personnel and 23 patrolling teams have been deployed to ensure peaceful polling.There will be barricading at 20 places, and no one is allowed to stand within 100 metres of polling booths. On Saturday, the election eve, the road from Rally Chowk to Sector 12A and the road leading towards women’s college, Sector 14, will remain closed from 9am to 6pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/campaigning-ends-for-mc-elections-in-panchkula/story-YjMY5fBCbx3yqada6DbC0M.html
25-12-2020||Kolkata||PM Modi misleading people with ‘half-truths’: Mamata Banerjee hits back||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday alleged Prime Minister Narendra Modi is misleading people with half-truth as she referred to the benefits of the Centre’s farmers’ schemes, which the BJP claims the state government is not extending to its farmers.“Today, PM showed apparent concern for farmers through televised address instead of proactively working to resolve their issues. While he publicly claimed his intention to help farmers of West Bengal through his PM Kisan Yojana… the fact is he is trying to mislead people with half-truth,” the West Bengal chief minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. “The fact is the Modi government has done nothing to help West Bengal. They are yet to release even a portion of the Rs 85,000 cr of outstanding dues that includes unpaid GST dues of Rs 8,000 crore,” she added.Prime Minister Modi on Friday addressed a virtual event to release over Rs 18,000 crore to more than nine crore farmer families under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme. During the event, the prime minister also raised questions regarding the West Bengal government’s stand on the scheme intended to help farmers.“Today, I regret that more than 70 lakh farmers in West Bengal have not been able to get benefits of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN). More than 23 lakh farmers of Bengal have applied online to take advantage of this scheme. But the state government has stopped the verification process for so long,” news agency PTI quoted the Prime Minister as saying.Mamata Banerjee tried to deflect the accusation levelled against her by PM Modi by saying that the Centre should release part of the outstanding dues so that the state can address its issues.The Trinamool Congress-led government in West Bengal has faced criticism from the BJP for not implementing Centre’s schemes like the PM-KISAN and Ayushman Bharat. Earlier this month, Union home minister Amit Shah during his two-day visit to West Bengal targeted the chief minister and said that her party is paying off extortionists and anti-social elements with money sent by the Centre.Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who has several times over the past year criticised the Trinamool Congress regime in the state, also weighed in on the implementation of the PM-KISAN in the state on Friday. Dhankhar said, “It’s a matter of concern for me that farmers of West Bengal could not benefit from Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. As Governor, I have repeatedly approached the chief minister regarding this issue but none of my letters was answered.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/pm-modi-misleading-people-with-half-truths-mamata-banerjee-hits-back/story-EqoqbT9xaKVlQwYlwO1sVJ.html

25-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC submits proposal to shift dairy units out of city||The high-powered committee chaired by mayor Balkar Sandhu has sent a new proposal to the state government which states that owners of dairy units have agreed to shift out of the municipal corporation limits with certain conditions regarding change of land use (CLU) of the sites where the dairy complexes are currently located.In October, the committee had recommended that the dairy units should not be shifted from the city, and the existing dairy complexes be upgraded to stop dumping of waste in the Buddha Nullah. A meeting of the committee was held at the mayor’s camp office on Friday in which deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal also took part. It has been proposed that a certain portion of land owned by farmers in dairy complexes be transferred to Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) to develop commercial pockets, while the rest will remain with farmers, and the land use be changed to commercial category. Sandhu and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and his relatives also own dairy units in the Haibowal dairy complex. “The proposal was also discussed with principal secretary of the local bodies department AK Sinha during his recent visit to the city. If the government accepts the latest proposal then we will proceed with planning the entire project,” Sandhu said. The project to shift the dairy units at Haibowal and Tajpur Road dairy complex is hanging fire for a long time. It was proposed as the dairy units dump cow dung and dairy waste in the Buddha Nullah.There are over 500 dairy units in the two dairy complexes and around 200 scattered units in different parts of the city. The sewer lines in city areas also get choked due to dumping of dairy waste.MLA (Ludhiana east) Sanjay Talwar has also demanded that MC take the final decision regarding shifting of dairy units as soon as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mc-submits-proposal-to-shift-dairy-units-out-of-the-city/story-6fzB18JwFKBwBYIGG81YgP.html

25-12-2020||Pune||Congress-NCP misguiding farmers: Fadnavis||PUNE: Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis termed the stance taken by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress on farmer laws as “double standards”. Addressing a farmers’ rally at Manjari in Pune district on Friday, Fadnavis said that both the political parties are misguiding farmers. Fadnavis said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought the three laws in the interests of farmers. The BJP government brought a minimum support price for sugarcane farmers for the latter’s benefit, even promoting the ethanol policy which will help them get good rates.” The former chief minister said that existing agriculture produce market committees (APMC) were looting farmers and middlemen are getting more benefit. These laws would break the monopoly of APMCs. He said, “Both the parties are misleading farmers. The NCP-Congress government brought a contract farming law, which the Centre has now introduced. However, they are opposing the law.” He said that the Opposition are creating a picture that the new laws are against farmers and misguiding citizens about the Modi government to gain political mileage. Former co-operative minister Harshwardhan Patil said, “Most of the suggestions recommended in the law are supported by the Congress and NCP earlier. Even some of them have already been introduced.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/congress-ncp-misguiding-farmers-fadnavis/story-Fk7KAzYh30bby0G0gVustK.html

25-12-2020||Kolkata||PM Modi accuses TMC, CPI(M) of playing politics with farmers; Mamata hits back||Security of Bengal’s farmers, who produce crops on 68 per cent of the state’s total geographical area, emerged as a political issue on Friday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing the nation’s farmers in a live telecast, accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) of playing politics over the farmer’s agitation in Punjab. Without naming the two political parties in his long speech, the PM said, “Parties that have been rejected by the people are now conspiring.” Migration of jobless people from Bengal, where farming can no longer support all families, has been a raging issue since the Covid-19 pandemic started. “Look at the state government. It sees politics in welfare schemes and stops 70 lakh farmers from receiving central aid. It goes to Punjab and hobnobs with people who are misleading farmers,” said Modi. Also read: Dharavi reports no new Covid-19 case for the first time since AprilDirecting his attack on the CPI(M) and the government it runs in Kerala, the prime minister said, “People who ruled Bengal for 30 years have not even once staged an agitation in the state demanding implementation of the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Yojana. Why didn’t you raise your voice? Instead, you reached Punjab to pose for selfies. This raises questions.” Reacting to PM Modi’s allegation, chief minister Mamata Banerjee issued a statement in the evening. “Since you have raised questions on my ideology and commitment to the people of Bengal, let me remind you that my ideology is consistent with the vision of the founding fathers of the country and I have wholeheartedly served the people of West Bengal with the right intent, efforts and with everything I have,” wrote Banerjee. Banerjee also accused the prime minister of showing concern for the agitating farmers through a televised address “instead of proactively working to resolve their issues.” “Was this a PM’s speech? He was addressing farmers of the country but singled out Bengal and Kerala. Why?” said TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy. By targeting the TMC and the Marxists, Modi apparently redefined the battle line in poll-bound Bengal since most of the rural population is dependent on farming or farm-based business. According to the 2011 census, Bengal’s population stood at 9.13 crore. It is projected to reach 10.19 crore in 2021. The census showed that around 68.13 per cent of the population lives in villages of rural areas where the literacy rate was 72.13 per cent in 2011. According to the Bengal government’s data, the net cropped area is 52.05 lakh hectares which comprise 68 per cent of the geographical area of the state and 92 per cent of arable land. Also read: From BJP to Mamata Banerjee, a 10,000 farmer rally challenge in KolkataBarely 24 hours before PM Modi’s speech, Mamata Banerjee had announced that her government would set up an agro-based industrial park at Singur in Hooghly district, where her long agitation against acquisition of multi-crop land for the Tata small car factory helped her oust the CPI(M) government in 2011. The Tata Group moved the project to Gujarat. Defending the Singur agitation, Roy said, “We opposed the Tata project not just politically but moved the court as well.” “We are not doing any politics in Punjab. The farmers are on protest and opposition parties are urging the Cente to scrap the new farm laws. Modi deviated from this main issue today to mislead people,” said Roy. “Our government has so far spent Rs 2,642 crore to give Rs 5,000 per acre annually to 47 lakh farmers. Modi is only talking about Rs 6,000 under PMKSY. We will give it to farmers if it is routed through the state. We cannot let the BJP reap political benefit to buy votes,” Roy added. When pointed out that PM Modi specifically said that Bengal farmers are writing to him, seeking aid under PMKSY, Roy said, “Has there been any farmers’ agitation in Bengal in 10 years? They have no complaints. The government collects rice from them on time paying the minimum support price. Bengal farmers have tripled their average income since 2011. The Centre can achieve that not before 2028.” Hoping to find the CPI(M) by the TMC on this issue, Roy said, “We have differences with the Left but we support the farmers’ cause. The two parties agree on issues such as communal politics. These (the PM’s speech) are diversionary tactics to weaken the movement.” CPI(M) politburo member Md Salim summarily rejected the TMC’s support to the farmers’ stir, calling it a lip service. “Had the TMC been serious about the farm bills it would have convened a special winter session of the state assembly that we demanded. In 2014 and 2017, the TMC government introduced two similar bills in the state,” said Salim. “The TMC does not even have a farmers’ front. When we held kisan agitation and general strike on November 26 and December 18, the government opposed it. The police even resorted to baton charge on the agitators,” alleged Salim. The BJP wanted to make the most of the PM’s speech and held meetings in all community blocks of the state where the live programme was screened at gatherings attended by party leaders. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “People in the state will enjoy the benefits of all central schemes when we come to power in a few months”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/pm-modi-accuses-tmc-cpi-m-of-playing-politics-with-farmers-mamata-hits-back/story-E810pkjGDYOQOpjcp4oODO.html

Yadav also urged Congress president Sonia Gandhi to honour the decision of the Supreme Court and direct Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to release water to Haryana. He also urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene in the matter. “All political parties of Punjab are united on the issue of not giving water to Haryana whereas parties in the state are silent on this issue,” he said. Yadav said Haryana Yuva Kisan Sangharsh Samiti will undertake a mass awareness campaign in southern Haryana from December 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/syl-canal-issue-farmers-of-ahirwal-region-in-desperate-need-for-water-says-ex-mla/story-D9SxvwafYCPs50OltbccSL.html
25-12-2020||Pune||The test drive of ‘death stretch’ from New Katraj Tunnel to Navale bridge chowk||Pune: Using the New Katraj tunnel to Navale bridge chowk stretch has become a risky affair for motorists, two-wheeler riders and pedestrians, as the road is witness to regular mishaps. The main observation cited by road experts is that the road has a long slope where heavy vehicles use the decline to shut down their engine to save fuel which may cause accidents as in many cases the brakes stops to function. On November 29, three persons lost their lives after a heavy vehicle dashed them on the highway near Narhe exit on the service road. HT conducted a test drive on December 19 (Saturday) in a truck starting from New Katraj tunnel via Narhe service road exit till Navale bridge chowk. To understand the precautions and safety measures that need to be taken by truck drivers, especially on the slope, we were accompanied by Swapnil Pangare, area sales manager of KGP Auto Ltd, Ghatge Trucking BharatBenz dealer with their heavy truck driver Jamir Shaikh. Both of them explained on how to drive steadily and the things that need to be followed while driving through the slope stretch of the road to avoid accidents. Test drive 1. At 8.30 am, I along with driver Jamir got into the truck which has a heavy load capacity up to 28 tonnes. We started from Navale bridge chowk towards the new Katraj tunnel 2. While going towards the new Katraj tunnel, Jamir showed some of the important buttons inside the driver cabin which are used to control the vehicle. One such button is called “Constant Throttle Valve” (CTV). It is mainly used to control the engine brakes while the vehicle is on slope. The button was located on the right side of the driver’s steering wheel. “There are six diesel sprinkling nozzles in the engine. After switching on this button, only one diesel nozzle supply is on and other five remain closed. This step saves diesel and also the vehicle ignition is on and air supply to brakes remains constant. Many trucks do not have this facility, and some drivers do not use it even if the heavy vehicle is fitted with the button,” Pangare said. 3. In 15 minutes we crossed the tunnel and by taking the ‘U’ turn on the highway we started coming back from the tunnel towards the Navale bridge chowk which is the danger stretch that sees accidents. 4. From halfway through the tunnel, the slope on the highway started and the truck gained speed (there is speed limit of 80 kmph on this highway). Jamir said, “There is a speed lock of 50 kmph to the truck and even on the slope if the ignition is on we control the vehicle on first or second gear.” After the tunnel ended, the slope started towards the Dari Pul bridge and to show the mistake that some drivers commit, Jamir took the vehicle on ‘neutral’ gear. Soon, the speed of the vehicle almost touched 90 kmph 5. Explaining the wrong practise of putting the heavy vehicle on neutral gear, Pangare said, “When a truck driver crosses the tunnel before the Dari Pul bridge, he puts on the neutral gear. Later, when he approaches the Navale bridge, he starts applying brakes as other vehicles also enter the stretch. As the vehicle was in neutral gear, the liners get heated up which leads to brake failure and possible accident. There is a brake control button in every heavy vehicle or truck which should be used by the driver on such slopes, but to save a fuel of around 3 to 4 litres, they do such risky things.” 6. Driving ahead, we crossed the Dari Pul bridge and the ‘death’ stretch or accident-prone slope on the highway started. Jamir took the speeding truck in second gear. He then switched on the CTV button which controls the engine brakes and though in speed the truck was going at 50 kmph on fuel saving mode. The stretch from new Katraj tunnel to Navale bridge chowk is around 6 to 7 kms and there are several boards on this stretch installed by the Pune traffic police department appealing drivers “not to switch off the engines or put vehicle on neutral”. Rumbler strips are there at a couple of spots, and at some spots potholes were also seen. 7. By around 9.10 am we reached the Narhe service road exit which goes ahead to the Navale bridge chowk. This is the spot where the recent accident claimed three lives. As our vehicle was on control speed, Jamir slowly took the service road and finally our test drive ended at 9.15 am coming back to Navale bridge chowk. Normally the average mileage of trucks is between 3 and 6 kmpl, and to save fuel on this danger stretch drivers follow the wrong practice of switching off the engine or putting it on neutral gear. But if the engine break control button is used with ignition on, then same amount of fuel is saved along with safely passing through the slope, according to Pangare. Review “Overall, the test drive was good and we got a first-hand experience of traveling inside a speeding truck on this ‘death stretch’. It is not so difficult for drivers to control their heavy vehicles by using safety features in their vehicles, but lack of alertness or careless attitude may cause accidents. While going through the slope, we found some speeding heavy vehicles. By controlling the vehicle on gear with the help of engine brake button, one can easily control the speed avoiding any mishap. Some improvement and upgrade in road infrastructure on this stretch by NHAI is needed like repairing potholes, adding more rumbler strips and putting up of more safety sign boards and signals along the service road.” Mishap countAccidents happened on this stretch starting from new Katraj tunnel to Navale bridge chowk Year/Fatal accidents/Serious accidents/Minor accidents/Total 2019/12/02/29/432020 (Till Nov)/14/25/09/48 Total /26/27/38/91||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/the-test-drive-of-death-stretch-from-new-katraj-tunnel-to-navale-bridge-chowk/story-hMidjBFVqe2tPqEHYgE89O.html

Now, we will have to stand against Punjab to seek our legitimate share of water through SYL. Some people were announcing to boycott CM’s rally, I want to tell them that the Jal Adhikar rally would be held at any cost,” Dalal added.Interacting with party workers in Bhiwani’s Siwani, Dalal hit out at left parties and accused them of receiving foreign funds to protest against the BJP leaders.“The people carrying red flags are projecting themselves as farmers and their main motive is to protest against us. Such people don’t want you people to get your water from Punjab. Within a year, I am planning to provide water in the fields of 14 villages in Siwani region,” he added.Defending his earlier remarks, the minister said he had never called farmers ‘Khalistanis and backed support from China and Pakistan’.Farmers to boycott CM’s rallyDayanand Punia, secretary of Akhil Bhartiya Kisan sabha, said the farmers had conducted door to door meetings and panchayats in over 25 villages of Loharu constituency represented by JP Dalal and decided to show black flags to Khattar during his visit to Behal.“Agriculture minister Dalal is making all attempts to divide people by conducting CM’s rally demanding SYL water from Punjab. People of our constituency have decided to boycott Khattar’s rally.

25-12-2020||Chandigarh||18 lakh Haryana farmers received ₹2,225 crore under PM Kisan Yojana: Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday said over ₹2,225 crore have been deposited in the bank accounts of 18 lakh farmers of the state after the launch of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana. Under this flagship scheme launched in 2019 for the welfare of farmers, the Union government provides a financial benefit of ₹6,000 per year to each registered farmer. The money is transferred directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiary and is paid in three equal four-monthly instalments of ₹2,000 each. Khattar expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for releasing the seventh installment of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana to the accounts of farmers on the occasion of Sushasan Diwas on Friday. At least ₹360 crore have been deposited in the accounts of 18 lakh farmers of Haryana under this scheme on Friday, an official spokesperson said. The PM transferred this amount to the accounts of farmers digitally. “So far ₹2,225.30 crore have been deposited in the accounts of farmers under this scheme in the state,” Khattar said. During the transfer of the seventh installment, ₹18,000 crore were deposited in the accounts of 9 crore farmers of the country. This programme was viewed by farmers at the panchayat level in Haryana. A farmer, Hari Singh of Fatehabad district shared experiences regarding small holdings with the Prime Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/18-lakh-haryana-farmers-received-2-225-crore-under-pm-kisan-yojana-khattar/story-NuumQgTkwEZqxJW9UM9eQN.html

25-12-2020||Pune||The art of empathetic listening alleviating pain, stress and brokenness, all via The Vent||PUNE When Rohan (name changed) called the helpline of The Vent--a recently launched listening platform, he was on the verge of inflicting harm on himself. After spending about three months of lockdown in the confines of his house with his parents, he was frustrated for more reasons than one. “Rohan was meaning to come out, and speak to his parents about his homosexuality. Before he could break the news to them, he lost his job. Dealing with the challenges of finding employment, not being able to meet his partner too often, and handling the parental pressure to get married, were damaging his mental balance,” says Shraddha Deo, founder of The Vent. She went on to add that after venting out on the call for almost an hour, Rohan reported feeling lighter and better. Later, he was directed to see a counsellor for better healing and emotional wellbeing. Deo, a psychologist, has been working in the field of mental health for a decade. The Vent, launched in July this year, is run by Deo and Vaidehi Barve, a legal advisor. Deo says, “While working as a counsellor, I realised a lot of people came to me primarily with a motive to be heard attentively and without any judgments.” Back in the day, people would find this comfort by opening up to family and friends, but the socio-cultural dynamics of today’s times are different, and the need to be heard empathetically is pronounced. She added, “I believe that people shouldn’t have to pay just for such a fundamental emotional need. This thought kept brewing in my mind. Around the same time, the unsettling news about Sushant Singh Rajput’s death came in. That was a big trigger for me, and it reemphasised the necessity of a space, where people could verbalise their feelings in a safe, and non-biased environment.” At present, ‘The Vent’ has 12 volunteers, who have been trained on empathetic listening. Their responsibility is to answer calls, reassure the callers that they have their complete attention, and that they will hear them with utmost compassion. So far, the helpline has addressed 200 callers, and is functional through the day till late hours. “Most of the calls, typically spanning anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour, come from people complaining of a range of issues, such as loneliness, depression, career problems, relationship and marital troubles, and self-doubt, and so on. Our job is to listen and facilitate catharsis without offering any advice. However, in situations where we feel counselling and therapy can help, we direct the callers to the relevant experts, whom we have on board,” says Noopur Ganu, an empathetic listener at ‘The Vent’.While ‘The Vent’ is a recently launched portal, there are also similar initiatives that are making a heartfelt effort towards promoting mental wellbeing. While the city’s Connecting NGO runs a distress helpline for anyone feeling tremendously low or suicidal, Sassoon Hospital’s ‘Manasamvad’ was initially launched to spread awareness about Covid-19, has ended up as a helpline to tackle stress, anxiety, depression, and the trauma after loss of jobs. Evaluating the effectiveness of a listening portal, counselling psychologist Shrutkirti Fadnavis says, “Unconditional listening is the first step towards the process of catharsis. Listening portals, such as The Vent, facilitate discharge of negative energy and offer relief. This can work as a great stress buster.” --Distress Helplines--The Vent: Call: 8448440267Timing: 10 am to 11 pmWebsite: http://theventforyou.com/Connecting NGO:Call: 9922004305/ 9922001122 Timing: 12 noon to 8 pmEmail: distressmailsconnecting@gmail.comManasamvad:Call: 02026127331||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/the-art-of-empathetic-listening-alleviating-pain-stress-and-brokenness-all-via-the-vent/story-AQcTv5TkcK3HCBSIFtcvSO.html

The man was said to be under financial stress. “According to statements of the neighbours and relatives of the deceased, the family’s head was under severe financial crisis after the lockdown and the family was under severe grief. On Thursday night, an argument broke out between the couple over financial issues following which on Friday the man killed his four kids and wife with an axe and later hanged himself,” said Vikram Singh, circle officer (CO), Rishabhdeo. “Locals said that the condition of the family had worsened. The deceased family didn’t have any government IDs like Aadhaar, BPL card to get any benefits of government schemes. In such a situation, the man was not even getting work under MNREGA.

25-12-2020||Pune||Slam Dunk: ‘Being part of NBA requires good fortune, dedication and knowledge of sport’||As a young basketball fan, watching the sport, and then as a basketball player myself, the only universally agreed upon truth is that the NBA (National Basketball Association, of the USA) represents the pinnacle of basketball competition. Being born in Pune, the hardwood courts of American cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago and New York, seemed inaccessible and daunting to someday reach. However, through a winding and circuitous path as an athlete, student and now coach, the globalisation and expansion of basketball has made it possible to seek various routes to the pinnacle of basketball competition. While each individual has a different dream and strategy, it is crucial to recognise the opportunities, to someday, get the chance to work at the most competitive level of basketball, the NBA; with elite athletic and coaching talent. Playing and learning through experiences on the courts of Deccan, St Vincent’s (now hardwood) and Balewadi can certainly be the platform to eventually, one day, being around great players like Stephen Curry, Tim Duncan and coaches like Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr. The opportunity to work in the NBA requires a combination of good fortune, knowledge of the sport and dedication and understanding basketball infrastructure. Despite a lot of my basketball skills and knowledge as a player being developed in the hot and humid weather of the Middle East and in America, the current resources available globally make information of basketball schemes and team concepts easily accessible to all ages of players and coaches. Many roles exist in NBA basketball outside of strictly being an NBA player on a roster, the most prominent of which, is coaching players on court. Essential to coaching is experience playing the sport at a high level. Playing experience allows for a deep understanding of the nuances of the game, and in the NBA the smallest of advantages can be the difference between winning and losing a championship. As an alternative to coaching, there is a huge need for individuals who can break down and analyse the technicalities of the game on video and specific basketball software. Since coaches are usually occupied with managing their team, there is a need for additional analysis and observations from individuals who can analyse specific team and player tendencies. In this role, it is critical to understand key NBA terminology specific to each kind of tactical strategy a coach wants to implement in the teams playing style. Multiple head coaches in the NBA such as Erik Spoelstra of the Miami Heat have started their careers in this manner, breaking down and analysing game videos. Understanding the various physical training techniques is another area it is possible to make an impact and be able to reach the NBA level. NBA athletes have a combination of size, speed and co-ordination that can rival athletes in any global team sport. Individuals seeking to improve at the highest levels employ highly specific training techniques that can maximize their performance giving them the slightest advantage. For organisations investing millions of dollars in players, it is essential to maximise the number of games players are healthy to give them the best chance to win. I learnt the importance of this physical preparation on one of my first days working as a member of the San Antonio Spurs organisation. During this day in the offseason (when most players are usually focused on rest), Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili were both part of a group of players who engaged in a track workout outdoors in the very hot summer of Texas. Keeping in mind that both players were engaging in preparing themselves for the season physically when they could have been relaxing and taking time off shows how seriously the best players approach their preparation and how valuable it is to them. When players are injured, it represents a large financial loss for each organisation, hence, the role of trainers and weightlifting coaches is paramount to team success. Stay tuned for the next column which will give you an inside look at an NBA practice and how each team prepares for a game day both when at home and while travelling on the road!

25-12-2020||Pune||‘23 suggestions have been sent to NHAI for Navale bridge traffic’||Pune: Managing traffic is an integral part of police work. The recent pile-up and mishaps at Navale bridge have raised concerns about the accident-prone spot. Even though it is a part of a highway, the stretch falls in the jurisdiction of Pune city police. Along with suggestions sent to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police for traffic, Pune, talks about Navale bridge and other traffic-related issues. Following are the excerpts from the interviewRegarding the Navale bridge situation, what is your takeaway, suggestions and way forward?After the last pile-up accident, we have carried out some changes made. I visited the spot with the planning police inspector and conducted a survey. We have sent 23 suggestions to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). A few things were implemented immediately — “go slow” road sign boards have been installed, rumblers are in installation process, reflective boards for night have been installed. Among the other suggestions was that heavy vehicles should not use the third lane on the slope which also has a turn. So, when the vehicles travel down the slope, they gain speed and the chances of losing control increases. We have suggested a speed limit of 60 kmph, installation of blinkers, maintaining the first lane for heavy vehicles from Katraj to Warje river bridge, and installing speed limit sign before the bend near Marathi Bana hotel. It has to be a joint effort because we cannot risk lives and keep passing on the responsibility.Why are diversions made to city roads due to the metro work?Yes, changes have been made and it will take around 3-4 days to set in before people realise the change. Especially for metro work, we have a set of 13 terms that are to be followed. Some of those terms are that a traffic warden is to be appointed by the contractor, before work begins the traffic officials of the area need to be informed, pedestrians should not be inconvenienced, contractor’s contact information should be on display at the site, raw material should spill on the functional roads, iron barricades should be used wherever necessary, lights should be installed for night-time visibility, responsibility of preventing accidents is on the contractor. After all these, if it is deemed fit, our divisional inspectors conduct a field visit and recommend diversions. For that application has to be made online. There have been cases of assault of traffic police for enforcing traffic rules. Any initiatives taken to tackle it?We have 100 body cameras and we can get up to 38 more. We have told our officials to be polite towards vehicle users regardless of their behaviour. It is a matter of an individual’s mentality. Along with good words and respectable language, we advise them to use their mobile phone cameras to record everything in the absence of body cameras when the situation gets out of hand.How many CCTV cameras in the city meant for traffic are functional?There are a total of 1,341 cameras of which 1,189 are functional, 119 are not-functional, and 33 are in the process of shifting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/23-suggestions-have-been-sent-to-nhai-for-navale-bridge-traffic/story-hY4vstY6k5R2xujzK3zs1H.html
25-12-2020||Dehradun||Politics heats up on ‘development debate challenge’ between BJP and AAP||The politics over debate challenge has heated up between the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) over the debate challenge posed by the AAP after Uttarakhand cabinet minister Madan Kaushik said that he accepts the challenge and would go to Delhi to show “Uttarakhand development model” to AAP government in Delhi. Kaushik made the statement on Thursday evening while speaking to the media after the assembly session. His response had come in reply to AAP senior leader and Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s challenge to the BJP led state government for an open debate on any five development works done by it in its three and a half years of tenure after coming to power in 2017. Sisodia floated the challenge during his visit to Dehradun about a week ago. “We accept the challenge for a debate on development. Sisodia has asked us to mention any five development works but we will mention 100,” said Kaushik. Also read: Indian sailors stranded at Chinese ports: No link to standoff, says ChinaOn the question of fixing a date for the debate citing Sisodia’s claim that he would come to Dehradun for it whenever Kaushik agrees, he said, “Instead I would go to their den in Delhi and hold the debate. Will show them the Uttarakhand model of development which is much better than their Delhi development model which they talk about comprising issues like education, water, power and health.”Kaushik’s statement drew a witty and aggressive response from AAP in the form of memes on its state unit’s social media handles. It posted memes related to Kaushik’s reply stating 100 development works of his government. Meanwhile, Sisodia through social media replied that he is “glad that Kaushik has accepted the challenge.”“Kaushik should decide any of the dates- January 2,3 or 4 and I will come down to Dehradun for it. It will make clear whose government did what for its people” said Sisodia. Amid the ongoing politics on the issue, political expert MM Semwal said, “AAP which has declared to fight the next assembly election of 2022 on all 70 seats, is trying to make its presence felt with such tactics.”“Though it seems to be difficult for it to make any significant impact in the elections, it’s trying hard to shake the political scenario of the state with its senior leaders like Sisodia throwing challenges of debate to Kaushik who too is a very clever politician,” said Semwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/politics-heats-up-on-development-debate-challenge-between-bjp-and-aap/story-Uqgq2I9lfNGjVyx5bNFggI.html

25-12-2020||Pune||Frequent fire incidents on Tukai hill a threat to flora-fauna||Two separate fire incidents were reported in the last three days on the Tukai tekdi, located in Baner. In both these fire incidents combined, more than 100 planted trees have suffered serious damage. Vasundhara Abhiyan Baner (VAB), an NGO which is working for conserving the biodiversity on the hill had planted these trees over the period of 14 years.“Half of these damaged trees will not survive. We lose 300-350 saplings each year due to such fire incidents. We remove the dead tree from the compound and then plant another one in that hole. Our volunteers have worked really hard to plant these trees. Everyday more than 100 volunteers of Vasundhara Abhiyan Baner work on this hill to make it greener. But such incidents destroy years of our hard work in a few minutes,” said Pandurang Bhujbal, member Vasundhara Abhiyan Baner.With a goal of enriching Tukai tekdi with biodiversity, a few residents of Baner started the work of the organisation in 2006. In the last 14 years, the network of volunteers has planted approximately 26,000 trees on the hill which include 450 various species of the plants. VAB has a network of more than 1,000 volunteers. They devote their time to this cause as per their convenience.“We all have jobs and our own businesses. We have volunteers across all age groups. When we see a burnt tree, our heart aches,” said Sanjay Murkute, member, VAB.The reason behind these fires is not clear, however, officials believe a human intervention sets the dry grass on fire and then it spreads over the hill.“Such fires are man-made. If a person throws or leaves a lightly burnt cigarette bud in the dry grass, it may cause a fire. People should avoid smoking on the hill,” said Guruswamy Tumale, assistant garden superintendent, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). “There has been a court case regarding the ownership of the land on the hill. So, we can’t intervene after a point. We are doing all we can. To avoid such incidents we try to create public awareness for the conservation of the trees,” Tumale added.Locals of this area say that such fire incidents are not new on the Tukai hill. They accuse the authorities of negligence. “We saw fire on the hill at around 10.30am on Wednesday; I attribute the increased instances of fires on hills of Pune to rampant dumping and burning of garbage and miscreants. The forest department and PMC have failed completely in safeguarding hills from such activity. Simple preventive measures of removing dry grass are not done by them,” said Ravindra Sinha, general secretary Baner-Pashan link road welfare trust. He was one of the many citizens who rushed to douse the fire on the hill.Such fire incidents adversely impact the ecosystem of the hill. “It has an immediate impact on the varieties of indigenous grass in that area. This variety declines. It also affects the insects, reptiles and the habitats of the birds,” said Dharamraj Patil, biodiversity expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/frequent-fire-incidents-on-tukai-hill-a-threat-to-flora-fauna/story-wdxpeJgn0pgiS4h0femlpK.html

25-12-2020||Pune||Doubling time reduces significantly in Pune, but experts urge caution||The doubling time for Covid infections have increased considerably in Pune city. For December, the doubling time was over 400 days. That is it took 400 days to double the number of Covid positive cases in Pune.Doubling time is defined as the time needed for the cases to double in a particular regionDr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant chief of the health department at the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said that the rate of infection has reduced very much. “Earlier the doubling time was very low. But now we have calculated that the doubling time has increased. For the number of cases to get twice the number, it takes more than 461 days today,” said Wavare.This, Dr Wavare said, was because the Covid infection was not spreading as much as earlier.“This is because there is more awareness among people about wearing masks, hand hygiene and social distancing. The administration has also strictly implemented these things,” said Dr Wavare.Speaking on the increase in doubling time, Dr R Gangakhedkar, epidemiologist who earlier was the head scientist of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that the doubling rate has increased because people are following all precautions.“The first wave is about to end. Due to this, we can see the decrease in infection. And so the doubling time has increased but to maintain this, there should be no complacent behaviour in the public. Wearing masks, hand hygiene and social distancing is a must,” said Gangakhedkar.He further said that the Covid virus will see more mutations. “The best way to keep one safe is to practice social distancing. Covid is here to stay for the next few years. Everyone should make a habit of wearing masks for their safety and the safety of others,” said Gangakhedkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/doubling-time-reduces-significantly-in-pune-but-experts-urge-caution/story-2CIu3VJZC94K6nPh7Ywx7I.html

25-12-2020||Pune||Political parties eye electorate as village merger to add PMC’s population by five lakh||Days before the 23 areas – referred in government records as villages – are to be officially merged into the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), politicians are divided over the decision. With civic polls slated for December 2021, each party is trying to take political mileage over the issue. Earlier on Wednesday, the Maharashtra government issued a notification, paving the way for merger of 23 areas surrounding the city into PMC limits. Post merger, PMC will have largest (518 sqkm) area under its jurisdiction with increased number of corporators and over five lakh population under its limits from these areas. The latest move is also being seen with political motives as the 23 areas are under the control of the NCP and Congress, who want these parts to be under PMC as civic polls are lined up in December 2021. To prepare the party for polls, the city BJP chief Jagdish Mulik has started meeting residents from these areas. Currently, the BJP controls the 165-member PMC house with 98 corporators. Central parts of the city are dominated by the BJP, while outskirt areas are under the control of the NCP and Congress Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state unit president Chandrakant Patil accuses the Maha Vikas Agadhi government for taking the merger decision with political motives. “When we were ruling in the state, we decided to merge the villages step by step and provide adequate infrastructure. This government has not mentioned anything for giving financial help for creating infrastructure in these villages,” said Patil According to Patil, PMC is already facing a financial crisis due to Covid-19. Mulik said, “The Maha Vikas Aghadi and mainly the NCP is believing that by merging these 23 villages, they would be able to get power in PMC. The NCP and Congress would not get support in these villages. Right now both the parties have power in these villages, but they are unable to carry any development work. Though it is a political decision, BJP would remain with the citizens of the 23 villages and get their support.” NCP city unit president Chetan Tupe said, “As per the high court’s order, the BJP merged the 11 villages in 2017. Then the state government promised to merge remaining 23 villages in next three years. The state government just followed the previous decision and merged the remaining 23 villages in PMC.” Congress leader Aba Bagul also accused the BJP for playing politics. “The BJP in PMC has already approved the new water scheme for these villages and has appointed a consultant at the cost of Rs13 crore. Why they are doing such planning even before the state government offered its nod. It means they too are supporting this decision but doing politics over it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/political-parties-eye-electorate-as-village-merger-to-add-pmc-s-population-by-five-lakh/story-MKecODMkSOKH76bijy26TN.html

Ansari said the survey was being conducted in at least 20 districts of Malwa-Nimar and the central region of MP under the guidance of Syed Minhajuddin, AIMIM leader and councillor of Greater Hyderabad Nagar Nigam. An initial survey was conducted a few months ago to find out if people were looking for an alternative to the Congress, BJP, BSP and SP.

25-12-2020||Kolkata||BJP ups ante against TMC as PM Modi releases financial benefits to farmers||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) upped the ante against the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal accusing the state’s ruling party of depriving farmers from receiving financial benefits released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. Modi released the next instalment of PM-Kisan, the direct cash-transfer scheme for farmers, worth Rs18,000 crore into bank accounts of 90 million farmers.The BJP’s IT cell chief Amit Malviya attacked the Mamata Banerjee-government in a series of tweets. “Today, when the PM will transfer 18,000 crore to 9 crore farmer families across the country, farmers of West Bengal will be deprived because the CM has refused to identify and submit the list of beneficiaries to the central government. Pishi’s ego means farmers suffer!” Malviya tweeted on Friday morning. Today, when the PM will transfer 18,000 crore to 9 crore farmer families across the country, farmers of West Bengal will be deprived because the CM has refused to identify and submit the list of beneficiaries to the central government.Pishi’s ego means farmers suffer!#PMKisanThe TMC, however, said the way the Centre wants to transfer the money is not acceptable and the state government is providing financial assistance to farmers, which is higher than what the Centre provides. “The state has already informed the Centre that the financial benefit needs to be routed through the state. The Centre giving direct benefit is against the federal structure. Secondly, the state government is providing farmers an assistance of Rs5,000 per acre, which is higher than the central benefit,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP.This comes just two days after the TMC chief Mamata Banerjee sent a team comprising five parliamentarians to meet agitating farmers at the Delhi-Haryana border. Also Read: TMC worker, supporter found dead“Of the approx 72 lakh farmers in WB, nearly 23 lakh have self-registered on the central portal seeking benefits under the #PMKisan Samman Nidhi, but Pishi wouldn’t certify them! Each farmer in WB has so far lost Rs14,000 (including latest instalment) and the state 9,800 crore,” Malviya said in his second tweet. Similar allegations were made by union home minister Amit Shah during his visit to the state last weekend. “Only 55% of WB’s agricultural land is irrigated. Despite being a water-rich state, it is poorly irrigated. It ranks 24 out of 29 states. In terms of average monthly income of farmers as reported by NABARD in 2016-17, WB ranks low at 24 among 29 states. Pishi has failed farmers,” Malviya said in his tweet. The PM’s outreach comes amid ongoing farmers’ protests against the three laws passed by the Parliament in September to reform the farm sector.Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in West Bengal in 2021. BJP and TMC’s exchange over the PM-Kisan scheme is the latest in a war of words between the parties leading up to the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-bjp-ups-ante-against-tmc-as-pm-modi-releases-financial-benefits-to-farmers/story-s92Bl5ulLcjGQHpkyE5AZI.html

25-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration still owes MC ₹48 crore in property tax||Even after repeated property notices, threats of disconnection of water connections and latest rounds of meetings on unpaid dues with the municipal corporation officials, the UT administration has failed to pay more than ₹48 crore in outstanding property tax.The UT Secretariat in Sector 9 (₹2.16 crore), Haryana Raj Bhawan (₹3.18 lakh), Punjab Raj Bhawan (₹2.7 lakh), Government College for Girls, Sector 11 (₹82 lakh), Art Gallery, Sector 10 (₹34 lakh), are among the top tax defaulters.But the administration’s departments are not the only government agencies with unpaid property tax dues in their names. Even MC’s own departments–horticulture and road wings—owe it more than ₹3 crore in unpaid property tax.In contrast to MC failing to make much headway in recovering property tax dues from the government departments, it has already recovered ₹49 crore from the residential, commercial and institutional segments against the initial tax collection target of ₹48 crore for the financial year 2020-2021. It has now revised the target to ₹54 crore.For the cash-strapped MC, property tax is one of the two major sources of its revenues, the other being the collections from charges on water supply. There are 1.4 lakh properties under the jurisdiction of the MC, of which more than 1.2 lakh are taxable.UT tops list of defaultersThe MC had served the administration property recovery notices for ₹10 crore in August, and another set of notices amounting to ₹44 crore with December 15 as the deadline for payment.The notices were issued mainly to different wings of the UT engineering department, which maintains all the UT’s buildings. “Two wings cleared off ₹6 crore dues by submitting the receipts which showed they had already paid the tax. One of the wings, CP-3, has neither paid the dues nor submitted any receipts,” said an MC official, requesting anonymity.The MC had also issued notices to its own departments; the dues stood at around ₹11 crore at the time of issuing the notices.“Different MC departments reconciled around ₹8 crore in property tax, but ₹3 crore are still pending. We are pursuing the matter with the departments and hope these will be cleared soon,” said the official. The defaulting departments include roads and public health wings of the MC engineering department.“While some departments have not paid the tax, in other cases, there is a mismatch between their records and ours. In such cases if they submit the receipt of the tax payments then we are accommodating them,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-still-owes-mc-48-crore-in-property-tax/story-iYKPFWpDt0IhSn9JYa84WO.html

Colonel Kuldev Nand (retd) was only 26 when his 23 Mountain Artillery brigade had to face the bullets from the Pakistani forces while advancing towards Mudafarganj in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) on the morning of December 4, 1971.“When we received orders to move forward, suddenly firing started from the opposite side and two of our men got injured. We attacked, killed eight men and captured two. Later, we found a heavily injured armourer in the fields, who pleaded with us to shoot him. He was lucky he was facing the Indian Army and we did not kill him. Rather, he was evacuated and given medical care, before he left for Pakistan,” he said.Lieutenant General KS Dogra (retd) was with the corps of Army Air Defence and posted in Sambha (Jammu and Kashmir), and was responsible to track the enemy’s location.“With the help of radar control guns, we shot down many Pakistani aircrafts. On December 3 and 7, many of their aircrafts were destroyed, due to which their spirits were broken and then they never flew in our areas,” he said.Subedar Sewa Singh, 92, from the Bombay Engineer Group, a regiment of the Corps of Engineers, who retired in 1975, couldn’t talk, but his son Baldev Singh said that his father had defused a bomb in Ferozepur Zira and saved many lives.The felicitations took place a day after the victory flame was received in a grand reception by Lieutenant General SS Mahal, GOC, Kharga Corps. Lieutenant General Ranjit Singh (retd) highlighted the role of Kharga Corps in the war.The flame will now be taken to Patiala, Chandimandir and Siachen glacier, the GOC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/50-years-of-1971-war-triumph-veterans-of-ambala-region-relive-memories/story-OKETSlScSQb6T0mT5NvPJN.html

25-12-2020||Chandigarh||Welfare body pitches for therapeutic village for people with mental disabilities in Chandigarh||Citizens for Inclusive Living (CIL), an association of persons working for the dignity and welfare of people with mental disabilities, have pitched for establishing a serenity therapeutic village in Chandigarh.“Chandigarh, a modern city matching western standards of living, is, unfortunately, lacking in decent assisted living facilities for persons with mental disabilities. Persons with mental disabilities feel excluded from the mainstream, and good community living options within the city are virtually non-existent. Many parents will happily pay for good facilities, so there is no financial burden on the government,” members of the CIL in a press conference here said.Happy Arora, a parent, spoke of the urgent need for good quality residential and occupational facilities for persons with mental disabilities, and the instrumental role that parents could play in successfully running a large, integrated community set-up. Aditya Vikram, a mental health advocate, spoke of the synergies in having an inclusive community, and the potential for providing the best social care facilities including boarding, lodging, vocational, occupational, and recreational facilities, all in one large, beautiful and therapeutic campus in Indira Holiday Home, Chandigarh.Dr Simmi Waraich, a psychiatrist, spoke of the immense potential for international recognition of such a project and intended tie-ups with several reputed institutions. The association comprises special educators, professionals, social workers, parents and caregivers of persons with disabilities and concerned citizens. Its aim is to make Chandigarh more inclusive and caring for persons with mental disabilities. CIL has over 100 members, with a core committee of 17 members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/welfare-body-pitches-for-therapeutic-village-for-people-with-mental-disabilities-in-chandigarh/story-aOtMyA6dUnUjPivG3eIpyH.html

Addressing a press conference here, the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) leader said: “I accept that these farm laws need some amendments. We had given suggestions to the Centre which were accepted by the Centre... and these suggestions were reflected in the letter the Union government had sent to the farm unions while extending invite for talks.” Chautala further urged the protesting farmers to give “concrete suggestions” regarding their demands and resume the dialogue. “When the Centre is ready for talks, the farmer unions that have held six rounds of talks earlier should come forward. No agitation has ever ended without talks being held.”“History teaches us that the agenda of the agitation never succeeds due to the deadlock over dialogue. This deadlock will not end until you (farm union) give suggestions and hold the talks,” he added. Chautala also ruled out withdrawing support to the Bharatiya Janata Party in Haryana, reiterating that he would be in the government till farmers continue to get MSP. “I will resign and sit at home the moment I am unable to protect the interests of farmers...We will take appropriate and immediate step if there is any threat to the interests of Haryana...,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farm-laws-need-amendments-talks-must-resume-dushyant-chautala/story-CoMOuzkEX1aWsdBNCwjqKI.html

In Hooghly, 35-year-old Suchand Jana, a TMC supporter, was found dead on the banks of a canal with bruises on his face. “The body was sent for post mortem.

Meanwhile, the TMC and BJP traded allegations after the police recovered the body of 70-year-old Khalek Mia, a TMC worker, from a field by the roadside at Toofanganj in Cooch Behar.

25-12-2020||Chandigarh||High court to re-examine boundaries of Sukhna lake catchment area||The Punjab and Haryana high court will re-examine the boundaries of the Sukhna Lake catchment area. On December 18, the HC had stayed demolition and construction activity in the Sukhna catchment area. Apart from recovery of the ₹100-crore fine imposed on the governments of Punjab and Haryana, it had put in abeyance an earlier March 2020 order of a division bench with these directions. The December 18 order from the bench of justice Jaswant Singh and justice HS Sidhu had come on the plea of Kansal Enclave Residents Welfare Association, Mohali, a residents’ body, who had petitioned against the March judgment saying no consensus had been drawn regarding the veracity of the 2004 map prepared by Survey of India, as per which the court had decided the catchment area boundaries in March. Punjab also figured in the appeal. In the detailed order released on Thursday, the court observed that the catchment area of the lake needed to be determined on the basis of scientific, technological and legal aspects. It also issued notice to Survey of India, which prepared it. The court observed that some of the construction, in the areas which fall in the catchment area as per the 2004 map, were notified in Nayagaon’s master plan and their right to shelter, cannot be denied. It said that in this year’s monsoon season, there was breach in the Sukhna lake area and owing to opening of flood gates, there was flooding in Baltana and Zirakpur. “ At this stage, this Court is primarily concerned with the first and foremost adjudication of the correct and accurate determination of the catchment area of Sukhna Lake on the basis of the applicable technical parameters,” it said. Synonymous with the city, the lake was created by Le Corbusier in 1958. However by 1988, 66% of the original water holding capacity of the lake was lost due to silting. Following this, check dams were constructed in the catchment area. But the water-level has once again started going down. The man-made lake now has a capacity of around 500 hectare-metres against the original capacity of over 1,074 hectare metres. The lake’s depth is 12-13 feet. On the north side, the lake is surrounded by 26-square-kilometre wildlife sanctuary. The March order had come on a suo motu plea going on since 2009. In March, the court had declared Sukhna as a living entity. Fine was imposed as court found that “state connived with the defaulters” in allowing construction. The chief secretaries of both states and the Chandigarh adviser were directed to constitute high-power committees to fix the responsibilities of officers who permitted large scale unauthorised construction.The court had also directed the ministry of environment and forest to notify at least 1-km area from the boundary of Sukhna Lake wildlife sanctuary as an eco-sensitive zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/high-court-to-re-examine-boundaries-of-sukhna-lake-catchment-area/story-d8Xv7gxGCM95JrGrvaN4CO.html

25-12-2020||Chandigarh||Now, personnel manning Chandigarh MC vehicles to pick waste from doorsteps||After failing to get the desired response from city residents for its latest segregation drive, the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) has decided to rejig its strategy.From asking residents to walk to the garbage collection vehicles to dump the waste, MC has now decided to ask its personnel manning these vehicles to collect garbage from people’s doorsteps.The change will be effected with the MC enrolling the existing cart-based private garbage collectors on its vehicles. “With the existing garbage collectors starting to man the MC vehicles also, the old practice of collectors picking up garbage from people’s houses will be gradually restored,” said Sorabh Arora, joint commissioner, MC.On Wednesday, the first day of the door-to-door segregated garbage collection, residents had complained that MC vehicles had left their lanes before they could reach them. Senior citizens, especially those living on the first and second floors, had also said that it was difficult for them to climb down the stairs. Even as teething problems persisted, MC asked its sanitary inspectors to coordinate with locals and resident welfare associations.“Today, members of the RWA along with area sanitary inspectors ushered the accompanying staff door-to-door to train them and educate residents about segregation. MC vehicle along with three helpers had started picking waste from all households,” said Jagrup Singh, adviser, Government Houses RWS, Sector 22.In many localities, though, the existing garbage collectors continued to collect garbage instead of MC vehicles.“In narrow motorable lanes, no MC vehicle came and waste collection was done by existing garbage collectors only. On bigger roads, MC vehicles came,” said RC Sharma, vice president, Sector 18 RWA.In Sector 8, “Informal waste collectors had picked most of the garbage from households before the arrival of the MC vehicle,” said RS Gill, president of Sector 8 RWA.Improvement from Day 1 Stating that there was marked improvement in the amount of segregated waste collected on the first day, Arora, said, “The amount of segregated waste deposited on Thursday doubled from Wednesday. In the coming days, we are expecting better results.”The MC will also be stepping up the awareness campaign among the residents. It plans to distribute pamphlets among the residents detailing information about the segregation.“We will also be organising webinar involving the residents and the resident welfare association to educate them about how to segregate waste and how to differentiate between different types of waste. The webinar will be addressed by solid waste experts. It is planned to be started from next week,” said Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-personnel-manning-chandigarh-mc-vehicles-to-pick-waste-from-doorsteps/story-h8Wh6RwwEh1sH0CjgTRwJP.html
25-12-2020||Mumbai||Covid: Maharashtra tweaks quarantine rules for fliers on new strain watchlist||Keeping in line with the trend of daily Covid-19 caseload below 4,000 over the past few days, Maharashtra recorded 3,580 cases on Thursday, taking the tally to 1,909,951. The death toll breached the 49,000 mark after 89 new casualties.The state government also tweaked its earlier order of mandatory quarantine of 14 days for travellers from Europe, Middle East and South Africa, bringing the period down to seven days, if they tested negative between the fifth and seventh day. The patients will have to complete the remaining quarantine period at home, the notification by chief secretary Sanjay Kumar stated.Earlier, on December 21, the state government had made 14-day institutional quarantine mandatory for passengers arriving from these countries in the wake of the emergence of a new fast spreading variant of the virus in the United Kingdom (UK) and other countries. The revised notification issued on Thursday has brought down the period to seven days, although hospitalisation for Covid-19-positive passengers remains intact. “On arrival, no RT-PCR test will be conducted for asymptomatic passengers who will be taken to a paid institutional quarantine facility [hotel]. They will be sent home if the test between 5th to 7th day results in a negative, although the remaining period of quarantine will have to be completed at home. Asymptomatic Covid-19 patients with will continue to be institutionally quarantine for 14 days,” the order stated. Meanwhile, Maharashtra continued to control its daily caseload as it has not crossed 5,000 for the past 20 days. A total of 98,503 cases have been reported in December, against the 109,166 during November 1-24. But experts still want people and authorities to be extra cautious for two reasons — first, the concern of a surge from next month and second, a new variant of Covid-19 found in the UK, which is believed to be 70% more transmissible than the original strain. They have also clarified that there is no need to revise our treatment protocol as of now, as the new variant is more infectious but it is yet to be proven that it is more harmful, said Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state-appointed task force for the clinical management of critical patients.“We don’t know its virulence yet. All we know is it is more infectious, means it spreads faster than the older strains. We also came to know that it has affected more people from the age group of 30 to 60 years, but this also could be a coincidence because that population is still out the most. I personally don’t think we can correlate this with the new variant,” said Dr Pandit, who is also director, critical care, Fortis Hospital, Mulund.He also said that they don’t need to revise the treatment protocol at this moment. “We may need to revise our testing protocol, because we have come to know that patients are testing positive early after exposure to the virus, compared to the previous version. At present, patients are coming positive after getting tested between 5th and 7th day, but the new variant probably is coming a bit early and a patient can test positive between 3rd and 4th day. However, this also needs to be confirmed through extensive research. We will be changing the testing protocol only after getting confirmed information,” he said. He also suggested to be cautious till the end of winter, especially in the backdrop of the emergence of the new variant.Mumbai clocked 643 cases, taking the count to 289,204, and 12 deaths, taking the toll to 11,045. Pune city recorded 299 cases, pushing the tally to 189,338. Nagpur city stands third after Mumbai and Pune in terms of daily caseload with 237 new cases. The state has completed 12,341,204 Covid tests with 62,728 tests conducted on Thursday. The overall positivity rate of the state stood at 15.48%. The number of recovered patients reached 1,804,871 with 3,171 recorded in the past 24 hours. The recovery rate remains at 94.5%. Meanwhile, a day after the announcement of allowing amusement parks and tourist places to open, the state tourism department issued standard operating procedures (SOPs), stressing for physical distancing by keeping the number of visitors low during rides as well as regular sanitising of premises to combat the Covid-19 virus. In case of amusement parks, the SOPs pointed that “staggering of visitors for different rides to be done, to allow for adequate physical distancing. Use of escalators with one person on alternate steps may be encouraged.” For tourist places, the tourism department has asked the staff to take adequate care to ensure the safety of themselves as well as the visitors. “Social-distancing includes refraining from hugging, shaking hands with travellers as well as among staff. It involves maintaining distance and avoiding anyone who is coughing or sneezing,” said the SOP.Amusement owners said these new guidelines will increase the overall running costs, making it an unviable proposition. “We spend at least ₹30 lakh to run our place, which will now increase due to these SOPs. However, in this pandemic, when people are avoiding going out, we will hardly get any visitors, it makes no business sense to open the place,” said Rajesh Vardhan, managing director, Vardhman Fantasy, who has an amusement park in Mira Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-maharashtra-tweaks-quarantine-rules-for-fliers-on-new-strain-watchlist/story-8yWWfxx94HrLB2X6AIUMJN.html

MNS leader Akhil Chitre, who is made a party in the suit by Amazon, said, “We wrote to the online apps to add Marathi as one of the language of operations after finding out that they had several southern Indian languages for operations but not Marathi.” After several meetings with party representatives and fearing aggravated action by MNS, Amazon approached the civil courts. The company has so far filed five suits in the courts, seeking the restraining orders against MNS. “The defendant [MNS] is threatening the plaintiff [Amazon] and the defendant is resorting to unfair labour trade practices, inciting the employees working at the plaintiff’s work premises through their arm-wresting tactics,” the lawyer for Amazon submitted before the court, while seeking the restraining orders. MNS however, raised the issue of jurisdiction, and objected to the relief sought by Amazon. However, the city civil court at Dindoshi granted relief to Amazon and said, “At this stage, it appears that protection is required to be given for the working of the plaintiff, otherwise there will be disturbance in their business activities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-court-to-mns-don-t-obstruct-amazon-s-business-activities/story-CuHwXmKCR9HPs83hdmfCXI.html
25-12-2020||City||Mere possession of fake notes not liable for IPC charges: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) recently granted bail to a 19-year-old man who was booked and arrested for allegedly possessing counterfeit notes. The court held that mere possession of counterfeit notes does not mean that there was an intention of knowingly using the notes on the part of the accused and hence the charges under section 489B (using as genuine, forged or counterfeit notes) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) does not apply to him. A bench of justice Bharati Dangre, while hearing the bail application of a man named Vachkal, was informed by his advocate Murtuza Nazmi that his client had been booked and charge sheeted with two others for allegedly possessing counterfeit notes. Vachkal and others were booked under sections 489B and other sections of IPC. According to the charge sheet, the anti-narcotic cell, Pune, had seized counterfeit notes of Rs500 and Rs2,000 denominations from the dashboard of a car during a raid. The officers found that Vachkal was in possession of three notes of Rs2,000 and one note of Rs500.The interrogation of the two arrested during the raid revealed name of the third person who was also later arrested but was granted default bail. Nazmi submitted that prima facie the charge sheet against Vachkal does not contain any material to reflect the mens rea (criminal intent) on the part of the applicant who possessed the said notes, which are alleged to be counterfeit. In light of this, he sought bail for his client. After hearing the submissions the court observed, “The applicant is merely found in possession of the counterfeit currency notes. The charge sheet did not contain any material to show that he was proposing to traffic or use the said notes as genuine or that he had knowledge or reason to believe that the said notes are forged or counterfeit. The applicant does not have any criminal antecedents and considering his young age, pending the trial, he cannot be incarcerated for long, particularly when on completion of investigation, the charge sheet has already been filed. He is, therefore, entitled to be released on bail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mere-possession-of-fake-notes-not-liable-for-ipc-charges-bombay-hc/story-sB87T2uJyycVKGdEI6dlXP.html
25-12-2020||Mumbai||Farmers from Maharashtra to join protest in Delhi today||Farmers from Maharashtra, who are marching to Delhi to lend their support to those protesting in the national capital against the three agriculture laws, reached Rajasthan on Thursday. The farmers have covered a distance of 900km since Monday, after they undertook their journey from Nashik. They are expected to reach Delhi on Friday. The farmers camped in Jaipur on Thursday. They will reach Shahpur on the Haryana-Rajasthan border on Friday afternoon, where they will join other protesting farmers, before entering Delhi. Ashok Dhawale, president of All India Kisan Sabha, said, “We were in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday and had four-five meetings. On Thursday, we camped in Jaipur, and on Friday morning we will leave for Shahpur, where farmers from Punjab and Haryana are protesting.” While more than 2,000 farmers in around 250 vehicles left from Nashik on Monday till Madhya Pradesh, only around 1,000 farmers proceeded to Jaipur on Thursday. “Not everyone can afford the money and time to travel all the way to Delhi. We have organised this march to show the central government that it’s not just farmers from Haryana and Punjab who are affected by these farm laws. When so many farmers from Maharashtra travel 1,300 km to Delhi to join protests, it will raze the government’s argument to the ground,” Dhawale said. Farmers claim that the laws favour big corporations to whom they will lose their business, gut the mandi system and gradually end the regime of minimum support prices (MSP) that acts as a protective net for cultivators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/farmers-from-maharashtra-to-join-protest-in-delhi-today/story-4TiNwg8efQBGibWzDRiY0O.html
25-12-2020||City||Bombay HC grants bail to man booked for minor’s sexual assault to reform||While observing that a man booked for sexually assaulting a minor will have to serve punishment after conviction, the Bombay high court (HC) recently granted bail to a 20-year-old booked for a similar crime on the grounds that he deserves a chance for reformation. The court noted that as the man, lodged at Yerawada jail at Pune, was undergoing clinical counselling by psychologists at Sassoon Hospital, it would help determine whether he was repentant about his act or wanted to continue to follow his antecedents.A single bench of justice Bharati Dangre, while hearing the bail application of the accused, was informed by his advocate Rajesh More that the man was undergoing reformative counselling in Yerawada jail while waiting for the trial to begin. More stressed on the fact that considering the crime he has committed, the man could be incarcerated for a long time, which may turn him into a hardened criminal, and hence he should be granted bail while he was undergoing counselling. The man was booked for unnatural sex and threatening under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and for forceful sexual exploitation of a minor under sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012.Additional public prosecutor SV Gavand for the state informed the court that the man was in conflict with the law when he was a juvenile, and had been booked twice after attaining majority. However, Gavand admitted that the jail and the hospital reports showed that the man had maintained good behaviour and was responding to counselling. After hearing the submissions, the court, while granting bail, observed, “The applicant is barely 20 years old and deserves a chance for reformation, though the offence with which he is charged cannot be wiped out, and on conviction, he should suffer the penalty prescribed. However, he deserves one chance of not just being out of prison to face the trial, but also to start his life afresh awaiting his trial. This opportunity will determine whether he repents over his past alleged conduct or whether he continues to follow his antecedents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-man-booked-for-minor-s-sexual-assault-to-reform/story-UJaVdFFv4XBiVEBDm4V2JP.html

25-12-2020||City||24-year-old Mumbai man held for supplying drugs, ₹27.5-lakh MD seized||The anti-narcotics cell (ANC) of Mumbai Police on Wednesday arrested a 24-year-old alleged drug supplier from south Mumbai with mephedrone (MD) worth ₹27.50 lakh. He was produced in the court and remanded in the police custody till December 28. Preliminary probe has revealed that the accused, Mohammad Nawaj Mohammad Ejaz Shaikh, was allegedly involved in the supply of drug from the past two years and several drug peddlers used to buy MD from him. The police also suspect that he was also in touch with drug suppliers from other states. Shaikh, a resident of Bara Imam Road in south Mumbai, sells spare parts of motorcycles. In the evening, he supplies drugs to small peddlers as well as consumers, said the police. Many of his consumers used to visit his residence to buy MD, said deputy commissioner of police Datta Nalawade of ANC. Following a tip-off, officers of Azad Maidan ANC laid a trap near his home on Wednesday evening and arrested him. During the search, they seized 275 grams of MD, said a police officer.

25-12-2020||Mumbai||Risk of mutation can’t be ignored, danger yet to pass, says Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray alerted people with the possible mutation of the virus, like it has spread in other countries, and stressed for the need to follow the Covid appropriate behaviour. Ruling out the need of reimposing the lockdown, the CM also justified his move of imposing night curfew by saying it will inculcate the sense of risk of spread of the virus among the people.CM while speaking to the media at his official bungalow, Varsha, on Thursday evening, said that the government has taken precautions to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread from the people coming from other countries where the second strain of the virus has been found. “We have started tracing the people coming from the United Kingdom (UK) where the new variant of the virus is found. But what if the same mutation takes place here, in our state. We are not paying heed to the possibility. To avert any such risk, we should follow the Covid-19 protocols by maintaining a safe distance, wearing masks and keep hands washing,” he said. Hitting out at his detractors, the CM justified the need of night curfew. “They asked if the virus spreads only at night and not during the day, questioning our decision of imposing night curfew. But they should understand that the curfew is to spread a sense of responsibility as the danger of the spread of virus still hovers over us. This will help us realise the seriousness of the situation. We don’t want to impose lockdown restrictions during the day, because there is no need of any such step currently,” Thackeray said.The state has imposed night curfew between 11pm and 6pm from December 22 to January 5 in the jurisdiction of 27 municipal corporations and has empowered the district collectors to impose the same if they feel necessary. It has made quarantine mandatory for the international passengers coming from Europe, Middle-East and South Africa to avert any possible spread of a new rapidly transmitting strain of Covid-19 from the travellers coming for countries at risk.Thackeray candidly admitted that he was under tremendous pressure during the initial peak of the pandemic. He said that in the wake of the scarcity of everything from doctors to medicines to oxygen and infrastructure, it was a huge challenge to contain the spread. He also took a dig at the central government for the hardship caused to the migrant workers during their mass exodus. “Days before the national lockdown was imposed on March 23, I repeatedly requested the Centre to arrange special trains for migrants and offered to pay the charges for it. It was very difficult to hold them back in the scenario they have been staying, but the Centre did not concede. As a result, migrants were forced to stay when we should have allowed them to travel to their native,” he said.Meanwhile, the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) initiated with the process to check on 55 passengers who returned from the United Kingdom between November 25 to December 23, followed by the directions from the Maharashtra government. “We have received a list of 55 passengers who returned from the UK to Kalyan-Dombivli during the specific period. Our area-wise health post has been asked to visit them and check on their health status. We will check if they have symptoms and will be asked to do RT-PCR and if tested positive we will take further measures to track their contacts,” said Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC. The KDMC on Thursday recorded 118 fresh Covid cases and the total number of cases till date is 60,034. The civic body has recorded 980 deaths till date.

Is this democracy?” Khattar asked.Khattar also touched upon the BJP’s winning streak in most of the elections, adding, “Over 70,000 representatives have been chosen by nearly two crore people. Now, there are those who are disappointed as their party did not come to power, We will teach them lessons only if we will keep them away.”The meaning of democracy is that the points are explained in the assembly to people, meetings are set up, pamphlets are distributed. Go to media. There is freedom of expression, the CM said. “Indulging in dhingamasti (scuffles) won’t do,” he warned.The people of Panchkula were intelligent, they should give a befitting reply to those causing trouble by voting for the BJP candidates, he said.The CM held rallies at six places in Panchkula city.Tomorrow is the last day of campaigning for the polls scheduled for December 27.

25-12-2020||Mumbai||FYJC special round postponed to Dec 28 by Maharashtra govt||A day after the Maharashtra government approved the proposal of extending the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) quota to Marathas, the state education department postponed the special merit list for junior college admissions scheduled on Thursday to December 28.The education department had earlier planned to declare the special merit list for admissions to first-year junior colleges (FYJC) in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) on Thursday, December 24. However, with the state government’s decision of extending the EWS quota to students from the Maratha community, such students will now be allowed to change their quota preference from SEBC to EWS or general by December 26. Students will also have to submit an undertaking for the new selection, as admissions will be provisional and will be subject to the submissions of documents required in future. Students who have availed EWS reservation will not be eligible for the SEBC reservation for admissions. Similarly, students who have already been admitted into colleges in the earlier rounds will be allowed to cancel their admissions in this round.“Many students might not have applied for the EWS reservation as they might have applied for the SEBC quota. Hence, admissions will be given to them on a provisional basis,” said an official from the state education department. While the special merit list will now be declared on December 28, students who are allotted colleges can confirm their seats by December 31.After the third merit list which was declared on December 15, only 213 students have been admitted against 14,644 seats for the EWS category in colleges across MMR. SEBC students can now apply against these vacant seats.On September 9, in line with the Supreme Court’s interim stay on the SEBC quota in jobs and education, the state education department stayed the admission process for FYJC until further orders. While the state government restarted admissions early this month stating that they will take place without the 12% SEBC quota, it has now allowed students from the SEBC quota to opt for the EWS quota as per the state government’s decision on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fyjc-special-round-postponed-to-dec-28-by-maharashtra-govt/story-XLeq79CmPg18wj99Px1mUJ.html
25-12-2020||City||Mumbai: Woman found with head injuries on Vashi bridge, cops suspect rape||A 25-year-old woman was found with severe head injuries on the Vashi railway bridge on Tuesday morning.According to police, prima facie it appears that she was raped and thrown out of a moving train by some unidentified culprits.The doctors from Sir JJ Hospital have found signs of sexual assault, following which the government railway police (GRP) registered a case under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 376 (punishment for rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the unidentified accused. Vishnu Kesarkar, a senior inspector of Vashi, GRP, said, “The woman could barely talk when the officers found her on the bridge. She mentioned the mosque at Titwala when we asked her about her address. Officers then took her photographs and found out about the mosque she mentioned. After questioning a lot of people, we traced her family in that area,” he said.“We are examining the CCTV footage of all the railway stations, but have not seen the woman boarding a train at any station so far. It is also possible that the culprits had assaulted her at some other place and then dumped her on the railway bridge to mislead the police. There are no CCTV cameras on the railway bridge,” Kesarkar said.“The woman worked as a maid with a family at Powai. She had gone home to meet her family members on Sunday and returned in the evening. On Monday she again left that family saying that her mother was not well. That day she neither went to Titwala nor returned to Powai,” he said.The GRP has formed multiple teams to investigate the case. They are now also checking her call data records to find out the people she was in touch with.“The woman is still in a semi-conscious state and we have not been able to take her statements so far,” Kesarkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-woman-found-with-head-injuries-on-vashi-bridge-cops-suspect-rape/story-BCjElgHDQ1RylfRZpKXkuO.html
25-12-2020||Chandigarh||Bir Devinder Singh seeks CBI probe into Mohali cyber hub project||Former Punjab vidhan sabha deputy speaker Bir Devinder Singh has sought a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into a cyber hub coming up on plot number A-32 in phase 8 of Mohali, alleging grave violations. The ruling Congress government, however, has refuted the charges.Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Bir Devinder, who is also the former Kharar MLA, raised questions over the project coming up on 31 acres of land over there, alleging plot A 32 was allotted by Punjab Infotech to JCT limited in September 1984, but after the unit was declared sick and closed it was sold by the official liquidator. “The GRG Cyber Hub is coming up on the plot and according to the brochure more than 150 plots are being sold but without demarcation of the green belt in that area which is against RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) norms without amending the sector plan that is otherwise not allowed,” alleged Bir Devinder Singh. The plot was allotted to JCT as single unit plot in 1984 when the sector was originally carved out. The infrastructure of roads, water supply was developed to cater to the needs of one unit,” he added. Division of a single plot into multiple plots was not permissible without approval of the amendment of the sector plan by the Cyber Treasury Punjab (CTP). Under new guidelines of the National Green Tribunal a public hearing was a must in the case, he said. “Under whose directions or patronage is the operation is being carried out so brazenly and audaciously? Why is the chief minister silent over such blatant plunder of state wealth?,”questioned Bir Devinder Singh, asking for a CBI probe.No undue advantage extended to private party Reacting to the charges as “unfounded” on Thursday, however, the Punjab government said the process of disposal of property was being carried out transparently by the Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Limited (ARCIL) under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002. According to an official spokesperson of the industry department, the disposal of the property had been made by ARCIL under the appropriate provisions of the Act through open e-bidding in a fair and transparent manner and dues of Punjab Small Industries & Export Corporation had also been protected. No undue favours were granted to GRG Developers and Promoters LLP, that is the auction purchaser. It was to be noted that ARCIL had conducted open auction three times and had been successful the fourth time.Auctioned to highest bidderThe government said that an open e-auction had again been conducted by ARCIL during February 2020 at the reserve price of Rs. 90.50 crore and the plot had been sold at the highest bid amount of Rs. 90.56 crore to GRG Developers and Promoters LLP. The statement issued by government said that GRG Developers & Promoters had already paid 50% sale value of the plot with ARCIL and had entered into agreement with PSIEC for making payment of 50% unearned increase of Rs. 45. 28 crore plus enhanced land cost and applicable transfer fee as per guidelines within a stipulated time period with applicable interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bir-devinder-singh-seeks-cbi-probe-into-mohali-cyber-hub-project/story-vjQkpnCPoq4jfNKo4X9GjL.html

Preliminary questioning revealed that three crushers (machines to break rocks) were used for illegal mining, the SSP added.“This group used to deploy their associates on certain locations to keep a watch on activities of officials deputed on duty in the police and mining departments. They also kept escort vehicles to prevent anyone from seizing their illegal sand tippers,” Satinder Singh said.Five separate cases were registered at the Majri police station under sections 4(1), 21(1) Mines & Minerals (Regulation & Development) Act 1957 and 379 of the Indian Penal Code.

25-12-2020||Mumbai||Second semester scheduled from January to May: Mumbai university||With examination to most undergraduate courses coming to an end, the University of Mumbai (MU) has clarified that the second-term for the 2020-21 academic year will commence from January 1 until May 31, 2021. Summer vacations have been scheduled from June 1-13, 2021. A circular to this effect has been shared with all affiliated colleges this week.“All faculties including traditional (arts, commerce and science) as well as interdisciplinary studies have followed first-term from August 7 to December 31. The second-term will take place between January 1 to May 31, and the summer holidays will take place from June 1 to 13,” states the circular.As per MU’s November 18 circular, affiliated colleges are supposed to hold online exams for the current batches of undergraduate courses by December 2020, while postgraduate exams should be conducted in January 2021. Following this, the Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU) approached MU’s vice-chancellor, seeking postponement of first-year degree college exams. Teachers highlighted that due to delay in admissions to first-year courses, most colleges have not managed to teach the mandatory 90 days before exams, making it impossible to hold exams in December. Following this, the varsity in the first week of December released a circular clarifying that all affiliated colleges should complete first-term examinations for their first-year batches by January 9, 2021. “Most exams will be completed by this month-end, so it makes sense to start the new term in January. We are still assuming that classes will continue online and they will resume accordingly,” said the principal of a suburban college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/second-semester-scheduled-from-january-to-may-mumbai-university/story-bJud8DmJ3UJRnwLGyTKxvK.html

25-12-2020||City||Maratha leaders oppose Maharashtra govt’s decision to extend EWS quota for community||A day after the state cabinet decided to extend the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) quota benefits to the Marathas, community leaders have criticised the government. They have expressed concerns over the adverse effect of the move on the ongoing legal battle and have said that the decision is taken out of helplessness. The state had on Wednesday approved the proposal to extend the 10% EWS quota to Marathas, after the Supreme Court (SC) stayed the implementation of the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act under which the community was granted 12% and 13% in education and jobs, respectively. A constitution bench will hear the reservation petitions from January 25 in the case. Bharatiya Janata Party parliamentarian and Maratha leader Sambhaji Chhatrapati has criticised the state and warned that it will have to take responsibility if the decision affects the legal battle. “The decision may affect the prospect of the SEBC quota in the legal battle. In such a case, the responsibility will entirely lie with the government. The decision was taken out of helplessness. It seems that the government is convinced that the reservation is not going to stand the legal scrutiny,” he said. Public works department minister and head of the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation Ashok Chavan said the decision to extend EWS quota was taken as per the Bombay high court (HC) orders after a few community members had moved HC to avail EWS quota. “A section of community leaders are playing politics over the reservation, by criticising any decision taken by the government. The state cabinet’s September decision to extend EWS quota to the Marathas had to be put on hold after the community leaders had opposed it. The state is determined to protect the SEBC reservation and has prepared to fight the legal battle in the Apex Court,” he said. Community members, however, have expressed their reservations over the decision. “The decision could go against our contention of urgency in hearing the matter in the top court. We have been opposing the move since the beginning. Secondly, the SEBC reservation has just been stayed and not cancelled by the court. This means the community cannot avail second reservation when the one meant for them is still in force. Most importantly, the actual percentage of Marathas benefitting from EWS quota will be too less as we will be competing with people in open category,” said Virendra Pawar, one of the organisers of Maratha Kranti Morcha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maratha-leaders-oppose-maharashtra-govt-s-decision-to-extend-ews-quota-for-community/story-SI2DfiCMuu7KfglRXK9joO.html
25-12-2020||Mumbai||Families struggle as Mumbai civic hospitals turn away psychiatric patients||With most psychiatry departments in civic-run hospitals shut since March, when the lockdown began, patients and their families are struggling to cope with the challenges posed by their mental disorders. On December 18, Sachin Karve, 48, was rushed to Dr RN Cooper Municipal General Hospital, in Juhu, by his wife Swati. Despite Karve being an alcoholic who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and having a history of hospitalisation, the hospital refused to admit him.Back in August, Karve had been admitted to Cooper Hospital for 15 days when his condition had deteoriated. “The psychiatry department has been closed since March when the Covid-19 outbreak began. So we had to admit him [Karve] in a general ward. However, he soon started harassing other patients who beat him up. Then he ran away from the hospital twice,” said a doctor who is aware of the case. When Karve was eventually found — he hadn’t left the hospital — Swati had to take him home. “The hospital instructed me to keep an eye on him [Karve] round the clock at the hospital. We don’t have anyone to stay at the hospital all the time. I have two children, 10 and 9 years old, whom I can’t leave alone at home,” she said. In December, when Karve’s condition worsened again, Swati returned to Cooper Hospital, but the hospital is still not admitting patients. “All the departments have opened up except psychiatry. There are patients with suicidal intentions and depression who can even cause harm to others. They need immediate hospitalisation. Despite this, we can’t admit them,” said a doctor from the hospital, requesting anonymity.However, despite repeated calls and messages, Dr Pinakin Gujjar dean of the hospital didn’t respond. The government-run Sir JJ Hospital started admitting psychiatric patients from the first week of December. “During the pandemic, we had to close down the psychiatric wards and send back the patients to their respective homes, which disrupted their treatment. But now we have opened up the OPD [outpatients’ department] and the admission process,” said Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar, dean of Sir JJ Hospital. King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, in Parel, has also begun partial hospitalisation of patients with psychiatric disorders.According to a study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 130 countries, 67% of those surveyed reported disruptions in counselling and psychotherapy due to the pandemic and 35% reported disruptions to emergency interventions for psychiatric conditions. Additionally, many Covid-19 survivors have been found to be at a greater risk of developing mental health issues like anxiety, depression and insomnia, psychiatrists said. “This is the time to focus on mental health and invest more into building up the infrastructure. People are already living in fear of the pandemic. So, we need to provide wider opportunities to patients,” said Dr Harish Shetty, a city psychiatrist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/families-struggle-as-mumbai-civic-hospitals-turn-away-psychiatric-patients/story-TpU5hlgrlDMITXIT04KTmO.html
25-12-2020||Chandigarh||Two Mohali policemen held for murder bid sent to police remand||A local court on Thursday sent the two Mohali police personnel arrested for attempt to murder to six-day police remand. Dismissed from service after their arrest, Rashpreet Singh, an assistant sub-inspector posted at the Industrial Area police station, and Davinder Singh, a constable posted at the Saneta police post, were arrested for allegedly entering the house of Sector 71 resident Naresh Kumar and trying to rob him at gunpoint on December 20. Police recovered an Etios car from their possession. Two other persons believed to be linked to the crime, who informed the policemen about Naresh keeping money and valuables at home, are yet to be arrested. The weapon too has not been traced.Naresh Kumar had complained to the police that on December 20, at around 9.30pm, as his son was checking a power inverter that had broken down at home, two men in police uniform posing as deputy superintendents of police of the excise department entered his house. One of them later identified as Rashpreet Singh pointed a pistol at him and asked him to hand over all the gold and cash in the house. When Naresh became suspicious and asked for a search warrant and their identity cards, the duo allegedly panicked and started beating him up, with Rashpreet hitting him several times on the head with the butt of a pistol. Naresh read Davinder’s name on his badge when the constable tried to grab him by the arms. After the failed loot bid, the two policemen allegedly fled in a car waiting outside. Naresh Kumar was admitted to a private hospital in Mohali with head and other injuries. A case was registered under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint), 458 (lurking house trespass or house-breaking by night after preparation for hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code besides under the Arms Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-mohali-policemen-held-for-murder-bid-sent-to-police-remand/story-nvMSdgSkbXkqtPTmIeoUTM.html

The proposed alignment requires at least minimum forest land, which is unavoidable,” read MMRDA’s letter to the ministry, justifying the diversion of forest land. A senior MMRDA official, who did not wish to be named, said, “The portion is just a small patch of forest near the Kasheli creek. We are awaiting approval in a month or two.” In 2017, MMRDA had to seek the nod of the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for the project, as the alignment crosses the Ulhas river near Kalyan. The 24.9-km Metro-5 corridor will connect Thane and Kalyan via the power loom town of Bhiwandi and will have 17 stations.Currently, the areas are connected only via the overcrowded suburban railway. The cost of the project is pegged at Rs8,417 crore.Recently, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had shifted the proposed Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg, as the plot in Aarey had witnessed severe opposition from activists. However, the transfer of land in Kanjurmarg was stayed by the Bombay high court (HC) after the central government also claimed ownership of the plot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mmrda-seeks-centre-s-nod-to-divert-forest-land-for-mumbai-metro-5-corridor/story-wvmL05WHJhBzC3wAKLDd2L.html

While churches have arranged online masses, some parishioners are upset about the last-minute restrictions. Midnight mass has been cancelled and mass timings have been revised following the announcement of night curfew earlier this week. Father Nigel Barrett, the spokesperson of the Archdiocese of Bombay, said, “All Christmas mass and New Year’s Eve services will be concluded before 11pm in all churches, following the night curfew restrictions imposed by the state government.”Initially, when congregations of 200 were allowed, churches had arranged for one member from each family to attend Christmas mass to prevent overcrowding in light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. On Wednesday, the state capped the number of people allowed to attend mass to 50. Some members of the city’s Christian community have started an online petition that reads, “The new GR [government resolution] by the state government of allowing only 50 people for mass has dampened the people’s spirit and killed the joy of those who eagerly await to pray on Christmas even after following and adhering to every protocol.” Mobai Gaonthan Panchayat (MGP), an umbrella body that represents the East Indian community, has appealed to its members to ask the state government to waive the night curfew for Christmas. “The night curfew announcement has not gone down well with many amongst the peace-loving Christian community. We at MGP along with like-minded Christians object to this sudden announcement before Christmas. We want a special standard operating procedure (SOP) to be released for Christmas [as was] done for Ganeshotsav,” said Gleason Barretto, MGP’s spokesperson.Judith Monteiro, a member of the Association of Concerned Catholics (AOCC), said, “On the eve of Christmas, you’ll have issued further restrictions on the Church eucharistic celebrations in terms of attendance of the people, because of which many churches have cancelled the eucharistic celebration (as they cannot be partial to some while forfeiting others) thus denying us ... Mass and ... Holy Communion...We appeal to you to please allow mass with a maximum of 200 (depending on the capacity of Church).” A letter has been sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, with this appeal.Father Nobert D’souza of Holy Cross church in Kurla said that it would be able to ensure adequate distancing and therefore would have midnight mass. “We have a huge campus, which is why we can go ahead with our plan to allow 200 people for midnight mass. Since the government has made it compulsory to only allow 50 people at a time, we have planned to distribute people in groups. While one group will be in the church, other groups will be in separate buildings on the premises, thus ensuring that all rules are obeyed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-subdued-christmas-celebrations-in-mumbai-curbs-irk-many/story-dsxIFfppqaT4qRDcPZzloI.html
25-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro shed: Maharashtra govt may form panel to find right location||To end the ongoing stalemate over the land allocation for the car shed for Metro lines and its friction with the Centre over the Kanjurmarg land, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is likely to form another committee to study and zero in on the right location for the car shed for the Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) corridor. This committee will be the third to study alternatives for the depot for line 3 in the past five years. On Tuesday, the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) also wrote to the state government, stating the 25-hectare plot in Aarey Colony will prove to be “insufficient to handle future traffic and hence can prove to be an imperfect solution in the future” and that Kanjurmarg plot would be a “better option” for the car shed. Sources privy to the development said the government was likely to issue an order with the terms of reference in a day or two. The committee is likely to deliberate on the technical feasibility of both, the Aarey and the Kanjurmarg plots. In 2015, the then Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government had formed a committee under former metropolitan commissioner UPS Madan to find an alternative site for the depot. The MVA government, too, in December 2019, had formed a committee under additional chief secretary (finance) Manoj Saunik to study the alternatives. While the MVA shifted the car shed from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg in October 2020, the Bombay high court (HC) ordered an interim stay on the transfer of the Kanjurmarg land, after the Central government claimed ownership on it. The litigation and court order has put a spanner in the ongoing Metro shed work, with clear indication of the delay in commissioning of the line. However, sources said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is keen on the Kanjurmarg plot. In his address to citizens last Sunday, Thackeray also invited the Opposition and the Centre for a dialogue. Thackeray has been criticised by the Opposition BJP for shifting of the shed, saying it will delay the project by three years and lead to the escalation of the cost at least by ₹4,000 crore. Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis attacked Thackeray saying the decision of shifting the shed location was to satisfy his ego. Meanwhile, in its letter to the state, the MMRDA has stated that the depot in Aarey was planned to accommodate a total of 39 rakes, however, as per the traffic estimates, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC), which is executing the project, would require 42 trains by 2031 itself. The letter states, “The depot capacity at Aarey would have got exhausted by 2031 itself. To meet the full projected requirement at Aarey Depot, it is necessary to restore to full 30 ha. land. This would have required the additional 5 ha land kept aside as there are more than 1000 trees existing on the land. It’s very difficult to create additional depot facilities other than Aarey at a later date once the system comes in operation (sic).” It further states, “The present commissioning plan of line 3 is mid-2023 and if a quick decision can be taken by the state government to provide land with minimal delay, of about six months, it would still be possible to commission line 3 by Dec of 2023. (sic)” It states that while the cost of building separate depots for line 3, 4 and 6 would be ₹2,434 crore, an integrated depot at Kanjurmarg can be built at a cost of ₹1,600 crore. The letter states, “Considering the scarcity of land and consequent land acquisition cost involved, Kanjurmarg appears to be a more efficient alternative. An integrated car shed utilises the synergies of the project to avoid duplicating the infrastructure and costs and improves operational efficiency. In the event if Kanjurmarg land is not allotted, it would also involve additional land acquisitions and detrimental ecological impact and duplication of infrastructure and resources (sic).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-shed-maharashtra-govt-may-form-panel-to-find-right-location/story-KKVxvmW2mFeG0yBKNgQXXN.html
25-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra to give relief to anti-CAA protesters?||The state government may withdraw cases filed against those who took part in the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) stir in Mumbai early this year. A delegation of civil activists, under the banner of Hum Bharat Ke Log, met home minister Anil Deshmukh at his official residence on Thursday. Deshmukh has promised them “appropriate action”, they said.According to the activists, there are at least five FIRs registered against the protesters in various police stations, along with more such cases across the city. “It was a peaceful protest across Mumbai and Maharashtra. There was no violence. The police booked many indiscriminately,” said Feroze Mithiborwala, a central committee member, Hum Bharat Ke Log, who submitted a memorandum signed by 31 scholars, social activists and politicians to the home minister. “We requested for withdrawal of the cases in accordance with the recent state government decision of withdrawal of social and political cases. All anti-CAA agitations received a huge response from the public. We have mentioned five FIRs registered in various police stations, although there are more such cases lodged in the city for protesting against the CAA. The minister has forwarded our memorandum to his department for further action,” said Mithiborwala, adding, “As the trains are still not running, our activists will face a harrowing time coming to courts. Moreover, it is risky to travel during the Covid-19 pandemic and we may have to spend a lot of money.” Deshmukh has instructed officials from the home department to take cognisance of the matter. Last year, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central Government passed the CAA, which it said was aimed at helping persecuted minorities from neighbouring countries. This led to protests across the country, including Maharashtra. One of the prominent sit-in protests in the city was at Agripada, termed Mumbai Bagh on the lines of Delhi’s Shaheen Baug, which went on for 56 days. It was called off after a lockdown was imposed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-give-relief-to-anti-caa-protesters/story-GIhPlNPrXa8mNOj60WkFqO.html

She has been named by the party for her nomination to the legislative council from the Governor quota.“I never wanted to be an MP (member of Parliament), even when I joined the Congress in March, last year. I would have campaigned for the party at the national level, but the party leadership insisted that I contest the Lok Sabha election. I always wanted to work for the people and the broader janhit (welfare). I would like to be people’s neta like I was perceived as ‘people’s actress’. My name has been nominated to Council by my party, but I never joined the party to become a legislator. I always wanted to work for the people and will continue to do so, even if I was not sent to the Council,” said the actress during the conversation with a select group of journalists at Sena Bhavan.Matondkar is among 12 people recommended by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for the nomination to the Council. The proposal is waiting for Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s nod for last more than one and half a month. The uncertainty still hovers over the nominations of the names recommended by the MVA government.Matondkar said that she was not upset with the Congress and she still shares good relations with party leaders like Sonia and Rahul Gandhi at the national level and Balasaheb Thorat at the state level. “I was offered the Council seat by Congress too, but I had already quit Congress. I had a problem with second rung leadership in the party. I was contacted by honourable chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and told that I was needed in the Council for the betterment of cultural and social field in the state. It appealed me the most and I decided to join the party,” she said.Matondkar said that Shiv Sena’s Hindutva is ‘inclusive’ and does not believe in diving people in the names of religion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/even-if-not-nominated-to-council-i-will-work-for-people-of-maharashtra-says-urmila-matondkar/story-zd0APiTgv5GKZszHbgtgEI.html

25-12-2020||Noida||HC directs Noida authority to reconsider plot cancellation in Sector 61||The Allahabad high court has directed the chief executive officer (CEO) of Noida authority to grant one more year for construction to a petitioner, whose lease deed for a plot in Sector 61 was cancelled in August 2020.Noida Authority in an order, dated August 7, 2020, had cancelled the lease deed of a plot in Sector 61 with the observation that the land in question was not utilised by the petitioner.The authority’s counsel stated that physical possession of the said plot has not been taken by the authority. Moreover, the counsel argued in the matter of cancellation of the lease deed, for violation of the terms and conditions therein, the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Development (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, would be relevant. The ordinance provides for insertion in Section 7 of the U.P. Industrial Area Development Act, 1976, that states: “Provided that where any land so allotted is not utilised for the purpose for which it was allotted within the period of five years from the date of possession or within the period fixed for such utilisation in the conditions of allotment, whichever is longer, the lease deed will stand cancelled and the land shall vest with the Authority.”“The high court bench of Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Jayant Banerji disposed off the petition with the observation that the CEO of Noida Authority shall consider the request of the petitioner for the grant of one more year for making completion of the construction over the plot in dispute in accordance with the amended Ordinance, 2020,” advocate Anoop Trivedi said on ThursdayNoida Authority Legal Department said high court order will be complied as per amended ordinance.The authority had in August cancelled allotment of three plots for violation of the conditions mentioned in the lease deed. The authority had taken action in response to a UP government ordinance that came in July 2020 stating that a plot should be cancelled if the owner was found to be violating terms and conditions of allotment. These terms and conditions include violation of land use, default of plot cost and delay in making the business functional among others, said officials. “The authority cancelled the allotment on violations of lease deed conditions. Some were using the plot for purposes other than permitted use for example, for commercial purposes. However if the Allahabad high court has issued any order, then we will obey the same,” said Avinash Tripathi officer on special duty of the Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/hc-directs-noida-authority-to-reconsider-plot-cancellation-in-sector-61/story-ikOYGOocVZvPjV2NR2aPCI.html

25-12-2020||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad suffer ‘severe’ air for the third day||Local emissions and weather conditions kept the city air quality under “severe” category for the third day in row. On Thursday, the three cities, namely Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Noida, remained the most polluted cities of the country like a day earlier. According to the weather analysts, while there is no external sources of pollution in the city, the ventilation is low due to limited wind time of low speed. With the pollution levels well over six to seven times the safe standards, the three cities remained under “severe” category despite marginal improvement since past 24 hours. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) bulletin, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on a scale of 0 to 500, on Thursday was 441 — the third worse in country as against 462 on Wednesday and 437 on Tuesday. Greater Noida’s AQI was 448, as against 476 on Wednesday and 450 on Tuesday. It was the worst polluted city. The AQI of Ghaziabad, the second-most polluted city, was 440 as against 472 on Wednesday and 458 on Tuesday. According to the IMD, the city is not getting enough winds to disperse the pollutants. The city, according to the experts, is receiving winds between 11am to 4.30pm, while the winds go calmer for the rest of the day. Due to this the pollutants trapped in the atmosphere.“Thursday saw maximum wind speed of about 10 kmph between 11am and 4.30pm. The wind speed may increase towards slightly by 2kmph on Friday, which may marginally improve the air quality. The city is also seeing higher humidity levels of around 100 to 95% and lower temperatures — both the conditions are suitable to trap the pollutants,” said said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. The fine particles or pollutants PM2.5 levels spiked from twice on Sunday to seven times higher than the standards sine Wednesday , continuing on Thursday. On Thursday, PM2.5 for past 24-hours in Noida was recorded at 350.18 microgrammes per cubic metres against 405.18 microgrammes per cubic metres on Wednesday and 347.63 microgrammes per cubic metres on Tuesday. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 355.48 microgrammes per cubic metres against 438.17 microgrammes per cubic metres on Wednesday and 368.41 microgrammes per cubic metres on Tuesday. The PM2.5 levels for Ghaziabad on Thursday was 364.56 microgrammes per cubic metres against 449.69 on Wednesday and 389.73 microgrammes per cubic metres on Tuesday. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 units. According to the system of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI is likely to improve slightly. “Under the calm wind-cold conditions, low ventilation has halted the dispersion of accumulated pollutant. However, better ventilation condition is forecasted for the next two days. Hence, AQI is forecasted to improve to the higher end of the very poor category by 25th Dec and likely to further improve to the middle-end of Very Poor on 26th and 27th Dec (sic),” said the SAFAR statement on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-ghaziabad-suffer-severe-air-for-the-third-day/story-sTnAzbdRtzrlQrRx2cFBsN.html
25-12-2020||Noida||New Greater Noida to be developed on lines of Gurugram||The new Greater Noida area, to be expanded on at least 30,000 hectares, will be developed on the Gurugram model of land acquisition, said officials. This will allow for better development and avoid disputes pertaining to land acquisition and compensation, said officials.Under the existing model, the authority acquires land from farmers, develops it and then sells the same to developers, industrial firms and others. By applying the Gurugram model, the authority now wants to develop basic facilities and allow investors to buy the land directly from farmers and then give permissions for businesses and other ventures.The Uttar Pradesh government has given the green signal for the change in approach. Also, the boundary for land acquisition has been marked till a subsection of a canal originating from the Upper Ganga Canal, towards Bulandshahr, where agricultural land is available, said officials.As per the Master Plan-2021, the Greater Noida has around 38,000 hectares notified area, largely bounded by NH-24 in the north-west, Hindon river on the western side and GT Road/Northern Railway mainline to Kolkata on the eastern side, in 124 villages. On the northern and western sides, it is flanked by Ghaziabad and Noida, respectively.The UP government established the industrial town in 1992 to boost growth. However, due to farmers’ frequent protests, the area could not be developed as planned, said officials. Farmers frequently resist land acquisition attempts on the grounds that the compensation offered was not adequate.The acquisition has also turned violent in the past, with the death of five farmers were on August 13, 2008, in Ghodi Bachheda and the death of six farmers in Bhatta-Parsaul in 2011. The UP government has decided to change its approach to keep farmers happy, said officials.“We will follow Gurugram model and acquire land for only basic infrastructure, such as roads, drainage network and other community services. We will develop the basic facilities and allow interested developers to buy the land directly from farmers, who can have a stake in projects and grow alongside industrial development,” said Narendra Bhooshan, the chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.The Greater Noida authority is already working to finalise its Master Plan 2041, which will detail the exact land to be earmarked for industrial, residential, commercial, institutional and other uses. It has planned to earmark land of 80 more villages for expansion and seek required approvals before starting the development works next year, said officials.“We will soon finalise Master Plan 2041 and start the expansion of this town. We need to expand because there are huge opportunities, in view of Noida International airport at Jewar, along Yamuna Expressway. We will also adopt the land pooling policy that gives the opportunity to farmers to become partners in realty or industrial projects, like Gurugram. Besides, investors can contact farmers and approach us for licences to operate in the city, on the lines of Gurugram’s operations,” said Bhooshan.Surendra Nahta president of medium, small, micro enterprise association, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “Agitations and court cases affect businesses badly. Peace and better policing are crucial for businesses to grow. And if land procurement is with ease, then it makes a huge difference.”Realtors were also enthused about the change in approach as it reduces the scope for conflicts with landowners. “Developers and other investors face huge losses if a land dispute with farmer crops up. Not having any dispute over the land is always beneficial for any business to flourish and the land is the most important component in business, be it realty sector or industrial,” said RK Arora, the president of National Real Estate Development Council, Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/new-greater-noida-to-be-developed-on-lines-of-gurugram/story-3RVuGfR9S9Z7FfDxfq96BK.html
25-12-2020||Noida||NMRC decides to terminate feeder bus service after four years of operation||Noida: The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) in its annual board meeting on Thursday decided to terminate the contract of the feeder bus service, four years after its operation. The fleet of 50 low-floor buses were meant to provide last mile connectivity from metro stations to different sectors and villages. The feeder buses had been plying in Noida and Greater Noida since December 14, 2016, NMRC officials said. Manoj Vajpayee, general manager, NMRC, said that NMRC on Thursday convened its 26th board meeting followed by its 6th Annual General Meeting. Both the meetings were conducted via video conferencing at the NMRC headquarters in Noida. “The board deliberated the matter of feeder bus service and authorized managing director NMRC to terminate the contract of the service, in view of various violations, as per the clauses in the contract. The bus service did not serve the purpose it was meant for,” Vajpayee said. However, Vajpayee did not elaborate on the violations. Praveen Mishra, NMRC’s executive director, who attended the meeting, confirmed that the services have been terminated but refused to comment further. Sources said that the bus service was running in loss since its operation. HT had published a report on May 30, 2019 in which a senior NMRC official had said that these buses record an average of 10,000 commuters and generate ₹3.50 lakh revenue a day, which is not enough for the corporation to even recover its operational costs. The NMRC’s monthly revenue from the bus service wsa is ₹1 crore, against ₹3 crore of operational expenses a month, the officials said.NMRC had signed a contract with a private transport company to run the city bus service. The buses will remain with the company as the contract is terminated, the officials said. NMRC had suspended the services of this bus facility since the outbreak of Coronavirus in March this year.The bus service was funded by the Noida Authority and Greater Noida Authority. NMRC had a fleet of 50 low-floor AC buses that ran on 11 routes in Noida, Greater Noida and Noida Extension. These low-floor GPS-enabled buses were covered with two CCTV cameras and panic buttons.In Noida, these buses started from Botanic Garden and covered different metro stations across Noida, as well as some villages. Similarly, the buses also started from Noida Extension to Sector 51 Metro Station, and covered Gaur City, Kisan Chowk, Garhi Chaukhandi village, and others on the way. These buses also ran between Noida and Greater Noida, covering Sector Alpha 1, Pari Chowk, Knowledge Park, NSEZ, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/nmrc-decides-to-terminate-feeder-bus-service-after-four-years-of-operation/story-rNwhbeC4gp5YPqmkLUdwEI.html
25-12-2020||Noida||Traffic hit as pro-farm bill farmers protest at Noida e-way for 5 hours||A group of farmers on Thursday protested at the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway near Mahamaya Flyway, affecting the traffic moving from Greater Noida towards Delhi for about five hours. The protest was led by the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti (KSS), which is supporting the Centre’s new farm bills.The farmers claimed that they wanted to go to Delhi to meet the Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar but were stopped by the police. They gathered at the spot around 11:30am and protested till 4:30pm, the police said. Bijendra Singh Rawal, president, KSS, GB Nagar, said, “Along with 500 other farmers, I have come here in support of the three farm laws. We have gone through these laws and found them useful. These laws will break the shackles that have been restricting the farmers from growth and prosperity since Independence,” he said. Rawal further said that earlier, the farmers had the option to sell their produce only at the mandi. “There was no other option to sell the produce outside mandi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reiterated that the mandis will exist while the farmers will have option to sell their crops to others at their convenience,” said Rawal.He alleged that in the mandis, there are middlemen, who take commission to facilitate the sale and purchase of the crops that ultimately affects the income of farmers. Meanwhile, some members of Kisan Sena, another outfit, also joined the pro-farm laws protest near Mahamaya Flyway. Satveer Tyagi, a resident of Kulesra village in Greater Noida, said, “I grow paddy, wheat and bajra in my fields. When we go to sell the produce in the mandis, the mediators seek commission from us. Now, we can visit other places and sell our crops if we get better price,” he said. A Noida police team reached the spot and placed barricades on both sides of the protesters. A team also flew a drone to keep aerial surveillance. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional DCP, Noida Zone 1, said that the farmers had started gathering from 11:30am onwards. “The police had placed barricades and allowed traffic movement in a single lane for commuters heading towards DND Flyway and Film City Flyway. But at 4pm, another farmers’ group came from Western Uttar Pradesh and joined the protest. The gathering became large and we stopped the traffic completely till 4:30pm on the route. However, we diverted the traffic at Charkha Chowk, near Amity University. These vehicles were guided to reach Okhla Sanctuary metro station and take the underpass to reach Noida-Greater Noida Expressway again,” he said. The police later allowed a 21-member farmers’ delegation to enter Delhi to meet the Union Agriculture Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/traffic-hit-as-pro-farm-bill-farmers-protest-at-noida-e-way-for-5-hours/story-2X0RIw0glbWRrtJYehKgAM.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||SDMC makes it mandatory for meat shops, restaurants to mention halal or jhatka||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Thursday passed a proposal regarding mandatory mention of halal or jhatka for the meat being served at restaurants. This order will also be applicable at meat shops in SDMC area.The proposal, cleared by the standing committee, will now be sent to the House for final approval. “There are thousands of restaurants in 104 wards of four zones falling under South Delhi Municipal Corporation. Out of these meat is served in about 90% of restaurants but it is not mentioned whether the meat being served by the restaurants is halal or jhatka. Similarly, the meat shops also do not make the distinction.... Therefore, this meeting resolves that this direction be given to restaurants and meat shops that writing/mentioning jhatka or halal has been made mandatory,” the resolution stated.In August 2018, the East Delhi municipal corporation had also passed a similar resolution. However, there is no such practice in place in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.Narendra Chawla, leader of the House in SDMC, said that it was the right of the consumer to know what type of food he or she is consuming.“You may find halal or jhatka meat written on the meat shops but such a practice is rare in restaurants. Many people do not eat jhatka meat and similarly many don’t eat halal meat but in restaurants you cannot tell the meat type being served. So it is a healthy practice to mention what kind of meat is being served at the restaurants,” Chawla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sdmc-makes-it-mandatory-for-meat-shops-restaurants-to-mention-halal-or-jhatka/story-AUO2rsWRm64y3vtGW00FaN.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||Civic body employees stage protest, threaten indefinite strike from January 7||Hundreds of civic body employees, mostly those from North Delhi Municipal Corporation, on Thursday staged a day-long protest outside Civic Centre, which houses headquarters of north and south municipalities, to demand the release of their pending salaries. Employees in the north corporation have not been paid salaries for the last 3-4 months.The symbolic protest was carried out by the Confederation of MCD Employees Union — an umbrella body of the civic employees unions.Representatives of the union said that those who participated in the protest included teachers, engineers, horticulture department, clerical staff along with Class IV e mployees such as beldars and labourers.Ramniwas Solanki, general secretary of the Confederation of MCD Employees Union said that municipal workers had withdrawn their strike twice in the past after the mayor and commissioner of north corporation assured that their pending salaries, dues and pensions would be released by November-end. That did not happen.He said that salaries of teachers, engineers and other employees of the north corporation are pending for the months of August, September, October and November. “We have not yet been paid for last four months. Enough is enough We can’t keep working without salaries. We will go on an indefinite strike from January 7 and stage a protest at L-G office on the same day,” Solanki said.He said that the salaries of civic employees should not be delayed further.Jai Prakash, mayor north corporation, said that the civic body is going through a financial crisis and the salaries of sanitation workers have been cleared till the month of September, DBC(Domestic Breeding Checker) employees till October, doctors and nurses till September. “Protest is not the solution as the employees should also understand the civic body’s situation. Efforts are being made to clear maximum liabilities in phased manner,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civic-body-employees-stage-protest-threaten-indefinite-strike-from-january-7/story-q3bF1wkJKlif6pDYJIOBlN.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||Students join farmers in protest at Delhi’s borders||At Delhi’s borders where tens of thousands of people are protesting against the three farm laws, it isn’t just farmers or those with a farming background but hundreds of students from different universities have joined the protesters. The students said they have joined in to be part of the “revolutionary movement”.Most of these students are from Delhi University (DU), Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Punjab University, Jamia Millia Islamia, and Ambedkar University.Sukhwinder Singh, a student of MA in History at Punjab University and a member of Ambedkar Students’ Association, who has set-up a library at the Singhu border along with his friends, said, “We are here not because our family members are associated with farming but because we genuinely resist these new laws. Who will feed us if the farmers won’t be there? How will people from marginalised sections afford food if farming is completely corporatised? Now is the time to do something to stop that disaster.” Singh and his friends have been staying at the Singhu border protesting site in a tent for the last two weeks. Vivek, 17, a student of DU’s School of Open Learning (SoL) and a member of All India Students Association (AISA), has been attending the protest at Singhu border since November 29. His association has set up a medical help desk for protesting farmers. “I am from Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat district and from a farmers’ family. I know how these laws will affect our families. We will come on the roads,” he said.The farmers’ agitation against the three new farm laws at Delhi’s four key borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate, and Chilla – entered into its 29th day on Thursday. Similarly, students are attending the ongoing protest at the Tikri border as well. Among them is Kaushik Raj, a PhD scholar from JNU, who is participating in the agitation from the day one. “No revolution is complete without students participating in it. We are here because we understand that it’s a matter of grave concern. And if we don’t fight against it now we will never get another opportunity,” he said.Kaushik and his friends have set up a library at the border and have also started screening movies on revolution and farmers’ issues at Tikri border from Thursday under the banner of “trolly-talkies”. When asked how he manages his PhD work along with the protest he said, “Books are not the only medium of gaining knowledge. Here we are getting knowledge of real life issues.”Navkiran Natt, a member of AISA who has completed masters in film studies from Ambedkar University this year, said, “Many of us who belong to farmer families know that the new farm laws will take away the only source of income-- our lands.”Besides, students from different Universities have also set up libraries at Ghazipur and Singhu border under the banner of “Vikalp Manch”. Students can also be seen helping farmers at langars and while cleaning the protest sites.Meanwhile, on Thursday, protests remained peaceful at Delhi borders. At the Singhu border, farmers held a webinar to “burst myths” about their ongoing movement. The webinar was attended by 10,000 people and another 66,000 watched it on Facebook and 43,000 on Youtube by Thursday evening. As many as 1,640 questions were answered by farmers during the webinar, said Baljit Singh, head of the farmers IT-cell, Kisan Ekta Morcha.ENDS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-join-farmers-in-protest-at-delhi-s-borders/story-UCYW9CRn1uf16XgTaNCU3N.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||Seven nabbed, police blow lid off Rs 10 crore ‘Like’ and ‘Share’ scam||The business of paid “like” and “share” of videos on social media platforms was misused by a gang to create an elaborate system of paid membership, in which thousands of social media users across the country were duped after being promised easy money, the Delhi Police said on Thursday, after arresting seven and busting the racketIngit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police (south-west), said that while seven members of this gang have been arrested so far, two prime suspects —Devesh Lal and Sunny China, who started the scam — remain on the run and were supposedly based in Dubai at the moment.The DCP said that a trail of R10 crore in transactions made by this gang has been detected and 30 bank accounts frozen.The officer identified the alleged fake mobile application as LoveLike and their website as www.task4.in – both of which are now dysfunctional.Police said that the scam was designed in such a way that there were two memberships — one free, in which the members made little money and the second paid — which was much more lucrative but came at a price.“The free members were given three videos every day to like and share. Each video fetched them Rs 6. That way, in a month a free member could make R540. A free member didn’t have the option to create multiple accounts,” said an investigator..But people with paid memberships were promised limitless earnings. The “advanced” membership cost R10,000 and once purchased the members were offered 39 such videos daily and paid Rs 13 per like and share. This brought them Rs 15,210 a month. The highest membership category— titled “Super”— came at a price of Rs 50,000 and offered users 125 videos to like and share every day, paying them R25 per video. The users stood to make Rs 93,750 monthly under the Super membership.“What lured the paid members was the option to create multiple accounts. Many even involved their families. One complainant had invested R5 lakh by involving seven of her relatives. People did not complain, since they had to spend so little time on their phones to like and share these videos,” said the officer.What made the scheme appear even more lucrative was that members were promised up to 15% of the earnings of every new member that they brought in.THE CRIMEBut the videos being sent out to members weren’t being procured from any firm or organisation looking to grow, the officer said. “These were random videos picked up from social media sites. The aim was to lure people to invest money,” said the officer.To lure people, the gang first roped in unsuspecting but influential Youtubers to promote their scheme, the officer said. The existing members were also promised handsome incentives for each new member they roped in. “The gang actually paid to the first few members in the early days, to build trust. But when they had collected enough money, they stopped paying and fled,” the officer said.“The crime came to police’s notice on December 8, when one of the victims reached out to Delhi Police on Twitter, after which the south-west district police launched a probe,” said Amit Goyal, additional DCP. The alleged scam had left a big online footprint that the police used to carry out raids in Gurgaon and arrest seven alleged members of the gang.Since thousands of such victims are suspected to be there, Abhinendra Jain, assistant commissioner of police (operations), said that investigators are now reaching out to cyber cells across Delhi to collate all such cases against these alleged racketeers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/seven-nabbed-police-blow-lid-off-rs-10-crore-like-and-share-scam/story-8aiOnsez8HP0Ke7EJQO9tN.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||Eight of CISF’s trusted four-legged warriors retire||After nine eventful years of meritorious service, Blacky and Pesty — both 9-year-old female Labradors — along with six others, retired from the Central Industrial Security Force’s canine squad on Thursday. Blacky and Pesty were the only dogs from the force to be deployed on special duty at Kumbh Mela 2018, to secure the premises. For the past nine years, the duo have also been responsible for securing Delhi Metro premises and have been used to check more than 2,000 unattended bags.Apart from Blacky and Pesty, the other six canines who retired on Thursday were Rosy and Tweeky -- German Shepards, Lilly, Jency and Lucy — all Labradors and Mini — a Cocker Spaniel. All of them had helped the force in securing the Delhi Metro and Indira Gandhi International airport premises.On Thursday, the eight dogs bid adieu to the force during a farewell ceremony organized specially for them at their Shastri Park kennel in east Delhi. They were awarded with a medal each for their distinguished services and for their dedication. The dogs were then served with a cake made of dog food as they spent their last day with the force.Deputy inspector general, CISF, Jitender Rana said Thursday’s ceremony was held especially to honour the canines and thank them for their contribution in keeping the Delhi Metro safe. A farewell ceremony, Rana said, was the least the force could do for the four-legged guardians. “These dogs have served us for over nine years. Two of them even were deployed at Kumbh Mela and were relied upon to sanitise the premises. Each one of them have sniffed more than 2000 unattended bags, keeping the metro and its passengers safe,” Rana said.The DIG said the canines will be handed over to Friendicoes-SECA, an NGO, that will take care of their veterinarian needs in their old age. Dog lovers can further adopt these dogs from the NGO, he said.A senior officer from the CISF said the dogs retired due to their old age. “After a certain age, their capability to sniff and track reduces. However, we keep track of all our dogs even after they are handed over to the NGO. Our teams visit them occasionally to keep a check on their health and conditions under which they’re kept,” the officer said, requesting anonymity.Doctor Akhilesh Gupta, from Friendicoes-SECA, who was also present at the ceremony, said the NGO will take the dogs on Friday and all of them would go through a medical check-up. “Those found fit can be adopted by dog lovers. If we detect any health issues, then we will send the canine toour Gurugram facility under medical supervision,” Gupta said.DIG Rana said with their eight dogs retiring, they are left with 53 canine soldiers in their kennel. Procedure to fill in the vacant posts with new recruits was in progress, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/eight-of-cisf-s-trusted-four-legged-warriors-retire/story-UuIhWdULdabuElrlqzvdwO.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||Cyber crime cases went up during lockdown, shows Delhi police data||There was a significant spike in cyber crimes in Delhi during the Covid-19 induced lockdown with as many as 135 such offences being reported every day on an average in May, the Delhi Police said after analysing nearly 33,000 cases registered until November this year. For instance, in January this year, 1,480 cyber crimes -- or about 48 offences every day – were reported against 4,188 cases in May. In April, the cases stood at 3,372, in June at 3,239 and in July at 4,103. Anyesh Roy, deputy commissioner of police (cyber crime unit), said with concerted efforts to raise awareness against cyber frauds, including sharing case studies on radio programmes to reach a large audience and short videos shared on WhatsApp, cases of cyber crimes are slowly coming down. In November, for instance, 2,634 cases at a daily average of 88 offences were reported to the Delhi Police.Roy attributed the spike in cyber crimes during the lockdown to the increase in online shopping as markets stayed shut. “Many bogus sites with poor credibility cropped up to take advantage of people who had increased their use of digital platforms for shopping. Under normal circumstances, the public wouldn’t have generally used those sites for shopping,” said Roy, adding that it couldn’t be said if street criminals migrated to online frauds. “It is rather the existing online fraudsters who scaled up their operations and came up with new ideas of cyber crimes,” said Roy.The cyber crime unit has analysed these offences to conclude that 62% of them were online financial frauds, 24% were social media harassment that included morphing photos of people and sexual harassment, and the rest 14% were other crimes such as hacking, identity theft and data theft.Further analysis of cases, police said, also pointed to regions from where certain kinds of cyber criminals operated. The Mewat region, for instance, was found to be a hot spot of cyber frauds duping people by sending fake messages through fake social media profiles. From north and northwest Delhi and NCR towns such as Noida and Gurugram, fake call centres were being run which cheated people by offering tech support in the name of reputed software companies. Fake websites on government schemes were mostly tracked to people in north Rajasthan and south Bihar, the police’s analysis found.Besides government office and private firms, at least 165,000 individuals were targeted in 12 cases termed as ‘mega frauds’ by the police. Among cases that were counted as ‘mega frauds’, DCP Roy cited the case in which free solar panels and laptops were being offered using a fake website by misusing the Prime Minister’s name. While only three persons arrested for this alleged fraud, their website had garnered more than 1.5 million hits in two days and over one lakh persons were duped, said Roy. Overall, for the 12 mega frauds, the police registered 65 first information reports (FIRs) and arrested 125 suspects. Overall, 214 cyber offenders have been arrested this year.How rampant the cyber crimes are in the national capital can be gauged from the fact that in the 10 days until Thursday, five fake call centres have been busted here.The cyber crime unit was also kept busy through the year blocking “objectionable content” on social media platforms. The police requested platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and YouTube to block as many as 278 accounts this year. “The most such accounts blocked were 140 on Twitter,” said Roy.Apart from the centralised cyber crime unit, each district of Delhi Police too has its own cyber cells. These too were flooded with complaints. Of the 32,896 cyber crimes reported until November, 2,349 were in these districts. Vikram Singh, former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, attributed the spike in cyber crimes during and after the lockdown to unemployment, cash crunch, lots of spare time and easy availability of tools. “The tools required for cyber crimes are minimum. In half such crimes, those with basic knowledge of computers can operate if they have internet connection and a mobile phone. They had empty minds, abundant time and found it an easy work that paid well and the getaway was easy,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cyber-crime-cases-went-up-during-lockdown-shows-delhi-police-data/story-syScqUXmhZFBS13Bks51TJ.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||Two flyovers proposed to decongest Ring Road stretch gets UTTIPEC nod||In what may come as a major relief for motorists and residents of Punjabi Bagh and Moti Nagar in west Delhi, the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre on Thursday approved a proposal to decongest a roughly 3.5 km stretch of the Ring Road between Raja Garden flyover and Punjabi Bagh flyover. The Public Works Department (PWD) proposes to construct two flyovers parallel to the existing single flyovers at Club Road crossing and at Moti Nagar crossing for smoother flow of vehicles.According to UTTIPEC officials, the corridor which is to be improved, starts from Raja Garden flyover and goes up to Punjabi Bagh flyover and is a part of the Ring Road. “The proposal includes the provision of three lanes – dual carriage way grade separator (flyover) from Raja Garden crossing over the Club Road intersection along with doubling the existing flyover above the Punjabi Bagh crossing (Moti Nagar Crossing). This PWD proposal will decongest the Ring Road and improve its capacity. It will help to provide signal free movement from Dhaula Kuan to Azadpur on the Ring Road,” a UTTIPEC statement said.The proposal was approved in a governing body meeting of UTTIPEC, chaired by L-G Anil Baijal. The proposal has been cleared with the condition to incorporate provisions for adequate space for safe movement of pedestrians on this stretch.A senior PWD official said the project will now be sent to the Delhi cabinet for final approval. “We can start the project on ground only when all the approvals are granted. Clearance of the project from the UTTIPEC is a big success because now we would be able to start further planning on the project,” the official said.He added that under the project, the two one-way flyovers will be converted into three lanes each in both directions. The length of the existing flyover at the Club Road intersection near Raja Garden will also be increased. The length of the flyover at the Club Road intersection is around 600 metre and it will be extended up to ESI Hospital which will take its overall length to around 1.5-km. “It is important to improve this stretch of the Ring Road because it gets heavily clogged during morning and evening traffic hours. Many times it takes over half an hour to wade through the heavy traffic on this 3.5 km patch. This project will certainly benefit the residents and motorists passing through this area,” the PWD official said.Besides, the UTTIPEC also approved a detailed feasibility study for construction of a rail over bridge (ROB) and rail under bridge (RUB) on Khera Kalan-Khera Khurd rail crossing on Delhi-Ambala rail line.The ROB is proposed for efficient movement of through traffic whereas the RUB is proposed to segregate the through traffic from the local traffic of Khera Kalan and Khera Khurd, a UTTIPEC statement said.​At present, vehicles create a long queue at the railway crossing resulting in traffic congestion. The proposal will provide uninterrupted movement across the railway crossing.The UTTIPEC also asked National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) to conduct traffic study for providing road connectivity for proposed Rapid Rail Transit System (RRTS) complex at Jangpura.NCRTC has planned to accommodate the Operation Control Center, service buildings, and essential staff quarters along with other required installations of RRTS at Jangpura.“This land (where the complex is to come) is bounded by three railway tracks forming a triangle and has a very poor connectivity with adjacent roads. Connectivity has been proposed through the provision of trumpet towards Mathura Road; which will be four-lane divided with two-metre footpath on both sides, and a two-lane undivided flyover with two-metre wide footpath on both sides (along the railway line) towards the Ring Road,” the UTTIPEC statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-flyovers-proposed-to-decongest-ring-road-stretch-gets-uttipec-nod/story-AMS2VKMMVYMPUE8aaYShIP.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||PM Narendra Modi to flag off Metro’s first driverless train on Monday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the country’s first-ever fully automated driverless train service on the 37km long Magenta Line (Janakpuri West-Botanical Garden) on December 28, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said on Thursday — the day the corporation completed 18 years of operations. PM Modi will also launch a fully operational National Common Mobility Card for travel on Airport Express Line on the same day. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be flagging off the country’s first-ever fully automated driverless train service on the 37km Magenta Line on December 28,” DMRC said in a statement on Thursday. A senior DMRC official said that the technology will first be launched on the Magenta Line, but the Metro is also working to extend this to the Pink Line (Shiv Vihar-Majlis Park) in the next few months. Another DMRC official, on the condition of anonymity, said that driverless technology was introduced on the Magenta Line and the Pink Line in 2017, but until now, the Metro was conducting rigorous trials to ensure that trains could safely switch over to driverless operations. Officials explained that the driverless train technology has set standards for automation called grades of automation (GoA). In GoA 1, trains are run by one driver and, in GoA 2 and GoA 3, the role of the driver is reduced to operating doors and for taking over in case of emergencies -- the starting and halting of trains is automated. Finally, in the GoA 4, trains are set on a completely unattended train operations mode. “The progression to remove human intervention entirely is done in a phased manner. After isolated trials at first, we have of late been conducting trials during the non-peak hours. The idea is to gain complete public confidence in the system,” the DMRC official said. The DMRC had initially set a tentative deadline for operations, under GoA 3, for May this year. But the plans were delayed due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The DMRC also announced that the NCMC will first be launched on the 23km Airport Express Line, but the facility will be extended to other lines. “There are certain changes that we had to make in the automatic fare collection (AFC) gates to read the new cards. Along with these cards, all other fare collection options —such as the Metro smart card and the ‘More’ Delhi Common Mobility Card — will continue to be accepted in the Metro network,” said the official. The NCMC, or the One Nation One Card, will enable travellers to pay multiple kinds of transport charges, including Metro services and toll tax, across the country,while allowing withdrawing money from the same card. NCMC cards are issued from nearly 23 banks on debit, credit, pre-paid card product platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-flag-off-metro-s-first-driverless-train-on-monday/story-4Ao1Efejh9SZUkfnZipgOI.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||BJP workers vandalise DJB office, AAP calls it premeditated attack||Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairman and ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator Raghav Chadha alleged on Thursday that a group of protesters belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by the state unit chief Aadesh Gupta, barged into the civic agency’s headquarters in Jhandewalan and vandalised his office.Addressing a press conference, Chadha said the “goons” were shouting slogans against Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for supporting farmers who are protesting against three federal farm laws aimed at liberalising agriculture trade. The charge drew a sharp rebuttal by the opposition party, and triggered a blame game, but footage of the incident showed Gupta and a group of supporters storming into the office of DJB at Jhandewalan.“The goons of the BJP said that they are disgruntled because Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party have stood in solidarity with protesting farmers, because the AAP government did not allow stadiums to be converted into jails, and because the AAP leaders tore apart copies of the contentious farm laws in the assembly. They also admitted to leading similar attacks at residences of the chief minister and deputy CM Manish Sisodia (earlier this month),” Chadha, who is also spokesperson of the AAP, said. He also alleged inaction on the part of the Delhi Police, which report to the Union home ministry.Kejriwal, too, hit out at the BJP. “The AAP stands with the farmers and we are not scared of such cowardly attacks. The BJP should know that. I appeal to all AAP workers to not get provoked by such attacks and continue supporting the farmers,” he tweeted. While videos of the office premises showed broken furniture, glass doors and what seemed to be blood on the floor of the building, Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (central), denied that any DJB employees or AAP workers were injured in the incident. He, however, said that some police personnel were injured. “There was no blood at the scene,” said Bhatia. The police briefly detained 30 people, including Delhi’s BJP chief, for the incident. Gupta later said it was the AAP volunteers who “sabotaged” his “peaceful protest” against an alleged tanker scam.“During the demonstration outside the Delhi Jal Board headquarters, Aam Aadmi Party volunteers attacked BJP workers. One worker sustained an injury to the backbone and was admitted to a trauma centre, while four others also suffered serious injuries,” he said.The BJP was staging a “peaceful” demonstration outside the DJB headquarters against the “tanker scam” and problems faced by people due to water supply issues, he claimed. “Aam Aadmi Party volunteers forcibly barged into the headquarters, vandalised it and attacked the BJP workers. The Kejriwal government conspired to defame the BJP by sabotaging our protest,” he further said. CCTV footage shared by Chadha on his Twitter account showed some men scaling an iron gate and then helping a group on the outside to break through the gates. Some men in uniform inside the gates appeared to be first reasoning out with those who had scaled down, and then trying to stop them from breaking open the gates. Chadha, who was not there at the time of the incident, also alleged that the police were standing “quietly” behind the protesters and “facilitating the attack” while the private security guards tried to prevent the trespassing. “It was clearly a premediated attack... But we will not be scared of such cowardly attacks. Now we will continue supporting farmers and protesting against the contentious farm laws,” said Chadha.The incident took place between noon and 1pm, police said. “There were two levels of barricades and then the main gate of the headquarters. The protesters managed to break through the first two barricades and then barged through the gates even as we tried to stop them,” said a senior police officer who asked not to be named.A DJB employee said on condition of anonymity that he watched the men barge in. “About 30 men managed to enter. They were carrying banners against the CM and were shouting slogans. They stayed inside for several minutes. I was watching everything from the balcony of the first floor as they went on a rampage on the ground floor. They didn’t even care to cover their faces. We thought they would come up and attack us too, but they left before that,” said the employee. DCP Bhatia denied any lapses or inaction by the police. “The force there was prompt and active,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-workers-vandalise-djb-office-aap-calls-it-premeditated-attack/story-g4QQKiJdgpkBSUDqCD7ODI.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||Two from IGI airport fled to avoid government quarantine, say officials||Two passengers from the UK — who went missing from Delhi airport on Tuesday — were aware that they are infected with Covid-19 and deliberately escaped as they did not want to go to institutional quarantine facilities, officials present at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport have claimed. While one of the passengers was traced in Punjab, the other had managed to flee to Andhra Pradesh.The state government, Delhi police, or airport authorities have not pressed any charges against the two so far. The UK returnees, who arrived at the Delhi airport on Monday and Tuesday, were subjected to mandatory RT-PCR tests, as required by the government in order to stop the spread of a new strain of Sars-Cov-2 that spreads faster. India has also suspended all flights to and from the United Kingdom (UK) between December 23 and December 31.To ensure that passengers returning from the UK do not mix up with other passengers, a special corridor has been set up at the airport to expedite immigration and customs clearance and baggage collection gate. CISF personnel, donning PPE kits, escort all flyers from the UK through different levels of clearance and drop them at the waiting halls, where they are handed over to health officials. They are then taken to the testing facility at the multilevel car park facility near Terminal 3. Officials said they are unsure at which point, the two managed to escape. Airport officials, privy to the case, said the two had tested positive and were to be taken to institutional quarantine. The health department and the police are unclear whether the two patients escaped before boarding the ambulance at the airport or from the ambulance on way to the quarantine facility.Deputy commissioner of police (IGIA) Rajeev Ranjan said no such incident took place at the Delhi airport. “Till Thursday night we had received no complaint or report regarding the escapes,” he said.The two escapes came to light after one of the persons reached Ludhiana and tried to get himself admitted to one of the private hospitals in the city. Both the patients have now been brought back to Delhi,” said an official from the Delhi government, adding that they are currently in the special isolation ward at Delhi government-run Lok Nayak hospital.Sachin Badhshah, deputy inspector general, CISF, said on the arrival side, “Our role is limited to just facilitating the arriving passengers.” They were escorted and handed over to the authorities concerned, he said.An officer aware of the matter, said all the passengers from the UK flights were asked to wait for their test reports in a lounge. “Once someone tested positive, they were asked to isolate themselves, don a PPE, and go to the ambulances waiting outside for transporting them to an isolation facility. However, both the persons managed to slip out either before reaching the ambulance or from within the ambulance,” the official said.Three others were untraceable on Tuesday and were later traced by Delhi government officials, he added. One among them had tested positive at the IGI airport on Tuesday. “The person was taken to Safdarjung hospital. But there was some miscommunication and Safdarjung hospital released him prescribing home isolation. Then the Covid-19 passenger himself came to a government’s health care facility in east district and was traced by the city’s Covid surveillance system. He was later shifted to the dedicated ward in Lok Nayak hospital on Tuesday night,” said a senior official. So far, 11 people who travelled from the UK have tested positive for the infection, with at least 50 others, who had come in direct contact with infected patients, also being sent to quarantine. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said the government “will talk to” airport authorities in the city over the issue.“Flight operations and security there is under the airport authorities... But a person who has tested positive, should not have moved out,” Jain said .Asked, about the responsibility of the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the Delhi airport,Jain said, “We will talk to airport authorities about it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-from-igi-airport-fled-to-avoid-government-quarantine-say-officials/story-wc2mDQJ9TITMjnbRwuq5TM.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||Govt to reserve 60% ICU beds in pvt hospitals for Covid care||The Delhi High Court on Thursday said that it would be “inhumane” to have 80% ICU beds in almost three dozen private hospitals of the city reserved only for Covid-19 patients, especially at a time when the positivity rate and the cases in the city was going down. The court said that the order has to be removed, if beds are lying vacant.Justice Navin Chawla expressed the court’s displeasure at the delay by the Delhi government in presenting the statistics regarding the necessity of keeping these beds reserved amid concerns of non-Covid patients not getting critical care.“Until there is serious doubt, continuation of this order is inhumane. How many beds are occupied, vacant, required for keeping the Covid-19 patients? Show me that they cared to find out vacancy and requirement of ICU beds in the last one month,” the court said.“I’m going to examine the decision making process...Till the time it cannot be sustained to keep the ICU beds vacant,” the court said during the hearing. “My view is that there is no need for reservation. In case numbers increase, we will allow it again,” the judge added.The court was hearing a plea by the Association of Healthcare Providers — filed through advocate Sanyam Khetarpal — challenging the decision of the Delhi government of September 12 for reserving 80% beds in 33 private hospitals.On Thursday, the Delhi government informed court that an expert committee has recommended reducing reservation of 80% ICU beds to 60% thereby increasing the number of ICU beds for the non-Covid patients. The government counsel also assured the court that the Delhi government is going to pass an executive order for the reservation of beds on the recommendations of the committee by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).He said that a meeting would be held on December 26 in this regard, where the views of Dr VK Paul, Niti Aayog and Dr Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) will be taken into consideration while passing an order on reservation of ICU beds for Covid patients.During the hearing, senior advocate Maninder Singh, also representing the petitioners, told the court that the division bench of the Delhi HC had vacated the stay because the cases had doubled and even the positivity rate had gone high. He added that now, however, the cases have gone down, along with the positivity rate.After the hearing the government and the petitioners, the court asked ASG Jain to re-examine its decision and place it before the court on December 28 for consideration.The government informed the court that in the meeting of the expert committee of the DDMA conducted on December 23 for formulation of recommendations regarding de-escalation of Covid-19 dedicated beds, it was found that there is a significant decline in number of cases admitted in the hospital .The expert committee of the DDMA, in its recommendation, said that the total hospital Covid bed occupancy as on December 23 stood at 2,866 (of the total 18,779 Covid beds), and Covid ICU beds occupancy stands at 1319 (of the total 5,100 beds).The minutes of the meeting said that the committee unanimously agreed that due to the declining trend of occupancy among all categories of Beds (Oxygenated, ICU, Ventilator), the de-escalation may be carried out in a graded manner preferably in Delhi government hospitals and private sector hospitals.The committee decided not to recommend any change in the status of Covid beds for the Central Government Hospitals.The committee also said that the Covid ICU beds reservation of 80% of the total ICU beds be reduced to 60%, making 40% ICU beds available for the non-Covid patients. It said that the private sector hospitals also being important stake holders for provision of medical and tertiary care services, the Covid beds reservation of 60% of total beds in all private hospitals should be de escalated to 45%. It said that this will make 55% beds in private sector hospitals available for non-Covid patients and increase the beds from existing 6760 to 8696 (approx), an increase of more than 1930 beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-to-reserve-60-icu-beds-in-pvt-hospitals-for-covid-care/story-sWyXqJQdOP4PXQVwZneApN.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||Active Covid-19 cases decline across Delhi districts||As new Covid-19 cases are declining in the national capital for around three weeks now, seven out of eleven districts recorded less than 1,000 active cases as of December 22, shows the latest district-wise summary prepared by the revenue department. Northeast Delhi has 158 active cases -- the lowest among all districts. At 2,616, northwest Delhi district has the highest share of total active cases (12,189) as of December 22, showed the weekly report which is submitted to offices of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and lieutenant governor Anil Baijal.The other six districts with less than 1,000 active cases as on December 22 are central Delhi (592), New Delhi (731), Shahdara (359), south Delhi (891), southeast (887) and southwest (910), according to the report seen by HT. To put this in perspective, on November 15, when Delhi was peaking in its third – and worst – phase of spike in Covid-19 cases, only one out of 11 revenue districts had less than 1,000 active cases, showed government data.Delhi, as on November 15, had 43,774 active cases – of which lowest was recorded in the northeast Delhi district (918) and highest in southwest district (6,391), the data showed. Southwest district was followed by south Delhi with 5,815 active cases.Last week, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that Delhi seems to have overcome the third wave of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said, “We are leaving no stone unturned when it comes to efforts being done to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease. District teams have been entrusted with assessment of transmission risk and creating micro containment zones wherever necessary. Contact tracing was scaled up. The government also focused on home isolation management and patient care quality in hospitals. The efforts have shown results. However, people must continue following precautions.”Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the numbers are encouraging. “Active cases have declined despite the government increasing the number of tests, especially RT-PCR tests, which are considered to be more accurate. The government should keep up with its currently applicable strategies on testing, tracing and isolation. And people should not let their guards down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/active-covid-19-cases-decline-across-delhi-districts/story-yNmE487ErzRyMKNe20AlUM.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi reports 1,063 Covid-19 infections, positivity rate at 1.18%||After three days consecutive days of reporting fewer than a thousand infections, 1,063 people were tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Thursday, according to the daily health bulletin. The positivity rate – proportion of samples that tested positive among total tested – also rose slightly to 1.18% on Thursday. The positivity rate has consistently been declining in the city since mid-November when it touched the highest 15.33% during the third wave of the infection. It has remained below 5% for 22 days now and below 2% for 10 days, as per the data shared by the government. “The situation has improved a lot. The positivity rate dipped below 1% and the number of deaths has also gone down. We need to reduce it further. The recovery rate has also increased a lot,” said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal during a press briefing on Thursday. The number of deaths also went up slightly. The city saw 37 deaths on Wednesday as compared to an average 28.5 deaths recorded a day during the last seven days. The seven-day case fatality ratio – the proportion of deaths among those who tested positive – shot up to 2.73% from the 1.87% at the beginning of the month. The cumulative CFR – calculated on the basis of the total number of cases and deaths – has also been inching upwards since mid-November after declining consistently since recording 4.11% in June. So far, the highest number of deaths reported in a day was 131 recorded on November 18 during the third surge in the number of cases. “It is unlikely that Delhi will see a huge surge like this with a high proportion of people having been exposed to the infection already. It is likely that infections get reported from pockets,” Dr Shobha Broor former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences had said. Delhi tested 89,990 samples on Wednesday of which 47,889 were done using the gold standard RT-PCR method and the rest 42,031 with the less reliable rapid antigen technique.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-reports-1-063-covid-19-infections-positivity-rate-at-1-18/story-c8v4t5F2fmn7oiIJMKr1mI.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi can store 11.5 million vaccine doses in a week: Kejriwal||The Delhi government has storage facility for 7.4 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, which will be increased to 11.5 million within a week, announced Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday. The government estimates that around 5.1 million people in three priority groups will receive the vaccine in the first phase. With all three vaccines that have applied for emergency use authorisation in India needing two doses, Delhi would need 10.2 million doses to vaccinate its three priority groups. “We already have a capacity to store around 74 lakh doses. This will increase to 11.5 million in the next five to seven days. We need 10.2 million doses to vaccinate the people in the priority groups,” Kejriwal said in a press briefing. The Delhi government currently has a central vaccine storage facility in Civil Lines, which had stored 5 million doses of measles rubella vaccine during the planned one-time drive, along with other vaccines for routine immunisation. Apart from this, the Delhi government is setting up another central vaccine storage facility at its 650-bed Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality Hospital in Tahirpur, as reported first by HT. A separate 5,000 square feet two-storey building at the hospital is being retrofitted with electrical fittings and deep freezers. The facility will have approximately 90 deep freezers that can store the vaccine either between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius or up to -20 degrees Celsius. Two of the three vaccines — Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Oxford/ Astrazeneca’s Covishield marketed by Serum Institute of India — need a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for storage, which is what is available across the country for the routine immunisation programme. The vaccine by Pfizer needs minus 70 degrees Celsius temperature for storage. “The work is likely to be completed in another two to three days. However, we do not know at the moment how many doses the facility can hold. It will depend on which vaccine is given approval and what kind of packaging it will come in,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department. The Delhi airport, where vaccines from outside India are likely to land, has a capacity for 2.7 million doses in cold chambers in its cargo terminal. “The vaccines that come from abroad will be brought from the airport to the central storage facilities. For those manufactured in India, it will be brought to the facility from the companies. After this, it will be distributed to the depots in every district from where it will go to the fixed point,” said a second Delhi government official. The vaccines will be delivered through the 640 “fixed points”, such as government dispensaries, that dot the city. Administrations in each of the 11 districts have also been tasked to keep tie-up with transporters, pharmaceutical companies and logistics companies for safe transportation of the vials. The districts have also started identifying locations, where camps will be set up, most of which will be hospitals, mohalla clinics and some schools.A senior health official said that talks are on to set up a vaccination camp at the IGI airport as well.When it comes to preparation for vaccine distribution, airport authorities said all arrangements are in place. The authority has named the mission ‘Project Sanjivani’. The airport has a storage capacity of 2.7 million vials of Covid-19 vaccine at any given point of time. It also has two cargo terminals with cool chambers where temperature can be set anywhere between -20 degrees Celsius to 25 degrees Celsius. The Delhi airport has also made arrangements for dry ice supply so that the vaccine can be kept stable for a longer period. A separate entrance for trucks carrying vaccines has been made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-can-store-11-5-million-vaccine-doses-in-a-week-kejriwal/story-uVt33LdkwaaAPCrXB8HCtI.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt trains 3,800 people for Phase 1 of Covid vaccination drive||The Delhi government is training around 3,800 people — including 600 doctors from the private sector — for the Covid-19 vaccination drive. The vaccinators and the support staff will be taught about the different kinds of vaccines, how to administer them, how to ensure that the cold chain is maintained, what kind of adverse reactions might happen and what to do to combat these reactions, a senior official from the Delhi government said. The trainees will also be familiarised with the various modules of the Centre’s digital network CoWIN that will be used to register and track beneficiaries, schedule immunisation drives, and track all resources needed. “The state level officers and officials from World Health Organisation and the United Nations Development Programme were trained first by the centre. They are now helping in training the vaccinators. So far, we have received applications of 600 doctors from the private sector. The training of nearly 3,800 vaccinators and support staff will be completed in another two to three days,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College and advisor to the Indian Council of Medical Research. A senior government official said around 200 teams will be formed to administer the vaccines to 5.1 million identified people in the first phase. Each vaccination booth – situated at a government or private hospital, dispensary, polyclinics, or mohalla clinic – will be staffed by five persons, only one of who needs to be a doctor or nurse, who will actually administer the vaccine. “Each vaccination team will comprise of five people, who will have the capacity to vaccinate around 100 people a day. That is the initial target. We are expecting to complete the vaccination process in over two months,” said a senior government official. At the booth, one person will check whether the beneficiary has been registered, a second person will verify the documents, the third will administer the shot, and another will monitor the person for 30 minutes after that to ensure that there is no adverse reaction. “In case we are directed to expedite the process and complete the first phase in a month, then we will have to do it by increasing the number of teams to about 340. It will be a challenging task, because a large number of health workers are already involved in Covid-19 testing and staff from there cannot be diverted. But, a month’s target is not impossible if the resources are available on time,” said the official. A revenue official said even additional district magistrates are undergoing training for the vaccination process. “Like health workers are being taught the technicalities, revenue officials are also being taught the basics of vaccination. Apart from that, we are also being trained on the facts about the vaccine, so we can run IEC campaigns and ensure strict compliance to the vaccination strategy,” a senior revenue official said. “For example, we have to convey to people that even after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, they must continue taking all precautions like use of face cover or masks, hand sanitisation and maintaining social distance,”said the official. The official also said family members of health care provider and family workers will not be included in the first priority phase, unless deemed extremely necessary by the district administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-trains-3-800-people-for-phase-1-of-covid-vaccination-drive/story-AIy1uPG6AQzOkxc97HymUN.html
25-12-2020||Delhi||5.1 million Delhiites to get Covid-19 vaccine, process to identify first recipients began in October||Over one-fourth of Delhi’s population has been identified as belonging to the three “priority groups” that will first receive a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after one is approved by the central government.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday announced that the government has identified 5.1 million people who will be administered the vaccine in the first phase in Delhi. “Our health-care workers such as doctors, nurses, paramedic staff and so on will be the first ones to get the vaccine does in Delhi. We have identified 300,000 health-care workers who will be vaccinated,” Kejriwal said at a press briefing.  “Next will be the front-line workers which include police, civil defence volunteers and municipal workers. There are 600,000 such persons. Third category is of those who are 50 years of age or older and those below 50 years who have comorbid conditions. There are 4.2 million persons under the third category,” he said. The three priority groups were recommended by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC). Across the country, nearly 300 million people in the three categories will receive the vaccine first. The Delhi government started collecting data on 13 categories of health-care workers in October. At first, the government had asked over 1,200 hospitals and nursing homes in the city-state – both government and private -- registered with it to send in a list of their employees. “A comprehensive list of over 3,000 doctors, nurses, paramedics, pharmacists, administrative, sanitation and security staff working in the hospital has been sent to the government for the vaccine. All of them will be eligible to get the vaccine. If they want; they can refuse it too,” said a senior official from the administration of Lok Nayak Hospital who requested anonymity. The government also asked the Indian Medical Association to share a list of its registered members to identify those working in stand-alone clinics and health-care centres. After that, the government published an advertisement asking all clinics, including AYUSH and dental facilities, to register their staff on a government portal. For the list of front-line workers, apart from the categories mentioned by the Centre such as the police force and municipal workers, the Delhi government also identified departments such as electricity and water utilities whose employees were included in the second priority list. The organisations were asked to send information to the government on their staff. The Delhi government is currently uploading all this information on the centralised digital platform called CoWIN. It is an end-to-end digital network that will help in registering those eligible for a vaccine, tracking those who have been vaccinated, creating a schedule for vaccination, and monitoring the availability of resources on a real-time basis. As for those above the age of 50 and those below 50 with comorbidities, the government used the electoral rolls and data collected during door-to-door surveys for actively detecting cases of Covid-19 in November-December. “The aged and those with comorbidities are at the highest risk of developing severe Covid-19, so most of the government’s initiatives have been targeted towards them. The door-to-door survey that was conducted in November already ensured that we have a list of such vulnerable people and now our surveyors are working on updating it,” a senior official from New Delhi district said, requesting anonymity. Apart from that, the central government will also launch a mobile app connected to the CoWIN platform that will allow people to register for the shots on their own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/process-to-identify-first-recipients-of-covid-vaccine-in-delhi-began-in-october/story-WJhp3RV7nwl8W5H05oZ6ON.html

It has contended that there are shortcomings in the investigation being carried out by the crime branch as even after 10 months have lapsed since the incident, there has been “no progress”.The petition has also sought directions to Delhi Police to file an affidavit with relevant material regarding the functioning of the CCTV cameras at the Jyoti Nagar police station where Faizan was detained in February, especially between February 24 and February 25.The matter would be now heard on February 1, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mother-of-man-assaulted-by-cops-during-delhi-riots-moves-hc/story-4OFoEBytSnQXwduT63lFqK.html
25-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ambala MC polls: Farmers’ stir likely to have impact on results||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s recent visit here, when he was shown black flags and his cavalcade was blocked by farmers near Maharaja Agrasen Chowk, could be indicative of rising anger over the three farm legislations and the ongoing agitation, which are likely to become key issues in the municipal corporation (MC) elections scheduled for December 27. Instead of nine villages under MC limits previously, now 21 villages will vote for the mayor and their ward candidates.A tour of villages reveal that most people feel the farmer protests are justified and will have an impact on the elections. The CM’s visit to Ambala could have hurt the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) chances, feels a farmer from Ghel village (ward 11) Raghubir Singh, 60. “Everyone knows about the agitation at Delhi’s borders, but the protests when the CM arrived here have sent a message to every local of the anger of the farmers. All of us have seen videos of the protests. We are BJP supporters but my cousins visit the protest sites regularly at the border,” says Raghubir Singh.Octogenarian Gurvinder Singh from Sonda village (ward 18), who has been farming for more than six decades, says people like him will support the party that talks about the farmers, but not the BJP-Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) coalition. “Why is the government so determined to push the laws on us? If I have built a house and my family members don’t like it, I will demolish it. This should happen for the farm laws too,” he adds.Though sewage waste accumulating in the area where he lives is Balraj’s immediate concern, this labourer from Hira Nagar (ward 1) says his community is aware of the protests.The issue hits home because Ambala shares borders with Punjab, say political analysts.Dr Kushar Pal, head of department, political science, at Karnal’s Dyal Singh College, says the impact of the agitation is likely to be felt only in the rural belt.“The state president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union Gurnam Singh Charuni, who is fronting the agitation in Haryana, has a considerable presence in Ambala, Yamunanagar and Kurukshetra. So I think that there could be an impact, but it won’t be significant and will be limited to the villages as the major vote share of these elections remain in the urban belt,” says Pal, who is also state coordinator of Lokniti – Centre for the Study of Developing Areas. Madan Mohan, sarpanch of Ghel, which will be voting for the first time in the elections, said most of the locals are farmers with small landholdings who are aware of the stir.Meanwhile, even as the BJP-JJP combine faces flak for the farm laws, opposition parties such as the Congress, Haryana Democratic Front (HDF) and Haryana Jan Chetna Party (HJP), are trying to capitalise on the issue.Dr Sanjay Sharma, whose wife Dr Vandana Sharma is the mayoral candidate for the BJP-JJP coalition, said it could have an impact on the polls, hastening to add: “I don’t think all the farmers are angry and most think that the elections have nothing to do with the agitation.”Former ministers and MLAs Nirmal Singh from the HDF and Venod Sharma from the HJP have accepted that the farmers’ issue has emerged as an important election issue. While Sharma says that the impact will be clear after the results, Nirmal Singh claims, “We’ll definitely gain votes from the rural belt. I think the government will fall soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ambala-mc-polls-farmers-stir-likely-to-have-impact-on-results/story-PPusVZr7OUnTQd5bkOKNwK.html

25-12-2020||Pune||MVA government will be responsible for anomaly in Maratha quota: Raje||Pune: BJP Member of Parliament Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje on Thursday questioned the intentions of the state government regarding the Maratha quota issue. “I am unable to understand what is happening in the case of Maratha quota under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) category reservations. The state government is yet to take a firm stand on separate reservation quota. The Supreme Court will hear the case on January 25 and the state cabinet on Wednesday approved the proposal of extending the EWS quota to the community. I am suspecting something suspicious about the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s decision. The government will be solely responsible for any lack of benefit for the Maratha community,” said Raje. Addressing the media at Patrakar Bhavan on Thursday morning, Raje said, “I want the state government to share their intention about their preparations before the Supreme Court on the January 25 hearing. If they wanted to take the decision to give Maratha community benefit in EWS category then they would had taken it much earlier. I request the Maratha community to study the EWS reservation of 10 per cent and how many will fit into it, as the open category includes several other communities also. I don’t oppose EWS personally, but if we take reservation from this quota then there will be problems to SEBC category.” Earlier this year, the Supreme Court gave its stay to implement the quota for the Maratha community under the SEBC category. It was later challenged by the Maharashtra government. A constitutional bench of the apex court will hear the case on January 25 next year. Pravin Gaikwad, president of Sambhaji Brigade organisation of the Maratha community, said, “Our original demand was getting an economical base reservation and that we are getting by this new order of the state government. While in the OBC category earlier there were 180 castes which have now increased to 404 castes, it has increased from 52 per cent to 60 per cent in castes. In this, they are getting 25 per cent reservation which is less than their actual percentage of total castes. Now, if Maratha community will be added to it, then it will be a lot of burden on that reservation category. So, now we are getting reservation through EWS. It is beneficial for students and in job opportunities in government jobs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/mva-government-will-be-responsible-for-anomaly-in-maratha-quota/story-qb7eGmLlWkTVZuz0KfjQWJ.html
25-12-2020||Pune||Clubs, lounges stare at losses under the curfew shadow in Pune||Pune: Following the imposition of 11pm-6am night curfew in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, those looking forward to hold celebrations at clubs and lounges have changed their plans for New Year eve. According to owners, clubs and lounges that had just started picking up business were hard at work preparing for the New Year’s bash. The recent order of night curfew has hit their plans, causing financial loss. The night curfew has been imposed since December 22 to January 5 as a precautionary measure to prevent coronavirus infection. “The curfew is going to affect our businesses badly. Since there was nothing possible during the lockdown, everybody suffered losses. Many establishments had planned to cover the loss during Christmas and New Year. We respect the order, but it is going to affect us,” said Rajshekar Birajdar, admin head of Zeleb Night Life located on Mundhwa road, Koregaon Park Annexe. “We had just started to get our crowd back. The night curfew period will affect our business by 30 per cent. Apart from loss of revenue, we dug ourselves a deeper hole as we have to spend on preparations for the upcoming nights. We had already booked DJs, lights, sound systems, and decorations,” said Ashish Goyal, owner of Mafia Sky Lounge at Vimannagar and the 360-degree revolving restaurant at Deccan. Along with the establishments, their patrons aren’t the happiest either. With 11 pm being the deadline, many had to rethink their New Year’ eve night. “Because of the curfew, most of the clubs have cancelled their parties, and if they haven’t, they have rescheduled them to end by 11 pm. Now, mostly we’ll party at home, maybe order some takeout. We don’t see any logic in the curfew. People who want to roam outside will do so, let it be before 11 pm or after,” said 20-year-old Banner-based lifestyle blogger Gayatri Muley. “Covid-19 pandemic is not over yet. We understand that the curfew is for our benefit. It is sad that we can’t go through with our plans. We thought that after the lockdown we will finally end 2020 on a good fun note, but on the other end, we do have to follow the rules for our safety. We will have to plan something else for the New Year’s eve,” said Abhishek Thakur, a 22-year-old student living in Kothrud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/clubs-lounges-stare-at-losses-under-the-night-curfew-shadow-in-pune/story-ocYYGBnuyio866IVpsGLPK.html

25-12-2020||Pune||The inside story of the Mephedrone case in Pune||If the year 2019 saw the highest, a total of 119 cases pertaining to narcotics substances and arrested 157 persons in the city, the Covid induced lockdown did not prevent trafficking of contraband items as the Pune police continued with their action with 57 arrests this year between June and January. What made the headlines for the most part of the year, however, was busting of a racket by neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad Police. The seizure of 20kg mephedrone (MD) in Chakan by Pimpri-Chinchwad police in October led to the exposure of a nexus of producers, distributors and transporters who were involved in the production and sale of MD weighing at least 150kg. With 21 arrests and seizure of over Rs 1 crore in cash, the roles of the people are becoming clearer. A case under Sections 8(c) with 21(c), 22(c), and 29 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 was registered at the Chakan police station of Pimpri-Chinchwad police. The operation is found by the police to be a brainchild of Tushar Suryakant Kale (42), a resident of Borivali (west) in Mumbai and a native of Karveer in Kolhapur. However, before the operation took the shape that was found by the police, it went through various trials which went undetected by the authorities. Kale joined the Chota Rajan gang. He was in jail in a murder case. After his release, he started multiple legal businesses, but soon was indebted. Kale met a contact he had made in jail - Chandrakant Shedge - who lent him money and planted the first seeds of MD business. Shedge put him in touch with the Nigerian national who is known in this case as Zuby, according to the police. The Nigerian national promised funding and a direction towards gaining logistical support. “The Nigerian gave him the contact of a man named Bhanudas More, lodged in Thane jail in a drug case. When More was brought for court dates, Kale pretended to be a family member and met him. That is when More gave him potential names for support like raw material, transport, equipment. With the knowledge and contacts, Kale first tried his hand in Mahad and then the likes of Palande, Arvindkumar, and Jogal came in,” said senior police inspector Balkrushna Kadam of Hinjewadi police station who is investigating the case. The drug production got a boost with the presence of Arvindkumar Lohare also referred to as “doctor” entered the picture. He helped Kale and Khanivadekar and few others learn the process of making MD and allegedly charged Rs 35 lakh for a short course. RENT PER KG Once the technique was learned, Kiran Rajguru put Kale in touch with the owner of a factory in Ranjangaon and came up with a rent system of rent per kg of the product instead of rent per month, according to advocate Shishir Hiray, special public prosecutor (SPP) in the case. The factory was identified as Sanyog Biotech and the owner was identified as Ashok Sapkale. Sapkale is one of the four people who have applied for bail in the case on grounds of being unaware of the contents of the production. However, on Tuesday, SPP Hiray opposed the bail application in a court in Khed and said that the owner of the factory was well aware of what was happening and earned a handsome profit from it. UNION OF RAKESH ALIAS ROCKY AND TUSHARE KALE Rakesh Khanivadekar alias Rocky and Tushar Kale’s association is suspected to have begun in 2017. Khanivadekar and his brother, who is not named in this case, are involved in various kinds of illegal drug trade, according to the police. Rocky had been earlier arrested by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in a case registered in Palghar after a raid in a Palghar-based factory led to seizure of 483kg of narcotic substance called ephedrine. Anil Patil, who is the latest arrest in the case, had helped Kale secure bail in a case registered against him in Igatpuri, Nashik in which Lohare was also booked. THE MONEY TRAIL The police have seized cash worth upwards of Rs 1 crore in cash alone. After Kale’s arrest, Rs 60 lakh in cash from Khanivadekar’s possession and Rs 25 lakh from Kale’s possession were seized by the police from their various whereabouts. On Monday, Rs 25 lakh in cash were seized from Lalit Patil from his house in Nashik. The cash recovered by the police is suspected to be the remnant of the Rs 65 lakh cash that was provided by chemist Lohare, Afzal Hussain Abbas Sunsara, and Manoj Palande, according to the police. The money was meant to rally lawyers and settlement for these arrested men. The police have sealed multiple locations including Sanyog Biotech in Ranjangaon MIDC, Alkemi industry and Nimbus Pharma in Mahad MIDC owned by three of the accused. The police have seized real estate ownership related papers from some of the accused and plan to seal them too. “Kale had defaulted on his payment for the drugs. He was supposed to have paid Rs 2.4 crore but had made payments of only Rs 65-67lakh. The money was paid to Kiran Kale (Rs 30lakh), Chetan Fakkad Dandavate (Rs 14 lakh), Sankpale (Rs 7lakh), and one other person (Rs 14 lakh),” said senior police inspector Sawant. How did the racket land on police radar? The case first landed on police radar after a truck carrying 20kg MD was seized in Chakan on October 7. The 20kg substance was meant for sale to people from Delhi and was found in a Volkswagen car registered in Pune. These were drugs that were remaining from the batch of 132kg MD that produced just before lockdown was announced. The people who owed the money held onto the drugs as Kale cut contact with them and decided to sell it to a buyer from Delhi. During that sale, the police nabbed the car. “We have to ensure that Maharashtra does not turn into Udta Maharashtra like Udta Punjab. To make that happen, we have to act tough. Section 37 of NDPS demands that no such activity should be tolerated and it makes bail difficult too. The case is definitely complicated but there is enough evidence to get conviction. Moreover, the investigation is still underway and more evidence will be collected,” said Advocate Shishir Hiray, special public prosecutor in the case.

25-12-2020||Chandigarh||Two days after farm protesters block Haryana CM’s convoy, Ambala SP transferred||Two days after Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s convoy was blocked and attacked by farmers protesting the Centre’s farm laws in Ambala, the superintendent of police (SP), Rajesh Kalia, was transferred to Panchkula. A communication by state additional chief secretary (ACS), home, Rajeev Arora said that Kalia has been posted as SP, security, crime investigation department (CID), replacing Hamid Akhtar. Akhtar will hold the charge of additional inspector general (AIG), welfare, along with that of the Ambala SP. The CM’s convoy was blocked and attacked by protesting farmers near Agrasen Chowk in Ambala on Tuesday. Protesters under the banner of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) showed him black flags in protest against the three farm laws. The situation was tense and SP Kalia was seen pushing protesters away himself to clear the convoy’s route, but in vain. The protesters threw flag sticks at the vehicles in the convoy. Khattar was in Ambala to campaign for the BJP-JJP mayoral candidate Dr Vandana Sharma for the December 27 municipal corporation elections. A case of murder bid and rioting was registered against 13 farmers on Tuesday night. Farm union leaders have dissociated themselves from those involved in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-days-after-farm-protesters-block-haryana-cm-s-convoy-ambala-sp-transferred/story-tUJEJ1um6b4knrZEx4BOdM.html
25-12-2020||World||Queen Elizabeth hails Diwali in Christmas message, doesn’t mention pandemic||Noting that people of all faiths could not celebrate festivals the usual way this year, Queen Elizabeth’s Christmas message on Friday hailed Diwali, the festival of lights, which she said provided moments of hope and unity in a year that has kept people apart.The widely-watched royal message recorded in mid-December in Windsor did not mention “pandemic” or “Covid-19”, but she said the year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought them closer.She said, “Every year, we herald the coming of Christmas by turning on the lights. And light does more than create a festive mood - light brings hope. For Christians, Jesus is ‘the light of the world’, but we can’t celebrate his birth today in quite the usual way.“People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi. But we need life to go on. Last month, fireworks lit up the sky around Windsor, as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, providing joyous moments of hope and unity - despite social distancing.”The queen, 94, Prince Philip, 99, and other members of the British royal usually spend Christmas in the country retreat of Sandringham, Norfolk, but the royal couple has been living in Windsor and will not visit other family members due to Covid-19 restrictions.Across the Commonwealth, she said stories of people volunteering in communities had inspired her and her family. Paying tributes to nurses, the youth and others who rose to the challenges of the year, she said, “There is hope in the new dawn.”She said, “Of course, for many, this time of the year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family-members distanced for safety, when all they’d really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.“If you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers,” she added, wishing people “a very happy Christmas”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-hails-diwali-in-christmas-message/story-Xz6g6eLdi1LtzFiTWAab8K.html
25-12-2020||World||Japan confirms cases of new coronavirus variant||Japan’s health ministry has confirmed the country’s first cases of infection with the new variant of the coronavirus that was identified in Britain.The five people arrived between December 18 and December 21, before Japan stepped up border control on Friday for entrants from Britain. A man in his 60s developed fatigue, but the other four were without symptoms.Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said the five were sent to quarantine straight from the airports.After they tested positive for the virus, further analysis conducted at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases determined they had the British variant that is 70 per cent more transmissible, the ministry said in a statement.Shigeru Omi, head of a government taskforce, called for tighter border control to prevent new variants.

25-12-2020||World||UK deploys soldiers to clear backlog of truck drivers as France closes border||Around 1,000 British soldiers were spending Christmas Day trying to clear a huge backlog of truck drivers stuck in southeast England after France briefly closed its border to the U.K., then demanded coronavirus tests from all amid fears of a new, apparently more contagious, virus variant.Even though an estimated 4,000 or so international truck drivers are spending yet another day cooped up in their cabs, some progress was evident Friday, with traffic around the English Channel port of Dover moving in an orderly fashion towards the extra ferries that were put on to make the short crossing across to Calais in northern France. Rail operator Eurotunnel was also back in action, offering a way back into France.The military personnel were directing traffic and helping a mass testing program for the drivers, who must test negative to enter France. French firefighters have also been drafted to help the military test drivers for coronavirus. Poland’s Territorial Defense Force also sent reinforcements to help with testing and food distribution.British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he had instructed the army to take control of testing as part of efforts to get “foreign hauliers home with their families as quickly as we can.”Officials from the transport department have said that all but three of the tests conducted so far have been negative. Those testing positive are being offered accommodation. Most of the testing is being conducted at a disused airfield at Manston Airport, 20 miles (33 kilometers) from Dover.France closed its border for 48 hours to the U.K. last Sunday after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a variant of the virus that is 70% more transmissible is driving the rapid spread of infections in London and surrounding areas. As a result, the capital and many other parts of England have seen lockdown restrictions tightened and family holiday gatherings canceled.Free food and drink was being sent to the stranded truck drivers and more than 250 portable toilets were put in at Manston, with 32 others placed along the gridlocked M20 highway. Britain’s coast guard said its teams in the Dover area had so far delivered 3,000 hot meals, 600 pizzas and 2,985 packed lunches.“The most reassuring thing is that food is getting through at Manston, and I have to say a big thank you to everyone who volunteered to help drivers stick it out in cold conditions in the days leading up to Christmas,” said Duncan Buchanan of Britain’s Road Haulage Association.The mood among the stranded drivers appeared to be mostly sanguine, especially compared to their anger earlier this week at the situation and the lack of facilities.The virus has been blamed for over 1.7 million confirmed deaths worldwide, including nearly 70,000 in Britain, the second-highest death toll in Europe behind Italy.On Saturday, Britain is extending tighter lockdown restrictions to more areas as authorities try to stem the spread of the new variant. Over the past two days, the U.K. has recorded its two highest daily infection numbers, at just below 40,000. That is stoking fears that the country’s beloved National Health Service will face acute capacity issues in its hospitals soon and thousands more people will die from the virus.In a video message to the nation, Johnson said this Christmas was “not about presents, or turkey, or brandy butter” but about hope, in the form of coronavirus vaccine shots being delivered and more vaccines being developed.“We know there will be people alive next Christmas, people we love, alive next Christmas precisely because we made the sacrifice and didn’t celebrate as normal this Christmas,” the prime minister said.Johnson said Thursday that more than 800,000 people in Britain have received the first dose of the vaccine developed by American pharmaceutical firm Pfizer and German biotechnology company BioNTech. The U.K. was the first country in the world to approve the vaccine and began inoculations for health workers and those over 80 on Dec. 8.___Follow AP coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccines and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-deploys-soldiers-to-clear-backlog-of-truck-drivers-as-france-closes-border/story-EstY1dNEb7DbbqsGSIDepK.html
25-12-2020||World||Explosion in Nashville believed to be ‘intentional’, say police||An explosion shook the largely deserted streets of downtown Nashville early Christmas morning, shattering windows, damaging buildings and wounding three people. Authorities said they believed the blast was intentional. The FBI is leading the investigation.Police spokesman Don Aaron said the 6:30 a.m. explosion was believed to be “an intentional act.” Police earlier said they believe a vehicle was involved in the explosion. Aaron said three people were taken to area hospitals for treatment, although none were in critical condition.The FBI will be taking the lead in the investigation, said spokesman Joel Siskovic. Federal investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also on the scene. The FBI is the primary law enforcement agency responsible for investigating federal crimes, such as explosives violations and acts of terrorism. Investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also on the scene.Black smoke and flames were seen early Friday billowing from the area, which is packed with bars, restaurants and other retail establishments and is known as the heart of downtown Nashville’s tourist scene.Buildings shook in the immediate area and beyond after a loud boom was heard.Buck McCoy, who lives near the area, posted videos on Facebook that show water pouring down the ceiling of his home. Alarms blare in the background and cries of people in great distress ring in the background. A fire is visible in the street outside. McCoy said the windows of his home were entirely blown out.“All my windows, every single one of them got blown into the next room. If I had been standing there it would have been horrible,” he said.“It felt like a bomb. It was that big,” he told The Associated Press.“There were about four cars on fire. I don’t know if it was so hot they just caught on fire, and the trees were all blown apart,” he said.Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said on Twitter that the state would provide the resources necessary “to determine what happened and who was responsible. Please join @MariaLeeTN and me in praying for those who were injured and we thank all of our first responders who acted so quickly this morning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosion-in-nashville-believed-to-be-intentional-says-police/story-EQDuBWbiTaCzXEhUBclc9O.html
25-12-2020||World||Men charged in Daniel Pearl’s murder case to be released on Saturday, says lawyer||British-born al-Qaeda leader Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and his three aides, whose release in the abduction and murder case of US journalist Daniel Pearl was ordered by a court here, would walk out of the prison on Saturday, police and lawyer said on Friday.In a surprise move, a two-judge bench of the Sindh High Court on Thursday directed security agencies not to keep Sheikh and other accused under “any sort of detention” and declared all notifications of the Sindh government related to their detention “null and void”.The court observed that the four men’s detention was “illegal”. According to the Jail Superintendent, the four men could not be released from Karachi’s Central Jail on Thursday as the prison authorities received orders from the Sindh High Court for their release very late.The legal counsel for the four men said that they would now be released on Saturday as Friday is a public holiday in the country.Meanwhile, the United States on Friday expressed “deep concern” over Sindh High Court’s order to release Sheikh and his aides and said it will continue to monitor any developments in the case.“We are deeply concerned by the reports of the December 24 ruling of Sindh High Court to release multiple terrorists responsible for the murder of Daniel Pearl. We have been assured that the accused have not been released at this time,” the US State Department said in a tweet.It said that the US will continue to monitor any developments in the case and will continue to support the Pearl family “through this extremely difficult process” while honouring the legacy of Pearl as a “courageous journalist”.The US has been mounting pressure on Pakistan, demanding justice for Pearl.Ruth and Judea Pearl - the parents of Pearl - condemned the decision made by the Sindh High court and expressed full confidence in the Supreme Court of Pakistan to provide justice for their son and reinforce the paramount of the freedom of the press, the Express Tribune reported.“We refuse to believe that the Pakistani government and the Pakistani people will let such a travesty of justice tarnish the image and legacy of Pakistan,” they said in a statement.In April, a two-judge Sindh High Court bench commuted the death sentence of 46-year-old Sheikh to seven years imprisonment. The court also acquitted his three aides who were serving life terms in the case – almost two decades after they were found guilty and jailed.However, the Sindh government refused to release them and kept them in detention under the Maintenance of Public Order. Their continuous detention was challenged in the Sindh High Court, which ordered their release. However, it asked authorities to place their names on the no-fly list so that they could not leave the country. It also directed them to appear before the court whenever summoned. Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was abducted and beheaded while he was in Pakistan investigating a story in 2002 on the links between the country’s powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda.A three-judge apex court bench headed by Justice Mushir Alam is hearing the appeal by the Sindh government and the family of the slain journalist against the acquittal of Sheikh. Pearl’s murder took place three years after Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.He was serving a prison term in India for kidnappings of Western tourists in the country.

25-12-2020||World||European Union assesses Brexit trade deal with UK||Ambassadors from the European Union’s 27 nations convened on Christmas Day to start assessing the free trade deal the bloc has struck with former member Britain, a historic accord that takes effect in just a week.At Friday’s exceptional meeting, the EU delegations asked for more time to study the texts before sending them to lawmakers at the European Parliament, according to an EU diplomat. The ambassadors are expected to meet again on Monday.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed Thursday’s agreement as a “new beginning” for the U.K. in its relationship with its European neighbors.In a Christmas message, Johnson sought to sell the deal to a weary public after years of Brexit-related wrangling since the U.K. voted narrowly to leave the EU in 2016. Although the U.K. formally left the bloc on Jan. 31, it remains in a transition period tied to EU rules until the end of this year.Without a trade deal to set out the terms of their new relationship, tariffs and other impediments would have been imposed on trade between the two sides starting Jan. 1. Both sides would have suffered economically from a failure to secure a trade deal, with the British economy taking a bigger hit at least in the near-term, as it is more reliant on trade with the EU than vice versa.“I have a small present for anyone who may be looking for something to read in that sleepy post-Christmas lunch moment, and here it is, tidings, glad tidings of great joy, because this is a deal,” Johnson said in his video message, brandishing a sheaf of papers.“A deal to give certainty to business, travelers and all investors in our country from Jan. 1. A deal with our friends and partners in the EU,” he said.Both sides claim the 2,000-page agreement protects their cherished goals. Britain said it gives the U.K. control over its money, borders, laws and fishing grounds. The EU says it protects the EU’s single market and contains safeguards to ensure that Britain does not unfairly undercut the bloc’s standards.Under the deal, there will be no tariffs or quotas on trade between the two sides, though there will be more red tape for businesses because the U.K. is leaving the EU’s frictionless single market and customs union. Firms will have to file forms and customs declarations for the first time in years. There will also be different rules on product labeling as well as checks on agricultural products.“The principle is not business as usual. There will be a lot of changes starting next week,” Barnier said on France-2 television Thursday night.EU leaders voiced their sadness at the rupture with Britain but were relieved that the tortuous aftermath of the Brexit vote had come to a conclusion. They are unanimously expected to back the agreement as are lawmakers from the European Parliament who can only give their consent next month retrospectively as they have already broken up for Christmas.Yet some British fishermen were disappointed.“In the end, it was clear that Boris Johnson wanted an overall trade deal and was willing to sacrifice fishing,” said Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organizations.Under the terms of the deal, the EU will give up a quarter of the quota it catches in U.K. waters, far less than the 80% Britain initially demanded. The system will be phased in over 5 1/2 years, after which the quotas will be reassessed.The French government, which had fought hard for fishing access, announced aid for its fishing industry to help deal with the smaller quota, but insisted that the deal protects French interests.The president of the French ports of Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer, Jean-Marc Puissesseau, said no matter what is in the Brexit trade deal, life for his port will become more difficult because “there will no longer be free movement of merchandise.”Some 10,000 jobs in the Boulogne area are tied to fishing and its seafood-processing industry, he said, and about 70% of the seafood they use comes from British waters.“Without fish, there is no business,” he told The Associated Press.___Angela Charlton in Paris contributed.___Follow all AP stories on the Brexit trade talks at https://apnews.com/Brexit||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-assesses-brexit-trade-deal-with-uk/story-weBPBgsnvzNI9KQyNbyy9I.html
25-12-2020||World||Japan’s PM Suga urges citizens to have a quiet and distanced New Year||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga urged the nation on Friday to spend a quiet New Year period without the usual social gatherings to prevent the spread of Covid-19, which has been breaking infection records almost on a daily basis.Suga also announced a package of $2.6 billion for hospitals treating Covid-19 patients which have come under strain due to the rapid rise in cases across the northern island of Hokkaido as well as large cities like Tokyo and Osaka.“I want you to spend a quiet New Year,” the premier told a news conference in Tokyo with the government’s leading coronavirus expert Shigeru Omi. “The infections aren’t coming down and if we keep going like this, we won’t be able to avoid further spread of the virus.”The country confirmed its first cases of the new, faster- spreading variant of the virus, in two citizens who had arrived from the United Kingdom, domestic media reported late on Friday.Japan has banned entry from United Kingdom, with the exception of returning Japanese nationals and those with residence permits. Japan does not celebrate Christmas, but the New Year period is an extended national holiday, with many people usually travelling back to their hometowns and spending time with family and friends.Omi warned that it was critical that “all citizens move in the same direction,” to get a grip on the health crisis.“If we don’t bring infections down now, once they surge again after the New Year period it won’t be easy to change the downward trend,” he said. “It would take time, and would probably be impossible to control over a period of weeks,” he said.Omi said shared meals were a major cause of infections and called on people to refrain from holding large gatherings and to limit meals to four people one regularly ate with, or fewer.While Japan has avoided the huge infection numbers seen in other parts of the world, the number of new daily cases surpassed 3,000 for the first time this month. Tokyo reported 884 infections on Friday, near Thursday’s record 888.HOSPITALS, VACCINESUnderscoring the strain on the hospitals, five national groups of doctors and other medical workers made an emergency request to Suga on Friday, asking for strong anti-pandemic measures and support for the medical sector.With hospitals equipped for treating Covid-19 filling up, other hospitals are being forced to accept patients with the disease, according to Tsuyoshi Masuda, president of the Japan Federation of Democratic Medical Institutions.“These small and medium-sized hospitals, which have been supporting medical services in their respective regions, are facing a crisis that is threatening their survival,” Masuda told reporters at a separate news conference on Friday.He also warned that the risk of in-hospital infections was high at institutions not specialized in dealing with infectious diseases.Japan, with a population of 126 million, has struck deals to buy 290 million vaccine doses from Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc, or enough for 145 million people.A health ministry panel said that people aged 65 or older should get priority for vaccination against Covid-19, as well as frontline healthcare workers and people with underlying medical conditions.It specified chronic heart disease, chronic respiratory disease and chronic kidney disease, among others, as underlying conditions that should determine priority.The panel’s recommendations would mean 36 million elderly people and 8.2 million people with medical conditions would be the first to receive shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-pm-suga-urges-citizens-to-have-a-quiet-and-distanced-new-year/story-Kf1ETdDY0jg8gv9qpVdA5K.html
25-12-2020||World||South Africa rejects UK claims over new coronavirus variant||South Africa’s government rejected allegations that a new variant of the coronavirus found in the country has contributed to a second wave of infections in the UK and criticized its decision to impose travel restrictions.A new virus variant that was detected in the UK has a mutation occurring at a site common with the South African strain, known as 501.V2, but they are “two completely independent lineages,” Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said in a statement late Thursday. There’s no evidence that 501.V2 causes more severe disease or increased mortality than any other variant that’s been sequenced around the world, he said.Mkhize’s comments came a day after UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that flights from South Africa will be banned and that anyone who’s been there in the past two weeks must quarantine immediately. Several other countries have also halted flights from South Africa.The new UK strain was identified about a month before the South African variant appeared to have developed, Mkhize said, citing ongoing research by the Network for Genomic Surveillance in South Africa, which was launched in June. He described Hancock’s announcement as “unfortunate.”“It is the widely shared view of the scientific community that, given the current circumstantial evidence, the risks of travel bans may outweigh the benefits, and that it is possible to contain the variants while sustaining international travel,” Mkhize said. “We, therefore, maintain that non-pharmaceutical interventions and strict containment measures remain most important to reduce the risk of transmission.”Coronavirus infections in South Africa have surged since the government eased most restrictions several months ago, and a second wave is now coinciding with the summer holidays. The Health Ministry registered a record 14,305 new cases on Thursday, bringing the cumulative total to 968,563.Experts in South Africa lead the field of genomics surveillance alongside those from institutions in Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK, and have shared all information on the evolution of the coronavirus with the World Health Organization, Mkhize said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-rejects-uk-claims-over-new-coronavirus-variant/story-EKYgU0IcJlJsAsr9S1rgCK.html
25-12-2020||World||Indian sailors stranded due to Covid measures, not standoff, says China||China on Friday said there was no link between the situation of the Indian sailors on two cargo ships carrying Australian coal stranded at Chinese ports and the current state of ties between the countries.The Chinese foreign ministry said the two vessels were stuck at the ports because of quarantine measures in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic.As many as 39 Indian seafarers on two cargo vessels - MV Jag Anand and MV Anastasia -- have been stranded in waters off the Chinese ports of Jingtang and Caofeidian in the northern province of Hebei for several months.The ships have not been allowed to discharge their cargo, and the crew have not been allowed to disembark either, impacting their mental and physical health, according to reports.India’s external affairs ministry had questioned the Chinese authorities’ decision to not allow the ships to leave the ports.“We understand that some other ships, which arrived after the Indian ships arrived, have actually managed to discharge cargo and leave. The reasons for this are not clear,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at a news briefing.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, on Friday responded to a question on whether the ships and its crew were stuck because of currently sour ties involving China and India and Australia over military and trade disputes.“We stated repeatedly that China has clear stipulations on quarantine measures. Concerning this, China has stayed in close communication with the Indian side and [has been] responding to their requests as well as providing necessary assistance to them,” Wang said at a ministry briefing on Friday.“As far as I understand, China allows the crew change while meeting certain quarantine conditions,” he said.“But this Jingtang port (where the ship Jag Anand is stranded) is not in the list for such crew changes… As to whether this has anything to do with the bilateral relations, I don’t see any link,” Wang said.There are 23 Indian crew members on the bulk cargo vessel MV Jag Anand, in anchorage near Jingtang port in Hebei province since June 13. Another 16 Indian crew members were on the MV Anastasia, in anchorage near Caofeidian port since September 20. Both vessels are waiting to discharge cargo.A report by ANI in November had said the 23 Indian crew members on board were seeking help from the Indian government to return home, and some are suffering from health issues and the ship is running short of medicines, the report said.“Our embassy in Beijing has been in constant touch with provincial and central government authorities in China, requesting that the ships be allowed to dock and/or the crew be allowed to be changed,” Srivastava had said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-sailors-stranded-due-to-covid-measures-not-standoff-says-china/story-LPBTCagB9vJOXVmMU3izRO.html
25-12-2020||World||Nepal’s Supreme Court issues show-cause notice to Oli govt over Parliament dissolution||Nepal’s Supreme Court on Friday issued a show-cause notice to Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli-led government, asking it to furnish a written clarification over its decision to abruptly dissolve Parliament. The notice was issued after a preliminary hearing at the five-member Constitutional bench headed by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana on the writ petitions filed against the government’s decision to dissolve the 275-member House of Representatives, My Republica newspaper reported. The bench sought the written clarification from the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Minister and Office of the President as they are made defendants in all the writ petitions, it said. The court has also asked the government to furnish an original copy of the recommendations made by the government to dissolve the House and the decision made by President Bidya Devi Bhandari to authenticate the government’s recommendations. The five-member bench comprises justices Bishwambhar Prasad Shrestha, Tej Bahadur KC, Anil Kumar Sinha and Hari Krishna Karki. On Wednesday, Chief Justice Rana’s single bench forwarded all writ petitions to the Constitutional bench. Altogether 13 writ petitions have been registered at the apex court challenging the government’s decision to dissolve Parliament. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Oli has called a Cabinet meeting on Friday evening, amid an intensified struggle between the two warring factions of the ruling Nepal Communist Party to wrest control of the party. Oli is likely to reshuffle the Cabinet following the resignation of seven ministers close to the Prachanda-led faction, the paper said, citing a source familiar with the Prime Minister’s Office. The Oli-led Cabinet now has 18 members including ministers and ministers of state. On Thursday, Chinese ambassador Hou Yanqi met Nepal Communist Party’s executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, who claims control over the ruling party after removing Prime Minister Oli from the posts of the party’s parliamentary leader and chair. In a meeting of the Central Committee members close to him on Thursday, Oli announced the removal of Prachanda from the post of the party’s Executive Chairman. Earlier, the Prachanda-led faction of the ruling party elected him as the new parliamentary leader, replacing Prime Minister Oli. Nepal plunged into a political crisis after President Bhandari dissolved the House of Representatives and announced dates for mid-term elections at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli on Sunday, sparking protests from a section of the ruling party and various opposition parties, including Nepali Congress. The ruling party has now been virtually divided more than two years after it was formed following the merger of CPN-UML led by 68-year-old Oli and CPN-Maoist Centre led by 66-year-old Prachanda in May 2018. Both factions of the party have intensified efforts to retain official party recognition along with the election symbol. The two factions are now busy making strategies to wrest control of the party.

25-12-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccination: From India to Morocco, here’s where some countries stand||The fight against the coronavirus pandemic is well and truly underway as several countries have either started vaccination drives or have given approval to shots against Covid-19. Few others have signed agreements for vaccine delivery while some are still in the process of testing candidates.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAs the fight against the pandemic reaches a crucial stage, here’s where different countries stand with regards to their vaccination drives:1. In India, the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) said on Friday it has planned a two-day dry run in four states of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat and Punjab next week. The dry run will take place on December 28 and 29, and will include necessary data entry in Co-WIN, an online platform for monitoring of vaccine delivery, the ministry said.2. Ireland on Friday said that it had approved the Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine, with health minister Stephen Donnelly announcing that the first batch of vaccines is expected to arrive on December 26. Donnelly further said that the vaccination drive will begin next Wednesday.3. The British government on Thursday said that more than 600,000 people have been vaccinated since immunisation drive began on December 8. Till December 20, the government said, 616,933 people had been vaccinated against Covid-19. The United Kingdom was the world’s first country to start a full-fledged vaccination drive, having approved the Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine earlier this month.4. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted on Thursday that the country had received the first batch of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, just a day after approving it. These, Trudeau said, were a part of the 168,000 doses that Canada will get from Moderna before the end of the month, as well as part of the total 40 million doses guaranteed to it by the American drug maker. Canada has already started the vaccination drive of Pfizer’s candidate.5. Mexico and Chile on Thursday joined the list of countries which have started vaccination drives. Both countries have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine. 59-year-old Maria Irene Ramirez and 46-year-old Zulema Riquelme became the first citizens in Mexico and Chile respectively to receive a vaccine shot.6. Turkey on Thursday said that late-stage trials of a vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech had shown that it was 91.25% effective. Researchers said that during the trials, no major side effects were seen, except for a case of an allergic reaction. On Wednesday, the same candidate was found to be more than 50% effective in Phase 3 trials in Brazil.7. Morocco’s health minister Khalid Ait Taleb on Thursday announced the acquisition of 65 million vaccine doses from China’s Sinopharm and UK’s Oxford-AstraZeneca. Preparations of the vaccination campaign are at an advanced stage, the minister further said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccination-from-india-to-morocco-here-s-where-some-countries-stand/story-Yh9J3EjNqx2H61Oa7IrpqK.html
25-12-2020||World||Sinovac vaccine shot’s efficacy uncertain despite Brazil, Turkey results||With trials of Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s coronavirus vaccine in Brazil and Turkey suggesting the shot has a protection rate on either side of 90%, there is still no final assessment on exactly how effective it is in protecting people against Covid-19.Sinovac is finalizing results of phase III trials carried out in Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia and Chile, according to a person familiar with the trials. Those tests are relatively independent from each other and conducted according to different protocols, rather than subject to unified norms that typically govern such trials, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the data isn’t public.Researchers in Brazil earlier this week delayed releasing complete information on Sinovac’s vaccine, saying only that it was found to be more than 50% effective. Sao Paulo state Health Secretary Jean Gorinchteyn offered more specific guidance on Thursday, saying the vaccine “didn’t reach 90%” efficacy, which would make it less successful than those developed by Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc.“We don’t know how much more than 50% it was, whether it was 60%, 70% or 80%, but it’s at levels that allow us to reduce the impact of the disease on our population,” Gorinchteyn said in an interview with Brazil’s CBN Radio. “We knew that the effectiveness would never reach 90%.”Turkey TrialAdding to the confusion, Turkey said a trial of Sinovac’s vaccine taking place in its country showed an estimated efficacy rate of 91.25%. That trial, however, is based on only 29 cases, which is considered insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion on the shot’s effectiveness, according to the person familiar with the trials. The trial will continue to collect Covid-19 cases to get a more finalized reading, the person said.A Sinovac spokesman declined to comment on questions about the vaccine’s efficacy.The delay in the announcement of definitive results has created confusion over the effectiveness of Sinovac’s shot. Chinese developers have been slow compared with their western peers in releasing efficacy data, risking an erosion of confidence in these candidates as the world puts a laser focus on which vaccines are most successful in fighting the pandemic.Pfizer and Moderna’s shots, meanwhile, have been shown to reduce symptomatic cases by well over 90%.The reason Brazil hasn’t yet disclosed complete efficacy numbers is because Sinovac and its partners are reviewing all the Covid-19 cases found among participants, the person said. The Brazil trial has yielded more than 170 cases, but Sinovac needs to verify them to see whether they all meet the criteria set out by the Chinese drug regulator.Regulators from China and Brazil, as well as Sinovac and its partners are still in the process of analyzing data from the Brazil trial, according to the person. Ultimately, Sinovac hopes to see unified standards to ensure equal comparisons across different trial sites, the person said. The protocol for the Brazil trial says Covid-19 cases are diagnosed in line with guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The late-stage trial of Sinovac’s vaccine in Brazil, involving about 13,000 participants, suggested the shot is “safe and effective,” authorities at the Butantan Institute and the state of Sao Paulo said earlier in the week.Saving LivesSinovac is betting on a successful vaccine to inoculate more people around the world and save lives, especially in developing countries like Brazil that will have limited access to the Pfizer and Moderna shots. Sinovac’s shot is potentially better suited to developing countries because it can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures, while vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require deep-freeze conditions for storage and transportation.The Sinovac vaccine has been at the center of a political dispute between Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria and President Jair Bolsonaro, who says a vaccine from China can’t be trusted. Bolsonaro again cast doubt on the effectiveness of the Sinovac vaccine in a Christmas Eve address broadcast on Facebook.“I want to make it very clear that the label of this vaccine will be ‘we are not responsible for any side effect.’ Responsibility is yours,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinovac-vaccine-shot-s-efficacy-uncertain-despite-brazil-turkey-results/story-oapZWFIBXB4pU22RHv4WdM.html
25-12-2020||World||Canada gets first batch of 168,000 Moderna Covid-19 vaccine doses||Canada has received the first batch of the coronavirus vaccine from Moderna just one day after the government’s approval, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.On Wednesday, the national agency Health Canada authorised the use of the Moderna vaccine against the Covid-19 virus in the country’s immunisation campaign.“The first doses of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine have arrived in Canada. These are part of the 168,000 doses we will be getting before the end of the month, and part of the 40 million doses we are guaranteed from Moderna overall,” Trudeau tweeted late on Thursday.According to Public Services Minister Anita Anand, these vaccine batches would be the first to be deployed to the country’s north.Apart from the Moderna vaccine, Canada has secured up to 20 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine against the coronavirus, expecting 1.2 million doses from both manufactures to be delivered to the country by the end of next month.The government expects to vaccinate up to three million of its citizens in early 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-gets-first-batch-of-168-000-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-doses/story-QseAoBAYUaFg4pwRi3MsbN.html
25-12-2020||World||Japan delays gender-equality goals in new five-year plan||Japan on Friday adopted a plan that delays women’s advancement goals by up to a decade after failing to reach even half of the 30% target by 2020 and other measures.Under the new five-year gender equality plan, approved by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s Cabinet, the government has postponed the goal for women to account for at least 30% of leadership positions until “as early as possible during the 2020s.” The earlier goal was set by Suga’s predecessor, Shinzo Abe, under his “womenomics” policy designed to promote more women in the workforce to make up for Japan’s fast-aging population.The plan called for a society with no gender bias by 2030s. But it said that Japan is still largely bound by traditional gender roles, making it difficult for women to pursue careers in business and politics while fulfilling expected responsibilities in homemaking and childrearing.The plan backpedaled from a draft and fell short of promoting proactive steps, including a possible legal revision on family names, to allow married couples a right to choose whether to keep their maiden names. The current civil law says a married couple must choose either family name, most often causing women to adopt their husbands’ household names under Japan’s paternalistic tradition.The government draft had called for taking “necessary steps” to address inconveniences and burdens on women. But the final plan, reflecting conservative views of Suga’s ruling lawmakers, said family name options should be carefully studied, taking into consideration Japanese tradition and possible impact on children and a sense of family unity.Japan especially lags in women’s advancement in politics. Women account for less than 10% of lawmakers in the more powerful of its two-chamber parliament. About 40% of local assemblies have no female members or only one. Suga’s 20-member Cabinet has only two female ministers.“We cannot say we are close to achieving the 30% target,” the new plan said.“While women’s advancement is progressing faster in other countries, Japan has fallen behind.” Japan placed 121st in the global gender-equality ranking of 153 countries in the 2020 World Economic Forum report, falling from 101st when Abe took office in 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-delays-gender-equality-goals-in-new-five-year-plan/story-G9h4uzQpPImfmL1zfkJbkM.html

It aims to boost hydrogen consumption to 3 million tonnes by 2030 and to about 20 million tonnes by 2050 from 200 tonnes now, in areas such as power generation and transportation. The strategy identifies 14 industries, such as offshore wind and fuel ammonia, target the installation of up to 45 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind power by 2040.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-aims-to-eliminate-gasoline-vehicles-by-mid-2030s-boost-green-growth/story-Q6Tvy0WfiwcUcrKe2zs0dL.html
25-12-2020||World||7 US lawmakers write to Mike Pompeo on farmers’ protest in India||A group of seven influential US lawmakers, including Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, have written to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, urging him to raise the issue of farmers’ protest in India with his Indian counterpart.India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and politicians on protests by farmers as “ill-informed” and “unwarranted”, asserting that the matter pertains to the internal affairs of a democratic country.“We have seen some ill-informed comments…relating to farmers in India. Such comments are unwarranted, especially when pertaining to the internal affairs of a democratic country,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said earlier this month.This is an issue of particular concern to Sikh Americans linked to Punjab, although it also heavily impacts the Indian Americans belonging to other Indian states, the lawmakers said in their letter to Pompeo dated December 23.“Many Indian Americans are directly affected as they have family members and ancestral land in Punjab and are concerned for the well-being of their families in India. In view of this serious situation, we urge you to contact your Indian counterpart to reinforce the United States’ commitment to the freedom of political speech abroad,” they said.In their letter, the lawmakers said that the US as a nation that is familiar with political protests can offer counsel to India during their current period of social disturbance.“As national legislators, we respect the right of the government of India to determine national policy, in compliance with existing law. We also acknowledge the rights of those in India and abroad who are currently protesting peacefully against agricultural laws that many Indian farmers see as an attack on their economic security,” the lawmakers said.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September.Dubbing these laws as “anti-farmer”, these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislations would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the Indian government but the logjam continues.In addition to Jayapal, the letter has been signed by Congressmen Donald Norcross, Brendan F Boyle, Brian Fitzpatrick, Mary Gay Scanlon, Debbie Dingell and David Trone.Over the past few weeks, more than a dozen US Congressmen have expressed their concerns on the ongoing protest by the farmers in India.Earlier this month, Congressman John Garamendi, Co-Chair of the American Sikh Caucus, along with Congressman Jim Costa and Congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee —members of the American Sikh Caucus— sent a letter to Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu, expressing solidarity with the protestors and defending their right to peaceful protest.Democratic American lawmaker David Trone on Tuesday urged the Indian government to provide safety to the protesting farmers and hailed the recent offers of dialogue and a proposal from India’s Supreme Court to set up mediation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-us-lawmakers-write-to-mike-pompeo-on-farmers-protest-in-india/story-Q29XXk9GHz7bk5f4ymPL5I.html

25-12-2020||World||Mexico starts giving first shots of Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine for Covid-19||An intensive care nurse in Mexico City on Thursday became the first person in Latin America to receive an approved coronavirus vaccine.Mexico began administering the first 3,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in a broadcast ceremony in which Maria Irene Ramirez, 59, got the first shot, under the watchful eyes of military personnel who escorted the vaccine shipment.“This is the best present I could have received in 2020,” said Ramirez. ”The truth is we are afraid, but we have to keep going because someone has to be in the front line of this battle.”Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell waxed poetic, saying, “Today the stage of the epidemic and its treatment changes, to a ray of hope.”Zoé Robledo, director of Mexico’s social security system, called it “an unforgettable Christmas. We are sure this is going to be the beginning of the end of the pandemic.”Other doctors and nurses rolled up their sleeves in the chill morning air at outside vaccination stations in the cities of Toluca and Queretaro. The country’s 1.4 million health workers will be the first to get the shots, followed by the elderly, those with underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable to the disease, and teachers.Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said Mexico was the first country in Latin America to get the vaccine, though others were close behind.Chile also began its inoculation program Thursday, with 42-year-old nurse Zulema Riquelme getting the first jab as President Sebastián Piñera looked on.“I am calm, happy, very excited,” Riquelme told Piñera, who noted “a lot of people have gone to a lot of effort to reach this moment.”Chile said it had received 10,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, and has a deal for a total of 10 million. Health workers and the elderly will be first in line.In Costa Rica, which is the third country in the region to begin using the Pfizer vaccine, the first shot was given Thursday to Elizabeth Castillo, 91.“This moment represents for the country the beginning of the road to end the Covid-19 pandemic,” Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado said at the event that opened the vaccination.Argentina, which has run into problems obtaining the Pfizer vaccine, received a flight carrying 300,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine.Argentina plans to become the first country in Latin America to administer the Russian vaccine starting next week. It won’t yet be given to people older than 60 due to a lack of testing data.Argentine Health Secretary Ginés González García vowed the Russian vaccine was safe and said it could be used on those 60 and older once Russian authorities certify it. He said 5 million more doses were expected to arrive in January.While Mexico got only 3,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in the first shipment Wednesday, Ebrard said about 53,000 more doses would arrive by Tuesday, about 1.4 million doses in January and a total of about 11.75 million by mid-year.Ebrard said two vaccines are currently undergoing Phase 3 studies in Mexico and another three are awaiting approval to start.Other countries around the region are engaged in testing several vaccines, in studies that involve tens of thousands of volunteers.Latin America has been among the regions hardest hit by the pandemic.Mexico reported over 1.35 test-confirmed cases so far and 120,311 deaths, the fourth-highest toll in the world. However, estimates based on excess deaths this year suggest Mexico’s real death toll is closer to 180,000.Argentina has 1.5 million cases and over 42,000 deaths, while Chile has seen 590,000 cases and 16,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-starts-giving-first-shots-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/story-S1AfqwIcaYcDWfXWIdwdAI.html

Along with an organist, he provided the musical accompaniment for the choir.“It was the first time we had all been back at Notre-Dame cathedral since the fire, so it was a moment full of emotion,” he said in an interview with television station franceinfo.The cathedral, a landmark of Gothic architecture dating to the 13th century and a major tourist attraction, caught fire on April 15, 2019. The blaze destroyed the spire and roof.French President Emmanuel Macron undertook to restore the cathedral within five years.But to date, most work on the site has focused on making the building safe, including clearing up toxic lead from the roof and spire that melted in the fire.In the meantime, Notre-Dame is closed to the public and masses are cancelled.In April this year, seven people were allowed to attend a religious ceremony in the cathedral to mark Good Friday, when Christians commemorate the death of Jesus Christ.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-choir-in-hard-hats-fire-ravaged-notre-dame-rings-in-christmas/story-Eor0XT5HwGk8oiorOLHqxL.html

Also Read: Donald Trump golfs in Florida as Covid relief hangs in the balanceThose pardoned in the past month -- Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, George Papadopoulos and Alex Van Der Zwaan -- pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial as a result of Mueller’s probe into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow.For Trump, the pardons delivered a rebuke to those alleging his election victory was tainted by Russian help. Flynn, his former national security advisor who admitted lying to the FBI about secret contacts with Russians, was victim of a “relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man,” Trump said as he announced the pardon on November 25.The probe into Flynn, he said, was part of “a coordinated attempt to subvert the election of 2016.” On Tuesday Trump pardoned Papadopoulos -- a campaign advisor who had tried to hide his contacts with individuals linked to Russian intelligence -- and Van Der Zwaan, who also lied to investigators.And on Wednesday Trump announced the pardons of political consultant Stone and campaign chairman Manafort, both convicted of obstructing the investigations and lying. Manafort was also jailed over multiple financial fraud charges.All, the White House said, had been victimized by Mueller.“Mr. Manafort has endured years of unfair treatment and is one of the most prominent victims of what has been revealed to be perhaps the greatest witch hunt in American history,” the White House said.Trump blames ‘dirty cops’ Trump has fought hard since coming to office, attacking his own Justice Department and threatening officials’ jobs, to convince the public that the allegations about Russian interference were groundless and politically motivated.That was seen as the main reason why, in November 2018, he fired attorney general Jeff Sessions, who supported Mueller, and replaced him with Bill Barr.Also Read: Trump pardons more allies and Kushner’s father, sparking fresh outrageFour months later, when Mueller released a final report outlining efforts by the Trump campaign to cooperate with Russia, and multiple instances in which Trump sought to obstruct the investigation, Barr declared there was nothing significant there and refused to act.Instead, at Trump’s urging Barr began investigating the investigators, coming up with enough minor faulty behavior for Trump to claim that he was the target of “dirty cops” at the FBI.“FBI & DOJ had NO EVIDENCE to start an investigation against President Trump,” the president tweeted earlier this year.Meanwhile, Barr intervened against his own department prosecutors and judges in the cases of Flynn and Stone, suggesting they had been scapegoated.He ordered the case dropped against Flynn -- who had pleaded guilty -- and that Stone’s recommended sentence be slashed. ‘Mob boss’Trump’s pardons angered the Russia meddling investigators.They were “what you would expect to get if you gave the pardon power to a mob boss,” said Andrew Weissman, one of the lead investigators on the Mueller team.FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok said the pardons “shock the conscience” and send the message that “if you work for (Trump), it’s OK to lie to the FBI about Russia.”Yet Trump hasn’t finished avenging his tarnished reputation. On December 1 Barr formally named a Mueller-like special counsel to conduct an independent “criminal” probe into the Russian investigators, including Mueller himself.That could continue for months after Trump cedes the White House to Democrat Joe Biden on January 20.For Biden, who has signaled he wants to turn the page, the probe could keep the focus right where his predecessor wants it -- on the alleged wrongs done to Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-pardons-trump-seeks-to-erase-stain-of-russia-probe/story-OKs3OZ5dmN9Qu2jcZiAUUM.html

Other Syrian media said Syrian air defences responded to an Israeli attack near the town in the Hama province.There was no immediate word on what the target was or whether there were any casualties.Israeli jets regularly violate Lebanese airspace and have often struck inside Syria from Lebanese territory. But the Christmas Eve flights were louder than usual, frightening residents of Beirut who have endured multiple crises in the past year, including the catastrophic August 4 explosion at the city’s port that killed over 200 people and destroyed parts of the capital. That explosion resulted from the detonation of a stockpile of ammonium nitrates that was improperly stored at the facility.There was no immediate word from Israel on Friday’s flights and alleged attacks on Syria.In the past few years, Israel has acknowledged carrying out dozens of airstrikes in Syria, most of them aimed at suspected Iranian weapons shipments believed to be bound for Hezbollah. In recent months, Israeli officials have expressed concern that Hezbollah is trying to establish production facilities to make precision guided missiles.Masyaf is a significant military area for Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime that includes a military academy and a scientific research center. Israel has struck targets there several times in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-jets-fly-over-beirut-explosions-reported-in-syria/story-eVjaIXguBSjru64spBaYGP.html
25-12-2020||World||Donald Trump golfs in Florida as Covid relief hangs in the balance||After tossing a grenade that threatens to blow up a massive Covid relief and government funding bill and force a government shutdown in the midst of a pandemic, President Donald Trump spent his Christmas Eve golfing in Florida.Failure to agree on the bill could deny checks to millions of Americans on the brink.Trump had no events on his public schedule on the first day of his winter vacation Thursday, but traveled to his Palm Beach golf club, where he was spotted by CNN cameras on the links. Reporters were given no details of his schedule for the day, but told that, “As the Holiday season approaches, President Trump will continue to work tirelessly for the American People. His schedule includes many meetings and calls.” Trump’s departure came as Washington was still reeling over his surprise, eleventh-hour demand that an end-of-year spending bill that congressional leaders spent months negotiating give most Americans $2,000 Covid relief checks — far more than the USD 600 members of his own party had agreed to. The idea was swiftly rejected by House Republicans during a rare Christmas Eve session, leaving the proposal in limbo.The bipartisan compromise had been considered a done deal and had won sweeping approval in the House and Senate this week after the White House assured GOP leaders that Trump supported it. If Trump refuses to sign the deal, which is attached to a USD 1.4 trillion government funding bill, it will force a federal government shutdown, in addition to delaying aid checks and halting unemployment benefits and eviction protections in the midst of the most dire stretch of the pandemic.It was a final raised middle finger to Republicans from a president who has been raging over his November 3 loss to President-elect Joe Biden and trying to come up with new, increasingly outrageous schemes to try to overturn the results of a Democratic election. He has been egged on by allies like his lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who accompanied the president to Florida aboard Air Force One.Trump’s ire has been focused, in part, on Republicans in Congress whom he believes have been insufficiently supportive of his quest to delegitimize Biden’s win by lobbing unfounded claims of mass voter fraud before Congress meets to tally the Electoral College votes on Jan. 6.In Florida, Trump continued to rail against the results, complaining to members that he had been robbed of the election and voicing frustrations about the year-end spending bill.“At a meeting in Florida today, everyone was asking why aren’t the Republicans up in arms & fighting over the fact that the Democrats stole the rigged presidential election?” Trump tweeted after he’d returned to his private Mar-a-Lago club. “Especially in the Senate, they said, where you helped 8 Senators win their races.” “I will NEVER FORGET!” he wrote in another, The statements underscored concerns that Trump is blowing up negotiations to punish lawmakers for what he sees as their insufficient support loyalty.Trump has provided no credible evidence to support his election claims, which have also been refuted by a long list of officials, from former Attorney General William Barr to Republican governors, judges and local election administrators.Meanwhile, the nation continues to reel as the coronavirus spreads, with record infections and hospitalizations and more than 327,000 now dead. And millions are now facing the prospect of spending the holidays alone or struggling to make ends meet without adequate income, food or shelter thanks to the pandemic’s economic toll.To mark the holiday, the president and first lady Melania Trump tweeted out a pre-recorded video message in which they wished Americans a Merry Christmas and thanked first responders and members of the military.“As you know, this Christmas is different than years past,” said Mrs. Trump, who focused on the acts of “kindness and courage” the pandemic had inspired .Trump hailed the vaccine doses now being delivered and thanked those responsible. “It is a truly a Christmas miracle,” he said.Meanwhile, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been trying to salvage the year-end legislation to try to prevent a shutdown. Democrats will recall House lawmakers to Washington for a vote Monday on Trump’s USD 2,000 proposal, though it would likely die in the GOP-controlled Senate. They are also considering a Monday vote on a stop-gap measure to at least avert a federal shutdown and keep the government running until Biden is inaugurated January 20.In addition to the relief checks, the Covid bill that passed would establish a temporary USD 300 per week supplemental jobless benefit, provide a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants and theaters and money for schools, and provide money for health care providers and to help with Covid vaccine distribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-golfs-in-florida-as-covid-relief-hangs-in-the-balance/story-CzNGRhNkoqT6bEkYnBz12H.html

25-12-2020||World||What now for British economy with UK-EU trade deal reached?||The last-minute trade deal between the UK and the European Union means businesses will be spared new tariffs and border disruption at the start of the new year - an economic shock that would have compounded the employment and financial troubles inflicted by the pandemic.News of the agreement Thursday brought sighs of relief from the offices of corporate bosses and politicians, as well as from consumers anticipating produce shortages and transport workers facing the potential of long backups at border crossings.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey recently warned that a failure to secure a UK-EU trade deal would have a greater long-term impact on the British economy than the long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to the country’s deepest recession in more than three centuries.The deal still must win approval from the British and EU parliaments. Here’s a look at the changes to come and their likely implications.WHAT IS THE UK LEAVING ON JANUARY 1? Though the U.K. left the EU on January 31, it is following the bloc’s rules until the end of this year as part of a transition period to the new economic relationship. The problem was, what comes after that? The UK is leaving the European single market, which after its departure will encompass around 450 million people. At its heart, the single market aims to make trade as simple as possible, regardless of where a business is located within the European Economic Area, which in addition to the 27 EU member states includes non-EU nations including Iceland and Norway. The rules governing trade are the same across the single market and are based on the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.The U.K. is also leaving the customs union, which eliminated tariffs between members and created a common external tariff to non-members. Under the customs union, the EU negotiates international trade deals on behalf of its members — giving it a weight in the global economy that no single member would have. WHAT IS THE NEW RELATIONSHIP?  Under the terms of the new deal, there will be no tariffs on goods traded between the U.K. and the EU. For car manufacturers, for example, that’s a relief as without a deal a 10% charge would have applied from Jan. 1. There will also be no quotas, meaning that exporters can still transport as many vehicles as they wish.Still, trade will not be as seamless as before as the U.K. leaves the single market and the customs union. Firms will have to file forms and customs declarations for the first time in years. There will also be different rules on product labeling as well as sanitary checks on agricultural products, for example.The government has estimated that the new red tape will result in an extra 215 million customs declarations each year at an annual cost of about 7 billion pounds.But a deal averts what could have been considerable chaos and a deeper blow to trade, since new tariffs would have added to the cost of doing business between the UK and the EU for many different categories of good. That has many viewing Thursday’s deal as making the best of a bad situation for business. WHAT WILL THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT BE? It is possible that it will take time to adjust, likely leading to further traffic jams on both sides of the English Channel as well as delays at the ports in the days and weeks after Jan. 1. Early expectations are that some food prices, notably of imported meat and dairy products, will rise in the weeks ahead.  HOW WILL THE NEW TRADE RELATIONSHIP AFFECT ECONOMIC GROWTH?  Economists agree that the deal is better for the British economy than a no-deal outcome, and will help it recover from the coronavirus recession, which is expected to have reduced economic output by around 12 per cent in 2020. The impact is much smaller for the EU and other countries around the world, which would have mainly experienced some volatility in financial markets in case of no deal.The EU accounts for around half of the U.K.’s exports, so avoiding tariffs will help many companies. Executives can start to implement investment decisions that they’d kept on hold over the past few years of Brexit uncertainty. Still, the deal with the EU does not incorporate the full scope of the services sector. Since it accounts for around 80 per cent of the British economy, those businesses that rely heavily on business with the EU, such as banking and finance, face a murkier future. That’s particularly ominous for the UK’s huge banking sector.  WHAT ABOUT LONGER TERM? In the longer-term, most forecasters think the British economy will end up being a few percentage points smaller over the coming few years than it otherwise would have been if it had stayed in the EU. That may not sound much in the context of this year’s recession, but it does mean that living standards would be lower than otherwise have been the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-now-for-british-economy-with-uk-eu-trade-deal-reached/story-rfp59ncEQtDF6rtKp0BsYL.html

He said the Narendra Modi government was highly committed towards the growth and development of the agriculture and farm sector, and for the welfare, prosperity and wellbeing of farmers.In a series of tweets on Friday, Nadda said under the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojna a total of Rs. 18,089 crores is being transferred to 9.4 crore farmers directly into their bank accounts. It is a major step towards good governance, he added. Nadda said a total of 8 crore farmers from across India who had registered to connect with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his address today directly listened to his speech, which is unprecedented and historical.Nadda also said the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre under the leadership of the Prime Minister is constantly working towards the modernization of the agriculture sector and for making agriculture more profitable for the farmers of India, which is an agriculture-centric nation.In his tweets which were addressed to the farmers, the Bharatiya Janata Party chief said Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address once again warned against the conspiracies surroundings the farm sector reforms laws. Modi also clarified all the misconceptions of farmers regarding the laws and told them about the good intentions and work his government has been doing for farmers, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-asks-farmers-not-to-fall-for-propaganda/story-PlZMjo7d35fgPah1pc15vK.html
25-12-2020||India||Theft case filed after 100 kg gold kept under CBI’s lock and key goes missing||Acting at the behest of the Madras High Court, the CB-CID in Chennai has registered a case in connection with the “missing 100 kg of gold” seized by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) during a raid on an importer in 2012. On a complaint by C Ramasubramaniam, insolvency professional and liquidator, a case was registered under section 380 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on December 23, said a senior CB-CID official on condition of anonymity. The 103.8 kg gold, worth Rs 30 crore, is part of 400.47 kg in bullion and ornaments seized by the CBI when it carried out searches at the premises of Surana Corporation Ltd in Chennai in 2012. The gold was kept in safes and vaults of the Surana Corporation under the CBI’s lock and seal. On the Madras High Court’s directions, the CBI said, the vaults were opened in the presence of the official liquidator, Surana Corporation and banks’ representatives and inspected from February 27 to 29 and found that there was only 296.6 kg of gold. The case of the missing gold became public knowledge earlier this month when the Madras High Court was hearing a petition filed by Surana Corporation’s liquidator, Ramasubramaniam, seeking a direction to the CBI to handover the remaining 103.8 kg gold.The CBI told the court that it had handed over 72 keys of the safes and vaults to the principal special court for CBI’s cases in Chennai. “This court is unable to state with certainty that they have handed over the keys,” said Justice PN Prakash and ordered a CB-CID probe into the case on December 11 much to the embarrassment of the CBI.The following day, the CBI released a statement clarifying its role. “The inventorised gold was not kept in Malkhana of the CBI. Rather it was in the premises of Surana only under the seal,” the investigating agency’s statement read. “While the enquiry was on, the petition was filed in the high court. The CBI’s internal enquiry continues and if any adverse role of any CBI official surfaces, strict action will be taken against them,” said the agency.During the seizure, the gold bars were bunched while weighing but while handing over to the liquidator, appointed for a settlement of debts between Surana and CBI, it was weighed individually and that was the reason for the discrepancy, the CBI had claimed. During the course of the investigation the CBI concluded that the gold did not have a bearing on a corruption case, and that it had, however, been imported in violation of the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP). While prosecuting the case, the CBI accused officials of Minerals & Metals Trading Corporation of India (MMTC) of showing undue favour to Surana in importing gold and silver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/theft-case-filed-after-100-kg-gold-kept-under-cbi-s-lock-and-key-goes-missing/story-Oaawt1yylO9rjtvThGM0BL.html

The Union government should solve the problems of the farmers and withdraw the anti-people laws immediately. India has a distinguished image at international forums but the PM is diminishing it by his government’s adamant attitude,” said Soren after garlanding the life-size statue of Mahato at his memorial in Uliyan under Kadma police station (PS) this afternoon.The CM also said his government had completed a year in office and would present its account of performance and achievements on December 29 along with the roadmap for the next four years.Also read: From BJP to Mamata Banerjee, a 10,000 farmer rally challenge in Kolkata“Our government will not allow any illegal activity and ensure rule of law at any cost. There have been cases of illegal mining and we have taken action by stalking them. Most of the iron ore mines are now closed and penalty have also been levied on them for illegal mining. The past one year in office has been challenging. The old system has still been in effect in many spheres and we are trying to change the system. The previous state government had completely derailed the state. Once we accomplish the job of getting the system on track, the state will progress with double speed,” asserted Soren.He said it was an occasion of double joy as it was Christmas and also Mahato’s birth anniversary.“Nirmal Mahato was one of the pioneering and leading leaders of Jharkhand separate state movement. The crowd of people here shows the people’s love for him and JMM. It is such occasions when JMM’s bonding with the people gets further strengthened,” Soren said before leaving for Ranchi via Bokaro.Late Nirmal Mahato’s sister-in-law Ichagarh MLA Sabita Mahato, former state minister Sudhir Manato’s widow, her daughters, state ministers Champai Soren, Banna Gupta, MLAs Ramdas Soren, Mangal Kalindi, Samir Mohanty, Sanjiv Sardar and other JMM leaders were present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/withdraw-farm-bills-wake-up-from-slumber-jharkhand-cm-slams-centre-over-farmers-stir/story-Ao27ew6xem7lW5eLRu1HvK.html

Omar’s remarks came after Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party led by former finance minister Altaf Bukhari announced that Yasmeena Jan -- the District Development Council (DDC) member from Imam Sahib-I, in south Kashmir’s Shopian district -- has joined the party here earlier in the day. Jan had contested the polls on the National Conference (NC) mandate. “This explains why our leaders in Shopian district are being put under “preventive arrest” by the police.

The NC vice president said it was shameful for the administration to play “partisan politics”. “Shame on this administration for playing partisan politics to curry favour with the ruling party & their stooges. These parties couldn’t win seats so now they are using money/muscle/threats & government coercion to make up the numbers. So much for “democracy has won”!” He said in another tweet.

The workers resorted to ransacking after the Dindoshi Court directed MNS chief Raj Thackeray to be present in court following Amazon’s complaint that their posters were torn by MNS workers.MNS leader Nitin Sardesai said: “The Amazon is anti- Marathi as it gives choice of other languages to its buyers but not Marathi. This provoked the Maharashtrians and hence they indulged in violence.”The MNS had demanded that e-commerce companies Amazon and Flipkart should include Marathi as other regional languages like Tamil, Telugu and Kannada are included as preferred languages on their apps. Flipkart responded to the diktat and included Marathi while Amazon refused to do so.

Rajinikanth had been shooting in Hyderabad for almost ten days for his upcoming film ‘Annathe’ but it was suspended on December 23 after four crew members tested positive for Covid-19 during a routine test on the film sets. Rajinikanth took a Covid-19 test on December 22 and it was negative and has since isolated himself, a press release from the hospital said. “Though he did not have any symptoms of Covid-19, his blood pressure showed severe fluctuations and needed further evaluation,” the hospital said. “He will be investigated and monitored closely in the hospital till his blood pressure settles down before being discharged. Apart from fluctuating blood pressure and exhaustion he does not have any other symptoms and is hemodynamically stable.”Earlier Rajinikanth had said that on December 31 he would announce the launch date of his political party which he is expected to float in January 2021, ahead of the assembly elections slated for April or May in Tamil Nadu. He first announced his entry into politics on New Year’s Eve in 2017 but his party work remained in limbo. With the Covid-19 pandemic, his political foray remained doubtful as doctors had advised the 70-year-old against it since he had undergone a kidney transplant in 2016. But the actor sprung a surprise earlier this month saying that though there were health concerns, he was ready to sacrifice his life for the people of Tamil Nadu and made two appointments for his yet to be launched party. At that time, Rajinikanth had also said that he had 40% shooting left to be completed for ‘Annathe’ which is being produced by late DMK leader M Karunanidhi’s grand-nephew Kalanidhi Maran’s Sun Pictures. Several political leaders wished Rajinikanth a speedy recovery including Telangana governor and former Tamil Nadu BJP’s state president Tamilisai Soundararajan, opposition leader of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu and Jana Sena party founder, Pawan Kalyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajinikanth-hospitalised-for-blood-pressure-fluctuations-in-hyderabad/story-gZNkrEMFdWZ9HkLm4Ku2hI.html
25-12-2020||India||2020: The year that gave glimpse of how life in India could be without trains||The year 2020 showed India a glimpse of how life would be without trains.As the coronavirus lockdown was announced on March 24, the Railways for the first time in its 167-year-old history shut down all its services.People stranded across the country and who usually looked to the Railways to ferry them home, were left without their lifeline. Some, like the thousands of migrant workers, took to the streets choosing to walk to their destinations. As the Railways directed its resources towards carrying essentials across the country, lakhs of tickets were cancelled during the summer holidays -- something unheard of in rail history.It was on May 1 that the wheels of trains started chugging again. This time, to ferry migrant workers home. Between May 1 and August 30, the Railways ferried 63.15 such workers home across 23 states in over 4,000 Shramik Special trains, not only bringing huge relief to the stranded migrants, but also hope for the others that their lifeline was down, but not out. It was, however, the Shramik Special trains which saw the Railways being criticised by the Opposition parties over the fares being charged from the migrant workers. While the Railways said that it did not charge a penny from the workers and spent more than Rs 2,000 crore on their transportation, the politics over the issue continued.“What do trains mean for me? They mean hope, joy and also a sense of routine. For 25 years, I have taken the same route home to Bihar to be with my family after months of being away from them. That’s what they mean to me, they get me to my family. “Every year, I would book tickets around the same time to go home. This year it did not happen and I feel a sense of loss that something that was part of life could very easily be taken away,” said Jitender Kumar, a security guard working in Noida.Currently, the Railways is operating 1,089 special train services, while Kolkata Metro was running 60 per cent of its services, Mumbai suburban was running on 88 per cent and 50 per cent of Chennai suburban services were in operation.Railway Board Chairman and CEO VK Yadav agreed that it was a tough year for the national transporter, but also highlighted how it innovated and used the crisis as an opportunity. “This year has been of grit and victories for Indian Railways. Faced with daunting and unprecedented COVID-related challenges, Indian Railways has not only been able to keep the national supply chain running and move millions of people back home in most adverse circumstances, but has also been able to realise the potential of its workforce, which driven to the wall has come out with innovative solutions,” Yadav told PTI. While passenger movement dipped resulting in an estimated loss of 87 per cent as compared to last year, the Railways’ made drastic changes in their freight movement, introducing parcel services, carrying essentials like milk, medicines and even ventilators.The innovation was to realise that if the Railways could not move passengers freely, it could move freight instead. Business Development Units (BDUs) were set up at Railway Board, Zonal Railway and Divisional levels. Multi-disciplinary teams from BDUs have been reaching out to customers to attract new business. It also introduced time-tabled parcel services to provide reliable services to courier services, e-commerce companies. The Railways also launched eight Kisan Rail Services to enable farmers to send their produce across the nation with enhanced speed and reduced cost.With all its focus on freight movement, the Railways’ freight staged a recovery in September by registering a record loading of 102 Million Tonnes (MT), which is the highest ever loading for the month of September in any year. The momentum in freight loading continued and growth of 15 per cent and 9 per cent has been obtained in the subsequent months of October and November respectively.With passenger trains off the tracks, the Railways doubled the speed of freight trains from 24 kmph a year ago to 46 kmph which means half the time taken for sending products. It also completed over 350 critical and long pending major bridge and track works.While the year saw no major accidents, the Railways family bore the pain of 30,000 employees infected with coronavirus and saw more than 700 frontline workers breathe their last.While it did not carry passengers across the country on holidays, it sent lakhs of migrant workers home to their loved ones. While it did not manufacture state-of-the-art Train 18s, the Railways produced more than 5000 COVID care coaches. Its production units supplemented the government’s efforts by producing masks, sanitisers and even overalls for use by railway employees.“The Railways used COVID as a challenge and has been able usher in an unprecedented growth in development of infrastructure, innovation, capacity expansion of network, freight diversification and transparency matters. Railways has this crisis as an opportunity to lay the foundation for future development and next level of travelling experience for passengers,” said Yadav.Looking forward, he said plans have been made to meet both infrastructure and traffic requirements till the year 2050. A National Rail Plan (NRP) 2030 has been developed with a view to develop infrastructure by 2030 to cater to the traffic requirements up to 2050. Based on the NRP, a Vision 2024 document has been prepared to develop infrastructure by 2024 to enhance modal share of Railways in freight transportation to more than 40 per cent and to cater to the traffic requirements up to 2030. However, there are two key issues on which the Railways is at loggerheads not only with its own officers and unions, but also political parties. While in 2020 the size of the Railway Board was reduced and it has been reoriented on functional lines, the decision to unify the eight organised Group ‘A’ services into one service under the Indian Railway Management Service (IRMS) has drawn a lot of flak. The modalities for recruitment of officers into IRMS and unification of the existing services are being worked out.Another issue on the Railways’ decision to introduce 151 modern passenger trains operated by private players over 109 routes has resulted in both unions and Opposition parties accusing the national transporter of selling national assets.While Kumar does not understand the implications of either the reorganisation of cadres or running of private trains, he does, however, know that a glimpse of a life without trains meant moments away from loved ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2020-the-year-that-gave-glimpse-of-how-life-in-india-could-be-without-trains/story-g8AvacB2K4d0di5vlMKUPL.html
25-12-2020||India||From BJP to Mamata Banerjee, a 10,000 farmer rally challenge in Kolkata||BJP’s Bengal unit chief Dilip Ghosh has thrown a 10,000 farmer rally challenge in Kolkata to Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee. The BJP leader promised to showcase five times that number at their own rally, underlining that the farmers are with the party. “I am challenging Mamata Banerjee and her leaders to gather 10,000 farmers and organise a rally in Kolkata if they can. We would organise 50,000 farmers and show them. The farmers are with Narendra Modi,” said Dilip Ghosh launching a mega booth-level outreach program ahead of the crucial assembly polls.Ghosh also said that farmers in the state are not in favour of the Trinamool government in West Bengal. He alleged that Mamata Banerjee prefers to send her emissaries to meet agitating farmers stationed at Delhi borders but does not allow any protest rally in the state. On Wednesday, Banerjee had sent five of her parliamentarians to meet the farmers at Singhu border to support their protest against the new farm laws. CM Banerjee also spoke to the farmers over phone and assured them of her support. Earlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused Mamata Banerjee’s government of “destroying” the state and depriving its over 70 lakh farmers of benefits from the Centre’s flagship PM-KISAN scheme under which Rs 6,000 per year is given to each farmer.Defending her government, CM Banerjee accused the PM of trying to mislead the people with half-truth and distorted facts. Meanwhile, the BJP in Bengal launched a massive door-to-door outreach program titled ‘Amar Booth Sobcheye Mazboot (My booth is the strongest)’ in all 78,000 polling booths across the state with the party’s booth-level workers. “We have been able to reach nearly every booth and set up booth committees. Booth level workers would be visiting every house till December 28. On December 27, they would urge people to listen to the Prime Minister’s Mann ki Baat program. Large screens would be set up in every booth,” said Ghosh. In November, the BJP had drawn up a draft blueprint of the campaign strategy the party would adopt in the run-up to the 2021 elections. Plans were made up to the booth level, so that each and every ground level worker could be involved during the campaign period and the party could cover the maximum area before the elections come calling. “This outreach program is a part of that and efforts are being made so that no booth level worker is left out. They are being given responsibilities,” said a senior BJP leader. Each booth president would be given a kit comprising a facemask, sanitiser and a diary to mark details of the campaign. It would also have various leaflets containing details of the outreach program, a 23-point guide on the duties of a booth president and a letter from the PM. The booth president would be given a name plate for his house, a BJP flag, to be hoisted at his house, and stickers to distribute to every house he visits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-bjp-to-mamata-banerjee-a-10-000-farmer-rally-challenge-in-kolkata/story-2MjRhWyAx8DV8Jx0BjrmyJ.html

The two-day dry run will be held on December 28 and 29, officials have said.“The dry run is being conducted to mobilise all elements involved in Covid-19 vaccination drive that is planned for next year to test the vaccine delivery machinery. All elements except for the vaccine will be mobilised,” a senior official in the Union ministry of health and family welfare said requesting anonymity.According to officials, five sites in each of the two districts in a state are likely to be established for the purpose of vaccinating beneficiaries. “Two districts each from all these four states have been identified where this dry run will be conducted simultaneously on these two days,” another health ministry official, who too did not want to be named, said.Also read | Antibodies target different part of coronavirus in severe Covid-19 cases: StudyThe health ministry has prepared a detailed checklist and shared it with the four states to guide them in the dry run. “The central government is gearing up for the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccine across the country. As the vaccine administrators will play an important role in the immunisation process, training of trainers and those who shall administer the vaccine has been taken up across various states,” the ministry said.Here is what you need to know about the dry run:1. The exercise will include necessary data entry in Co-WIN, an online platform for monitoring of vaccine delivery, testing receipt and allocation, deployment of team members, mock drill of session sites with test beneficiaries, a well as reporting and evening meeting, according to the Union health ministry.Also read | South Africa rejects UK claims over new coronavirus variant2. The health ministry has said it will also include testing of cold storage and transportation arrangements for Covid-19 vaccine, management of crowd at session sites with proper physical distancing.3. Each state will plan it in two districts and preferably in five different session-type settings -- district hospital, community health centre (CHC) or primary health care centre (PHC), urban site, private health facility and rural outreach.4. “This exercise will enable end-to-end mobilisation and testing of Covid-19 vaccination process (except the vaccine) and check the usage of Co-WIN in a field environment, linkages between planning, implementation and reporting mechanisms, identify challenges and guide the way forward prior to actual implementation including improvements that may be required in the envisaged process,” the health ministry said.5. Special focus will be to check how possible adverse events following immunisation will be dealt with as each session site will have a designated health care facility linked to it to treat people who may develop any discomfort or uneasiness post-vaccination. It will also focus on how infection control practices will be adhered to during vaccination at the session site so that it doesn’t become ground for disease transmission.Also read | India records 23,067 fresh Covid-19 infections in 24 hours, 6.6% lower than yesterday6. This will also provide a hands-on experience to programme managers at various levels. An important focus of the dry run will be on the management of any possible adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) as well as on adherence and management of infection control practices at the session site to prevent disease transmission.7. The mock drill will include concurrent monitoring and review at block and district levels, and preparation of feedback to be shared with the state and the Centre.8. Specific training modules have been drafted for medical officers, vaccinators, alternate vaccinators, cold chain handlers, supervisors, data managers, ASHA coordinators and all others involved in the implementation process at different levels.9. The training includes all operational aspects like the organisation of vaccination sessions, use of Co-WIN IT platform for the management of the entire vaccination process, deployment of HR cold chain preparedness, management of adverse events,  communications and intersectoral coordination, biomedical waste management, infection prevention protocols among others.Also read | Indian vaccine Covaxin has drawn global attention: ICMR10.

In an apparent reference to the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Banerjee wrote that some “nouveau invaders” in Visva-Bharati “have now started raising surprising and completely baseless allegations.” WB CM Mamata Banerjee writes to Nobel laureate Amartya Sen;says,"Some nouveau invaders in Visva Bharati have started raising surprising&baseless allegations about your familial properties...I want to express my solidarity with you in your battles against bigotry of majoritarians" pic.twitter.com/NXspA4VLgC“I write this letter to express my surprise and anguish over some recent developments, as I read about them in media, alluding to your ancestral links in Santiniketan,” Banerjee said in her letter to Sen. Banerjee also mentioned the Sen family’s links with Santiniketan, the location of Visva-Bharati University, stating that it’s a family “weaved in the culture and fabric of Santiniketan, inalienably.”Taking a veiled dig at the BJP, Banerjee also noted how “pained” she is at these “surprising and baseless” allegations about Sen’s familial properties. She added that she wanted to express her solidarity with him in his battles against the “bigotry of the majoritarians” in the country. The West Bengal CM then urged Sen to count her as his “sister and friend,” adding that he shouldn’t be daunted by these accusations. “We shall overcome,” she said in her letter.Banerjee’s letter to Sen comes a day after she was accused by the BJP of “skipping” the centenary year celebrations of the university, which were addressed by prime minister Narendra Modi. The chief minister’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) responded, claiming that she “wasn’t invited” for the ceremony.The episode has emerged as the latest flashpoint between the two parties as the BJP aims to defeat the TMC in next year’s assembly polls to end Banerjee’s 10-year term as the chief minister, and, in the process, form its maiden government in West Bengal.The Visva-Bharati University was established on December 23, 1924, by India’s first Nobel laureate, Rabindranath Tagore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/count-me-as-your-sister-mamata-banerjee-reaches-out-to-amartya-sen-amid-land-grab-charges/story-w7AdCIp4eKmdPAncRtrbHI.html

Shah insisted the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system will continue and mandis will not be shut down.Addressing a gathering in New Delhi to mark late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s birth anniversary, Shah accused the opposition of spreading lies about the three farm laws enacted in September. He maintained the laws, which have triggered protests, would benefit farmers. Shah said farmers were lauding agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar as they knew the laws are in their interest. He added if farmer organisations feel some provisions of the laws are not in their interest, the government is ready to discuss them with an open mind.Also Read: Protesting Haryana farmers throw open toll plaza gates on national and state highways“In 2014 and 2019, ending an era of coalition governments, farmers gave a clear mandate to Modi. And the top priority of the Modi government is the welfare of farmers,” said Shah. He added the Modi government implemented the long-standing demand of farmers to ensure MSP is at least equal to the cost of growing a crop.Shah said the Modi government has hugely raised welfare funds for farmers. He added when Modi introduced the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi direct cash-transfer scheme for the farmers, opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi demanded farm loan waivers.“In 10 years, the [previous Congress-led] UPA [United Progressive Alliance] government waived loans worth Rs60,000 crore. In just two and a half years, Modi provided Rs95,000 crore to 10 crore [100 million] farmers,” Shah said.“...when Sharad Pawar was the agriculture minister, in 2013-14, the budget for farmers was Rs21,900 crore. Now, under Modi, it has reached Rs134,000 crore. It is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Those who talk about the welfare of the farmers, what did you do when they were in power?”Shah attended Modi’s virtual interaction with farmers along with other Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders at a Gaushala in Delhi’s Kishangarh village. Other central ministers addressed similar events across the country.In New Delhi’s Dwarka, defence minister Rajnath Singh suggested that farmers should see how the farm laws work for a year or two. He added that in case they are not found to be beneficial, the government will bring necessary amendments. Singh called the protesting farmers his own people. “Those who are staging a sit-in [against the laws] are farmers...We have a lot of respect for them.”Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for almost a month in protest against the three laws.Singh called himself a farmer’s son and said the government will never do anything against the farmers’ interests. “People are trying to mislead farmers about these farm laws. I am the son of a farmer and have worked on farms. I want to assure you there is not a single provision in these laws that is against farmers.”Union minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who addressed a farmers’ gathering in Uttar Pradesh’s Rampur, said the government is committed to the “protection and promotion” of farmers’ welfare. Naqvi said political parties, which know nothing about agriculture, were hurting farmers’ interests.The BJP had drawn an elaborate plan to defend the three laws and union ministers like Nitin Gadkari, Nirmala Sitharaman, Thaawar Chand Gehlot, Ramesh Pokhriyal are scheduled to travel across the country to counter “misinformation” about them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-ministers-say-govt-is-committed-to-farmers-welfare-amid-protests-against-farm-laws/story-WqCRd9apZsM3pPwV5IglrK.html
25-12-2020||India||As La Nina peaks, longer, harsher winter likely||Winter may be relatively harsher and longer in north India this year as La Niña, a global weather pattern that has a cooling effect on global weather conditions, has matured and nearly peaked. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said that various meteorological parameters indicate that La Niña, which began in September, is approaching its peak and may return to neutral conditions only late next summer.Scientists said this could mean a long, harsh winter in north India and could have an impact on the coming monsoon depending on the status of La Niña in May, June and July.La Niña is only one of a range of climatic drivers which affect weather globally. Other drivers include the Indian Ocean Dipole and Madden-Julian Oscillation. Forecasting the expected impacts of La Niña can therefore be complex, WMO, said adding that it has started mobilising preparations for impacts of La Niña. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has estimated that there is 95% probability of La Niña continuing through March 2021.Also Read: Bitter cold persists in north India, light snowfall likely in Kashmir over weekendWMO on Wednesday said South East Asia is expected to see a typical La Niña weather response over the next three months, with wetter than average conditions affecting most parts, particularly the Philippines, with an increased risk of flooding and landslides.“We have already said that below normal temperatures are expected over northwest India through the winter. Generally, La Niña helps the Indian monsoon which means above normal rains are expected but its too early to give a specific forecast for monsoon. We know that cold westerlies tend to enter inland during La Niña years which is also why winter is more pronounced,” said DS Pai, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, Pune.“It appears that until February, winter conditions will be harsh and this may be an extended winter. La Niña years are associated with longer winters. The peak of winter chill is likely to be felt in the first week of January as a couple of western disturbances are likely to bring widespread snowfall to the western Himalayan region. If La Niña conditions immediately don’t switch over to El Niño when sea surface temperatures are very warm then monsoon in the coming year is also likely to be above normal,” explained Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet Weather.“Both October and November have been colder than normal over northwest India which may be linked to La Niña. Another spell of very low temperatures may set in by month end and January beginning,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centreEl Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Niño is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Niña is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters. IMD, in its seasonal outlook for winter, had said nights and early mornings are likely to be chilly, recording below normal minimum temperatures over most parts of north, northwest, central and some parts of east India while day temperatures are likely to be above normal over the same regions. The diurnal temperature variation (difference between day and night temperatures) is likely to be high in most subdivisions of north, northwest, central and a few subdivisions of east India.WMO on Thursday also said in a statement that this decade (2011-2020) is the warmest and this year remains on track to be one of the three warmest on record, despite a cooling La Niña event, which is now mature and impacting weather patterns in many parts of the world.“Record warm years have usually coincided with a strong El Niño event, as was the case in 2016. We are now experiencing a La Niña, which has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but has not been sufficient to put a brake on this year’s heat. Despite the current La Niña conditions, this year has already shown near record heat comparable to the previous record of 2016,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-la-nina-peaks-longer-harsher-winter-likely-says-meteorological-organisation/story-acCtDSonREHn34lYuhv0vM.html

The party has entrusted her with a coveted post. She will be the new Mayor of Thiruvananthapuram Corporation.The state capital has pulled off a mayoral first-- she is the youngest Mayor of the country. “I was into politics at a young age. If the party asks me to take to take up any role, I will be the happiest to accept it,” said Arya Rajendran, daughter of an electrician K Rajendran and LIC agent Sreelatha Rajendran. Hailing from a lower middle-class family, her single storey house doesn’t have a motorable road.Basking in the glory of recent local body elections, in which it won the majority of corporations, panchayats and block bodies, the ruling party sprang a surprise by giving the mantle of the prestigious corporation to a first-time councillor. Senior party leader Jameela Sreedharan and two others were also in the running, but the party chose a young leader over them.Call it an election stunt or not, this time the party had experimented with many young faces like Rajendran to take on the might of the Bharatiya Janata Party and incumbency factor and many emerged victorious. In the 100-member corporation council, the ruling Left Democratic Front has 52 seats and the BJP is in opposition with 35 seats.In the council also she is the baby (usually the mayor is called the mother of the city) but politics is nothing new to Arya Rajendran. She became a member of Bala Sangam, a children’s outfit affiliated to the party, at the tender age of six. Now she is its state president and also an office-bearer of the Students Federation of India, the party’s youth wing.The mayor-designate has quite a few priorities. “A heritage city Thiruvananthapuram is already beautiful. I will make it more clean ensuring proper waste disposal. I will also ensure medical care for all,” she said adding many leaders have inspired her and prominent among them were Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Health Minister K K Shailaja.She said along with her new role she would like to continue her studies. “People in my ward gave me a thumping margin because I was young and a student. I will pursue my studies along with my public service,” she said. Her elder brother works in a West Asian country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arya-rajendran-21-chosen-country-s-youngest-mayor-from-kerala-s-thiruvananthapuram/story-iF24YHQ7cvQDvM2nmOFAPL.html

Pandey visited the Shahjahanpur district jail in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday and investigated the matter in detail for over seven hours, besides recording statements of jail officials. “Statements of Jail Superintendent Rakesh Kumar, Jailor Rajesh Kumar and others were recorded. Documentary evidence such as books and pamphlets distributed by the followers of Asaram were also collected,” Pandey said on Friday. The jail gatekeeper, warden and some inmates were also questioned, he said, adding that he would complete the probe in two to three days and hand over the report to the Director General (Jails). According to reports, Asaram’s two followers had come from Lucknow, distributed blankets and held a prayer meeting in which Asaram’s photograph was placed on Monday. The probe was ordered after photos of the programme went viral on social media. Asaram was convicted in April 2018 of raping a Shahjahanpur girl at his ashram near Jodhpur in 2013.

25-12-2020||India||Vajpayee played transformational role in shaping India’s foreign policy: Jaishankar||Former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee played a transformational role in shaping India’s foreign policy that led to a new beginning in relations with the US, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Friday. In his opening remarks at the maiden Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture, Jaishankar said the late premier “introduced corrections, some bold and others more nuanced,” in a range of national security and foreign policy issues. “Atalji’s vision of India-US cooperation has been advanced, particularly in recent years, by the leadership and commitment of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Overcoming the hesitations of history, we are today focused on addressing contemporary challenges and emerging opportunities,” he said. Describing Vajpayee as a “titan of his times who left an indelible stamp on many of our national policies”, Jaishankar said he had an “intuitive understanding that the post-Cold War world required India to drastically rework its relationships and interests”. Also Read: Yogi Adityanath pays tribute to Atal Bihari Vajpayee on birth anniversary“This vision led to a new beginning with the United States that has since been developed by successive governments on both sides. It required us, as a nation, to overcome difficult moments and continuing concerns. Only someone with Atalji’s enormous self-assurance could, in the early days, have visualised how natural this partnership would become,” he said. At the same time, India’s relationship with Russia has remained steady partly due to Vajpayee’s endeavours, Jaishankar said. India’s principled approach of engaging China on the “basis of mutual respect and mutual sensitivity” too reflects Vajpayee’s thinking, he added. In India’s neighbourhood, Vajpayee “radiated goodwill and friendship, while being clear that terrorism and trust could not coexist”, Jaishankar said. Vajpayee could “finesse difficult issues” while warmly reaching out across regions and continents, he said, pointing to the country’s relations with the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) and with countries in Europe, Africa and Latin America. “And most notably, he embraced the Indian diaspora in a way that had no parallel till then,” Jaishankar said. Nisha Desai Biswal, president of the US-India Business Council and former assistant secretary for South Asia in the US state department, delivered the address focused on India-US relations. India marked the 96th birth anniversary of Vajpayee, who died in 2018, on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vajpayee-played-transformational-role-in-shaping-india-s-foreign-policy-jaishankar/story-eWihkQhRIlAJmCYHRgbrmI.html
25-12-2020||India||‘Only farmers of Bengal deprived of central benefits’: PM Modi’s sharp attack on Mamata Banerjee||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched a sharp attack on Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal and said the state was deprived of the benefits of the Centre’s schemes because its leaders were busy in furthering their own political ideology in name of farmers’ protest.“Today, more than Rs18,000 crores have been directly deposited in the accounts of farmers; no middlemen, no commissions. But the 70 lakh farmers of West Bengal have been deprived of the benefits of the Centre’s schemes. Bengal is the only state which is not allowing benefits of the schemes to reach the farmers,” PM said after releasing the next instalment of PM-Kisan, the direct cash-transfer scheme for farmers.Those who have ruled West Bengal for over three decades have destroyed the state, the PM further said, asking why the Opposition does not raise objections when the same people who stand against central schemes in Bengal go to Punjab and change colours.“Mamata Banerjee’s ideology has destroyed Bengal. Her actions against the farmers have hurt me a lot. Why is the Opposition quiet on this?” he said.“Many farmers from Bengal have written to the Centre, seeking benefits that haven’t reached them because of their state leaders, but the to no avail. The state government does not give importance to their appeals. I am astonished and in pain,” the PM said.PM’s latest outreach comes amid ongoing farmers’ protests against the three laws passed by the Parliament in September to reform the farm sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-farmers-of-bengal-deprived-of-central-benefits-pm-modi-s-sharp-attack-on-mamata-banerjee/story-aGr7Zgex1SUAndkQKmh8IO.html
25-12-2020||India||‘Ready to talk to those who are against us on farm issues’: PM Modi’s top quotes||Training his gun at the opposition parties for misleading farmers who are protesting against the new three farm laws for the past four weeks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he has no problem with parties doing politics. But don’t mislead farmers, he urged. This was BJP’s latest outreach programme amid the ongoing farmers’ protest which is far from the thaw. What PM Modi and other Union ministers have been saying for the past few days were echoed in PM Modi’s speech on Friday. But there was more as Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government is ready to talk to those who are against the government. Here are the top quotes from PM Modi’s speech:‘Talks must be based on issues,facts and logic’“There are parties which supported these farm laws before. We have their written statement. But now they have changed their stance. One political leader is misleading people. He doesn’t even believe in democracy. He has connections abroad as well. Can’t even say things he has been saying. But despite all this, I am saying this with humility that the we are ready to discuss the issue of farmers with those who are against us too but the discussion has to be based on issues, facts and logic,” PM Modi said.‘We have open mind’“We have not claimed that we have all the knowledge. There should be debate. That is how democracy works. We are ready to address all issues in an open mind,” PM Modi said.‘Direct benefit transfer’ Remembering Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his birth anniversary, PM Modi on Friday said the farm laws are in a way inspired by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. “Once Vajpayee ji criticised his previous government on how government’s money used to get lost in the way before reaching the beneficiaries. I am glad that we are being able to ensure direct benefit transfer. There is no middleman between the government and the beneficiaries,” PM Modi said.‘West Bengal depriving farmers’ “Over 70 lakh farmers in West Bengal are deprived of this scheme. This is my regret. The West Bengal government is blocking the scheme for its political interest. If you listen Mamata Banerjee’s speech dating 15 years back, then everything becomes clear,” PM Modi said.‘Farmers have replied through ballot box’“The political party which has deprived its own farmers is instigating farmers in Punjab. They have lost political relevance. They have lost the recent elections in placed where they are supporting the farmers’ protest,” PM Modi said.‘Why does Kerala have no mandi system?’“Those ruling Kerala for years are joining Punjab farmers for selfies, but not doing anything for mandi system in own state. If mandi and APMC are so good, then why Kerala does not have these?” PM Modi said.‘Demand has changed’“Farmers had some apprehensions about new laws, but people with political agenda came in between and introduced new unrelated demands. Initially, the demand was MSP,. which is justified as they are farmers. But now there are demands of releasing some people from the prison. There are demands to make highways toll free,” PM Modi said.‘Sell your products anywhere in the country’“Farmers will be able to sell their products anywhere in the country, listen to me carefully. If you want to sell at MSP, you can sell. If you want to sell at mandis, you can do that. If you want to sell online, the new laws empower farmers to do that too,” PM Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-politics-but-don-t-mislead-our-farmers-pm-modi-s-top-quotes/story-m287CwWOQxnJbEaKybmruL.html
25-12-2020||India||Let farm laws be implemented for a year; if not found beneficial, we will amend them: Rajnath Singh||Addressing a rally in Delhi, senior BJP leader and defence minister Rajnath Singh made an appeal to “let the farm laws be implemented for a year or so”, adding that the government will be ready to amend the laws if they are not beneficial to farmers.“Let the farm laws be implemented for year or so. If they are found to be not beneficial for farmers, we will be ready for necessary amendments,” Singh said. He made these comments at a rally in Delhi which is a part of Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) efforts to combat the ongoing protest against the three contentious farms laws. The ruling party is conducting a nationwide outreach to the farmers on December 25, the birthday of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Addressing a rally at Dwarka in the national capital, Singh said he himself is a farmers’ son and assured that the Modi government “will never do anything which is not in the interest of the farmers”.Describing the protesting farmers as his own people, Singh said, “Those who are sitting on dharna are farmers and are born to farmers’ families. We have lot of respect for them.”Underlining that all problems can be resolved through dialogue, Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants talks with farmers to continue, and therefore, the government has extended an invitation to them. Singh also said that the government is taking every step in the interest of the farmers. “Our government will never do anything which is not in interest of farmers. Those who are on dharna are farmers, born to farmers’ families; we have lot of respect for them.”Talking about minimum support price, Singh said, “There has been misconception that minimum support price will end. Prime Minister has said & I’ll also give my word that MSP won’t end.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi also virtually addressed farmers across states on Friday and released the next batch of financial aid Rs 18,000 crore from the PM-Kisan scheme. Farmers are protesting on the borders of Delhi against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

25-12-2020||India||Kerala scribe Kappan’s case shifted to Mathura’s districts and sessions’ court||The additional district and sessions judge-I of Mathura will now hear the case of Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan and three others after an Agra court held that the chief judicial magistrate was not competent to hear the matter and to order the remand of the accused. Madhuban Dutt Chaturvedi, the counsel for three of the accused, confirmed the orders passed by the district and sessions judge earlier this week. “This transfer is the outcome of an application moved by the Special Task Force, heard and disposed of by the district and sessions judge. Interestingly, we too were challenging the jurisdiction of the chief judicial magistrate but our plea was rejected, earlier,” said Chaturvedi. The transfer of the case took place in the light of the apex court judgement that no court except that of the sessions’ judge was authorised to hear a case of this nature. Now, all the records and remand papers are to be transferred from the court of the chief judicial magistrate to the court of additional district and sessions judge. Kappan and three others-- Atiqur Rahman, Aalam and Masood-- were arrested on the way to a village in Hathras to meet the family of a Dalit woman who was brutalised, gang raped and killed. They were arrested for alleged links with the notorious radical Muslim organisation, the Popular Front of India, and initially booked for breach of peace and later under various provisions of the IPC and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

However, the UP government alleges Kappan’s association with the now-banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and the PFI and has submitted to the apex court that the Delhi unit of KUWJ was itself facing a vigilance inquiry over embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds following a Kerala high court order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-scribe-kappan-s-case-shifted-to-mathura-s-districts-and-sessions-court/story-OnKDSJMa7tuclFgEonwY4M.html
25-12-2020||India||‘Do they take your land too?’ PM Modi asks Arunachal farmer; Tomar appeals to end stir||As Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday interacted with farmers from six states, he asked a farmer from Arunachal Pradesh who has been doing contract farming whether the company that he has entered into a contract with also takes away his land or the contract is only for the produce. The farmer who cultivates organic ginger said the contract is only for the produce, not the land. “See, you are in Arunachal Pradesh but still are aware that your land will not be taken away. But there are a few farmers here who have been misled to think otherwise,” PM Modi said in a veiled reference to the ongoing protest of the farmers against the three agriculture laws.The government, in its attempts to dispel fears over contract farming, has been reiterating that contract farming will benefit farmers as it is not binding upon farmers and they are free to terminate the contract. However, apprehension over contract farming persists as reports have emerged that a Delhi-based company refused to buy the crops from Madhya Pradesh farmers even after agreement.PM Modi’s interaction with farmers amid the ongoing standoff with farmers on the occasion of the released of Rs 18,000 crore under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme is significant as the message is clear: the government will not repeal the laws, MSP will continue, protesting farmers have been misled by opposition parties. While PM Modi was addressing farmers through video-conferencing, Union ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh addressed farmers in Delhi. Inaugurating the main event, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said a few farmers of Punjab are protesting against the laws. Urging them to withdraw their protest, the minister said, “I hope they will understand the importance of the new farm laws, and the issue will be resolved soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-they-take-your-land-too-pm-modi-asks-arunachal-farmer-tomar-appeals-to-end-stir/story-cPJ4J4xwdedcssEuZaqzyM.html

25-12-2020||India||‘Complete travesty of truth’: Opposition rejects PM’s remark on farm laws||Opposition leaders on Thursday termed as “baseless” Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remark that the parties are lying to the farmers, saying such accusations are a “complete travesty of truth”. In a joint statement, the opposition leaders expressed solidarity with the farmers who are protesting at various Delhi borders against the three farm laws passed recently by the Parliament. “PM must stop baseless accusations, repeal farm laws. We register our strong protest against the baseless allegations being made by Prime Minister Modi, accusing the opposition parties of ‘repeatedly lying’ to the farmers about the new farm laws and using them for their politics. The Prime Minister’s accusations are a complete travesty of truth,” read the statement. The joint statement was signed by former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Sitaram Yechury of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary D Raja, Farooq Abdullah of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Akhilesh Yadav, TR Baalu of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav, Manoj Bhattacharya of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), Debabrata Biswas of the All India Forward Bloc (AIFB) and Dipankar Bhattacharya of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). “We have expressed our solidarity with the protesting farmers. The call for this ongoing historic struggle was given by more than 500 kisan organisations from all over the country under the banner of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM). Many of us had opposed these agri laws when they were being enacted in Parliament without discussions or proper consideration. MPs who sought a vote were suspended,” it added. In an address to farmers of Madhya Pradesh on December 18, the Prime Minister had reiterated his government’s commitment to the welfare of farmers and explained his government’s view of the three farm laws being a step towards making their lives better. Modi had also attacked the opposition for “misleading” the farmers on agri laws and compared his government’s agriculture ‘report card’ with that of the previous government. But the opposition parties dismissed the accusations. “Among the many unsubstantiated accusations made, one of them is that those who spoke of agrarian reforms in election manifestos earlier are now opposing (the farm laws). Yes, we are for reforms, but what sort of reforms? Opposition parties seek reforms to strengthen Indian agriculture; enhance the prosperity of our farmers; and ensure continued food security for our people and the country. The present farm laws undermine these very objectives,” the opposition leaders said. “Among the ‘big lies’ that the opposition is supposedly spreading, one is on the MSP. The PM claims (the government is for) implementing the Swaminathan Commission Report in this regard. This report had recommended an MSP of C2+50%, while this government, at best, implements A2+50%. In fact, this government told the Supreme Court its inability to implement C2+50% MSP. Who is spreading untruths?” they asked. Also Read: While PM holds Kisan Samvad, SP stages bonfire meetings with farmers The opposition leaders also denied the accusation that they are shooting from the shoulders of the farmers in order to regain lost political ground. Despite tall claims of implementing a higher MSP, farmers’ distress due to indebtedness is growing, leaving a record number of them with no other recourse than committing suicide, they claimed. The opposition parties also demanded repeal of the three farm laws and withdrawal of the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020. “We demand that the present agri laws be repealed along with the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Following this, discussions on agrarian reforms must be held by the central government with the farmers and all stakeholders. On the basis of these consultations, new enactments may be considered by Parliament, if necessary, by convening a special or a joint session,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/complete-travesty-of-truth-opposition-rejects-pm-s-remark-on-farm-laws/story-oUwKOwN4kL62Degz5EWnLP.html
25-12-2020||India||Farm law protests: Terai farmers to march to Delhi on Friday to join stir | 10 points||Terai farmers from Uttarakhand will undertake a march towards Delhi to protest against the farm laws on Friday, on what will be day 30 of the protests. On Thursday, day 29 of the protests, the government reached out to the farm unions, once again inviting them for talks at a date and time of their choice. Earlier in the day, a three-member Congress delegation, including Rahul Gandhi, met President Ram Nath Kovind to seek his intervention to repeal the farm laws.Here are key developments from day 29 of anti-farm law protests:1. Vivek Aggarwal, joint secretary in the Union agriculture ministry wrote to farm unions, again requesting them to hold the sixth round of talks as a date and time convenient to them. The farmers had on Wednesday rejected the government’s initial proposal in this regard, which it sent on Sunday.2. In the letter, Aggarwal stressed that it was “crucial” for the government to keep negotiations open with various farm unions. He also reiterated the government’s commitment to arrive at “logical solutions” for issues raised by the farm unions.3. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar met two groups of farmers, both of whom, he claimed, were in support of the reforms. 60 members of the Kisaan Majdoor Sangh and 21 from the Kisan Sena met Tomar separately, and expressed their support. He also showed a letter of support from the Kisan Majdoor Sangh.Read more| Farmers’ protest: Centre says not ‘logical’ to include MSP in talks, unions likely to reply today4. Tomar lashed out at Rahul Gandhi for meeting President Kovind and submitting a memorandum seeking a repeal of the laws. Remarking that even the Congress doesn’t take Gandhi seriously, Tomar said that the farmers told him that no one from the party came to get their signatures.5. The minister was referring to claims made by the Congress that its memorandum to the President had signatures of two crore people against the laws. “If Rahul Gandhi was so worried, he could’ve done something when his government was in power. Congress has always been anti-farmer,” Tomar said.6. 11 Opposition parties, including the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Samajwadi Party (SP), issued a joint statement, condemning prime minister Narendra Modi for his “baseless allegations” that the Opposition was lying to farmers about the new laws. “PM’s accusations are a “complete travesty of truth,” the statement said.7. The parties further demanded a repeal of the three laws and that of the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The government should hold discussions with the farmers and all stakeholders, the statement said.Read more| Farmers’ protest: Chilla, Ghazipur borders closed, traffic diverted from GT Karnal Road8.

SP workers plan to engage farmers in villages around bonfires to discuss their concerns.The event day coincides with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Kisan Samvad’ or a dialogue with farmers, seeking to dispel their apprehensions with the farm laws that have led to a prolonged farmers’ protest at borders of the national capital of Delhi.SP president Akhilesh Yadav has asked party’s sitting MPs, MLAs, MLCs, former legislators and office bearers to go to villages to participate in the Kisan Ghera programme and explain that the SP has “always stood by” their cause.The name of the outreach programme, Kisan Ghera, means to convey the small farmer gatherings, party workers hope to organise around bonfires.

The government wants the farmers to incur huge losses due to the black laws (farm laws). In its arrogance of power, the BJP is also insulting the food farmers put on the plates of every citizen of the country,” he tweeted in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/while-pm-holds-kisan-samvad-sp-stages-bonfire-meetings-with-farmers/story-s6sdNsj5NBqWgUv0C0dFoL.html

He added that a prolonged protest would not be in favour of the country. Ramdev made the comments on Thursday in Saharanpur.Ramdev added that the issues raised by the farmers are very sensitive and the protests should not be prolonged. Government and farmers should find an amicable solution which keeps the honour of farmers intact while ensuring the growth of the agriculture sector in the country. “Government should work to increase farmers’ produce and the price of crops,” he said.Protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that three laws passed by the Centre to purportedly reform the sector would instead pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the ‘mercy’ of big corporations. They insist that the three laws passed by the Parliament are repealed.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.Also Read: Farmer protests: Panjab University students set up book stall at Singhu borderPrime Minister Narendra Modi is set to interact with farmers on Friday during a money transfer event, while the Centre is hoping for a breakthrough after it invited protesting farmer unions for resumption of the talks.The farmer unions, however, alleged that the government’s latest offer for talks is nothing but ‘a propaganda’ against the peasants to create an impression they are not interested in dialogue, and asked it to put the scrapping of the new farm laws in the agenda to resume discussions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baba-ramdev-says-centre-should-come-midway-for-honourable-solution-to-farmers-protest/story-gujGR5yX0lI0EWnDsMbRmK.html

The crackdown has come as a huge embarrassment for Beijing, which has been trying to persuade the Ashraf Ghani government to hush up the case, people familiar with the matter in Kabul and New Delhi said.The 10 Chinese citizens, detained recently in this connection by Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security (NDS) on charges of espionage and running a terror cell, are believed to be linked to China’s spy agency, Ministry of State Security. The crackdown by the NDS started on 10 December.Also Read: Months after cancelling deal with China, India acquires heavy cranes for Chabahar portThis is the first time in years that Chinese nationals have been caught spying in Afghanistan where the country was looking at rapidly expanding its influence even as the US withdraws its troops. At least two of the 10 Chinese nationals were in contact with the Haqqani Network, the terrorist group that doubles as the sword arm of the Taliban, a senior diplomat in Kabul said.President Ashraf Ghani has been briefed about the detentions and has authorised First Vice President Amrullah Saleh, a former chief of the Afghan intelligence agency, to oversee the investigation and engage the Chinese in view of the sensitivities involved, the people cited in the first instance added.Amrullah Saleh has held a meeting with the Chinese envoy to Kabul, Wang Yu to brief him about the detention. Saleh is learnt to have indicated that the Afghan government could consider a pardon for the Chinese spies if Beijing submits a formal apology that admits to the violation of international norms and a betrayal of Kabul’s trust.Otherwise, Amrullah Saleh is believed to have told the Chinese ambassador, the Afghan government would go ahead with criminal proceedings. One of those detained, Li Yangyang, according to a counter-terror official in Kabul, has been operating for the Chinese Intelligence since July-August . He was arrested by the Afghan NDS on 10 December from his house in western Kabul neighbourhood of Kart-e-Char.Also Read: For total disengagement, India wants military commanders’ meet with China at ‘early date’The NDS team seized arms, ammunition and Ketamine powder, a recreational drug , from his residence when the first round of raids were carried out on 10 December. NDS officials who have questioned Li have reported that he had been gathering information about al Qaeda, Taliban and Uyghurs in Kunar and Badakhshan provinces, according to this counter-terror official. A Chinese woman was the second person to be arrested. Sha Hung, who runs a restaurant in Kabul’s Shirpur was also arrested the same day.“From her place, NDS recovered explosive material and other incriminating items,” the counter-terror official said.He added that Li and Sha have been in contact with the Haqqani NetworkEight more Chinese nationals were subsequently arrested.Investigators, a diplomat in New Delhi said, were still trying to ascertain the precise activities of the espionage ring and any possible linkage to Pakistan’s deep state. One view within the Afghan security establishment is that the detainees were creating a fake East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) module in Afghanistan to entrap ETIM operatives in Afghanistan. ETIM is a small Islamic separatist group alleged to be active in Xinjiang province, home to China’s ethnic minority Uighur Muslims. Its founder Hasan Mahsum, an Uyghur from Xinjiang’s Kashgar region, was shot dead by Pakistani soldiers in 2003. Rights groups say China uses the ETIM threat as an excuse to impose restrictions on Uyghurs and discredit human rights activists outside China. The United States last month revoked the terror tag slapped on ETIM although the group continues to be designated by the UN Security Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-espionage-ring-in-afghanistan-busted-10-spies-detained/story-qyPsZY1wUoD2flp9UIYMrK.html

The orbiter, which has completed sixteen months around the moon in lunar orbit, was launched on July 22, 2019 and inserted into the lunar orbit on August 20.On completion of one year of the orbiter being in space, Isro had said that the spacecraft was ‘healthy’, performance of subsystems were normal, and there was adequate onboard fuel to remain operational for about seven years.Here is all you need to know about the orbiter:- Chandrayaan-2, described as the most complex mission ever undertaken by Isro, cost less than half the budget of Hollywood blockbuster ‘Avengers Endgame’. The total cost of the mission is estimated at 124 million US dollars, while the movie has an estimated budget of close to 356 million US dollars.- The mission made India the fourth nation after the United States, Russia and China to land a spacecraft on the Moon.- Chandrayaan-2 consisted of three missions clubbed together – the orbiter that would circle around the moon, the Vikram lander that was to make a soft landing near the south pole of the moon, and the Pragyan rover that was to explore the lunar surface and observe water ice. The lander and rover were destroyed during the attempted landing in September, 2019. - The lander of Chandrayaan 2, ‘Vikram’, was named after the pioneer of India’s space programme, physicist Dr Vikram Sarabhai.- The data from seven out of the eight instruments was collected by the Indian Space Science Data Centre at Karnataka’s Byalalu, where it was prepared in the Planetary Data System 4 (PDS4) format for public release before being peer-reviewed scientifically. It was then released through the PRADAN portal hosted by ISSDC at https://pradan.issdc.gov.in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-releases-chandrayaan-2-orbiter-data-all-you-need-to-know/story-OQVOE3NrUklc6kyOtQTiAL.html
25-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest: Centre says not ‘logical’ to include MSP in talks, unions likely to reply today||The ‘Dilli Chalo’ protest against three agriculture laws called by several thousand farmers on November 26 enters the 30th day on Friday. Protesters, according to their announced programme, will picket toll plazas today while the standoff with the Centre over the laws continues, though the Centre on Thursday sent a fresh invitation to the protesters urging them to resume talks and fix a date.Here are the latest updates of the four-week-long protest:1. The Centre’s fresh invitation comes after the unions wrote to them that the agenda should be revised as they had already rejected the proposals after the 5th meeting.2. The Centre said it would not be logical to include in the agenda any new demand related to minimum support price as it was out of the purview of the new farm laws. “Any new demand related to MSP, which is out of the ambit of farm laws, is not logical to include in the talks. As informed earlier, the government is ready to discuss all the issues raised by farmer unions,” the three-page letter written by agriculture ministry joint secretary Vivek Aggarwal said.3. With regard to the Electricity Amendment bill and laws related to stubble burning, the government said it is ready to discuss if farmers’ unions have other issues apart from the draft proposal given based on the December 3 discussion.4. Reacting to the fresh invitation, farmers on Thursday said the MSP cannot be separated from the demand of repealing the contentious laws, asserting the issue of a legal guarantee for it is a key part of their agitation.5. The unions are likely to hold a meeting today to discuss the Centre’s letter and what to write in the formal response to the ministry.6. Farmers have alleged that Centre’s repeated invitation without changing the agenda is a propaganda against the protesters to create an impression that they (farmers) are not interested in dialogue.7. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with farmers from six states at 12 noon via video conferencing as he will release a fund of Rs 18,000 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme. The event coincides with former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s birth anniversary which the BJP observes every year as “good governance day”.8. PM Modi’s today’s interaction amid the ongoing standoff will be celebrated as a “festival” across the country with BJP ministers, MPs, MLAs attending the programme from various locations. One crore farmers will directly participate while over five crore will hear Modi’s speech. Union home minister Amit Shah will attend the programme in Mehrauli, while defence Minister Rajnath Singh will be in Sector 15 in Dwarka. 9. Reiterating that he will tender his resignation the day he is unable to ensure MSP, Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Thursday said the new central farm laws need many amendments and urged protesting farmers to give “concrete suggestions”.10. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday met President Ram Nath Kovind and submitted a memorandum containing signatures of two crore farmers against the laws.

25-12-2020||India||2020 - The year of the pandemic: From lockdown to slow release||As the country went into a state of lockdown on March 25, our lives were disrupted in a manner unlike anything we have encountered before. For a city that is always industrious, hard at work, assiduously getting through the tasks of the day, Delhi had to adapt, and adapt fast, to a change in rhythm. Schools shut down, and the children had to start attending classes online. Our offices asked us to work from home, and we stayed in — as instructed — for days on end, barely stepping out if we could help it. Many lost their livelihoods; almost everyone began to do a lot more domestic work than they had done previously. Mayank Austen Soofi captured this Delhi through his camera and phone, looking for new ways of telling the stories of our lives as we battled the coronavirus pandemic.How we worked 1. Hair stylists Wakeel and Bali, both in their 40s, on the job in their white PPE kits in Khan Market’s Bharat Hair Dresser, late November. “It’s to protect ourselves and our customers from the virus,” said Wakeel. Their daily attendance in the salon, which opened on June 1 after more than two months of staying shut, emphasises the fact that while many professionals might still be working from home, there are others who are obliged to perform their duties in person, at work sites. They wear their new uniform throughout the day except during lunch hours, and switch to a another washed set the next day.2. The legendary Old Famous Jalebi Wala shop in Chandni Chowk is screened off with a plastic curtain on an early December morning. A special poster cane up three weeks ago asking customers to maintain social distancing. The masked cook, Vicky, has just finished deep-frying the day’s first batch of jalebis. The shop stayed closed for two months during the lockdown and reopened in early June. The owner says that the “business is as cold as the weatherHow we coped 1. Janakpuri resident Radhika Singh, 52, irons her newspaper before any family member living in the three-floor residence touches it. In the early days of the pandemic, many discontinued the delivery of newspapers to their homes fearing that the paper might carry the Sars-CoV-2 virus within its folds. But Singh’s household didn’t. The fear was soon proved to be false given the sanitization procedures followed during the printing process. Even so, Singh believes that applying heat kills the virus. She said she got the idea of ironing from popular English series, Downton Abbey. Singh still doesn’t meet anyone except she did visit her parents in Dwarka twice, on Raksha Bandhan and Diwali. She agreed, late November, to meet on WhatsApp video— a poignant reminder of how people are reaching out to each other. 2. A hand sanitiser bottle occupies a place of decorative reverence in the Sufi shrine of Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya during the saint’s 806th birthday celebrations in October. Closed for more than five months, the shrine re-opened to visitors in September, and this was the first major event held there. The dargah was decked with flowers, balloons and buntings, with the hand-sanitiser bottles were installed attractively in various places so that visitors would be encouraged to use them. A team of volunteers were assigned to make sure that devotees didn’t linger for more than a few minutes. The saint’s grave continues to be surrounded by a plastic screen so that nobody tries to kiss it, as was the tradition in the BC era.How we studied 1. Fourth-year engineering student Muskan Singh, 21, prepares for her ongoing final exams at her Ghaziabad home, December. Singh hasn’t been to her college’s campus in Delhi’s Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women since the lockdown began in March.Even though her parents have resumed going to office in the past few months, Singh spends all her time in front of her laptop and on her mobile phone. “Soon we’ll complete two semesters without meeting our professors in person... can they recognise us as their students if we happen to pass by them somewhere?” she said, adding that she missed the pleasure of sitting amid fellow students. She however does play badminton for two hours with friends in the outdoor court of her apartment complexHow we were governed 1. Masked customers at a small roadside tea shop in Seelampur on a cool November morning. A Delhi Government-issued poster on the wall reads: “Not wearing mask is not a heropanti...” But, of course, the customers were obliged to take off their mask to dunk down their chai. The government, through the district magistrates’ enforcement officers, continues to fine people who don’t wear masks — but roadside vendors and stall owners, at risk from customers with their masks down, don’t have a choiceHow we interacted 1. Designer Elena Tommaseo, a native of Venice, on a Zoom meet-up with friends and relatives in Italy from her apartment in East of Kailash in April. This picture was taken at a time when Italy was witnessing a great many deaths due to the pandemic and Tommaseo, a longtime Delhi resident, was anxious for her folks, especially her elderly parents. In her 50s now, it was an annual ritual to visit them during the summer, but this year she was forced to spend the months of May and June in Delhi due to the lockdownHow we played 1. Fitness trainer Muhammed Zaid, 30, exercises on an early December morning in a gym in Old Delhi’s Kucha Chelan. Before the lockdown, Zaid spent long hours in SolidCore gym — across the street from his home — where he trained 15 clients over a stretch of 10 hours. He’d also take out a couple of hours for his own set of exercises. While Zaid didn’t go to the gym during the lockdown, and even for a few weeks after it lifted, he didn’t miss exercising even for a single day. “I gathered many equipments on my roof where I would exercise without fail.” Zaid wears the mask as often as possible.Twice a week, he jogs for 12 kilometres at Rajghat, a ritual he is following for six years. Sometimes, he plays snooker in a lounge near Delite Cinema. “I was about to move to Dubai to work as a fitness trainer, I’d gained all the appropriate certificates necessary for having such a job in Dubai... and then the pandemic arrived and my plan fell through.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2020-the-year-of-the-pandemic-from-lockdown-to-slow-release/story-wpfBSaIREJFtswPtxJ5ygI.html
25-12-2020||India||Baghpat farm union meets Tomar, pledges support to laws||A delegation of the Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, a farmer union from Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh, met Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Wednesday and pledged its support for the three new farm laws. “The Modi government is open to meeting all farmer organisations and committed to solving their issues. Nearly 3 lakh farmers have supported the laws. Their voices need to be heard to,” Tomar told reporters. In a tweet, he said the farmers told him that the laws were in the interest of farmers and should not be withdrawn. Farmers have been protesting on the borders of Delhi since November 26 against three farm laws enacted recently by the government. They have been protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baghpat-farm-union-meets-tomar-pledges-support-to-laws/story-SkqypccefH8RllZiWRIHQM.html
25-12-2020||India||PM Modi to address farmers today as BJP plans to scale up outreach||As protesting farmers mount pressure on the government to scrap a set of contentious farm laws, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will virtually address farmers across states on Friday and release the next batch of financial aid Rs 18,000 crore from the PM-Kisan scheme. The PM’s session with farmers is a part of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s nationwide outreach to the farmers on December 25, the birthday of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.“Tomorrow’s day (Friday) is very important for the country’s Annadatas. Will get the opportunity to release the next installment of PM-Kisan for more than 9 crores farmer families through video conferencing at 12 pm. Will also interact with farmers of many states on this occasion,” the PM tweeted on Thursday.The Centre is also expected to provide Rs 18,000 crore to 90 million farmers under the PM-Kisan scheme, an initiative of the Narendra Modi government to extend income support of Rs 6,000 per year to small and marginal farmers in three equal instalments of Rs 2,000 every four months. In a letter to BJP functionaries across the country, a copy of which was accessed by HT, party general secretary Arun Singh listed a series of steps, including installation of large TV screens at the venues of farmers’ gatherings, so that the prime minister’s speech gets a wide viewership.Singh told reporters on Thursday that the party has made arrangements for farmers’ participation on December 25 in more than 19,000 venues across the country, and the party’s members will also be present. While one crore farmers will directly participate, over five crore of them will hear Modi’s speech, he added.At the block level events, the party is planning to explain to farmers how the contentious three new laws, aimed at opening up trade in agriculture, are in their interest.Party functionaries have been asked to detail measures put in place by the Centre to benefit farmers such as increases in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers’ produce, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana that insures their yields and the introduction of neem-coated ure to boost wheat and paddy production. Singh urged BJP workers to gather outside Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs), or government controlled mandis, and offices of cooperative organisations for farmers’ events, which would also be attended by the party’s elected representatives.The new outreach to farmers will coincide with the completion of the first month of a sit-in protest by farmers who have massed at Delhi’s borders to demand a repeal of the three laws that they say will hurt their livelihoods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-to-address-farmers-today-as-bjp-plans-to-scale-up-outreach/story-c5WgDY05ddzicoq7g0ZCMM.html
25-12-2020||India||‘Will discuss with open mind’: Govt again writes to farmers||The Union government has invited farmers for talks again, a day after farm unions rejected the government’s request to a senior farm leader to suggest a date for the resumption of negotiations on three contentious farm laws. In a letter to farm unions, the government said it was ready to not only discuss existing proposals but also new demands the farmers may have. “If there are any new issues other than the proposals discussed on December 3, then the government is ready to discuss everything with an open mind,” joint secretary Vivek Agrawal of the agriculture ministry wrote in a letter to over 30 farm leaders. The bureaucrat, who wrote on behalf of farm minister Narendra Tomar, said the new farm laws were not related to minimum prices for agricultural produce in any way and the mechanism of minimum support prices would continue. The government reiterated its assurance on MSPs, continuance of agricultural power subsidy and a solution to stubble burning. Farm unions on protest against three recent laws said they were not inclined to restart negotiations with the government until it draws up a new agenda, presenting an increasingly difficult challenge to a government grappling to find a way to end the month-old agitation. A massive farmers’ rebellion was set off by three laws pushed through by the government in September that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules. Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices. Thursday’s outreach is the third written invite the government has sent out to protesting farmers, following five rounds of formal negotiations that ended on December 8, when farmers decided to call off further negotiations after a meeting with home minister Amit Shah, claiming a stalemate. The back-and-forth of letters from both sides has only made the deadlock appear intractable. Each official offer to carry on negotiations has been rejected by the farmers on the grounds that the government has avoided directly addressing their stand on scrapping the entire gamut of reforms approved by Parliament in September. While the government has made eight proposals, farmers’ union have said the government hasn’t made any concrete assurance. On December 20, the government responded to the farmers’ written rejection of proposals by saying that farmers should clarify in detail what their specific proposals. “The reply sent by you through your email to us is very brief. It is unclear whether the views expressed in that mail are your personal opinion or the collective view of all the farm organisations,” the government’s letter signed by joint secretary Vivek Agarwal to Darshan Pal, a senior leader representing the farm unions. Pal said the unions were not averse to talking but they could not “set a fresh date” for the talks because the proposals the government presented were “not acceptable”. “The government has to revise them because we rejected these proposals on December 5,” he said. “It’s clearly been a classic standoff. No one wants to blink first at least on the core issue of discussing a possible repeal or suspension of the laws, which the farmers want. I believe the talks can still be revived if the government can bring a model to compensate farmers for lower prices of produce, if not a law on MSP,” said RS Manu, a retired economist of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-discuss-with-open-mind-govt-again-writes-to-farmers/story-shoF7zyrmr73kJfVcZep0N.html

The Indian Army is committed to ethical conduct of operations. ”The army had ordered a Court of Inquiry earlier this year after reports appeared on social media that three youths, labelled as terrorists, had been gunned down by its personnel.The Court of Inquiry, which completed its probe earlier in September, had found “prima facie” evidence that troops had “exceeded” powers under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (Afspa) during the July 18 encounter in which three men were killed. Following this, the army had initiated disciplinary proceedings.Officials in know of the development said the two army personnel may face court martial proceedings for violating the powers vested under the Afspa and not following the Dos and Don’ts of Chief of Army Staff as approved by the Supreme Court.They also said the role of the three civilians as well as the person who had allegedly led the army to the men needs to be thoroughly examined by the police. The three civilians killed in Amshipura were Imtiyaz Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed and Mohammed Ibrar, hailing from Rajouri district. Their identities were subsequently confirmed through a DNA test. The bodies were handed over to their families in October.Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha had met the families of the three men and assured them the UT government will ensure that justice is done in the case.

He applies the breaks, gets off the seat and looks around, as if searching for an address. A carrier for a food delivery application, he has to hand over “South Indian thali” to a subscriber in the vicinity. He chats on the mobile and waits on the spot for the person to appear. Meanwhile, he has a spare moment to confirm that indeed, he is as young as he looks—even in his masked appearance.“I’m 18.”At this stage in life, many people are applying for colleges and thinking of a career, but Pratikansh has “problems at home.” Even so, he has enrolled himself in a “BA programming” course, while working on the side.And this is already the second half of his working day. Pratikansh works as a delivery man daily from 2pm to 10pm, and spends the day’s earlier part helping his mother with her “chhota mota (small-time)” job. “Papa is a plumber.” The family lives in nearby Paharganj and “my earnings help everyone survive the month,” he states.The young man often gets anxious about catching the coronavirus infection, since the nature of his job entails interactions with dozens of unknown people every day, “but I’m very careful, and then whatever is to happen will happen.”May be his dream will happen.“I want to be a representative in pharmacy... that job can change my life.”Pratikansh has other restaurant pickups and deliveries to manage before going back home. He pedals about 40km daily, he says. He starts his shift with lunch at home. “Today mummy had made aloo paratha... tonight she’s making shalgam (turnip) chukandar (beetroot) ki subzi.”And now the customer appears to claim her meal.

25-12-2020||India||‘Breach of privilege’ notice against Kejriwal||Rajya Sabha member Sonal Mansingh has filed notice for a breach of privilege motion against Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for remarking in the state assembly on December 17 that the three farm bills had been passed in the Upper House of Parliament without the legislation being put to vote.The notice, filed on Wednesday, will be taken up by the chairperson of the Rajya Sabha and sent to the Delhi assembly for action, if the chairperson feels it warrants action, a person aware of the details said on condition of anonymity.The Rajya Sabha in September passed three farm bills with the proceedings of the House conducted amid uproar as Opposition parties protested against the legislation.Expressing support for farmers who are protesting against the farm laws, Kejriwal on December 17 tore up the farm laws on the floor of the assembly and said: “What was the hurry to get farm laws passed in Parliament during the pandemic? It has perhaps happened for the first time that the three laws were passed without voting in Rajya Sabha…”Mansingh, a classical dancer who is a nominated member of the Upper House wrote, in a letter to the Rajya Sabha chairperson that the Delhi chief minister’s statement “is not only a serious breach of privilege but also a blatant contempt of the House, which was a mischievous attempt to denigrate the character of the chairman, Rajya Sabha and the prestige of the upper house of Parliament of India”.HT contacted the CM’s office but they did not comment on the matter.According to a person aware of parliamentary procedure, a member of Parliament can move a breach of privilege motion against the Delhi CM. “In 1955 during a speaker’s conference it was decided that a motion of breach of privilege can be moved against another house,” the person said.Constitutional expert PDT Achary said tearing up laws that have been passed did not amount to breach of privilege. “The questions that arises is (whether) the act of tearing a law that has been passed in Parliament and received the President’s assent is a breach of privilege. And if the chairperson finds it so, then it is not for the RS to take action; it has to be dealt with by the Delhi Assembly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/breach-of-privilege-notice-against-kejriwal/story-wNvW7tuKv1S5SPlIsmkibK.html
25-12-2020||India||Police raid Delhi lawyer Mahmood Pracha appearing for riots accused||Confusion and controversy surrounded a hours-long police search at the office of a lawyer representing some of the accused in the north-east Delhi riots case. Delhi Police’s special cell on Thursday conducted searches at the office of senior advocate Mahmood Pracha at Nizamuddin in connection with a case filed against him. Pracha, however, filed a police complaint that imposters posing as police personnel visited his office and took information from his computers in pen drives. The police denied this, and said the search was by them and that they had a court order. A person from Pracha’s office, who did not wish to be named, said late on Thursday evening that police teams were still inside Pracha’s office.During the day, a video of police personnel in plainclothes inside Pracha’s office at Nizamuddin was circulated on social media, which shows Pracha remonstrating with police personnel that he could not give the information that the police were seeking. Police personnel can be heard telling him in the video that they have a court order allowing them to search his office. In response, Pracha is heard citing attorney-client privilege that bars him from revealing information that was saved in one of the computer systems and that while the police are free to scan the computers in his office but he himself would not share any details with them. The video also shows Pracha and the police arguing about the validity of the warrant. Pracha represents several people accused of perpetrating violence or conspiring to cause the riots that ravaged north-east Delhi in February. His clients include Bhim Sena chief Chandrashekhar Azad and Gulfisha Fatima.Pracha could not be reached for comment despite repeated calls to him and to his office. The person from his office cited above said that the police have seized the lawyer’s phone too. HT could not independently verify this. Delhi Police said that they visited Pracha’s office in connection to a case. On August 22, police registered an FIR against Pracha after one of the riot victims told a court that the lawyer has asked him to fake a deposition and frame three people in riot cases. Police had then told the court that they had filed a case against Pracha for giving false information to the court, cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy.At the time itself, Pracha denied the police’s allegations and said that the case was meant to intimidate him. Pracha was also a prominent face of the protests against the citizenship amendment law . In response to Pracha’s allegation about imposters raiding his office posing as police personnel, the police issued a statement on Thursday evening. It read: “During the course of a bail matter pertaining to an accused of the NED riots, use of a forged notary stamp and creation of allegedly false/manipulated evidence at the hands of certain members of the bar was noticed. The learned special court had observed that the same required thorough investigation. Pursuant to this, a criminal case under appropriate sections of law was registered and investigation was taken up.” Police said that during investigation, search warrants were obtained from court to look for electronic and other evidence at two places and that they were executing the same on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-raid-delhi-lawyer-mahmood-pracha-appearing-for-riots-accused/story-Y5NftIwWyRzFctVfKI8JhM.html
25-12-2020||India||‘Anti-farmer’: Congress asks for withdrawal of laws||A delegation of senior Congress leaders met President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday to demand a special session of Parliament to repeal three agriculture reform laws, with former party president Rahul Gandhi attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the contentious legislation.Thousands of farmers, mainly from northern India, have camped on the borders of Delhi since November 26 to protest against the laws they say will weaken their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of powerful agribusinesses.Eleven Opposition parties also released a statement and termed as “baseless” Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remark that Opposition leaders were lying to the farmers and misleading them. The statement also expressed solidarity with protesting farmers. The BJP rejected the charges and accused the Congress of using farmers for politicking. In the afternoon, Gandhi; leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad; and party leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury; met Kovind and handed over a memorandum signed by 20 million farmers seeking withdrawal of the three laws.“We told the President that the new agri laws are anti-farmer. The farmers and labourers will suffer due to this,” Gandhi said after the meeting. “I want to tell the PM that farmers are not going back home until the laws are taken back. The government should convene a joint session of Parliament and repeal them,” he added. During the march to Rashtrapati Bhavan, Delhi Police detained Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and other leaders and took them to Mandir Marg police station for violating prohibitory orders after they held a sit-in protest outside the party office at 24, Akbar Road. Rahul Gandhi, Azad and Chowhury were allowed to proceed. Three Congress-ruled states -- Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh -- have passed bills bypassing the central laws that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules. Gandhi said all Opposition parties stood in solidarity with farmers and alleged that Modi wanted to transfer the wealth of ordinary people to crony capitalists. “Whoever will try to stand against him will be called terrorist - be it farmers, labourers and even if [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief] Mohan Bhagwat stands against him, he too will be called a terrorist. Anyone trying to take power from him will be dubbed anti-national,” he said. He also attacked the authorities for blocking a protest march by Congress leaders to Rashtrapati Bhavan. “Democracy…. which country are you talking about? There is no democracy in India. It is in your imagination but not in reality,” he told reporters. In the memorandum, the Congress claimed 44 farmers lost their lives in the ongoing protests. The BJP hit back. “The country hasn’t forgotten what happened during Emergency days. Democracy has flourished in Prime Minister Modi’s term,” Union minister of state for agriculture Kailash Choudhary said. His party colleague and Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar accused the Congress of cheating farmers. “It is clear today that the Congress party is doing politics in the name of farmers,” he added. Javadekar also made light of Gandhi’s demands, saying Congress members obstruct Parliament when it is in session and do not take part in debates.The Opposition joint statement was signed by Rahul Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Sitaram Yechury of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary D Raja, Farooq Abdullah of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Akhilesh Yadav, TR Baalu of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav, Manoj Bhattacharya of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), Debabrata Biswas of the All India Forward Bloc (AIFB), and Dipankar Bhattacharya of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). “We register our strong protest against the baseless allegations being made by Prime Minister Modi, accusing the opposition parties of ‘repeatedly lying’ to the farmers about the new farm laws and using them for their politics. The Prime Minister’s accusations are a complete travesty of truth,” read the statement. It referred to a speech by Modi to farmers of Madhya Pradesh on December 18, when the Prime Minister had alleged that Opposition parties were misleading the farmers on laws that would benefit agriculture. Gandhi condemned the detention of the other Congress leaders by the police. “It is an assault on the idea of India. The government is stopping our MPs from moving out of our office. PM needs to realise that there is a limit to this,” Gandhi said. “China is sitting at the border and has snatched thousands of kilometres our land. But why does the PM not speak up on it? Why is he silent? He is making the country weak and outside forces are seeing it as an opportunity. The country is moving on a dangerous path and it will suffer,” he claimed. Priyanka Gandhi said the government was not ready to listen to farmers. “It is a sin to brand farmers as anti-nationals. If the government is terming farmers’ protest as sedition, it is a sin,” she told reporters. But Union minister of state Choudhary maintained that the new laws were good for farmers. “Rahul Gandhi doesn’t want the agitation to stop. Congress cadre won’t stop agitating but farmers will. We are interacting with farmers while Congress and other political parties are inciting them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anti-farmer-congress-asks-for-withdrawal-of-laws/story-moVx1SjvrqddBRxMFZBMjM.html
25-12-2020||India||Reading the clues from Covaxin early trial data||Bharat Biotech, which is among the frontrunners in the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine in India, released new data from phase 1/2 clinical trials. The vaccine is still being tested for efficacy – whether it can prevent Sars-Cov-2 infections – but the data shows it is progressing well. A look at the key indicators and how it might compare with some other candidates.Bharat Biotech’s coronavirus vaccine candidate, jointly developed with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), passed the two crucial tests in clinical trials – showing it was safe and triggered an immune response – according to early stage analysis released on Wednesday. The Phase 1/2 data showed that levels of neutralising antibodies in those who received the vaccine -- called Covaxin -- were similar to those who recovered from a natural infection. This level was at its peak at 42 days after the second dose, with a dip seen at 104 days. Among all participants in the early phase who received the vaccine, 98.3% “sero-converted” (that is, they developed an antibody response). But how do these numbers compare with other leading vaccine candidates whose data has been released? The comparison can be made in two ways: drawing parallels with other candidates that use the same method to train a person’s immunity, or by comparing some of the parameters with the leading candidates already approved.Bharat Biotech’s Coovaxin is based on an inactivated virus, and for the first method of comparison, there are four others in late-stage trials that it can be compared. All four of these are being developed by Chinese companies but only one, Sinovac’s Coronavac, has carried out an analysis that can be picked up for comparison.At the outset, it appears that the Indian candidate may be comparable or even slightly better than its rival on some parameters. When people were given both doses of Covaxin, 98.4% of them developed antibodies compared at day 56 to 100% at day 28 after the two-dose regimen in the Coronavac trial, according to phase 2 trial data released by both.  The difference was more stark when it came to how strong the level of antibody response was. In the case of Covaxin, volunteers showed levels similar to those who had a natural infection from Sars-Cov-2 and recovered. But in the case of Coronavac, this level was roughly a third of what was seen in recovered individuals.To be sure, there could still be some variations in test methods used by researchers and the studies were held separately, in different populations, that do not lend to like-for-like comparisons. But the proportion of people who develop an antibody response and the comparison of antibody levels with recovered (convalescent) people are relative parameters that can be used to loosely compare vaccine performance.Sinovac and Bharat Biotech both judged their vaccines on these parameters, while the three other inactivated virus platform candidates in late-stage trials (two of them are by Sinopharm and the third by Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences) have not compared antibody levels to convalescent patients.While the Indian and the Chinese candidates have a platform overlap and both use a two-dose regimen, they also have some differences. The Chinese Coronavac, for instance, requires a booster shot at 14 days while the Indian one was at day 28. The two vaccine candidates also use different adjuvants -- ingredients that are used to help create a stronger immune response. Coronavac uses aluminium, which is a commonly used adjuvant, while Covaxin incorporates a proprietary adjuvant called Algel-IMDG.  The second method of comparison is to take into account the number of antibodies developed after people were given the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. In Moderna’s case, 100% of the people developed antibodies and the levels were over twice as the levels seen in convalescent individuals. In case of the Pfizer and BioNTech inoculation too, 100% of individuals developed antibodies and this level was close to four times. Both these numbers are far ahead of Covaxin and Coronavac.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reading-the-clues-from-covaxin-early-trial-data/story-IdDtQaiU0f6q1PH98sIpgL.html
25-12-2020||India||Delhi air toxic for third straight day||Delhi’s air quality remained in “severe” zone for the third consecutive day on Thursday as slow wind speed facilitated accumulation of pollutants, once gain putting under the scanner measures taken by authorities to mitigate the public health crisis that has become an annual occurrence every winter.The conditions led several experts to question what the newly formed Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi-NCR had achieved in mitigating the crisis, and what it was doing differently from the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, or EPCA, that it effectively replaced.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of Delhi stood at 423 at 4pm on Thursday, marginally better than Wednesday’s 433 but worse than Tuesday’s 418. Before this, Delhi’s air quality last touched the “severe zone” on December 5, when the 24-hour average AQI was 404. In several air quality monitoring stations in Delhi, including those in RK Puram, Alipur, ITO, Rohini, Okhla Phase-II, Bawana, Mundka and Anand Vihar, the average AQI remained over 450 on Thursday. Neighbouring satellite towns such as Ghaziabad (440), Noida (441) and Faridabad (408), too, recorded severely polluted air during the day, while the air in Gurugram (361) was “very poor”. An AQI of 201 to 300 is considered “poor”. A reading of 301 to 400 is in “very poor” category and associated with respiratory illnesses, especially in children and those exposed to the bad air. An AQI of 400-500 is considered “severe”. With the recent spike in pollution levels in Delhi-NCR, CAQM directed government agencies on Wednesday to ensure strict pollution control measures in the city were being followed. On the commission’s direction, CPCB has issued an order to keep hot mix plants and stone crushes shut till January 2.The body — constituted on November 5 under an ordinance promulgated in October — also directed the Delhi Pollution Control Board (DPCC) and the city’s municipalities to step up enforcement by increasing water sprinkling and mechanised sweeping in their respective jurisdictions.But experts said the formation of a commission will not help unless corrective measures are ensured. “First, we had EPCA, which had not done much to ensure a holistic solution for the perpetual problem of pollution the northern India belt. Now this new commission is doing nothing different. It has been three days since Delhi and NCR (National Capital Region) towns are reeling under severe pollution, but there has been no proactive step from the commission apart from tokenism. We can make a hundred bodies, but what is the use if we continue to breathe dangerous levels of pollution,” said Sushmita Banerjee, an air pollution management and policy researcher. CAQM chief MM Kutty did not respond to calls and messages till the filing of this report. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast that after recording a minimum temperature of 4.5 degrees Celsius at the Safdarjung observatory on Thursday, the temperature is likely to increase by a few notches from Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-air-toxic-for-third-straight-day/story-OEtLHxd81VVzAQPBuxLDvO.html

The mutated strain of SARS-CoV-2 reported from the UK has higher transmission capacity as compared to the earlier strains,” said Mohapatra in his letter to district collectors and municipal authorities.Meanwhile, the sample of the 34-year-old man who had tested positive for Covid-19 has been sent to NIV Pune for genome sequencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-last-2-weeks-43-people-have-returned-to-odisha-from-uk/story-SDZAA71D7wmap2k7dE83JK.html
25-12-2020||India||Akhada Parishad to send list of ‘self-styled godmen’ to Uttarakhand CM to bar them from Mahakumbh||With less than a month left for next year’s Mahakumbh, Akhada Parishad has warned against the entry of fake shankaracharyas and self-styled godmen in Haridwar for the mega religious congregation beginning in January. Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, the apex body of the all the Akhadas, has decided to prepare a list of such fake saints and self-styled godmen and send it to Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat so that they don’t get any recognition and facilities during the Kumbh through Kumbh Mela administration. Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad president Mahant Narendra Giri Maharaj citing the recent demand of so called Gayatri Triveni Prayagpeeth pontiff Trikal Bhavanta Saraswati to get land allocation and other facilities for the Kumbh mela tenure said that no fake saints will be allowed to enter the Kumbh zone. Citing the centuries old tradition of Sanatan Dharma of having only four revered Shankaracharyas namely the ones for Jyotirmath, Badrinath, Dwarka,Jagganath and Puri, Narendra Giri said that the state government should keep in mind that only four Shankaracharyas of these holy seats be given so-called status, recognition, land allocation and other facilities during the four-month long Mahakumbh. Cautioning the Kumbh Mela administration to not get influenced by such fake saints, Akhada Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj said that from their level they are apprising the state government and Mela administration officials about the real and fake saints. “We have sought names of such fake saints from across the country and as we get them, we will discuss and take a decision accordingly in our meeting. We have already urged CM Trivendra Singh Rawat and Kumbh Mela officer-in-charge Deepak Rawat to ensure fake saints don’t get entry and privileges during Mahakumbh,” said Akhada Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj. Mela administration additional Mela officer Harbeer Singh said that allocation of land to Akhadas for Mahakumbh has commenced and respective Akhadas are being handed documents in this regard with the whole process being done in consultation with Akhada Parishad. Notably, earlier in 2018 the Akhada Parishad had released in four phases list of more than two dozen “fake saints” ahead of Prayagraj Kumbh held last year to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. On the same lines, the Akhada Parishad is compiling the list of fake saints ahead of Haridwar Mahakumbh to be submitted to Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat. “In recent times a large number of incidents of self-appointed, fake or controversial godmen ,pontiffs, Jagadgurus and Shankaracharyas have come into light .Even in previous 2010 Mahakumbh fake Shankaracharyas issue had come to fore. So, it is good that Akhada Parishad is taking up this issue ahead of Mahakumbh 2021,” said Mahamandaleshwar Harichetnanand Maharaj of Shri Panchayati Akhada Bada Udasin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhada-parishad-to-send-list-of-self-styled-godmen-to-uttarakhand-cm-to-bar-them-from-mahakumbh/story-IWXrrOjr3FDYg6lXwsyHRO.html
25-12-2020||India||PM Modi to talk to Kerala church leaders to sort out issues, says Mizoram Governor||With differences between two Christian factions in Kerala, Orthodox and Jacobite, widening, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will talk to both groups next week along with others to find a lasting solution to some issues, said Mizoram Governor P S Sreedharan Pillai in Kozhikode. The Governor, also hailing from Kerala, said he had briefed the PM about all issues and sought his intervention to help solve them. He said leaders of both factions will be met separately and later there will be a joint meeting. He said he will also discuss the issue with Home Minister Amit Shah. The growing friction between the two factions has invited enough embarrassment for the community and often created big law and order problems in the state. Earlier Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan also tried to broker peace between two but failed to make much headway as both sides stuck to their stands. “There is a complaint that central funds for minority welfare are not distributed proportionately between different communities in the state. The Church has been raising its concern in this regard for quite some time. So the PM will hear their woes also,” Pillai said. All denominations of the Church have welcomed the latest development. “We hope the PM’s intervention will help us get justice,” said Jacobite church trustee Joseph Mar Gregorios. “We are ready to go by any agreement that is bound by law of the land and decision of the apex court,” said Orthodox Church secretary Biju Oommen. Recently, a tiff between the two spilled over to the streets inviting enough embarrassment for believers. Jacobites and Orthodox denominations of the Malankara Syrian Church have been fighting for the control of 2000- odd churches and their rich coffers for more than two decades. In 2017, the Supreme Court had upheld the 1934 constitution of Malankara church and gave the Orthodox group control over more than 1000 parishes and churches in Kerala but Jacobites, who were controlling majority of these shrines, were not ready to give up. Orthodox is an indigenous group but Jacobites have more followers. The Malankara Syrian church has two factions-- Orthodox, which is headquartered in Kottayam, and Jacobites, who consider the Patriarch of Antioch, based in Beirut, as their supreme leader. Both factions differ in their leadership but they share the same rites of worship and have a long-standing rivalry that goes back to 1912, when the Malankara church split into two, Orthodox and Jacobites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-talk-to-kerala-church-leaders-to-sort-out-issues-says-mizoram-governor/story-aDXm3n25LRlq4FseFxuCvK.html
25-12-2020||India||Zydus Cadila seeks Phase 3 clinical trials approval for its Covid-19 vaccine||Pharma major Zydus Cadila has approached the national drugs regulator, seeking approval to start phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine candidate against the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), that has proven to be safe for use. In a statement issued on Thursday, the company informed that it had submitted the phase II/II trials data of its plasmid DNA vaccine candidate, ZyCov-D, to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), Dr VG Somani. The vaccine has been found to be safe and immunogenic, claims the company. “…ZyCoV-D was found to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic in the Phase I/II clinical trials. The company is now planning to initiate Phase III clinical trial in around 30,000 volunteers upon receiving necessary approvals,” the company said in a statement. The Phase II study of the vaccine candidate had been conducted in over 1000 healthy adult volunteers as part of the adaptive Phase I/II dose escalation, multi-centric, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study. The trial has been reviewed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and reports have been submitted to Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) regularly for the update on safety outcome. “After establishing safety in Phase I clinical trial, ZyCoV-D has now completed Phase II clinical trials and the vaccine has been found to be safe and immunogenic. We are optimistic of Phase III clinical trial outcomes as well and that we would be able to start the production of the Novel Vaccine on its successful completion. I would like to thank all the volunteers who have participated in the study so far and helped us in evaluating the vaccine to fight COVID-19,” said Pankaj R. Patel, chairman of the Zydus Group, in a statement. With ZyCoV-D, the company has successfully established the DNA vaccine platform in the country. The platform is also known to show much improved vaccine stability thus requiring lower cold chain requirements. This makes the vaccine ideal for access in remotest regions of the country. Administered through the intradermal route, it also allows for the ease of administration. Further, the platform also provides ease of manufacturing the vaccine with minimal biosafety requirements (BSL-1). “…the platform can be rapidly used to modify the vaccine in couple of weeks in case the virus mutates to ensure that the vaccine still elicits protection. The plasmid DNA when introduced into the host cells would be translated into the viral protein and will elicit a strong immune response mediated by the cellular and humoral arms of the human immune system, which play a vital role in protection from disease as well as viral clearance,” the company statement further read. In its Covid-19 vaccine development initiative, Zydus has been supported by national biopharma mission, biotechnology industry research assistance council, department of biotechnology, Indian council of medical research, and national institute of virology, Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-cadila-seeks-phase-3-clinical-trials-approval-for-its-covid-19-vaccine/story-cmKv9G4xmL8t1MtZgDQ4zL.html

It is an auspicious occasion to promote freedom, language, art, culture, tourism. This has been done under the Dekho Apna Desh initiative to encourage people to see their own country,” Culture Minister Prahlad Patel said in a tweet.However, the order states that the applicants or agencies have to apply for permission to carry out shooting activities as under Rule 43 of the AMASR Rules, 1959. It also states that the director general, if satisfied that the licence asked for should not be granted, may for reasons to be recorded refuse to grant the same.“The exemption will be provided to the applicants/agencies specifically working on the areas of the Indian independence movement, life of a freedom fighter, sacrifices in the freedom movement, Indian tradition and culture, promotion of national language, folk arts/folk language, heritage of Indian tourism development and promotion and other issues relating to national importance,” the order issued by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) states.However, the applicants will have to pay a refundable security deposit, applicable for the filming of centrally-protected monuments and sites.“Except the 27 world heritage sites, at the other sites, filming will be free. This is to promote lesser known sites, encourage people to film at these sites and promote places within the country,” said Nitin Tripathi, Media Advisor, Ministry of Culture.The ASI has 3,692 centrally-protected monuments under it and the fee for filming at the these locations is Rs 50,000 per day per site, which is non-refundable, and Rs 10,000 as security deposit, which is refundable.Patel had earlier reduced the time taken to give permissions for filming at these monuments to 20 days, which earlier used to take months, and also brought down the filming fee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/filming-of-centrally-protected-monuments-will-be-free-from-dec-25-to-aug-15/story-AAavoDMzOYrRqtqzAgm4QM.html
25-12-2020||India||India questions China’s delay in releasing ships||India on Thursday said foreign vessels had been allowed to enter Chinese ports and discharge their cargo in the months during which two ships with dozens of Indian crew members were prevented from doing so on the grounds of Covid-19-related restrictions. According to the external affairs ministry, a total of 39 Indian crew members of two cargo vessels have been stranded in waters off the Chinese ports of Jingtang and Caofeidian for weeks as the authorities haven’t allowed the ships to discharge their cargo. Other reports have said there are more Indian crew members on some 20 vessels stuck outside Chinese ports. The situation is believed to be the outcome of a China-Australia trade row as most of these vessels are carrying Australian coal. Reports have said some 400 seafarers and about two million tons of Australian coal are stuck on vessels outside Chinese ports. “We understand that some other ships, which arrived after the Indian ships arrived, have actually managed to discharge cargo and leave. The reasons for this are not clear,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. He said there were 23 Indian crew members on the bulk cargo vessel MV Jag Anand, in anchorage near Jingtang port in Hebei province since June 13. Another 16 Indian crew members were on the MV Anastasia, in anchorage near Caofeidian port since September 20. Both vessels are waiting to discharge cargo. Both Jag Anand and Anastasia are carrying Australian coal. Chinese customs haven’t cleared Jag Anand’s cargo and local authorities haven’t allowing the crew to leave the vessel, citing Covid-19-related restrictions. The vessel’s charterer has refused to allow it to sail to another port to relieve the crew. Anastasia’s second officer, Gaurav Singh, told Australia’s ABC News that mental health issues, lack of medical support and a decline in drinking water quality had compounded the problems of the crew. Srivastava said: “This unprecedented situation has caused a considerable amount of stress among the crew. Our embassy in Beijing has been in constant touch with provincial and central government authorities in China. They are requesting that the ships be allowed to discharge their cargos and the crew members be allowed to be changed.” Chinese authorities have said crew change is not permitted at Jintang and Caofeidian ports because of Covid-19-related restrictions imposed by local authorities, he added. China’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday necessary assistance was being provided to the Indian crew members. Srivastava said the Indian mission in Beijing will remain in touch with Chinese authorities to “seek their facilitation and assistance which can lead to an early resolution of the issue and help ameliorate the situation of the crew”. This development also comes against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh sector, which has taken bilateral ties to an all-time low. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday that local authorities are in communication with the Indian side and provided assistance “while meeting certain quarantine and epidemic prevention requirements”. However, there was no indication when the Indian seafarers will be allowed to leave their vessels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-questions-china-s-delay-in-releasing-ships/story-c6qcoTc7aigBlYtMA9odkK.html
25-12-2020||India||Pak court sentences Hafiz Saeed to 15 yrs in jail in terror funding case||Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed, blamed by India for masterminding the 2008 Mumbai attacks, was on Thursday given a jail term of fifteen-and-half years in a terror financing case by a Pakistani court, his fourth conviction this year on similar charges. This was the longest prison sentence awarded so far to the Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) chief in the five cases that have been decided against him by the anti-terrorism court in Lahore. Though the prison terms in these cases cumulatively add up to 36 years, he will serve the sentences concurrently. The court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 200,000 on Saeed, 70, who is being held in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. However, reports have suggested he is being provided preferential treatment in the prison, including access to special facilities and visitors. Saeed’s latest conviction comes in the run-up to Pakistan’s efforts to counter terror financing being reassessed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) early next year. In October, the multilateral watchdog retained Pakistan in its “grey list” for failing to fully deliver on an action plan to fight terror financing, giving it time till February to address what it said were “very serious deficiencies”. FATF president Marcus Pleyer cautioned that Pakistan wouldn’t be given a chance “forever” to address outstanding issues, and said repeated failure to deliver on the action plan would result in a country being put in the “black list”. A court official in Lahore was quoted by PTI as saying: “On Thursday, an anti-terrorism court of Lahore sentenced five leaders of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, including its chief Hafiz Saeed, in another terror financing case...for 15-and-half years.” The others convicted by the court were all close aides of Saeed – JuD spokesperson Yahya Mujahid, Zafar Iqbal, Hafiz Abdus Salam and Muhammad Ashraf. The court also gave a six-month prison term to Saeed’s brother-in-law Abdul Rahman Makki and fined him Pakistani Rs 200,000, the court official said. Saeed and the others were brought to the court amid tight security and media wasn’t allowed into the courtroom. In November, Saeed was given two separate five-year prison terms under provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act for using and providing funds for acts of terrorism in two cases of terror financing. He was also given a six-month prison term for being a member of a banned group. Saeed was also given two sentences of five-and-a-half-years in February. It was earlier thought he would serve only about five years in jail as all the sentences were to run concurrently. However, Thursday’s verdict means he will serve up to 15-and-half years. A total of 41 cases were registered last year against JuD leaders by the Counter-Terrorism Department of Pakistan’s Punjab province, and 28 of them have been decided so far. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the action being taken against Saeed is largely because of pressure on Pakistan from Western powers and FATF to crack down on UN-designated terror groups and individuals as well as terror financing, including prosecution of those funnelling funds to terrorists. Saeed’s repeated conviction in five cases this year is also being seen as his diminishing utility to Pakistan’s powerful military establishment, which has for long had connections with LeT, JuD and other front organisations set up by him, such as the Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-court-sentences-hafiz-saeed-to-15-yrs-in-jail-in-terror-funding-case/story-oeHN1ZbTPUJkMEMpjZ0ulI.html
25-12-2020||India||Covid-19: Vaccine may be available at pharmacies||Depending on the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines available by the second quarter of 2021, experts making vaccine-related decisions are considering making shots available for private use for those who can afford to pay even as inoculation of the vulnerable population is expected to begin early next year once a candidate is finalised. The prices may be subsidised in private markets, said an expert from the team, requesting anonymity. However, the move will be subject to grant of regulatory approvals to the Covid-19 vaccine candidates. “This is something that was also done for the influenza vaccine; those who can pay are allowed to access the vaccine in private (market) with certain riders,” another senior official in the government, who too spoke condition of anonymity, said. He is also a part of the vaccine delivery process. The government had earlier announced that India targets to vaccinate at least 300 million high-risk people by July next year. It is currently drafting a list of beneficiaries that includes about 30 million health care and frontline workers for the first phase. Currently, clinical trials data of two vaccine candidates — Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca being manufactured in India by Serum Institute of India— are being examined by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). The three vaccine candidates whose emergency use authorisation (EUA) applications are before the national drugs regulator are: Pfizer-BioNTech, Serum Institute of India’s Oxford-AstraZeneca, and Bharat Biotech-Indian Council of Medical Research. Director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS),Delhi, said that EUA is likely to be granted by the end of this year or early next year. “The way things appear right now, necessary regulatory approvals are likely to come either at the end of this year or by early next year,” said Dr Guleria in an interview to a television channel on Thursday. “For Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, there is not just Serum’s trial data from India, but also AstraZeneca’s UK trials data to go by,” he added. While Pfizer had not showed up to present its case in the last meeting of the subject expert committee (SEC) on December 9, experts had sought additional data from the other two companies that had applied for EUA- Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech. Serum submitted the data on Monday, and Pfizer is also ready to present its case and has sought a fresh date from the drugs regulator. The regulator is examining the data before it allocates a date for an SEC to convene. Bharat Biotech, however, is yet to come back to CDSCO with fresh data. Several Covid-19 vaccine candidates around the world are currently undergoing advanced phase 3 clinical trials to establish efficacy of the vaccine candidate. The emergency use authorisation is usually based on preliminary phase 3 data. For market use authorisation, regulators seek full trial data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-may-be-available-at-pharmacies/story-b7NoAjCmdqN43D5EEOH8AM.html
25-12-2020||India||Covid-19: Vaccination dry run to be held in 4 states next week||The Centre has chosen eight districts in four states to conduct a dry run of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccination next week. The states that will witness the two-day dry run on December 28-29 are Punjab, Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.“The dry run is being conducted to mobilise all elements involved in Covid-19 vaccination drive that is planned for next year to test the vaccine delivery machinery. All elements except for the vaccine will be mobilized,” said a senior official in the Union ministry of health and family welfare, requesting anonymity.Five sites in each of the two districts in a state are likely to be established for the purpose of vaccinating beneficiaries. “Two districts each from all these four states have been identified where this dry run will be conducted simultaneously on these two days,” confirmed another official in the health ministry who too did not want to be named.The dry run will include testing for cold storage and transportation arrangements for the vaccine, managing crowd at session sites with proper physical distancing, and role of vaccinators and other staff on vaccine related duty.Special focus will be to check how possible adverse events following immunisation will be dealt with as each session site will have a designated health care facility linked to it to treat people who may develop any discomfort or uneasiness post vaccination, and also how infection control practices will be adhered to during vaccination at the session site so that it doesn’t become ground for disease transmission.Preparations have been on in full swing for the past five months for Covid-19 vaccine delivery so that no time is wasted in managing logistics when a vaccine is available for use in the country.To supervise and assist in Covid-19 vaccine delivery process, a multi-level governance mechanism has been established across all states and Union Territories. There are three types of committees: two at the state level and one at the district level. All these committees have been meeting regularly to chalk out the vaccine delivery plan at the ground level.Specific training modules have been drafted for medical officers, vaccinators, alternate vaccinators, cold chain handlers, supervisors, data managers, ASHA coordinators and all others involved in the implementation process at different levels.As per current estimates, the Centre will be using 29,000 cold chain points, 240 walk-in coolers, 70 walk-in freezers, 45,000 ice-lined refrigerators, 41, 000 deep freezers, and 300 solar refrigerators across the country for storage and delivery of vaccines. All these equipment have already been provided to states based on their individual requirement.“This is going to be one of the largest vaccination drives, with a lot at stake. It is important to have all checks and balances in place before the actual process begins,” said the first official cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-dry-run-to-be-held-in-4-states-next-week/story-Bq3Qvo4wDOjTZuurKUNeaO.html
25-12-2020||India||‘Till lotus blooms’: Suvendu Adhikari says won’t sleep till BJP wins Bengal||“I will not sleep till the lotus blooms,” Suvendu Adhikari, the newest Bengal strongman of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), vowed at a massive rally in Kanthi, his hometown in East Midnapore district, on Thursday evening, a day after he was branded a “traitor” at a Trinamool Congress (TMC) roadshow in the same town. Union home minister Amit Shah welcomed Adhikari, a former TMC heavyweight, into the BJP, of which lotus is the election symbol, on December 19 as the ruling party strives to extend its political base in West Bengal ahead of assembly elections next year. “They (TMC) claim Mamata Banerjee will contest the elections alone and she has put in place the next generation of leadership. If that is true, then why is she sending ministers to Midnapore? She, too, will address a rally at Nandigram on January 7. I know what she is going to say. I will hold a rally in Nandigram the very next day and give her a befitting reply,” said Adhikari. So massive was the turnout that the tableau carrying Adhikari and two state BJP leaders could move only a few inches a minute. It took the tableau more than three hours to cover the five-kilometre route leading to the rally ground. “The overwhelming response has convinced me that I took the right decision by joining the BJP. People of Bengal want change....democracy is for the people and of the people, not for the party and by the party,” said Adhikari, who referred to himself as bhoomiputra (son of the soil). Singling out TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy and urban development minister Firhad Hakim, the two leaders who addressed Wednesday’s rally, Adhikari ridiculed them, even challenged the chief minister and took potshots at her nephew Abhishek Banerjee. He even accused state finance minister Amit Mitra of failing to generate employment and instead generating revenue by allowing the sale of licensed country liquor in cheaper plastic pouches. “She (Mamata Banerjee) will come second in the race. Is baar, do sau paar (this time around we will score more than 200),” Adhikari told the local media on his way to the rally ground, repeating Shah’s announcement that the BJP will win more than 200 of the state’s 294 assembly seats in the polls due in about five months. “The TMC need not hold rallies in my district to stop me from going elsewhere in Bengal. The more they attack me the more will be the losses they suffer in East and West Midnapore districts. I will address a rally in West Midnapore on Sunday. My home is Bengal. My country is India,” said Adhikari. Adhikari’s followers raised a unique slogan, “Hare Krishna Hare Hare, BJP ghare ghare,” implying that the BJP has entered every home with the chant Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the 15th Century Hindu saint, composed for disciples of Lord Krishna. “Sri Chaitanya spread the message of universal love, hence this slogan. We are paying homage to Purushottam Ram and Sri Chaitanya at the same time,” said Adhikari. That the TMC has targeted Adhikari as its prime political enemy became evident on Wednesday when clashes took place between BJP and TMC workers in the district’s Ramnagar area. The rally was organised by Akhil Giri, the TMC lawmaker from Ramnagar and a known detractor of Adhikari. On Tuesday, Adhikari addressed his first rally as a BJP leader alongside the party’s state president Dilip Ghosh in Burdwan district. The ruling party hit back on Wednesday on Adhikari’s own turf. “The crowd was much bigger at our roadshow. Kanthi was never a BJP bastion. The people always voted for the TMC. We will win the seat once again,” Saugata Roy, who led Wednesday’s roadshow, said on Thursday. Adhikari accused Roy of winning the Barrackpore Lok Sabha seat in 1977 through rigging and then demanding Indira Gandhi’s arrest. “He changed his stance again and shifted his allegiance to Indira Gandhi,” he said. “I had political reasons to oppose Indira Gandhi and later realized that we need her. As far as the allegation about rigging is concerned, no court nullified the polls,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suvendu-won-t-sleep-till-bjp-wins-bengal/story-IU6NH6wQ0Ms48HqLXJIeLO.html
25-12-2020||India||India calls for holding early talks on LAC||India on Thursday again called for holding the next meeting of Indian and Chinese military commanders at an “early date” so that the two sides can work towards complete disengagement of troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The two sides have been unable to make a breakthrough in the nearly eight-month standoff in Ladakh sector of the LAC despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks, though external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said these discussions had resulted in better understanding of each other’s positions. He said a meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs was held on December 18 and the two sides had agreed the next or ninth round of talks between senior military commanders “should be held at an early date so that both sides can work towards an early and complete disengagement of troops along the LAC”. The disengagement should be in line with existing bilateral agreements and protocols and “fully restore peace and tranquillity”, Srivastava said. He added that India and China continue to maintain communications through diplomatic and military channels. Tens of thousands of troops from both countries have dug in for the winter at key friction points along the LAC in eastern Ladakh after the two sides were unable to agree on modalities for disengagement and de-escalation. On Wednesday, Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane visited forward areas in eastern Ladakh, including sites on the south bank of Pangong Lake where Indian troops have occupied strategic heights, and reviewed the prepared of forces. Among the areas visited by Naravane was Rechin La, where Indian troops occupied strategic heights during August 29-30 to pre-empt moves by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to unilaterally change the status quo along the LAC. Last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh said India has the strength to give an appropriate response to any transgression or unilateral action on the borders but believes in finding a peaceful solution to conflicts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-calls-for-holding-early-talks-on-lac/story-ZCps60AD8QG8JjraDDHVQP.html
25-12-2020||India||UP: Case lodged, ABVP apologises after ruckus over Jain idol||Jain community leaders have demanded the immediate arrest of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activists who, they alleged, entered the Digambar Jain College in Baghpat district’s Baraut town on Tuesday and threatened to remove an idol of Shrutdevi, the Jain goddess of knowledge.The police did not register a case immediately against the activists although a complaint was lodged by college principal Virendra Singh the same day, they added. On Thursday, Baghpat superintendent of police Abhishek Singh said that the case was registered against those named in the complaint by college principal Dr Virendra Singh and some unidentified activists under Sections 147, 504, 506 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code. He attributed the delay in registering the case to police engagement in dealing with the ongoing farmers’ protest in Baraut.Apologising for the outfit’s action, ABVP’s Baghpat district coordinator Ankur Chaudhary said, “We tender our apology to the Digambar Jain community and what occurred was due to our ignorance. No protest would be held in the future regarding the idol of Goddess Shrutdevi.” Earlier, Ajay Kumar Sharma, the station house officer of Baraut police station said the ABVP activists were confused over the idol of the Jain goddess. They thought the Jains had modified an image of the Hindu goddess Saraswati he added.He also claimed the matter was “sorted out”. “The matter has been sorted out in a meeting between both sides.”Amit Rai Jain, a leader of Jain community, claimed that no meeting has happened between the two sides. He said the police were “spreading lies” because the matter concerned ABVP, an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), ideological mentor of the rulng Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).He said a meeting of the community’s elders in Baraut on Wednesday decided to demand the immediate arrest of the ABVP activists and safety of the Shrutdevi idol on the premises of Digambar Jain College as well as the safety of other Jain temples and statues in western Uttar Pradesh .The community organised a march in the town and handed over a list of their demands to the college principal and management committee. “Jain community is a minority and the incident has filled us with insecurity in the town and in other parts of western UP,” Amit Rai Jain, who was also a participant in the meeting, said.A group of ABVP activists allegedly entered the college premises on Tuesday and locked classrooms and the principal’s office. They then went to the temple of the goddess Shrutdevi, which was installed on the college premises in 2016. The activists demanded that statue be shifted, saying they would remove it themselves if the college didn’t.Amit Rai Jain said the incident had angered the Jain community in the entire region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/u-p-case-lodged-abvp-apologises-after-ruckus-over-jain-idol/story-YONevRciZQCpsX2VMJ5O7H.html
25-12-2020||India||Fresh Shigella case detected in north Kerala||A new case of the shigella bacterial infection was reported from north Kerala on Thursday, a couple of days after the state health department claimed the disease had been contained effectively.The shigella outbreak came to light last week after the death of an 11-year-old boy in Kozhikode district. At least 30 people were diagnosed with infection, but they recovered after a few days and health officials said the infection had been contained. District medical officer V Jayashree said a one-and-a-half year old boy who contracted the infection was responding well to treatment. She said the boy, who belongs to Ferokke, had been suffering from diarrhoea for many days; tests revealed that he had been infected by shigella. She said samples of the parents were also sent for tests and the source of pathogen wasn’t known. According to medical experts, the shigella bacteria triggers an infection called shigellosis, which is usually mild, but it can be serious in patients with comorbid conditions. They said the bacteria, after entering the body either through contaminated water or through stale food, attacks the epithelial lining of the colon, triggering inflammation of the cells. In most cases, patients may experience diarrhoea and fever, symptoms that subside after sometime. Children below 10 years are prone to contracting the infection, experts said. Those changing the diapers of babies ought to wash their hands properly, and while swimming it was advisable not to sip or gargle water. Boiled water, home- cooked food and personal hygiene are advised by doctors to keep the bacteria away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-shigella-case-detected-in-north-kerala/story-VO2Por45VcstI7dZliJtMO.html
25-12-2020||India||No new articles on Sci Hub, Libgen till Jan 6 over copyright infringement: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday restrained Sci Hub and Libgen, two online repositories providing free access to paywalled research, from uploading, publishing or making available any article till January 6 on a plea by three global academic publishers, Elsevier Ltd., Wiley India Pvt. Ltd. and American Chemical Society, claiming copyright infringement. The case against Sci Hub and Libgen, which store 84 million and 80 million articles and papers, respectively is a significant case in India many experts say has the potential to shape intellectual property rights law in India. Elsevier publishes the Lancet and Cell journals among 2,500 others, Wiley publishes 1,700 journals, and the American Chemical Society is one of the world’s largest scientific societies that also publishes the prestigious Journal of the American Chemical Society. Elsevier successfully sued Sci Hub for the same reason in the US in 2015 and the American Chemical Society did so, again successfully, in 2017. Advocate Nilesh Jain, appearing for Sci Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan, submitted that the defence received a copy of the 2,169-page petition on Wednesday night and would need at least two weeks to respond. He said he was instructed on Wednesday by Elbakyan, who is listed as one of the defendants in the petition.To this, justice Rajiv Shakdher said, “You will not publish articles which they (plaintiffs) have copyright”. Jain said that nothing new would be uploaded. There was no representation of Libgen in court on Thursday.Elbakyan, from Kazhakstan, founded Sci Hub in 2011 to get around the high cost of scientific research, most of which were behind paywalls. She has been in hiding since 2015, fearing possible extradition. “Given the stand of the counsel for Defendant no 1 (Sci-Hub), no new articles will be uploaded or make available. Statement of Nilesh Jain is taken on record,” the court said.Justice Shakdher sought the reply of the defendants and asked them to disclose their physical addresses after senior advocate Amit Sibal, representing the publishing houses, told the court that they did not even know the address of the defendants.Sibal told the court that the defence had no case because they were “openly infringing” on the copyright of the publishers. “Our business model is some free journals and majorly subscription-based ...we are here before this court for the subscription-based publications…..The defendants are related or we can say mirror and pirate websites. They collect donations in millions, buy paywalled publications and upload copy on LibGen as well as on Sci-Hub. PayPal has disabled their payment system but they come up with new ones...” Sibal said.The petition sought direction to various internet service providers, the department of telecom and the ministry of electronics and information technology to issue orders to block Sci Hub and Libgen.During the proceedings, Sibal also suggested that he would give links that have to be removed from Sci Hub and Libgen. To this, the judge remarked, “They (defendants) are there since 2011. Where were your client for so many years? These sites are known by everyone.”Sibal said litigation in the other countries was taking time.The next hearing in the case is on January 6.Several researchers in India say they use Sci Hub to get around the high cost of research -- especially because many institutions here do not have subscriptions to these journals. “As a researcher in an Indian university, I have been using both Sci-Hub and LibGen which are indispensable resources as the institutional subscriptions and access provided by my university is inadequate because of frequent budget cuts in the library funding. Many students use these websites to access academic books and research papers which would otherwise be paywalled. Shadow libraries like these ensure that students get the materials that they need for studying,” said Prateek Vijayavargia, a PhD student at Jawaharlal Nehru University. “The existence of Sci- ub is a symptom of a fundamentally broken scientific publishing system, rigged in favour of giant publishers. Publishers should take the hint and work to improve the system, not waste time on lawsuits that are so transparently against the public interest,” tweeted Mukund Thattai, a scientist at the National Centre for Biological Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-new-articles-on-sci-hub-libgen-till-jan-6-over-copyright-infringement-delhi-hc/story-3j8he06wFMfmoARTpOGoKO.html
25-12-2020||India||Alagiri hints at launching a new party, says won’t work with DMK||MK Alagiri, elder son of the late M Karunanidhi, on Thursday said he will take a decision on launching a party after a discussion with his supporters on January 3, ruling out any possibility of a rapprochement between him and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) ahead of next year’s assembly elections. “There is no chance of working with the DMK,” said Alagiri, whose father expelled him from the party over discipline issues in 2014. “I have fixed a consultative meeting on January 3 with my supporters in Madurai and I will take a decision based on their advice,” the 69-year-old, a minister in the UPA’s second term, told reporters after visiting his ailing mother in Chennai. For decades, Tamil Nadu’s politics has been a witness to a sibling rivalry between Alagiri, who once oversaw the state’s southern districts for the party, and his younger brother MK Stalin, 67, who is now the DMK president and the party’s chief ministerial candidate for the assembly elections slated for early 2021. On March 25, 2014, Karunanidhi, a five-time chief minister and one of the doyens of Dravidian politics, expelled Alagiri from the party in the middle of a succession battle, causing a split in the family. After Karunanidhi’s death in August 2018, Stalin became the party president. “The party is consolidated under one leadership. So there is no way of bringing him (Alagiri) back,” said a DMK member on condition of anonymity. “Even if he starts a party, it will not have any impact on the DMK. Party cadres know that the DMK is on the verge of taking the elections by storm. Nobody will think of jumping camp now; it could finish their political career,” the leader said. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is aiming to make a mark in Tamil Nadu, dismissed that Alagiri was in talks with the party despite a buzz to this effect. “We are not in talks,” state BJP president L Murugan told reporters on Thursday in Chennai. “We have both clarified on this. (But) the Tamil Nadu BJP is ready to welcome Alagiri or anyone who is willing to join the party. Several important leaders will join us soon,” he said. In November, another expelled DMK leader and an Alagiri loyalist, KP Ramalingam, joined the BJP, an ally of the state’s ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).On Thursday, Alagiri said he could meet actor Rajinikanth, who is expected to launch his political party in January, when the latter visits Chennai, but ruled out any possible alliance. “I’ve not met him on his birthday (December 12)...I’ll meet him when he’s in Chennai,” Alagiri said. The 70-year-old actor was out of town for shooting his latest film, Annathe, in Hyderabad under the Sun Pictures banner owned by Karunanidhi’s grandnephew Kalanidhi Maran. With shooting suspended after a few in the crew tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, Rajinikanth is likely to return to the city soon.Political analyst Sumanth Raman said the DMK is expected not to “lose sleep” over Alagiri floating a new party. “It’s a do-or-die battle for the DMK and Alagiri is looking to make himself relevant,” Raman said. “Even if a few disgruntled members gravitate to Alagiri’s new party, it will not impact the DMK. However, the BJP is seen to be sending out feelers to Alagiri to embarrass the DMK.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alagiri-hints-at-launching-a-new-party-says-won-t-work-with-dmk/story-KVaJr9Lp0umuRxmRIp3qsL.html
25-12-2020||India||Remembering Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his 96th birth anniversary||Today is the 96th birth anniversary of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the first Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader to successfully complete a five-year term as the country’s prime minister. Born in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, Vajpayee was first elected to the Lok Sabha in 1957 from Balrampur constituency as a member of Bharatiya Jana Sangh, a forerunner of the BJP.Vajpayee, who was also a poet, quickly grabbed the attention of top political leaders across the aisle with his sharp oratory skills. After the death of Deendayal Upadhyaya, Vajpayee took over the party leadership and became the national president of Jana Sangh in 1968. He was among prominent opposition leaders who were arrested during the Emergency imposed by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.In 1977, several opposition parties, including Jana Sangh, came together to contest the general elections by forming the Janata Party. Vajpayee served as the minister of external affairs (MEA) in Morarji Desai’s cabinet following Congress’ defeat in that election. In 1979, Desai resigned as India’s 4th prime minister, triggering a collapse of the Janata Party. The erstwhile leaders of Jana Sangh came together in 1980 to form the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was headed by Vajpayee.Also Read | Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s 96th birth anniversary: Iconic poems penned by late former prime ministerAfter years of political struggle, Vajpayee became the 10th Prime Minister of India in 1996 following the BJP’s emergence as the single-largest party. However, the BJP failed to garner enough support to prove majority on the floor of Parliament, and Vajpayee had to resign after 16 days. In 1998, several political parties formed a coalition with the BJP and Vajpayee led the government under the banner of National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The government lasted 13 months as the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) withdrew its support in 1999.The 1999 Lok Sabha elections were held in the aftermath of Kargil operations and the BJP-led NDA secured a comfortable majority, helping Vajpayee to complete a full five-year term for the first time. It was during Vajpayee’s prime ministership that India carried out the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. Vajpayee resigned as the prime minister in 2004 and a year later, he announced his retirement from active politics, owing to his feeble health condition. In 2015, he was bestowed with India’s highest civilian honour, Bharat Ratna. After a prolonged illness, the veteran leader passed away on August 16, 2018, at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remembering-atal-bihari-vajpayee-on-his-96th-birth-anniversary/story-N0X1uG8yFLcL5JXhBHTcDK.html
