A large number of trucks and containers were seen stuck near Bawal as the Rewari Police diverted vehicular traffic headed to Kotkasim in Rajasthan to Jaipur. Authorities were forced to divert the traffic towards Kotkasim from Kasola Chowk after farmers blocked both sides of the carriageway of the Delhi-Jaipur highway on Friday afternoon. Sub-inspector Hawa Singh, who was posted at a flyover near Kasola Chowk on Rewari-Kotkasim Road said that they have stopped traffic towards Jaipur from Friday afternoon after both the carriageways were blocked. “The vehicles take a left towards Kotkasim and from there they move onwards on internal roads towards Behrore onwards to Jaipur,” said Singh. Traffic jam was witnessed as vehicles got stuck near Kasola Chowk onwards to Kotkasim on Saturday afternoon as commuters tried to find their way onwards to Rajasthan. “My wife is expecting and I don’t know where this road will take us. Lot of people like us are stuck in jam,” Ravi Beniwal, a commuter. Rajesh Kumar, a truck driver, whose vehicle was being used by police to block the road towards Jaipur said they had been standing there since last evening. “We have just had our lunch and don’t know when the situation will normalise. There are hundreds of trucks that are stuck on the main road and parked at petrol pumps. We were going to Mumbai from Karnal,” he said. A commuter who had managed to come to Haryana after crossing the border on foot said that vehicles from Jaipur to Delhi have also been diverted at around three to four places to avoid the blockade. “People are facing lot of trouble due to blockade. Locals who cross the border for work will suffer from Monday onwards,” said Kushal Singh, a resident of Behror. Commuters on the highway said congestion was also witnessed at Masani barrage where traffic police had set up a diversion towards Rewari. “There is a need to remove this blockade at the earliest as local industry and transporters are also suffering,” said Ram Kumar Yadav, resident of Dharuhera. Ram Murthy Joshi, SP , Bhiwadi said, “Both carriageways are blocked and routes have been diverted to ensure commuters get passage to cross the stretch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/heavy-traffic-congestion-on-delhi-jaipur-highway-hundreds-of-trucks-stuck/story-ENaUuhBWJTVbN0UTBXNfhO.html

Additionally, seven travellers have refused to get themselves tested for Covid-19. A senior official said that legal action will be taken against such people for not following the government rules and for failing to help the government to identify people who might be infected with new strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus.The list of the untraceable travellers has been already shared with the Gurugram Police, according to the health department as they have to administer Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Until Saturday, out of 411 travelers who arrived in Gurugram after December 9, at least 288 have given their samples for testing.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO), said, “In compliance with the government guidelines, we have to test every traveller who arrived from the UK in the last two months. Presently, 15 people are untraceable due to incorrect addresses or mobile numbers, which are not reachable. The list has been shared with the commissioner of police Gurugram to trace the people.”He said, at least seven travellers are reluctant to get themselves tested. “Our teams are constantly trying to motivate them but they have refused to give their samples for testing,” said Yadav, who issued a press statement on Saturday, asking UK returnees to come forward for testing. It said that despite several efforts some returnees are not getting themselves tested. If they continue to do so,action will be taken against them against Section 188 of IPC for not complying with the government rules.K K Rao, commissioner of police, Gurugram, said, “The investigation will begin once we receive the list from the health department. We will trace the UK returnees by reaching out to the embassy for correct contact details.”Yadav said that the immediate contacts of such travellers should also quarantine themselves. Following the recent standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the union ministry of health and family welfare, the district health department will have to monitor cases through calls or visits, and collect samples if they develop symptoms like cough, cold, fever or breathlessness for 28 days from the date of arrival from the UK.On Thursday night, the health department received a list of 695 travellers who arrived in Gurugram from the UK from November 25 onwards. Out of these, 411 people have to be administered with the RT-PCR test. Of the 411, at least 256 have given their samples to the district health department and 32 to private labs. About 101 travellers moved back to other states or cities and their names have been provided to the state governments. Yadav has already directed private labs to collect samples from homes, if approached by any UK returnee and preserve additional sample in case a person is tested positive, for genome sequencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/15-uk-returnees-untraceable-seven-refuse-to-get-tested-for-covid-19/story-ErvjaCSq1ddwLepuuB8LXI.html

Her family alleged that she had committed suicide due to “humiliation and torture” by Faridabad Police.As per the complaint, a crime unit of Sector 19 of Faridabad Police raided the house of a person named Shankar, who has been accused in a case of a cyber crime, on Thursday night. Family members of the accused alleged they were tortured the entire night in their house, taken to the crime unit in Faridabad next morning and subjected to third-degree abuse. They alleged that the deceased woman, who was the sister of the accused, committed suicide due to “humiliation and torture” of the family by the police.Naintara, the wife of the accused, claimed she was unaware about the activities of her husband. “Whenever I asked him about his work, he used refused to divulge anything,” she said. According to Naintara, a police team knocked on her house on Thursday night and the moment she opened the door they slapped her and asked her about her husband. “They made me and my sister-in-law law(victim) stand in a corner of the house and kicked us They took me into a police van and physically abused me in the moving van,” said Naintara.Sandeep, a relative of the accused, in his complaint filed with Rajendra Park police station, mentioned that he received a call from the deceased seeking help. “She told me that Naitara was picked up by the police. At around 6.30am on Friday, I reached her home. The moment I got inside the house, cops took away my mobile, wallet and everything I had. They abused me and other members of the family. They took us to the crime unit of Sector 19 in Faridabad. They forced me to stand naked and subjected me to police torture,” said Sandeep. Later in the evening they were released and they came back to Gurgaon and narrated the entire incident to the victim. Fearing police action, the victim committed suicide. “We came back and shared our ordeal with the victim. I told her that if Shankar was not caught soon the police will treat her in a similar manner. Fearing police torture, she committed suicide,” alleged Naintara.Spokesperson of Faridabad police, Sube Singh, said Shankar and few others have been accused in a case of cyber fraud wherein they used to clone SIM cards of people in the name of porting their phone numbers.

26-12-2020||City||Mumbai civic body begins testing of 187 UK returnees for new Covid-19 strain||In an attempt to identify and prevent the spread of the new Covid-19 variant in the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday started testing 187 passengers who had arrived from the United Kingdom (UK) earlier this week. According to BMC officials, the results of all these passengers will be out by Monday.A BMC official said, “187 passengers who are currently quarantined in hotels in the city will be tested in two batches on Saturday and Sunday. The results of those who were tested on Saturday will be out on Sunday.”Along with the UK returnees, those passengers who reached the city from the Middle East and Europe earlier this week will also be tested. Over 1,000 passengers from the UK, Europe and Middle East have been quarantined since December 21 amid the fear of new Covid-19 variant. Passengers from South Africa have been quarantined from Saturday but a decision on their testing will be taken later.“The samples of those who test positive will be sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for detecting the new Covid-19 strain reported in the UK. Such patients will also be hospitalised,” the official said. Earlier this week, around 590 passengers arrived from the UK to Mumbai on three flights. Of these, 187 passengers were quarantined, while the others were permitted to leave as they were not residents of Mumbai. Of the passengers from Europe and the Middle East who had arrived to Mumbai this week, 820 fliers have also been quarantined at different hotels in Mumbai till Friday. BMC is tracing more than 1,500 passengers who had arrived from the UK in the past one month to test them for the new strain. Officials, however, said that there is no proposal to trace passengers who arrived in Mumbai from Europe and Middle East in the past one month. The civic body said it will wait for the Covid-19 test results of these passengers before going ahead with any further relaxations, especially concerned with the reopening of schools or restarting the local trains for all after December 31. Suresh Kakani, additional civic commissioner, said, “No decision has been taken on restarting local trains for all or reopening schools. The proposal has to come from the state government. But whether we are in a position to reopen schools and restart locals for all is something we’ll have to decide after considering the situation in the coming days. One of the factors will also be detection of the new Covid-19 strain. For now, our focus is on quarantining and testing passengers from the UK, Europe, the Middle and South Africa to detect the new strain.”However, state’s Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said the new variant detection should not affect the decision to unlock the city. “There’s no harm in unlocking with Covid-appropriate behaviour in the coming days. The detection of the new strain, if any, shouldn’t impact the unlocking. But we should be prepared for a surge, say around two weeks after the New Year,” he said.On November 20, BMC had decided to keep all the schools for Class 9 to Class 12 closed till December 31, owing to the fear of a second wave around Diwali. In the case of local trains, the state government had given its consent to the Centre to restart locals for all in the last week of October, but the decision was not implemented owing to the fear of the second wave. Meanwhile, 536 cases were reported in Mumbai on Saturday, taking the tally to 290,336. The toll is at 11,068 after 12 deaths. Around 2.7 lakh patients have recovered from the virus. The city’s recovery rate is around 93%, while fatality stands at 3.8%. There are 8,262 active cases in Mumbai. One hot spot that has shown signs of drastic improvement – Dharavi – recorded only one Covid-19 case on Saturday, taking its tally to 3,789. Of these, 3,464 patients have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-civic-body-begins-testing-of-187-uk-returnees-for-new-covid-19-strain/story-j5URcqNwQ7HFAMArMr0SLO.html
26-12-2020||Gurugram||Colleges to create bank of pre-recorded lecture videos||The state higher education department has asked teaching staff across colleges in the state to share recorded video lectures, which will be used as e-content for the ongoing academic session. College heads said that the video lecturers will serve as additional learning resources for students, especially those who are not able to take regular online or physical classroom sessions.In a directive shared with colleges earlier this week, the higher education department said that regular teaching staff would need to contribute recorded lecture videos for the development of e-content for the academic session 2020-21. The department has said that the faculty needs to submit at least one recorded lecture video pertaining to a topic on a given subject. The topics on which the videos will be submitted are being handled by nodal officers of different colleges.Ramesh Garg, principal of Government Girls College, Sector 14, said that nodal officers for different subjects had earlier been appointed to helm the generation of e-content for this year in view of the pandemic. “If all faculty members across colleges in the state can pitch in with recorded lecture videos pertaining to a particular topic, the department will be able to put in place a bank of learning resources. While discussion is a major constituent of live online classes, these videos will act as a content resource for revision,” said Garg.Garg said that the pool of videos created would cover different content in line with the syllabus and can be used as an online learning resource once it’s ready. “In normal times, students used to have physical notes and other resources at their disposal but the pandemic has hastened the shift towards digital education. The videos that will be put together will serve as an online bank for students in addition to the classes that they take,” said Garg. He said that students will be able to benefit from videos from different teachers across the state under this e-content initiative.Dr Satyamanyu Yadav, principal, Government College in Sector 9, said that the lecture videos that will be recorded will serve as an e-resource for students. “Teachers will prepare lecture videos that will be transmitted through existing television broadcast mechanism. Further, they will be uploaded to an e-content library being created by the department. If there are students struggling with bandwidth issues or those who are unable to tune in regularly to online classes, they can rely on these video lecturers,” said Yadav. He said that students could download the necessary videos and use them offline for revision when required. “Sometimes, students miss out on live online classes that are being held daily. In such a situation, they can use their downloaded lecture videos,” said Yadav.The directive undersigned by the project officer, EDUSAT for the higher education department, stated that lecturers would need to discuss learning objectives and references used by them for preparing the lecture videos. “The lecture should begin by discussing the learning objectives and references used by the resource person. Besides the video, lecturers need to submit a document outlining the same,” said the officer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/colleges-to-create-bank-of-pre-recorded-lecture-videos/story-CuxTyIA5RppmQHPXtOOorJ.html
26-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG starts preparation to achieve water plus tag in upcoming Swachh Sarvekshan||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has started a survey of all the drainage pipelines across the city to check if the lines are connected to the nearest sewage treatment plant (STP) and whether they need to be upgraded for ensuring the same.The main purpose of the survey is to help the civic body to achieve the water plus certification for Gurugram, said officials.A city is declared water plus if all wastewater generated from households, commercial buildings, and industries flows to the STP for treatment.In the upcoming 2021 Swachh Survekshan Survey, a water plus certification carries 200 points. The certification was introduced by the Central government in August 2019.“We are looking to turn Gurugram into a water plus city at the earliest, and work in this regard has started. We are surveying areas across the city to check the on-ground status of drainage pipelines and accordingly take action for laying fresh lines or repairing existing drainage lines if the need arises,” said Dheeraj Kumar, joint commissioner, Swachh Bharat Mission, MCG.At several areas in the city, especially those in Old Gurugram, where the drainage lines were established much before the MCG came to formation in 2008, sewerage and stormwater lines tend to mix with each other.MCG officials said that the survey will also identify such sites in the city so that drains can be accordingly altered or laid anew.Kumar also said that the MCG is also simultaneously working on a plan to lay pipelines from the city’s STPs to the nearest green belts, parks or construction sites so that recycled water can flow to such sites for irrigation and construction purposes.He said that the MCG has already laid such a pipeline in a gated township in Sector 49.The city has STPs at Behrampur and Dhanwapur. The two plants together have the capacity of treating more than 400 MLD (million litres daily) of wastewater on a daily basis, said MCG officials. In a nutshell, the process of treating wastewater in an STP starts with the sewage being stored inside a tank. In the tank, the solid or heavier waste sinks to the bottom.The heavier waste or sludge is then removed from the wastewater entirely while the rest of the wastewater is once again filtered to remove smaller particles.Subsequently, the wastewater is left alone for a short period of time to naturally bio-degrade. In the last stage, tertiary treatment is carried out to remove phosphate and other chemicals.The treatment of wastewater holds importance as a January 2019 GMDA report stated that at least 80 MLD of untreated sewage water enters the storm water drains daily which, apart from posing health hazards,pollute the underground water table and nearby water bodies. This also causes waterlogging during the monsoon season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-starts-preparation-to-achieve-water-plus-tag-in-upcoming-swachh-sarvekshan/story-4fQFasI2wXqxpO909ILxTP.html
26-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Woman attempts to end her life by jumping from elevated road in Sector 21||Noida: A 20-year-old woman allegedly tried to take her own life on Saturday afternoon by jumping from the Noida elevated road near Sector 21. She is currently undergoing treatment at a government hospital in Delhi, police said.Police officials said that the incident took place around 1.30pm. “She was immediately rushed to a private hospital nearby from where she was referred to a higher centre in Delhi,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1.The police said that the reason for her attempted suicide is unclear at the moment.“She lived with her family in the area under the Sector 20 police jurisdiction and was training to be a seamstress. However, the family could not provide any details about problems she may have been facing. No suicide note was recovered from her, and we are not able to question her as she is yet to regain consciousness,” said a senior police official.Two die by suicideIn a separate incident, two persons, working at a company under the Kasna police jurisdiction, allegedly took their own lives within hours of each other.“The first suicide was reported last night when a 19-year-old youth took his own life. Today afternoon, the suicide of a 22-year-old woman was also discovered. They both worked in the same company, but so far they appear to be completely unrelated,” said Vivek Triwedi, SHO, Kasna police station.Police officials said that the reason behind the two suicides are unclear. “The woman had even informed her husband today about the first suicide, and when he came back home in the afternoon she was already dead by then. She had a 2.5 years old boy also,” said the SHO.The police are investigating possible connections between the two cases. Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are 011-23389090 from Sumaitri (Delhi-based) and 044-24640050 from Sneha Foundation (Chennai-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-woman-attempts-to-end-her-life-by-jumping-from-elevated-road-in-sector-21/story-Wv2EoXBX7fNd0wYGsVwkvI.html
26-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Health dept conducts tests of 260 travellers from UK, 2 found positive for Covid-19||NOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar health department has conducted RT-PCR testing of 260 returnees from the United Kingdom. Officials said that test results of around 140 travellers have been received, and two of them have tested positive for Covid-19. In the wake of the rise of a new variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus in the UK, the district administration has prepared a list of 425 passengers who have arrived from that country in the past 30 days. While all of them have been asked to serve the mandatory 28-day home quarantine, the district health department has started RT-PCR testing of 260 of them who have come to India after December 8, the officials said. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the Covid-19 control room is keeping a close eye on all the 425 travellers. “So far, we have got results of RT-PCR tests of around 140 travellers, of which two have been tested positive. Both the infected patients have been admitted to an isolation ward at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida,” he said. The new variant, referred to as Sars-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 (Variant Under Investigation, year 2020, month 12, variant 01), was detected in the UK earlier this month and reported to be highly transmissible.The DM said that the presence of new variant of the virus among the positive patients can only be ascertained through genomic sequencing. “Their samples have been sent to ICMR laboratory in New Delhi. But, since they were negative in their RT-PCR tests two weeks ago in the UK, it is expected that they are having only common Covid-19 infection. If the new variant of Sars-CoV-2 is found in their samples, the patients will continue to remain in the isolation unit for another 14 days, when they will be tested again,” he said. GB Nagar chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that all the 185 international travellers from the UK, who arrived in India between November 25 and December 8, will be contacted by district surveillance officials. “As per the standard operating procedure of the state government, those who had arrived from the UK between November 23 and December 8 had to be in mandatory 28-day home quarantine. If anyone among them develops symptoms, we’ll take their samples for RT-PCR,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-health-dept-conducts-tests-of-260-travellers-from-uk-2-found-positive-for-covid-19/story-wEmKuAFQC68jXrrtSpHViJ.html
26-12-2020||Noida||Respite from cold wave likely for 2 days as mercury may rise||Noida: The city is likely to get a respite from the cold wave for the next two days. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), due to change in the weather conditions and approaching western disturbance – a phenomenon that leads to snowing in the northern Himalayan states and temporary change in the wind directions – the mercury is set to rise by three degrees Celsius on Sunday and Monday. However, the minimum temperatures will drop sharply, leading to much harsher weather conditions from Tuesday onwards, IMD said. “There is a western disturbance approaching, which would change the current wind directions from icy cold north-westerly to warmer south-easterly and easterly. This would raise the morning time temperatures and provide temporary relief to the region from cold waves. The morning hours will, however, see shallow to moderate fog,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. On Saturday, the minimum and maximum temperatures for Noida were recorded at 6.2 degrees Celsius and 20.7 degrees Celsius, against 7.2 and 21.6 degrees a day earlier. Meanwhile, the average minimum and maximum temperatures for NCR based on the Safdarjung observatory were recorded at 4.4 degrees Celsius and 21.9 degrees Celsius, against 4.6 and 22.4 a day earlier. “The minimum and maximum temperatures on Sunday could rise by two to three degrees Celsius. The wind speed would be around 12 kmph,” said an official at IMD. The Met officials, however, said that the relief from the cold waves would be temporary as the weather conditions will revert and mercury will fall sharply towards Tuesday, giving a harsh weather conditions towards the year-end. “From Tuesday onwards, the wind directions would revert to icy cold north-westerly that would bring the mercury down with minimum temperature likely to hover around 3 degrees Celsius, giving a cold year-end,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/respite-from-cold-wave-likely-for-2-days-as-mercury-may-rise/story-mbMu0NIpTFnCBUDzD9JAPK.html
26-12-2020||Noida||Tikait’s remarks at Palwal stoke controversy||Ghaziabad: The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader, Rakesh Tikait, has landed in controversy over his alleged remarks in which he claimed that “temples” and “pandits” (priests) were not “giving enough support” to ongoing farmers’ agitation. A purported video of the Tikait’s address to the protesting farmers in Haryana’s Palwal has recently surfaced on social media. Tikait allegedly made some derogatory remarks against priests in the purported video. Tikait, who is also the national spokesperson of BKU, is spearheading protests at the UP Gate in Ghaziabad where thousands of farmers from Punjab and Uttarakhand have joined in since November 28 against the Centre’s new farm laws. Tikait, however, said on Saturday that he did not make any derogatory comments but some people were unnecessarily trying to create a controversy. He said that he was just urging priests in temples to come forward and support farmers. “They are coming to our protest site but not showing up. They are distributing some sweets like ‘kheer,’ ‘laddus’ and ‘gur’. They should come up with banners if they are helping farmers,” Tikait said at the UP Gate on Saturday. Tikait also posted several tweets in which he stated that it was a plan to create a divide. “Even after this, if someone got hurt, I am ready to apologise hundred times. Rakesh Tikait is nothing. Rakesh Tikait’s ego is not bigger than the agitation. Country is above all,” Tikait said in a tweet. Over the issue, ‘Zila Brahmin Samaj’ of Palwal has raised objections about the alleged remarks by Tikait. The association’s senior vice-president Pandit Subhash Sharma said a complaint has been given in this regard to Sadar police station in Palwal for registering an FIR against Tikait. Vijaypal Singh, deputy superintendent of police, Palwal, said that the matter will be first investigated. “If the complaint is given by the association, we will get it inquired/investigated before lodging any FIR,” he added. Mahant Narayan Giri, caretaker of ancient Dudheshwar Nath Temple in Ghaziabad, also criticised the remarks allegedly made by Tikait. “His remarks cannot be justified at all. I know that his father (BKU founder Mahendra SinghTikait) had sent donations to our temple. He was a very noble man. Further, if temples or priests help out people, they don’t put up banners or posters to show that they contributed,” Mahant Giri said.Meanwhile, the Ghaziabad police on Saturday evening said that they have registered an FIR under IPC section 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) against an unidentified person who allegedly issued threats to Tikait. “After receiving a complaint stating that an unidentified person has issued death threat to Rakesh Tikait, we have registered an FIR at Kaushambi police station. Surveillance teams have been roped in to find out the suspect,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram). “We have given a police complaint with regard to threats issued to me. The caller said that he has plans to kill me and also said that I had asked for donations from temples. He said he was calling from Bihar,” Tikait told reporters at UP Gate.Shamsher Rana, national media co-ordinator of BKU, confirmed that a police complaint was given on Saturday evening after the alleged threat call to Tikait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/tikait-s-remarks-at-palwal-stoke-controversy/story-uIL9ta8SqCHbJmRx5y5XyN.html
26-12-2020||Noida||UP govt sends six officers to assist Ghaziabad administration deal with farmers||The Uttar Pradesh government has deputed six officers to assist the Ghaziabad district administration to deal with the growing number of farmer protesters at UP Gate.The officers include deputy collectors to additional district magistrates and will be in Ghaziabad till January 2. The officers are from districts like Lucknow, Etah, Mainpuri and Bijnor. “The officers will be deployed as magistrates and will also carry out other duties,” said Bipin Kumar, city magistrate who was officiating at additional district magistrate (city). Ghaziabad District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not take calls. The gathering at the UP-Gate has swelled considerably over past week with about 300 to 350 tractor-trolleys also arriving from Uttarakhand. Vehicles and tents line up from the top of the UP-Gate flyover till the Khoda Colony end along the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME). Inspector general (law and order) Jyoti Narayan also arrived in Ghaziabad on Friday evening and held a detailed meeting with administration and police officers.Narayan directed that for the purpose of crowd management and any law-and-order situation, the UP Gate area should be divided into seven zones and 13 sectors. “The IG also directed that public address systems be installed to curb spread of rumours and police should be on the lookout for anti-social elements,” said district information officer Rakesh Chauhan. “The district magistrate has also directed a committee comprising officers from health, transport, fire and even the magistrates to be on round the clock duty at the stie in wake of growing number of people at the protest site. He has also directed the inspection of power cables and installation of floodlights. It was also directed that the health department also deploy a team for regular check-ups for protesters and make arrangements to test for Covid-19.‘We didn’t block the road’Even as the Delhi to Ghaziabad carriageway of the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) was blocked for the third time this week on Saturday, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait) blamed the administration and police.The road was blocked for more than five hours, forcing administration to divert traffic to other border sites. While the Ghaziabad to Delhi carriageway had been blocked since December 3, protesters had blocked the other road too alleging that the police were stopping their supporters in other districts from joining them.The blockade on Saturday was the fifth time that the highways were completed blocked, the previous occassions being December 8, 14, 21 and 22. “There were about 300 tractor-trolleys which had arrived from Uttarakhand on Friday evening and they blocked the highway on Saturday morning. The volunteers of the BKU were not involved. We repeatedly requested them not to block roads but to no avail,” said a BKU leader at UP Gate. The BKU (Tikait) on Saturday evening said that farmer groups, that were their supporters, were stuck in Rampur. Rakesh Tikait, BKU national spokesperson, however, denied that the blockades were put up by protesting farmers. “We did not block the highways and in fact the police and the administration had done it,” Tikait said at UP Gate while maintaining similar stance which he put up during the 10-hour blockade on December 22. During the blockade on Saturday which lasted from 11am to 4.30pm, protesting youths and farmers also blocked the Ghazipur to Vaishali slip road which was finally opened around 3pm up on intervention of senior farmers’ leaders. The protesters also played DJ music in tractors which they drove freely on the highway lanes and also resorted to sloganeering and clicking of selfies besides playing volley-ball on the blocked roads. The protest site at the UP Gate is growing every day in terms of gathering with tractor-trolleys now lined up in front of Khoda Colony extend up to the UP-Gate flyover where special tents have been put up. “We estimate that the proportion of BKU volunteers is about 20-25% of the gathering while majority are now from Uttarakhand and Punjab,” a BKU leader quoted above, said. “There was no law-and-order situation at UP Gate. Farmers blocked the road and later opened it on their own,” said Vipin Kumar, city magistrate who was officiating at additional district magistrate (city). BKU faction continued protest at Chilla Border: At the other Chilla border in Noida, members of BKU’s Bhanu faction continued their hunger strike on Saturday while they were also joined by group from Aligarh. “They came to show their support but left later today.

26-12-2020||Noida||State govt takes back two cases against GNoida farmers in land acquisition issue||The Uttar Padesh state government has withdrawn two cases against farmers of Bhatta and Parsaul villages in Greater Noida in connection with a 2011 clash in which four people were killed. That year, the Yamuna expressway industrial authority (Yeida) had begun to acquire land in these two villages, which the residents had opposed. On May 6, 13 farmers were booked for allegedly kidnapping government officials. The next day, police and farmers clashed resulting in the death of two policemen and two civilians, besides several injuries.Twenty cases were registered at Dankaur police station following the clashes and 40 people were booked. The government had since withdrawn 15 cases, while the order to take back two more was issued on December 21 by the state governor Anandiben Patel. The cases withdrawn involved charges of rioting, assault in robbery, kidnapping and arms act against the PAC. “The government has seen all the evidence after which the public prosecutors were permitted to file the necessary documents in court to take back the charges which the governor has allowed following which due proceedings should be carried out,” said a notice from the deputy secretary’s office to the Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate’s office. The Jewar MLA has also been championing for the charges to be dropped against the farmers. “We have been fighting constantly for the past three years to do away with all the cases against the farmers. At least three more cases are pending and we will ensure those are also taken back,” said MLA Dhirendra Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/state-govt-takes-back-two-cases-against-gnoida-farmers-in-land-acquisition-issue/story-QeZNSZf9V3l44A7up8tg7N.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||Fire in mask manufacturing factory kills one||A 50-year-old man was killed after a fire broke out in a mask manufacturing factory in Mayapuri industrial area in west Delhi on Saturday, police and fire officials said. Two others were managed by rescue teams. Police said the man — identified as Yugal Kishore — died due to inhaling toxic smoke. He did not suffer burns, rescuers said.Fire officials said that two gates – one iron and another wooden – of the factory located on the third floor of a building were locked from inside and three men were sleeping inside, when the fire broke out at around 3.30am. The rescue team of the fire department took a couple of minutes to break open the two gates and douse the flames. Police are probing the cause of the fire. Six fire tenders and nearly 15 firefighters were involved in the rescue operation and their prompt action saved the lives of two men who were trapped inside the factory, said Delhi Fire Services (DFS) chief Atul Garg.Ravinder Singh, additional division officer (DFS) said that the fire was not big and the flames were doused in less than half an hour. Since the machines and raw materials used for making masks had caught fire, it caused smoke that engulfed the entire factory and spread in nearly 200 square yard on the third floor, he said.Another fire officer said the rescuers first broke open the iron and wooden gates and rescued two workers -- Feroz Ansari,24, and Aman Ansari,18, -- who had fallen semi-unconscious, after inhaling smoke.“The two men were in the main hall. They soon regained consciousness and told the firefighters that the tailor, Jugal Kishore, was in a room on the same floor. The room’s door was locked from inside. The rescue team broke it open and found the tailor lying unconscious on the floor,” said the officer.Kishore was rushed to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital in a CATS ambulance. He was declared brought dead at the hospital later, said additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Subodh Kumar Goswami.“We have registered a case of negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter and death by negligence under Indian Penal Code’s Section 285 and 304A at the Mayapuri police station,” said Goswami.Police and fire officials suspect that the fire may have been caused either due to a short circuit or the workers burning something in the factory to keep themselves warm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fire-in-mask-manufacturing-factory-kills-one/story-0jVGGwtXmlS5gVaieavElI.html

She may be the first person in the state to test positive for the virus after visiting the UK where a new strain of coronavirus disease has been found.The civic body will now send her sample to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune to confirm the type of strain she is infected with.The state government has put the administration on alert after discovery of a new strain Covid-19 which is believed to be much more infectious than all the previous strains. It has directed the civic bodies and district collectors to trace and conduct tests of all those who came from the UK between November 15 and December 23.Also read: More muscle to IAF with at least 3 more Rafales flying-in next month“This woman arrived in Mumbai on December 15 and by road reached Aurangabad the next day. Following the directives, we traced and conducted her RT-PCR test and her report on Friday confirmed that she is positive for Covid-19. However, she is still asymptomatic,” said Dr Nita Padalkar, assistant municipal commissioner and medical officer of health, Aurangabad municipal corporation.Dr Padalkar said her RT-PCR test conducted in London on December 11 was negative and thus it is difficult to say if she is a carrier or she got infected in transit or after arrival in the country. “To know the type of virus, we have again collected her sample and will send it to the NIV, Pune, on Monday and after getting her report we will be able to comment further,” she said.The woman stays in Aurangabad city with her husband and his sample was also collected today. The civic body is now trying to trace other people whom she came in contact with while travelling to Aurangabad from Mumbai, the medical officer of health said. The government has already banned flights from the UK. It has also started tracing and testing passengers from the UK who came before the ban was imposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aurangabad-woman-returns-from-uk-tests-positive-for-covid-19-sample-to-be-sent-for-strain-testing/story-8WybbdqpFpXjeWkCLHbfSN.html
26-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana at a standstill, but MC at work||With cities coming to an abrupt halt due to the Covid-induced lockdown, the role of local governments became all the more crucial this year as these took on the dual challenge of fighting the pandemic while also ensuring that essential services continued running smoothly.The Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC), the largest civic body in Punjab, too found itself facing new challenges. From conducting disinfection drives to distributing ration among labourers, the already cash-starved MC simultaneously dealt with the burden of numerous construction projects under the smart city mission. Though development projects had to be stopped for about a month after the lockdown came into effect in March, these again picked up pace in April, after permission was granted to deploy labourers at construction sites, but with riders.However, it was not an easy run for the department as nearly a dozen of its staffers got infected with the virus. Two Class-IV employees also succumbed to the disease. Their work did not go unnoticed as residents appreciated their services, especially those of sanitation workers, who kept working even during the lockdown to keep the city clean. Among the biggest success stories of the civic body, in terms of development, were the reopening of the Jagraon Bridge and rejuvenation of the 114-year-old Clock Tower. The construction of Sidhwan Canal waterfront and green belts in the city brought some respite to residents amid an extremely rough year.Towards the end of the year, however, the civic body was on the receiving end as residents and the opposition raised the long pending issues, including potholed roads, traffic chaos due to ongoing construction works, stray animal menace, choked sewer lines, among others. As the recovery drives of MC were also hit due to the lockdown, the fund-starved MC is still struggling to find a way out of financial crisis. Another major setback was that the civic body could only hold two house meetings this year.HighsJagraon bridge reopenedThe historic Jagraon Bridge – the lifeline of the city – got a new lease of life as it was thrown open to residents after a prolonged wait of four years in the month of September. The bow string girder bridge, built by the railways, is now the cynosure of all eyes. The bridge connects the old city with the new and has been erected by replacing the 132-year-old bridge constructed by the British in 1888. Disinfection drives:Soon after the lockdown was announced in the month of March, the civic body commenced disinfection drives in the city. The roads and internal streets were disinfected with sodium hypochlorite and the drive was taken up extensively till the month of May. Apart from the civic body staff, fire brigade was also involved in the process. Handy machines were also provided to councillors to disinfect internal streets, where fire tenders could not enter. However, the drives were stopped after the unlocking process started. MC ferries labourers to stationAs labourers struggled to go back to their native places after the imposition of the lockdown, the MC played a crucial role in dropping them off to the railway station, once the Union government commenced special trains for them. As there was little or no public transport during the time, MC had started a special bus service to take them to the station. Sidhwan waterfront development projectAs authorities have completed the first phase of the waterfront development project alongside Sidhwan canal in Sarabha Nagar area, the place has become a favourite haunt of residents, especially morning and evening walkers. Apart from residents who come to spend leisure time with their families, a large number of cyclists also visit the place as it has a separate cycling and jogging track. The area from Pakhowal road canal bridge to Gill road canal bridge will be developed under the second phase. Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said leisure valleys are also being developed in BRS Nagar, Haibowal, Sarabha Nagar, Tajpur road among others areas to increase the green cover in the city. As directed by National Green Tribunal (NGT), micro forests are also being developed on the banks of Buddha Nullah. Recently, a team led by MC secretary Jasdev Sekhon took steps to beautify a park in Rose Garden, using waste material under the ‘Best-out-of-waste’ initiative. Clock Tower restored to original glory In shambles for years, the iconic Victoria Memorial Clock Tower (Ghanta Ghar), established in 1906 now dons a new look as the MC undertook a Rs 66 lakh project to revamp it. The mechanical clock, which was lying non-functional for a long time, has also been repaired.Smart city projects picks up pace:The Ludhiana Smart City Limited has started work on major projects, including Pakhowal Road ROB/RUBs, transformation of Malhar road as smart road, and rejuvenation of Sarabha Nagar market, among others. The LED streetlights project, however, has not been completed even after two years. Swachh Survekshan 2020 ranking and award:In the Swachh Survekshan-2020, the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) bagged the ‘Best big city in innovation and best practices’ award among cities having a population of more than 10 lakh. In all, 47 cities contested under the category, out of which the city secured 34th rank with 3, 113.06 points out of 6, 000. Downs:Buddha Nullah pollution continues to be a bane: Despite the state government and MC’s tall claims of spending Rs 650 crore on the cleaning of Buddha Nullah, it continues to remain highly polluted. What’s more, authorities have also found over 950 permanent encroachments alongside it. Around 200 encroachments, in form of animal sheds and houses, were razed in December. No end to stray dogs menace:The stray dog sterilisation project was disrupted thrice this year as there was a shortage of staff due to labour exodus. Residents’ patience wore thin as there was no respite from dog bite cases, On December 10, nearly 15 residents, including children, were bitten by a stray dog in BRS Nagar on December 10. No solution for solid waste:Facing the heat from the National Green Tribunal, the civic body has started working on solid waste management. Efforts are on to start collecting segregated waste from households. But dumping of garbage on roadsides and at secondary dumping points continue to put a blot on the face of the city. The civic body has also failed to find a solution to 16 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste dumped at MC’s main dump site. Adding to the woes, A2Z company, the firm involved in lifting of garbage from the city, has served a self-termination notice, and from February 2021, the MC will have to manage garbage collection on its own. No upgrade for fire brigade Three years have elapsed after 16 lives, including nine of firefighters, were lost in the plastic factory tragedy of November 2017, but the state government and the civic body have failed to upgrade the firefighting equipment. The fire brigade also does not have fire safety masks, suits or hydraulic ladders. It also faces an acute staff crunch, even as the city sees a number of fire incidents from time to time. Stray cattle menaceWith MC facing a shortage of space to shelter stray cattle, the animals continue to pose grave danger to the lives of the commuters. Despite collecting over Rs 30 lakh as cow cess every month, the civic body has failed to find a solution to the problem. The MC had established a cow shelter at Burj Powat village in July, with a capacity to shelter over 150 cattle, but the civic body has failed to start the shifting process of cattle.Road samples fail quality tests:Even after the civic body spent around Rs 630 crore on the construction and maintenance of roads and streets in the last five years, the roads remain treacherous for commuters in the absence of quality check. Even after cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and mayor Balkar Sandhu took a strict stand against errant contractors, there is very little improvement in terms of quality of work due to the nexus between the contractors and the MC officials. Two recently roads constructed in the ward of mayor Balkar Sandhu also got damaged in the month of December. Fuel theft cases:In a major embarrassment to the civic body, its own staff was found involved in fuel theft. In the first week of December, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal ordered the suspension of chief sanitary inspector Jagtar Singh and two sanitary inspectors, Gurinder Singh and Satinderjit Singh Bawa for the theft. Services of a contractual driver, Kulwant Singh were also terminated. Satinderjit had already been suspended in October after the mayor caught him and a driver stealing 43 litres of fuel allocated for a fogging machines.Jobs not provided to slain firefighters’ kin Three years have elapsed since the plastic factory fire mishap, but the kin of three out of the nine firefighters killed in the tragedy, have still not been provided jobs or compensation by the government. The affected families include those of contractual firefighters, Manpreet, Sukhdev and Vishal.Vending zones notified, but not establishedStreet vendors are up in arms against the civic body as it is carrying on with the anti-encroachment drive without establishing vending zones in the city. The setting up of vending zones has been hanging fire for six years now. Recently, the MC had got 64 vending zones notified by the local bodies department, but nothing has been done at the ground level to establish the vending zones yet. Meanwhile, street vendors and shopkeepers continue to be a hurdle in the smooth flow of traffic in different parts of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-at-a-standstill-but-mc-at-work/story-J2Zv7MBObYzk5ptSxSB88N.html

26-12-2020||Pune||Kausarbaug residents protest against leasing amenity plot||A large number of Kausarbaug residents, including young children, staged a protest on Friday against Kausarbaug co-operative housing society management in Kondhwa for allotting a reserved plot meant for sports activity for children to a private person for carrying out commercial sports and marriage functions.The residents raised slogans against the management stating that the 40,000 square feet open plot was meant exclusively for sports activities for society children and should not have been leased to a private person for profiteering.The protests began just before the start of Friday prayers when the citizens distributed pamphlets condemning privatisation of the public plot by the society management committee. Some skirmishes took place during the protest after which the Kondhwa police were summoned to defuse the situation.Nisar Attar, a society resident, said, “The society has illegally allotted the plot to a private person who is developing the space for profit. Our children don’t have any place to play and it will be a very costly exercise if our children decide to opt for playing in the said plot. Parking issues and women’s security are of serious concern before the residents. We demand strict action against the committee members and an immediate end to the commercialisation of amenity space of our society.”Kausarbaug society chairman advocate Rahman, said, “We have given the plot to develop a sports ground and false allegations are being levelled that we have given it for marriage functions. We have named it, Kausarbaug sports academy, where society children will get an opportunity to play sports. We have informed the police that we have given the ground for sports for children both inside and outside the society. We have passed a general resolution regarding the same, where everybody was taken into confidence, before we went ahead with the allotment. The person who has taken over the ground has spent lots of money for its development. We have not constructed any shed.”Mohammad Zia, another protesting resident, said, “It is a major scam being perpetrated by the committee members for purely profit motives. This commercial project has disturbed peace in the area and leading to problems like traffic jams and no space for parking during prayer times. The managing committee acted dishonestly and cheated the society residents and executed the project during the quietude of pandemic. It has illegally changed the status of the plot to commercial one and deserves strictest penal action as per the law.”Another resident Mohammad Anas Qureshi described the managing committee’s act as treachery and said, “An amenity plot cannot be commercialised and it has been reserved for sports recreation purpose exclusively for the society. We have petitioned to the police and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and will ensure that culprits are punished.”Kausarbaug residential society has over 1,200 members and also houses the biggest mosque of Kondhwa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/kausarbaug-residents-protest-against-leasing-amenity-plot/story-K6BD9f4Uot6hMIFjA3xorN.html

They have been facing the vicious cycle and atrocities of the central government for the last one month, but the BJP government in its stubbornness and arrogance is unable to understand the suffering of farmers,” Pilot said in a tweet. “The central government should repeal the anti-agrarian laws passed in the undemocratic process and protect the interests of the Annadata by giving rights to the struggling peasant brothers in the bitter cold,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/centre-too-arrogant-to-empathise-with-farmers-plight-pilot/story-9u8TsEI3JWBdDGDLqh1S0O.html

26-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh sees 37% dip in snatching cases this year||Only 77 cases of snatching were reported in Chandigarh this year, lowest in five years and down from 122 in 2019, mainly due to restrictions imposed in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. Police claim other initiatives such as mapping of snatching-prone areas, registration of cases against snatchers who stopped attending court hearings and making it compulsory for deputy superintendents of police and station house officers to visit the crime spot also helped in keeping the number low.However, with just under 50% cases solved, police have a lot of catching up to do next year. Among 77 cases, police are yet to trace the snatchers in 40 cases. Moreover, southern sectors, which provide an easy escape route to Mohali and surrounding villages, remain most prone to snatching. As many as 53 cases were reported in the southern division (which comprises police stations of Sectors 31, 34, 36, 39, 49 and Maloya), followed by 17 in east division (Sectors 19, 26, Industrial Area, Manimajra, Mauli Jagran and IT Park) and just six in central division (Sectors 3, 11, 17 and Sarangpur). The southern belt is also densely populated, which makes it easier for snatchers to spot the prey, strike and escape, said a senior police official, not wishing to be named. “We are putting in our efforts. The coordination among the tricity police has improved, which will go a long way in plugging the escape routes,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP), Kuldeep Singh Chahal. Drug addiction main reason, mobile phones prime catch “As many as 90% snatchers arrested this year were hooked to drugs, and committed the crime to fund their addiction,” said another senior official. Investigations show that mobile phones are the most targeted items, owing to easy resale in secondhand market without any documentation. While 36% of the stolen items were mobile phones, 30% were bags and purses and 16% were gold chains. “Most mobile phones are snatched when people are talking on them and are least alert,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-sees-37-dip-in-snatching-cases-this-year/story-G64wap8c39y4bERk2nAtHO.html

26-12-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news||MC’s garbage collection drive finds few takers The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation’s latest attempt at door-to-door segregated garbage collection hasn’t got the expected response. While the garbage collection vehicles made umpteen rounds of Sectors 1 to 30 over the past three days, city residents didn’t seem interested. Many of them didn’t even come out of their houses to hand over the garbage leave alone segregate it. “The MC will have to change its strategy and go to houses the way the garbage collectors do with rehris (carts). In Chandigarh, the literacy level may be high but awareness about such issues is low. A little inconvenience and people don’t participate,” said an MC official involved in the drive. Chandigarh cops go the extra mile to track vehicle thieves With vehicle thefts on the rise, Chandigarh Police have finally got cracking. Breaking from the practice of the station house officers (SHOs) not being a part of raids to arrest vehicle theft accused, an SHO of a police station in the south division of the UT was recently asked to lead the team conducting raids in another state. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal asked the inspector to go the extra mile. “SHOs can’t pass the buck. A crime is a crime and arresting the accused is the aim,” a UT police officer said. Politicians forget Covid safety in Panchkula MC campaign Leaders campaigning for the Panchkula municipal corporation elections did not adhere to Covid-19 safety guidelines whether it was maintaining social distancing or wearing masks properly. There seemed to be no concern about the health of voters. A video shared on WhatsApp showed Panchkula BJP MLA Gian Chand Gupta and other leaders interacting with children and dancing to rhymes in a packed room without masks. It would have been a welcome gesture in normal times but certainly not during the pandemic. No parent would appreciate putting their child at risk, particularly at a time when the leaders have been holding rallies and interacting with people of all walks. Online talent show for dogs leaves pet lovers awestruck Pet lovers had a reason to cheer when Rotaract Club, Chandigarh Himalayan, organised Pawestruck, a virtual talent show for pets, recently. Nearly 70 pets participated and were given challenges to complete at home over four days which concluded on December 20. Five winners were selected and won free grooming sessions for their pets. Chandigarh has country’s biggest RWA umbrella? The Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) which started two years ago, now boasts of 93 member RWAs, which members claim make it the biggest umbrella RWA body of the country.

26-12-2020||Bangalore||‘Which astrologer said it?’ Ex-PM Deve Gowda on BJP-JD(S) merger rumours||Rejecting speculation about his party’s merger with the BJP, former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda on Saturday asserted JD(S) was here to stay and would strive to come to power on its own in the 2023 assembly polls.He also hit out at the Congress for questioning his secular credentials and blamed it for the collapse of the JDS-Congress government in Karnataka and levelled allegations against the party.Breaking his silence on rumours about the merger with the saffron party, which he termed as an “entertainment programme”, the JD(S) patriarch said, with his clarification, the speculation should end.“Since the last three months several things have been said about our party, it can be called an entertainment programme.JD(S) is a regional party and the pain behind saving and building a regional party will only be known to its workers, office bearers and its head,” Gowda told reporters.Claiming that political leaders were speaking about JD(S)’ irrelevance,the 87-year-old leader said no one can shake or remove his party so easily.“It is not just Deve Gowda and his son, there are people to save this party not only during my lifetime, but even after me,” he added.Amid rumours of a possible merger, JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy, also Gowda’s son, and Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa had last week issued separate statements, dismissing it as far from the truth.There has been speculation for some months now about the merger, with Kumaraswamy twice meeting Yediyurappa personally at his official residence and JD(S)’ alleged softening of stand towards the ruling BJP in the state.Also JD(S) extending its support for the passage of the contentious land reforms bill in the Legislative Council after initially opposing it, and support to BJP in its no-confidence motion against the Council Chairman did add to the speculation.To a specific question on merger, Gowda said “Which astrologer has said it? ..These are childish talks...I was a former Prime Minister.Will I take my party to someone’s doorsteps?” Asked about 2023 elections, Gowda said the JD(S) was working towards coming to power on its own.“Congress is a big party and they have strength to bring the party to power.I’m not saying we have that strength, but we will strive for it, and will not sit quiet. There is no question. We will fight to come to power,” he said. Gowda hit out at the Congress party during the press conference.“I can speak a lot about Congress..” he said, as he noted that he too was a Congressman in the past.Stating that he had not gone to anyone’s door asking for his son Kumaraswamy to be made the Chief Minister after the 2018 assembly polls, he said “I invited all the secular leaders of the country for swearing-in of (Congress-JDS government)-why? To give strength to the Congress that had lost strength in 18-20 states...Who destroyed it?” Gowda hit out at the Congress, also Siddaramaiah, for trying to test his secular credentials.“On the issue of removing the legislative council Chairman, a former Chief Minister who is also a senior Congress leader (Siddaramaiah) by taking my name has spoken about testing my secular stand (for supporting BJP’s no-confidence motion).” He claimed Chairman K Pratapachandra Shetty was ready to resign, but the Congress party to which he belongs was not allowing him, “because they want to test Gowda’s secular credentials.” Gowda accused the Congress of misleading Muslims, and trying to destroy JD(S)’s secular credentials. “....none of them (Congress leaders) had gone to Godhra (immediately after riots).These people will save Muslims!They say in Parliament proceedings that theirs is soft Hindutva.Now I don’t understand soft and hard Hindutva,” he said.“Rahul Gandhi, who is projected as the future Prime Minister of the country, during the poll campaign had said Deve Gowda’s party is a B-team of BJP. This was for a former PM,” he said as he hit out at the state Congress leaders asking “who made him say this? Was their intention to save JD(S) or to finish it? and what was the outcome?” On the political slugfest between Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah, Gowda said he has sought putting an end to the “entertainment programme” from the JD(S) side.“Let them build their party, let us build ours.” Gowda has convened a mega meeting of the JD(S) on January 7, 2021, at Palace Grounds in Bengaluru.“Those who are honest will come, those who arent will go.This meeting will reveal the reality,” he said.He also said the JD(S) will have a core committee in place with 8-9 leaders and discuss revamping the party after January 15, aimed at strengthening it.“We will save and build this party, a regional party is necessary for the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/which-astrologer-said-it-ex-pm-deve-gowda-on-bjp-jd-s-merger-rumours/story-PrkaE6rfMj9g1R0sPAxumO.html

A joint team of CIA and police had recovered 414kg Doda chura from Jagroop, a resident of Jind’s Palwan along with the truck. The next day, police arrested his accomplice Rakesh Kumar of Karnal for drug smuggling. The cops had deposited only 414kg contraband in treasury amount and did not unload 398.150 kg contraband from the truck, not shown in the treasury,” he added.A senior official pleading anonymity, said the CIA personnel were planning to let off Rakesh Kumar from the case and demanded Rs 10 lakh from him. “The cops also promised Rakesh that they will return 398.150 kg contraband,” he added.The assistant sub-inspectors posted at Jind CIA-1, both drug peddlers and few unknown policemen have been booked under Section 15(3), 25, 29, 59 of the NDPS Act. “We have started an investigation into the matter to ascertain the role of other cops in the drug smuggling network,” the DSP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/eight-cops-suspended-for-pilfering-seized-poppy-husk-in-jind/story-C1cx5es8wQP6TdI5gjWScO.html

The residents have made all the arrangements at schools, community centre and even their houses.Suresh Kumar, a resident of Jhanj Kalan, said they got information that a group of 30,000 farmers and labourers from Punjab will enter Haryana through Datta Singhwala border on Saturday. “We contacted a few farmers and asked them to stay at our villages. We have opened the doors for our brothers, mothers, sisters and elderly people. The women from our villages came in large numbers to prepare food for the farmers,” he added.Roshni Devi, a resident of Barodi village, said she along with two dozen women from her village reached the school, where arrangements of food and shelter are being made for Punjab farmers.“We have a lot of love for Punjab farmers, who are leading the agitation against the Union government. I had asked three women from Tarn Taran to stay at my home tonight. The residents of our village have arranged food, warm milk, halwa, energy booster food, clothes and many other things. This agitation has brought Haryana and Punjab farmers more close,” she added.Hardeep Singh, a farmer from Gurdaspur, said,“ We have never seen such arrangements and the faces of local residents shows their affection for us. Few elderly people, who were waiting for us at Jhanj Kalan, told us to come back only after winning this battle against the government. There are no problems due to SYL between us and politicians from both the states are raising this issue for their benefits and we (farmers) will solve this issue on our own,” he added.He said farmers, including women from Punjab’s Amritsar and Tarn Taran, are in their group and they will head towards Delhi borders in the morning.Jind deputy commissioner Aditya Dahiya said he has deployed 27 duty magistrates after receiving information about entry of Punjab farmers in the district. “Our ambulances and fire brigades are also deployed near the gathering.

It is clear that the BJP-JJP coalition government has lost the confidence of its own legislators,” Hooda claimed. Responding to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s remarks that there is no need to call a special session of the assembly, Hooda said that protest by Haryana farmers was reason enough to do so. “Every day a protesting farmer dies due to biting cold. Does the state government not consider such a big agitation of farmers as an issue which merits discussion,” he said.“In this battle between the farmers and the government, many legislators of coalition partner JJP have also spoken in support of the farmers. It is clear that the BJP-JJP coalition government has lost not only public support but also the confidence of its own legislators,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hooda-demands-special-haryana-assembly-session-says-bjp-jjp-coalition-has-lost-support-of-mlas/story-qR0v5pKImyJ0KQEX1A6AvL.html

The farmers have unanimously decided to take over Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s rally on January 3 at Behal. We will occupy the venue of Khattar’s rally on January 2,” he added.A day earlier Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal said the chief minister’s rally at Behal in his home constituency Loharu was postponed due to polling of votes for the civic body elections on December 27. “ Some people were announcing to boycott CM’s rally, I want to tell them that the Jal Adhikar rally would be held at any cost,” Dalal added.Charuni slams Dushyant, Birender SinghBhartiya Kisan union (Charuni) state president Gurnam Singh Charuni has hit out at Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and senior BJP leader Birender Singh.“Chautala claims to be the political heir of Devi Lal but he is a disgrace on his name and similarly Birender Singh on the name of peasant leader Sir Chhotu Ram. Devi Lal and Chhotu Ram sacrificed their lives for the farmers’ struggle but Dushyant and Birender are just doing politics. Birender is making a fool of us by extending support to farmers and his son Brijendra Singh is enjoying as a BJP MP,” he added.On being asked about Dushyant’s remarks to mediate between the farmers and government, Charuni said where was Chautala when his government lodged cases against them, dug the road to restrict their march to Delhi borders and used water cannons and tear gas shells to disperse them. “It was the Haryana government which created hurdles for us. Why did Chautala remain mum when Haryana Police lathicharged us. We are capable enough to hold dialogues with the government,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-ban-entry-of-bjp-jjp-leaders-in-haryana-agriculture-minister-s-home-constituency/story-M0ZTW2y6Zme9SBSYwK7hoN.html
26-12-2020||Chandigarh||Guest Column: We need to learn to live with our mistakes||One thing that we human beings have in common is that we all make mistakes. One way or another, sooner or later, we all do it. If you’ve made mistakes in this life, know that you are not alone. Everyone on the planet does it. Mistakes are the ultimate sign that we are human. We should be comfortable making mistakes, admitting them and sharing them with one another from an early age. That is healthy as we will then be more accepting of our own humanity and feel much more at ease with each other. Perhaps we will be much more supportive of each other too. But that is so often not the case. Collectively, we tend to be quite afraid of making mistakes and feel immensely uncomfortable afterwards. It could be that throughout human history our survival has relied on us not making mistakes. Nature’s diktat: One mistake and you’ll be dead, could have been so ingrained in our DNA that it instinctively comes through when we do something wrong. With many social structures, religions and cultures around the world severely condemning people for making mistakes throughout the ages, our brains actually flash an error message when we go against social norms. Generally speaking, we are not at ease with making mistakes, with being wrong, with failure, with falling outside norms, and that much more. We don’t want to disappoint people whose approval we want.We are just not very comfortable with being human. The school system alone teaches us from a young age that being wrong won’t lead to success – think about the test papers with red marks. So many of our systems, along with our upbringing, can so often create shame, pain, and tell us that we are ‘bad’ people. Or simply not good enough. Learn to say that you are sorry both to yourself and to those whom you’ve hurt through your mistakes. By apologising to those you’ve wronged, you take responsibility and offer a chance for closure and healing. You also offer them a chance to forgive you. By apologising to yourself, you offer yourself compassion, for not knowing any better, or for simply screwing up in spite of knowing better. We all have our own baggage, and we need to learn to cut ourselves some slack and learn to forgive ourselves. This is also an excellent chance to engage your own inner critic and recognise the patterns that are sabotaging your ability to forgive yourself. Learn to quiet that harsh inner voice and look beyond the mistake – be kind to yourself. In many ways, being wrong is the only option we can count on as humans. The story of humanity is after all built on endless mistakes – and it is only by learning how to acknowledge them to ourselves and to one another that we can truly heal our story, and inherently our planet. The more obsessed we are with being right, the more walls we put between ourselves and the world. We need these walls to come down, and we need to normalise being wrong, so that we may heal and evolve in a fundamental way as a collective. There is no harm in being wrong as long as you can correct the wrong.mahavirindia@yahoo.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-we-need-to-learn-to-live-with-our-mistakes/story-D3NWIlzAgSuZWa9RwdX7jM.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||Gang targets three ATMs in four hours, hunt on for suspects||A group of four-five bike and car-borne men committed three back-to-back ATM robberies in west Delhi’s Madipur, Kirti Nagar and Naraina Vihar within four hours early on Saturday morning, police said. The three ATM robberies prompted several police teams to activate their technical as well as human intelligence network to identify and nab the suspects. In one of the three ATMs, the suspects made two attempts within an hour, the police said.Although the identity of the suspects could not be ascertained till Saturday night, the modus operandi suggests that it could be the work of a gang from Mewat in Haryana. Three separate cases were registered at the Punjabi Bagh, Kirti Nagar and Naraina Vihar police stations. “All the three ATMs — one of Punjab National Bank and two of Axis Bank — were unguarded and did not have security guards at the time of the incident. The banks are yet to give us an estimate of the exact amount stolen from three ATMs. Several teams are working on the cases,” said deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit.Police said that the robberies took place between Friday midnight and 4am on Saturday. The first robbery took place in an ATM booth located in Madipur area in Punjabi Bagh around midnight. Three men wearing caps and masks entered the ATM booth, blacked out the CCTV cameras using spray paint and cut open the money dispensing machine using a gas cutter. They took out the cash and fled, said a police officer.According to the officer, the same set of robbers then went to Kirti Nagar and targeted an ATM booth using the same modus operandi. Their third target was an ATM booth in Naraina Vihar. The footage of the CCTV cameras at the booth show that the alleged robbers arrived around 2.30am and attempted the robbery after spraying black paint on the cameras.“Due to some reason, the robbers then left the ATM. They returned around 3.30am and carried out the robbery,” the officer said, adding that the CCTVs installed on the possible routes taken by the suspects to reach the three ATMs are being scanned for clues.The police are also scanning the database of criminals who commit similar crimes and are out of jail. Their special focus is on gangs from Mewat region, who have in the recent past been involved in uprooting ATM machines or stealing money from such machines after cutting them with gas cutters.“Prime facie, it appears that the suspects had conducted detailed reconnaissance of the three ATMs before targeting them,” added the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gang-targets-three-atms-in-four-hours-hunt-on-for-suspects/story-cbD6BWXUP2YIWxOqcMZtSK.html
26-12-2020||City||Pune’s home farmers cultivate a taste for turmeric grown in their back-yards, terraces||PUNE Turmeric has found a place in the Indian kitchen for centuries. Pune residents are now growing turmeric in their backyards.Sujata Naphade, a home maker and resident of Pashan, and Nishika Patel, a homemaker and resident of Kondhwa, are two such “home farmers”.Naphade, 44, has been growing turmeric in her backyard for four years, something that Patel is doing on her terrace. “It’s all about the quality of the soil, the weather, and lots of patience. There are many criteria at play so just a technique won’t guarantee success as the major role here is played by unpredictable factors, like the rains,” said Naphade, who has also done her graduation in B-tech Agriculture. Nahpade advises people to first learn about the soil required, depending on the area of cultivation and the seasonal weather. According to her the best time to plant turmeric is in March or April. As turmeric does not have any seeds, one can buy fresh organic harvest in late December or January from a known market vendor or a farmer.Growing turmeric is a long process that takes up to 10 months, but the harvest done even in a one-foot diameter pot or a “grow bag”, will reap a minimum of around 1-1.5kg of turmeric.Depending on the soil, it will be enough to last a whole year of use for a small family. To grow turmeric requires a one-by-one foot diametre pot, dry leaves, soil, and some kitchen waste, said Naphade. One has to start by layering the soil and dry leaves alternatively. The top layer should be of the soil mixed with kitchen waste and any other organic manure. The plant has to be watered every two-to-three days. Keep adding dry leaves every month to keep the fertility and quality of soil stable. “I’ve always been interested in gardening as a child with my father. Now we don’t get chemical-free organic fruits and vegetables anymore. Wanting to eat natural, organic, seasonal food was a major reason for us to start growing our fruits and vegetables. And coming from an agricultural background solidified the base of the plan to grow our food at home,” she said. “Another reason for us to continue this was to make sure we learn to teach our kids. The previous generations knew everything about farming and agriculture, but the future ones won’t know anything as we haven’t learned enough to teach them. Our kids won’t know anything about their food and well-being,” added Naphade. Patel has been growing turmeric for three years on the terrace of her flat. “It is easy as long as you take good care of the plant. It takes good sunlight and soil to grow. One has to take care of the amount of sunlight the plant receives, along with the water. If you water way too much, the turmeric will get spoilt,” she said. For her, its been a learning journey. “There are some times when the harvest is good. And some times when you make mistakes and it does not come out best. But, it’s really good knowing that the food you’re eating is grown by you,” said Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-s-home-farmers-cultivate-a-taste-for-turmeric-grown-in-their-back-yards-terraces/story-hcAKCwTqiRHEjyjJCeyBhK.html
26-12-2020||Jaipur||‘Bye-bye. We’re quitting!’ RLP pulls out of NDA over farm bills says chief Beniwal||After Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Rashtriya Loktantric Party (RLP) chief Hanuman Beniwal also walked out of National Democratic Alliance on Saturday. While addressing farmers’ rally in Shahjahanpur in Rajasthan’s Alwar district, Beniwal said, “Bye-bye. We are quitting NDA. Nothing is above the pride of farmers in the country.” State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Mukesh Pareekh said that Beniwal’s party is an independent party and a one man’s unit. “Just because of him, the BJP left the parliamentary seat from Nagaur and helped him in winning the election,” he said.“Earlier, he had supported the agri laws but now just to gain political mileage he had quit the alliance,” Pareekh added. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in September had also pulled out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition at the Centre over the passage of contentious farm bills passed in Parliament earlier this month. Also read: ‘Wake up’ - Digvijaya Singh calls upon Congress members to join farmers’ stirThousands of RLP supporters joined the farmers protest on Saturday on Jaipur-Delhi National Highway in Shahjahanpur along the Rajasthan-Haryana border. Around 3 pm on Saturday, hundreds of vehicles had reached the border from Kotputli area of Jaipur rural. The RLP workers had put up a separate pandal on the stretch from where the farmers have been protesting on the highway for 14-days. “I request the central government to not play with flames. Any government who has dared to go against has been dethroned. Because of this act, agriculture mandis will end. Why didn’t the government consult the farmers? Because of this act land mafias raj will increase. I don’t understand why is the government not rolling back the laws,” said Beniwal at the protest site. Also read: Kerala gold smuggling case - Customs to move high court against jail deptCalling himself a son of a farmer, Beniwal said he had always supported them. “The central government is in the mood to muscle down the farmers’ protest. But this is the issue of sustenance and pride of farmers and we are standing with them,” he said.Last week, the disappointed RLP chief, who is a Lok Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) from Nagaur, resigned from three parliament committees in support of farmer’s issue. Farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana and Gujarat had started proceeding towards Delhi earlier this month but were stopped by the Rewari police at the Haryana-Rajasthan border. Since then, they have been protesting at Shahjahanpur in Alwar district at Rajasthan-Haryana border. RLP in Rajasthan The party has a Member of Parliament from Nagaur (Hanuman Beniwal) and three MLAs from Merta, Khinvsar and Bhopalgarh assembly constituencies. The RLP, which was formed before the 2018 assembly elections, had fielded candidates on 57 constituencies, won three and received a vote of share of 2.40 per cent. The party contested in alliance with the BJP on Nagaur Lok Sabha seat in 2019, thereafter on Khinvsar bypolls. The decision of breaking tie will not have much of an impact on the NDA. The BJP in Rajasthan is in opposition with 71 MLAs - far below the majority figure.Though RLP chief Beniwal is a vocal detractor of chief minister Ashok Gehlot and ex-CM Vasundhara Raje but if Gehlot woo him, it may consolidate his position in circumstances that arise during political crisis in Rajasthan.The BTP with two MLAs has already withdrawn its support from the Congress. If the RLP becomes a Congress ally, it will offset the impact caused by the BTP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/bye-bye-we-re-quitting-rlp-pulls-out-of-nda-over-farm-bills-says-chief-beniwal/story-Xfwq9rImkgyNQRsR30beEM.html
26-12-2020||Pune||Test drive of ‘death stretch’ from New Katraj Tunnel to Navale bridge chowk||Using the New Katraj tunnel to Navale bridge chowk stretch has become a risky affair for motorists, two-wheeler riders and pedestrians, as the road is witness to regular mishaps. The main observation cited by road experts is that the road has a long slope where heavy vehicles use the decline to shut down their engine to save fuel which may cause accidents as in many cases the brakes stops to function. On November 29, three persons lost their lives after a heavy vehicle dashed them on the highway near Narhe exit on the service road. HT conducted a test drive on December 19 (Saturday) in a truck starting from New Katraj tunnel via Narhe service road exit till Navale bridge chowk. To understand the precautions and safety measures that need to be taken by truck drivers, especially on the slope, we were accompanied by Swapnil Pangare, area sales manager of KGP Auto Ltd, Ghatge Trucking BharatBenz dealer with their heavy truck driver Jamir Shaikh. Both of them explained on how to drive steadily and the things that need to be followed while driving through the slope stretch of the road to avoid accidents. Test drive 1. At 8.30 am, I along with driver Jamir got into the truck which has a heavy load capacity up to 28 tonnes. We started from Navale bridge chowk towards the new Katraj tunnel 2. While going towards the new Katraj tunnel, Jamir showed some of the important buttons inside the driver cabin which are used to control the vehicle. One such button is called “Constant Throttle Valve” (CTV). It is mainly used to control the engine brakes while the vehicle is on slope. The button was located on the right side of the driver’s steering wheel. “There are six diesel sprinkling nozzles in the engine. After switching on this button, only one diesel nozzle supply is on and other five remain closed. This step saves diesel and also the vehicle ignition is on and air supply to brakes remains constant. Many trucks do not have this facility, and some drivers do not use it even if the heavy vehicle is fitted with the button,” Pangare said. 3. In 15 minutes we crossed the tunnel and by taking the ‘U’ turn on the highway we started coming back from the tunnel towards the Navale bridge chowk which is the danger stretch that sees accidents. 4. From halfway through the tunnel, the slope on the highway started and the truck gained speed (there is speed limit of 80 kmph on this highway). Jamir said, “There is a speed lock of 50 kmph to the truck and even on the slope if the ignition is on we control the vehicle on first or second gear.” After the tunnel ended, the slope started towards the Dari Pul bridge and to show the mistake that some drivers commit, Jamir took the vehicle on ‘neutral’ gear. Soon, the speed of the vehicle almost touched 90 kmph 5. Explaining the wrong practise of putting the heavy vehicle on neutral gear, Pangare said, “When a truck driver crosses the tunnel before the Dari Pul bridge, he puts on the neutral gear. Later, when he approaches the Navale bridge, he starts applying brakes as other vehicles also enter the stretch. As the vehicle was in neutral gear, the liners get heated up which leads to brake failure and possible accident. There is a brake control button in every heavy vehicle or truck which should be used by the driver on such slopes, but to save a fuel of around 3 to 4 litres, they do such risky things.” 6. Driving ahead, we crossed the Dari Pul bridge and the ‘death’ stretch or accident-prone slope on the highway started. Jamir took the speeding truck in second gear. He then switched on the CTV button which controls the engine brakes and though in speed the truck was going at 50 kmph on fuel saving mode. The stretch from new Katraj tunnel to Navale bridge chowk is around 6 to 7 kms and there are several boards on this stretch installed by the Pune traffic police department appealing drivers “not to switch off the engines or put vehicle on neutral”. Rumbler strips are there at a couple of spots, and at some spots potholes were also seen. 7. By around 9.10 am we reached the Narhe service road exit which goes ahead to the Navale bridge chowk. This is the spot where the recent accident claimed three lives. As our vehicle was on control speed, Jamir slowly took the service road and finally our test drive ended at 9.15 am coming back to Navale bridge chowk. Normally the average mileage of trucks is between 3 and 6 kmpl, and to save fuel on this danger stretch drivers follow the wrong practice of switching off the engine or putting it on neutral gear. But if the engine break control button is used with ignition on, then same amount of fuel is saved along with safely passing through the slope, according to Pangare. Review “Overall, the test drive was good and we got a first-hand experience of traveling inside a speeding truck on this ‘death stretch’. It is not so difficult for drivers to control their heavy vehicles by using safety features in their vehicles, but lack of alertness or careless attitude may cause accidents. While going through the slope, we found some speeding heavy vehicles. By controlling the vehicle on gear with the help of engine brake button, one can easily control the speed avoiding any mishap. Some improvement and upgrade in road infrastructure on this stretch by NHAI is needed like repairing potholes, adding more rumbler strips and putting up of more safety sign boards and signals along the service road.” Mishap count Accidents happened on this stretch starting from new Katraj Tunnel to Navale Bridge Chowk Year/Fatal accidents/Serious accidents/Minor accidents/Total 2019/12/02/29/43 2020 (Till Nov)/14/25/09/48 Total /26/27/38/91||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/test-drive-of-death-stretch-from-new-katraj-tunnel-to-navale-bridge-chowk/story-vfmmyycT1YYEo3IvU95LMI.html
26-12-2020||Pune||Startup mantra: Lighting up O2 supply requirement in Pune||It has been nine months since the Covid-19 outbreak began in the country. So far, there have been three crucial stages in the fight against this pandemic. First, detection of the coronavirus infection; second, enrichment of oxygen in order to decrease the dependency on ventilator units at hospitals; and the third and final stage is now vaccine distribution – especially last-mile delivery – across the country. Pune’s Science start-up and research institute ecosystem has played a crucial role in all these three stages of the Covid-19 outbreak. The Venture Centre of the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), alone, has supported and incubated 25 start-ups, of which three have played a super-important role in the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Covid-19 testingIn the first phase, detection of the coronavirus infection, was the testing procedure. The RTPCR test took at least 24 hours to produce results. This was because of a very limited number of approved labs and kits available across the country for testing swab samples. MyLab Discovery Solutions developed the first made-in-India PathoDetect Covid-19 Qualitative PCR test kit in a record time. It further received necessary commercial approvals and the kit was launched across the country. Phase 2: Oxygen EnrichmentWith a rising number of Covid-19 cases, patients in a serious medical condition, requiring oxygen and ventilator support, were also increasing exponentially. The healthcare systems at Covid-19 hotspots across the country were failing only because patients were not able to get oxygenated or ventilated beds in hospitals. Genrich Membranes Pvt Ltd, a start-up founded by Dr Ulhas Kharul and Dr Rajendra Kharul, stepped in at this crucial stage and supplied oxygen enrichment units (OEU) to hospitals. The NCL Venture Centre also played a key role in bringing together Genrich and Bharat Electronic Limited (BEL) to manufacture these units. The feedback received from hospitals was encouraging as the number of patients requiring ventilator support started decreasing due to the OEUs. Genrich is now in the process of obtaining an ISO 13485 certification for their product so that private hospitals can avail of the benefits of their product on a large scale. Genrich not only provided OEUs, but also developed a prototype for virus-free air kits for frontline healthcare workers and doctors who had to wear the PPE kits for long hours while dealing with Covid-19 patients. Phase 3: Vaccine distributionVaccine candidates are in process of getting emergency approval from the central government. However, the crucial task is to transport the vaccines vials to the farthest locations in the country. At present, traditional ice packs are being considered as vaccine carriers, but they pose many challenges, like maintaining the adequate temperatures till the vaccine is administered. The efficacy of the vaccine depends on these conditions and it is not possible to analyse the outcomes. Blackfrog Technologies has developed a portable temperature-regulation device for last-mile transport of thermally sensitive biologicals like vaccines, blood, serums etc. The technology will be used for transport of biological samples (blood, sputum) from hospitals/remote areas to diagnostic centres that conduct Covid-19 testing. They have already donated a unit of Emvólio - their portable medical-grade refrigeration system to the Udupi District Government Hospital for safe and efficient transport of Covid-19 specimens to laboratories. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Other Pune based start-ups involved in Covid-19 prevention, and precautionary, measures Atmen TechnoventionThe company has developed an endotracheal tube obstruction monitoring device. Covid-19 patients often experience shortness of breath, i.e. ARDS (Acute respiratory distress syndrome). All patients with this symptom are intubated using an endotracheal tube. Currently, clinicians monitor the endotracheal tube manually, which needs an experienced person. The company is also developing portable and affordable ventilators.ZeroplastDeveloping nanocellulose based 100% soil compostable products as an alternative to single-use plastics. Currently, working on eco-friendly, food-safe, hygienic, antibacterial and antiviral hand gloves made from compostable biopolymers and reusable masks coated with nanocellulose formulation which offers antiviral and antibacterial properties.Better SuitsDeveloping protective gear for frontline warriors and healthcare workers. They are developing a protective suit with the following properties: (a) reusable, breathable, and heat-absorbing fabric (b) smart indicators that can indicate contamination levels and (c) antiviral coating.Seagull BiosolutionsDeveloping immunodiagnostics ELISA kits using the Active Virosome (AV)-expressing S protein of Covid-19.Cyca OncosolutionsRepurposing an immune booster nutritional supplement as a therapeutic candidate for Covid-19. To be used as an inhaler for direct delivery to lungs.JeevtronicsThe company has developed a dual powered defibrillator. This product is to be used in ICUs in case of sudden cardiac arrest for patients suffering from Covid-19.Newndra InnovationsTheir flagship assistive device - JaipurBelt is an unpowered, lightweight (weight of helmet), efficient and affordable and patented exoskeleton that can protect the medical staff, healthcare workers and nurses from the fatigue and stress on their back due to long hours of work activities by off-loading the spine and waist up to a configured, variable limit without restricting body movements.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interesting Statistics/info• Of 339 NCL employees, 24 were found seropositive in a voluntary survey• Venture Centre is the only second organisation in India after Biocon Pharma in Bengaluru which has established a facility of government-supported Centre for Biopharma Analysis (CBA)• Venture Centre is the nerve centre for the task force constituted for repurposing of drugs for Covid-19• Under CAWACH initiative a nation-wide call has been announced requesting proposals from start-ups working on developing solutions for Covid-19 for funding assistance up to Rs 2 crore per start-up. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Experts speak:Dr Venugopalan Premnath, head, Venture Centre, NCL“Pune has a culture of respecting knowledge and nurturing innovators. Thus, the Pune innovation ecosystem is one of the best for knowledge-intensive, inventive start-ups to take birth and grow. Pune has a conducive research culture, density of scientists and engineers, key scientific facilities, good quality of life to attract talent and a pool of budding entrepreneurs. Where it falls short is in a pool of investors with a risk appetite for scientific enterprises, maturity in innovation management capabilities in R&D institutions and a weak pool of experienced entrepreneurs in the scientific business space. Pune is working towards improving these weaknesses. Venture Centre has started TechEx.in as a technology transfer and innovation management hub. During the Covid pandemic, Pune’s start-up community really rose to the occasion and made us realise how important it is to nurture a start-up pool.”Dr Rajendra Kharul, director, Genrich Membranes“Pune ecosystem is quite useful and helpful. Genrich is fortunate to be a part of such a thriving ecosystem. The biggest advantage of such an ecosystem is that the peers, founders can talk to each other and exchange information on critical issues which saves their time.”MyLab Discovery Solutions Hasmukh Rawal and Shailendra Kawade founded Mylab Discovery Solutions in 2016. The company was self-funded and developed affordable diagnostic solutions. The two co-founders were working with a US-based laboratory equipment giant Thermo Fisher before they started this company. Their manufacturing facility is located at Lonavala Industrial Estate and approved by Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation Pre-COVID revenue of Rs 44 crore Funding of Rs 1 crore from Action Covid-19 Team (ACT); undisclosed amount from Technology Development Board (TDB), Serum Institute of India and AP Globale in April 2020. Genrich Membranes NCL scientist Dr Ulhas Kharul along with Dr Rajendra Kharul and Kiran Bansode started the company in March 2015 It is a spin-off company based on proprietary technology from CSIR-NCL Received grant of Rs 44 lakh from BIRAC in 2016; and NSTEB equity-funding of Rs 50 lakh in 2017 ---------------- Blackfrog Technologies Founded by Mayur Shetty, Donson Dsouza and Ashlesh Bhat in November 2015 Incubated with Manipal Universal Technology Business Incubator Received BIRAC Biotechnology Ignition Grant of Rs 50 lakh in 2017 to develop proof of concept Located in Udupi, Karnataka and supported by Venture Centre, Pune as implementation partner ---------------- CEOs/Co-Founders/researchers about idea/current status Dr Rajendra Kharul said, “We took advantage of the government scheme for scientists and thought of making use of the membrane science in the interest of society. Patients with respiratory diseases like asthma require handy enriched oxygen units like those available in the foreign countries. We thought of making such units which are affordable and easy to carry. We took help of the CSIR 800 project and installed such machines at the Chest Research Foundation, Sassoon Hospital and Primary Health Centre in Palghar. In the last one or two years we had several rounds of detailed discussion with private and government hospitals. During these discussions we realised that certification for the device is necessary and hence we are now obtaining ISO 13485 certification. After acquiring the certification, the product can be widely adopted in private and government hospitals.” Mayur Shetty said, “Even before the COVID19 outbreak, there was a huge requirement for effective vaccine distribution especially the last mile delivery part. Polio, BCG, MMR all require cold chain infrastructure and traditional use of ice packs drops the temperatures below 2 degree which affects efficacy of vaccine. Our product was designed in 2018 and now we are scaling up the manufacturing. At present we have capacity if 250 units per month and we are increasing it to 350 per month. Considering that the COVID19 vaccine is on horizon, we are working with ISO 13485 complaint contract manufacturer which will enable us to produce one lakh units per month. We are live on ground in three states for delivering animal vaccines, human vaccines and COVID19 specimens like nasal and throat swabs.” Hasmukh Rawal said, “When the first COVID19 case was identified in India and there was no Indian test available, we knew that the country will have to struggle to meet the testing demands. We have a deep expertise in molecular testing due to years of a work in this domain. We got our complete research team to focus on developing a test which is highly reliable and cost effective. Within six weeks we developed a test which passed the most stringent of criteria and at one- fourth the cost of existing tests. Our investors helped us to scale from near 20,000 test a week to 2 lakh tests a day. ---------------------------------------------------- Customers/Government view Dr Sudhir Patsute, medical superintendent, Dr Naidu Infectious Disease Hospital, Pune Municipal Corporation “Central line system for oxygen support to patients was not available at most government or civic hospitals. Using oxygen cylinders, transporting and refilling them was a difficult task as we were pressed for time. So, using portable oxygen enrichment units or generators was needed during the Covid-19 peak. Mild symptomatic patients could be provided with required oxygen support as the flow could be adjusted using the unit. This helped in keeping the oxygenated beds vacant for patients with severe symptoms.” Dr Awanti Golwilkar-Mehendale, consultant pathologist, AG Diagnostics “We are very happy with the kit. Availability of kits was never an issue. Results using the kit were and the technical support provided is equivalent to any other international company. The process of validation of the kit in the lab was very smooth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/startup-mantra-lighting-up-o2-supply-requirement-in-pune/story-PBBh9LlhAT2fmt2nENL89H.html
26-12-2020||Pune||MNS activists ransack Amazon warehouse in Kondhwa Budruk||Irate activists of Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) ransacked the Amazon transportation service godown located at survey number 27 in Burhani industrial estate in Kondhwa Budruk on Friday. MNS activists carrying party flags barged into the company compound, ransacked the furniture and broke window glasses with stick. The MNS action is fallout of a court notice issued to its party chief asking him to appear before the court on January 5, 2021. Following the vandalism, a case was registered by Kondhwa police against 10 unidentified persons under section 143,147,149,427,452 of IPC along with several other relevant sections of Maharashtra police act, epidemic. The complaint in the matter was filed by Amazon official. Amazon in its complaint had alleged that its posters were torn by MNS workers.The MNS workers were furious as the court had asked the party supremo and other leaders to appear before the Dindoshi court after a suit was filed in the court.MNS corporator Sainath Babar said “Amazon was informed well in advance that its application must have Marathi language on its platform. This is just the trailer and MNS will go hammer and tongs against the company if it fails to adhere to our demands of incorporation of Marathi language on its application as it is the mother tongue of the people.”The MNS had also written to the e-commerce platform that if demands were not met, then they can go to any extent to ensure that their mother tongue language demand is enforced. In November, the party had started a campaign entitled “No Marathi, No Amazon” seeking to incorporate the Marathi language in Amazon’s app.Kondhwa police station in charge Sardar Patil was unavailable for comments despite repeated attempts to reach out to him. A large number of policemen were deployed in the area to prevent the MNS activists from resorting to further vandalism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/mns-activists-ransack-amazon-warehouse-in-kondhwa-budruk/story-ArukBnFtGey5YHKVTLV3KP.html
26-12-2020||Pune||Aim to bring sports revolution via int’l university, says Sunil Kedar||We aim to bring in a sports revolution in the country with the opening of the International Sports University at the Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex, Balewadi, said Sunil Kedar, state sports and youth affairs minister on Friday. Kedar, who was in the city to interact with the city’s sports fraternity, said, “Like former PM Rajiv Gandhi, who brought Information and Technology (IT) revolution in the country which has helped various generations get employed and even prove their mettle in other countries, in the same way, the International Sports University will help bring sports revolution in the country.”A budget of Rs 400 crore has been allocated for the prestigious event. However, the state was initially planning to set up a university in Aurangabad, but considering the cost and infrastructure, the project has been moved to Pune.“If we had started the project from scratch, then we would have had to spend Rs 700 to 800 crore and it could have taken a lot of time, but in Pune, infrastructure will not be a problem,” added Kedar.The university will offer various courses including physical and sports education, sports sciences and sports medicine, sports technology, sports governance, sports management, sports media and communication, sports coaching and training.In the first phase, a three-year programme in sports science and sports technology will be started along with a three-month programme in sports coaching and training. Intake capacity for each course will be 50 students.“Focus will be not only on developing athletes who can bring medals, but producing world-class coaches in the country. We have a trend to hire coaches from other countries and this could help change that,” added Kedar.Government is also planning to set up sub-centres of universities in other parts of the state after two years. The state sports minister also stressed on providing much needed help for athletes who come from middle class families.“The sports university will create such a platform that it will give employment to all athletes who are coming from middle class families. University will give them so many options related to sports stream that even if someone does not want to play a game, they can continue to remain at the back-end in a supporting role,” added Kedar, who is expecting the university to be ready in the next three years.Omprakash Bakoria, state sports commissioner, said that the sports department is in talks with prestigious institutes like the Indian Institute of Technology and Indian Institute of Management for possible tie-ups.“We have written to IIT, Mumbai, and IIM, Ahmedabad, for possible tie-ups. We are looking to get experts from these prime institutes for our courses like Sports Technology, Sports Governance and Sports Management,” said Bakoria.The university will also help students during placements. “We will be meeting corporates associated with the field of sports. We will meet companies leading the sports manufacturing group so that our students get jobs in these companies when they complete the course,” added Bakoria.

Of these 25 travellers, who are asymptomatic, one traced by the authorities tested positive during the re-test following which his samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology for genome sequencing to ascertain if the virus is the similar to the new strain, officials said. The person, according to officials, had arrived in Pune on December 13 and tested positive as he went for RT-PCR test in the city. “The person is from Pune city and is asymptomatic. The person is currently undergoing quarantine period at home. We have sent his samples to NIV for genome sequencing,” said Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) assistant health chief, Dr Sanjeev WavareExtensive screening and tracing is going on for passengers who have travelled abroad over the last one month. These passengers are screened and tested in the wake of the new Covid-19 strain found in the United Kingdom (UK).Bhagwan Pawar, district health officer, said that of these 504 passengers, the surveillance team has traced 25 people so far. “We are working day and night to trace the others and all those who have come in contact with these passengers as a precautionary measure. The rest of the passengers will be traced very soon,” said Pawar.He further said that those who are found displaying any symptoms, will be quarantined immediately.“We are tracing all the passengers. There are around 96 passengers from the Pune rural area. Rest are from the city. After the tracing is done, we will get to know how many exhibit symptoms and accordingly, testing will be done,” said Pawar.Experts from the field opined that passengers who test positive should be retested with the TaqMan or TaqPath to confirm the new strain. Otherwise, their genomes sequencing should be done.As per the central government standard operating procedure (SOP), the list of passenger manifest from international flights shall be conveyed by the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) so that this data would be provided to the surveillance teams.Central government has issued special guidelines for those passengers who arrived in the country before the SOP was issued and a list of all such passengers has been given to the respective states and city administrations for further action, like contact tracing and institutional quarantine.There are no direct flights to the Pune airport from the UK.

Following the incident, BJP’s national general secretary and West Bengal in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya briefed Union home minister Amit Shah about the incident. “Today TMC workers attacked the car of Sunil Mondal, who is an MP. I briefed the Union home minister about it,” said Vijayvargiya, while addressing a gathering at the BJP office. TMC’s top leaders said that it was a spontaneous protest by party workers against Mondal since he hadn’t resigned as an MP. Mondal had resigned from TMC before joining the BJP on December 19. “Have you seen any such protest for Mukul Roy or Suvendu Adhikari who also defected to the BJP? They both had resigned and then joined the BJP. Mondal, however, hasn’t resigned from his MP post yet. It was a spontaneous protest,” said Kalyan Banerjee, TMC MP. On Saturday, a felicitation event was held by the BJP for the newly inducted leaders including former TMC MP and state minister Suvendu Adhikari.

Police had earlier claimed that her in-laws had dumped her body in river Dabra after killing her. In May 2019, a married woman named Sweety Kumari, along with her younger son Pawan (7), had gone missing from her house in a village under the Bheldi police station area of Saran district. Two days later, body of an unidentified woman was found near the banks of Dabra river in the area, following which, a case was lodged against unknown persons on May 17.

She also blamed the Centre of non-cooperation and ‘indulging in propaganda for petty political gains’.“Our farmer brothers & sisters have been on streets protesting against new farm laws. Instead of addressing them, PM today chose to mislead the people with half-truth & distorted facts. BJP-led Centre is not cooperating & only indulging in propaganda for petty political gains,” she tweeted, along with a letter in which she rubbished the Centre’s allegation of the non-cooperation by the Bengal government in implementing the PM Kisan Yojana. Banerjee said that the three contentious farm laws would dilute the MSP and state procurement systems, leaving farmers at the mercy of private buyers. She slammed the PM for ‘showing his apparent concern’ via a televised event rather than proactively working to resolve their issues. Mamata said that she had written two letters on the issue of PM Kisan Yojana and spoken to the minister concerned but it was them who were not cooperating. Our farmer brothers & sisters have been on streets protesting against new farm laws.

The chief minister said that her government was prepared to do anything for the benefit of the people, even if it meant supporting the politically driven schemes of the Centre which were formulated out of political agenda and were not in the interest of helping people. Banerjee said that her ideologies were consistent with the vision of the founding fathers of the country, that she had served the people of West Bengal with the right intent and that the people would give a befitting reply to those trying to malign them or their state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/centre-not-cooperating-indulging-in-propaganda-for-political-gains-mamata/story-coFKu3QGCFUR2dqS4jxyGO.html

26-12-2020||Patna||As Congress delays review of Bihar poll results, cracks begin to show||Even a month and a half after the Bihar Assembly election results were declared, the Congress party is yet to assess the reasons for its flop show despite being blamed by ally, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), for the Grand Alliance or Mahagathbandhan’s narrow loss to the NDA, and despite every other major political outfit having reviewed their poll performances. While the RJD emerged as the single largest party with victories on 75 seats, the Congress had to be content with just 19 seats, eight less than the previous elections. It was only due to the Left parties’ vastly improved performance that the GA managed to win 110 out of the 243 Assembly seats in the state. Senior party leaders including All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Tariq Anwar and Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) campaign committee chief Akhilesh Prasad Singh, said that the party needed a formal review of the defeat in order to rebuild the organisation soon. Anwar, also a former Union minister, is hopeful that the AICC would undertake the review exercise soon. “Review of the defeat in Bihar is very much on the AICC agenda,” he said, citing discussions with party leaders in Delhi. Singh blamed “flawed” electoral strategies drawn by BPCC chief Madan Mohan Jha and AICC leaders Randeep Singh Surjewala and Shaktisinh Gohil for losing the seats the party was confident of winning.Also Read: Ashwini Kumar Choubey seeks CM Nitish Kumar’s help to end strike of Bihar’s junior doctors“We lost Mithilanchal, as we refused to rethink our candidate for the Jale assembly seat, which allowed the opposition to create a Hindu-Muslim divide. I have studied (our performance on) every seat and know how the party lost. I am ready to explain it to the party senior, Rahul Gandhi,” added Singh. BPCC chief Jha said Gohil’s prolonged illness was causing the delay in review exercise. “Senior leaders often meet at Sadaqat Ashram and informally discuss the causes of the setback. However, a formal review is needed,” said Jha. A senior AICC member Kishore Kumar Jha claimed the party’s “laidback” approach had demoralised party workers. “Leaders of the RJD and the Left often criticise the Congress leadership for defeat in polls because state party leaders lacked courage. Senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari got away with criticising the party leadership. Sadly, those in key positions in the BPCC refused to react,” said Jha, adding that some leaders were avoiding the crucial review meeting to save their own skins. Recently, Shivanand Tiwari had hit out at Rahul Gandhi, claiming he lacked leadership quality and therefore didn’t inspire people. He advised the Congress president to forsake her ‘blind love for son’ for the sake of the country. AICC media panellist and MLC Prem Chandra Mishra was the only prominent leader to respond to Tiwari’s attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/as-congress-delays-review-of-bihar-poll-results-cracks-begin-to-show/story-DDbs1Pv3S97PMVoWAYyLsN.html

26-12-2020||City||Punjab health department starts tracing of 2,500 UK returnees over new coronavirus strain fears||Amid rising concerns over a new infectious strain of the coronavirus, the state health department on Friday started tracing nearly 2,500 travellers who returned from the United Kingdom in the last one month and are believed to be living in various districts of Punjab. The move came after the Union health ministry directed the states and the union territories to track the locations and clinical status of the travellers from the UK who arrived in the country after November 25. It will be ascertained as to which other state(s) they travelled after their arrival besides conducting genome sequencing of their samples. The state is planning to conduct mandatory RT-PCR tests of the travellers who did not undergo testing after their arrival, especially those who landed less than two weeks ago. The new coronavirus strain, which accounts for one-third of the current cases in London, is believed to be 70% more infectious than the other known variants. “As per the data, 1,822 travellers to Punjab from the UK in the last one month landed at the Delhi international airport. As many as 1,604 travellers to Punjab and elsewhere landed at the Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport, after November 25. Of a total of 3,426 returnees, nearly 2,500 are still believed to be in the state,” said Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. The tracing exercise will be over in the next two days, he added. “All these returnees will be kept under surveillance by the health department. The symptomatic people will be tested for Covid-19. We will further trace their contacts who will also be tested for the virus,” he added. “Till now, no traces of the new virus strain have been found in India but many UK travellers were tested positive after their arrival. Also, the department is closely monitoring the eight passengers aboard the Heathrow- Amritsar flight who were tested positive on December 22. On Friday, their samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for genome sequencing and research of the new virus variant,” Dr Bhaskar added. The department has already listed 216 close contacts of these eight people and they are being shifted to institutional quarantine facilities in their respective districts. “The direct contacts of the eight persons include their family members and those sitting next to them in the flight. After five-day institutional quarantine, all of them will be tested,” said Dr Bhaskar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-health-department-starts-tracing-2-500-uk-returnees-over-new-virus-strain-fears/story-So8w6R942O3OLLjIhQOyJO.html
26-12-2020||City||Former Bathinda SDM, town planner under lens for irregularities in land acquisition for highway widening||The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has detected major irregularities in the land acquisition process for widening of the Bathinda-Sangat Kalan road as the nature of 177 khasras (plots) of land was changed from agriculture to commercial in an attempt to give undue compensation to nearly 155 private landowners. The probe conducted by the NHAI’s regional office, Chandigarh, categorically puts the role of the then Bathinda sub-divisional magistrate (SDM)-cum-competent authority for land acquisition (CALA) Amrinder Singh Tiwana and then district town planner (DTP) Paramjit Singh under the lens for the alleged irregularities. The compensation amount, however, has not been paid yet to the landowners. In a letter to the Punjab government on October 1, 2019, the NHAI observed “apparent irregularities” on part of Tiwana in preparing the 3A notification and variation list to 3A notification (for land acquisition) and by Paramjit Singh in issuing change of land (CLU) permission. The central agency had written to the Punjab revenue and rehabilitation department and sought investigation into the matter.On May 27, 2020, the revenue department sought report from the Bathinda deputy commissioner in this regard. In his report, the DC said that serious irregularities occurred when Tiwana acted as CALA and the matter should be investigated by a senior officer. The revenue department on November 24 wrote to the personnel department to take further necessary action as the latter deals with the Punjab Civil Service (PCS) officers. The complaint and consequent probeIt was on August 5, 2019, that one Ashutosh Singh filed a complaint with the NHAI and demanded a probe into the process, alleging that some officials in collusion with some people acquired the land at an exorbitant price of Rs 60-70 crore. The NHAI constituted an expert committee under CR Rana, a land acquisition expert, along with Bathinda project director Vipin Mangla. The committee’s report submitted in September 2019 stated that 3-A notification for land acquisition was published in e-gazette the previous year in September. The nature of land of khasra numbers 863, 851 and 852 at Gehri Buttar village was changed from agriculture to commercial on the same day of submission of application of CLU on August 20, 2018, to give inflated compensation to the landowners. “The project director had also raised the issue of CLU on a large scale with the CALA as well as Bathinda DC but no action was taken. Therefore, you are requested to get the investigation done,” reads the NHAI’s communication to secretary (revenue) Manashvi Kumar in October last year. Tiwana, who is now posted as Kotkapura SDM, didn’t respond to repeated calls and messages. Paramjit Singh (now Faridkot district town planner) rejected allegations of irregularities, saying only three CLU cases were cleared and that too as per the government’s guidelines and with the permission of the then Bathinda DC Preneet Bhardwaj. “We faced a lot of pressure from influential people to clear four other CLU cases, but we refused,” added Paramjit who recently filed a reply on the matter after being charge-sheeted. NHAI project director (Bathinda) Vipul Gupta declined to comment on the issue, saying he is not authorised to talk to the media. Bathinda deputy commissioner N Srinivasan also didn’t respond to calls and messages. Secretary (revenue) Manvesh Singh Sidhu, who looks after land acquisition matters, acknowledged that the case is with the department and he has written to the personnel department for further action. RTI activist Kuldeep Singh Khaira, who also procured some details in the matter, said, “A single officer can’t execute such a scam. In this case, huge amount of public money would have been paid off had the NHAI officials not probed the matter properly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-bathinda-sdm-town-planner-under-lens-for-irregularities-in-land-acquisition-for-highway-widening/story-e2wmZny6zrytUczRu2LZ5I.html

Khadse has been asked to be present before the central agency on December 30, according to news reports. Khadse, however, told HT that he is yet to receive the notice, but was mentally prepared for any such move. The former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) bigwig was also forced to resign from the ministerial council in the previous Devendra Fadnavis government, following allegations of graft and conflict of interest in a land deal at Bhosari near Pune four years ago. Khadse is said to have received notice from ED in the same land deal case. “Apart from farming, I have no other income source. I was mentally prepared for this and had even said this while joining NCP. This would be my fifth probe in the same land deal case. The state anti-corruption bureau has investigated the case twice, while it has also been probed by the income tax department has and Zoting committee (formed by the previous regime),” Khadse said. “Until now, ED used to probe major cases worth hundreds of crores. Now if they want to investigate a land deal worth ₹25 crore-₹30 crore, then I should be happy that my name is added in list of big people,” he said. Satyabrat Kumar, joint director of the ED did not respond to calls.Khadse joined NCP in October. State NCP chief Jayant Patil had said Khadse may have to face ED probe after quitting BJP. “If they unleash ED behind me, I will show the CD,” Khadse said referring to alleged proofs of corruption against BJP leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ed-notice-to-ncp-s-eknath-khadse-leader-denies-it/story-OXQsR8WgMwoktOxrFvYKHI.html

The three publishers are among the leading producers of academic journals, books, research work and other publications. Sci-Hub and LibGen give free access to research papers. Elsevier, Wiley and ACS, which charge a subscription fee for accessing content published by them, have alleged that Sci-Hub and LibGen were infringing on their exclusive rights to manuscripts of research papers.Elsevier, Wiley and ACS, which charge a subscription fee for accessing content published by them, have alleged that Sci-Hub and LibGen were infringing on their exclusive rights to manuscripts of research papers and should thus be banned. The scientific community, however, is upset with the court case, to seek a ban of accessible scientific content, and has strongly opposed the alleged “commoditisation of research information.” “We are shocked to learn that three academic publishers — Elsevier, Wiley, and the American Chemical Society (ACS) — have filed a suit seeking a ban on the websites Sci-Hub and LibGen, which have made academic research-related information freely available to all,” said BSS. “More than 2000 scientists, professors, researchers, teachers and students have signed a statement supporting free access to knowledge and urging the court and the government to allow the Indian academic community to continue to have access to Sci-Hub and Libgen,” said Soumitro Banerjee, general secretary of BSS and professor in the physical sciences department of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research at Kolkata. Contending the allegations of infringement by the publishers, scientists said publishers such as LibGen and Sci-Hub do not violate any norm of ethics or intellectual property rights, as the research papers are actually intellectual products of the authors and the institutions. The statement issued by BSS added that international publishers such as Elsevier have created a business model where they treat knowledge created by academic research, funded by taxpayers’ money, as their private property. “Those who produce this knowledge – the authors and reviewers of research papers – are not paid, and yet these publishers make windfall profit of billions of dollars by selling subscriptions to libraries worldwide at exorbitantly inflated rates, which most institutional libraries in India, and even developed countries, cannot afford. Without a subscription, a researcher has to pay between $30 and $50 to download each paper, which most individual Indian researchers cannot afford. Instead of facilitating the flow of research information, these companies are throttling it,” read the statement. “The way exchange of scientific knowledge works today is through papers. And the subscription fees are so high for each journal that students find it difficult to subscribe to any of those. Some research institutes have institution subscriptions, but that is also limited by the institute funding. As most institutes are facing fund cuts, the first thing they do is to discontinue subscriptions. So to really grow scientific knowledge exchange, whatever Sci-Hub and LibGen are doing are great initiatives. As research scholars, we should support them,” said Dibya Sankar, a research scholar from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/academic-publishers-vs-libgen-and-sci-hub-make-research-academic-papers-accessible-to-all-2k-scientists-students-appeal-to-court-govt/story-iid8Q847AQt6O4ZlLM6r8N.html

26-12-2020||City||TRP case audit: Mumbai Police say have proof; Republic TV rubbishes it; BARC says not right to comment||The Mumbai Police’s crime branch, which is probing the television rating points (TRP) manipulation case, has claimed that a recent forensic audit conducted by the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) has brought out a lot of incriminating material, and revealed how data was manipulated to bring Republic TV at the number one position among English news channels. Joint commissioner of police Milind Bharambe said the data manipulation was mostly done between 2016 and 2019. Forensic auditors appointed by BARC analysed the data of 44 weeks in their audit. He also alleged that it appears from the audit that the ratings were pre-decided and accordingly manipulated. The number one news channel at the time was thus brought to the second position, said the police. “Three methods were used for the manipulation, and data was selectively chosen to ascertain and analyse TRP for the particular [accused] channel,” said Bharambe. Police have also discovered some emails and WhatsApp chats exchanged between the ex-employees of BARC and channels on the BARC servers. Bharambe said one of the chats read, “Please find below numbers on English news, as required. Times Now numbers were changed while Republic remains same”. Another chat stated: “Pls find below English news channels-Times Now and CNN News 18 –will be changed. The equations of Times Now have decreased drastically across the universe”. Republic TV in its statement said the claims are “laughable”. In support of its claim, the channel said BARC had sent e-mails to Republic on October 17 and November 20, stating that there was no question of any manipulation by the channel. “The [forensic report] Mumbai Police is referring to is from July. BARC’s emails to us are from November and December. It defies common sense why BARC would give Republic Media Network a complete clean chit in November and December.” It has further claimed for the past three months, Mumbai Police has done everything possible to “target” Republic Network, and has “fallen flat” every time. “This ridiculous and bizarre witch-hunt was exposed once again today,” it adds. A spokesperson from BARC India said, “The development related to the two ex-employees of BARC India is a part of an ongoing investigation for which BARC management continues to extend its support and cooperation to the law enforcement agencies. It would consequently be inappropriate for BARC to comment any further at this stage. Every employee of BARC India is expected to conform to a Code of Conduct & Ethics and any infringement invites suitable disciplinary action. We will continue to ensure that what Indian watches is reported accurately and with utmost integrity. It’s a responsibility we owe all our stakeholders.” The audit report also mentioned manipulation being done for some entertainment channels. Meanwhile, Partho Nirmal Dasgupta, former CEO of BARC, who was arrested from Pune on Thursday after his role cropped up during investigation, is also suspected to be involved in manipulation of TRP. Dasgupta worked in from 2013 to 2019. He allegedly misused his position to manipulate TRP of some channels. He was produced before a magistrate on Friday and has been remanded to police custody till December 28. “We have got very strong evidence with us against the officials who are responsible for TRP fraud. BARC has cooperated very well and helped in the investigation,” Bharambe added. The investigation in the case started on October 6. The first charge-sheet has been filed against some of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trp-case-audit-mumbai-police-say-have-proof-republic-tv-rubbishes-it-barc-says-not-right-to-comment/story-iyDHCOQxImWrxFOZNgpP3K.html

The duo were rivals and used to have fights frequently. According to the crime branch, Munshi is involved in at least 12 assault cases. He was earlier externed twice from the city, said a police officer. On December 17, Khan was at Bhagat Singh Nagar, Goregaon. Munshi along with his three brothers and a 16-year-old attacked Khan with a knife and choppers. They stabbed Khan 17 times. He was rushed to a hospital by some locals, but was declared dead before admission, said inspector Sunil Mane of unit 11. Bangur Nagar police nabbed Munshi’s four aides. Crime branch officers then started a parallel probe and learnt that Munshi was hiding in Pune. However, when they had reached there, Munshi had left for Solapur. The police then traced him through his phone and nabbed him on Thursday evening from Solapur. He was brought to Mumbai and handed over to the Bangur Nagar police, Mane said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-man-stabbed-17-times-29-year-old-accused-held-from-solapur/story-mq8IVDA40WDBBY0CsTHEJM.html
26-12-2020||City||Not enough volunteers for Covaxin trial: Mumbai hospitals||City’s civic hospitals are not getting enough volunteers to conduct the clinical trial of the first indigenous vaccine, Covaxin, owing to lack of awareness and scepticism about Covid-19 vaccines. Doctors fear this may further delay the compulsory completion of the clinical trial process.In the last week of October, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) selected two hospitals – the Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital (Sion hospital) and Sir JJ Hospital in Parel for the pan-Indian clinical trial of Covaxin, manufactured by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. According to ICMR, 2,000 volunteers in the age group of 18-60 have to be a part of the trial. By December 31, the hospitals were supposed to complete the selection process. However, only 128 volunteers have come forward at Sion hospital, while JJ Hospital has had 368 volunteers for the trial so far.“We aren’t getting enough volunteers to take part in the trial. Earlier, we were getting 30-35 volunteers for the trial. But now, it has gone down to 10-12 volunteers. Many of them opt out of the trial after filling up the consent forms,” said Dr Dinesh Dhodi, department of pharmacology and in-charge of the trial at JJ Hospital.Doctors believe that the lukewarm response from volunteers could be attributed to several reasons. Many who wish to volunteer are unable to reach the hospitals owing to restrictions on travel. Secondly, following a few reports about the adverse effects of the vaccine on volunteers, many are hesitating to participate in the trial.During the first phase of the trial in August, a volunteer was hospitalised after receiving a dose of Covaxin. The issue was reported to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation-Drug Controller General of India (CDSCO-DCGI) within 24 hours. “The adverse event was probed thoroughly and determined as ‘not vaccine related’,” said the spokesperson, Bharat Biotech.On September 6, AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine Covishield along with the University of Oxford, temporarily had to halt the phase-3 trials around the globe after a participant reportedly developed severe adverse reactions in the United Kingdom. Later, the company resumed clinical trials of its vaccine candidate after confirmation from the regulatory authorities that it was safe to do so. “We started the trial on December 5 when the response was higher. But gradually, the response has declined. There is not much awareness among people about vaccine. So, not many are coming forward,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Sion hospital. “We cannot force volunteers to take part in it if they don’t want to,” he said.In the trial, out of the 1,000 volunteers, around 500 will be given a placebo (a replica of the actual vaccine which does not contain an active drug). However, this has discouraged many volunteers from taking part in the trial as they do not wish to get themselves administered with the placebo, doctors said.“We haven’t received any deadline about the completion process of the trial yet. But if we don’t get proper response from citizens, we might have to write to the ICMR seeking additional time for the trial,” said a senior official from the civic body.Doctors have urged citizens to trust the efficiency of the vaccine. “Experts with several years of experience in medicine have developed this vaccine. People should come forward to help in developing it,” said Dr Joshi.According to a study report — Safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152 (a phase 2, double-blind, randomised controlled trial) and the persistence of immune responses from a phase 1 follow-up report — published by Biotech on Monday, the vaccine was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events in its Phase-2 trials. “In the Phase-2 trial, BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses,” read the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/not-enough-volunteers-for-covaxin-trial-mumbai-hospitals/story-WGewVfCbRAPhsM3ZXk50sJ.html
26-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body starts training doctors for Covid-19 vaccination||As the city hopes to receive the Covid-19 vaccine by the first half of next year, the civic body has geared up to train doctors for the mass immunisation process. So far, 40 doctors have received training as master trainers, who will later train other doctors.Even though the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been immunising children for years, this will be the first time that the civic body will vaccinate adults. For the initial phase of Covid-19 vaccination, BMC has estimated the need to train around 2,500 people. “Though the process is similar [to other vaccination drives], we still need to provide training to our doctors. These 40 doctors have been trained for vaccine distribution, storage and transportation. We expect to complete their initial training by January 7, 2021,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC.Other than tertiary-care hospitals, training is being conducted at peripheral and special hospitals as well. Following this exercise, these trainers will train the vaccination team members at their respective centres and field-level staff. Meanwhile, the civic body has identified eight hospitals — King Edward Memorial (KEM), Lokmanya Tilak General, BYL Nair, Cooper, Bhabha (Bandra), VN Desai, Rajawadi and Bharat Ratna Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar — as Covid-19 vaccination points.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said the civic body has decided to develop a real-time Covid-19 mobile application to monitor and regulate the vaccination process among the 2 crore-odd population of Mumbai. “Along with vaccination process, we also need to train our employees in handling the app, which will help to centralise the system,” he said.The civic body plans to vaccinate around one crore people within a month after the vaccine roll out. “To ensure better accessibility to people, we have plans to include schools and gymkhanas as the vaccination points,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-starts-training-doctors-for-covid-19-vaccination/story-0Xtvz6uZKTmykOl8VQqH1O.html
26-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai local trains for all likely in first week of Jan: Maharashtra minister||As the pandemic situation seems to be under control, the Maharashtra government plans to restart local train services for all in the first week of January 2021. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar on Friday said he had spoken to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and he was positive about opening the railway services in the next eight-10 days. However, a decision would be taken only after reviewing the pandemic situation. “With the risk of the spread of the new variant of the virus, we will have to be careful while taking any decision about railway services for all. When we allowed women commuters in non-peak hours in September, the crowding at stations was beyond control,” he said. Wadettiwar said a letter has already been given to the Railways for their nod, but the final call has to be taken by the state government. “The decision will depend entirely on the situation in the next 8-10 days. There should not be a problem in opening up trains for all if the cases remain low. We will hold a review meeting in the first week of January and decide,” he said. According to an official from the relief and rehabilitation department, the local services would not be opened for all, but a few segments of commuters will be allowed to travel in non-peak hours. The official said like women are allowed to commute from 11am to 3pm and 7pm till midnight, men may be allowed early morning. Currently, the local trains are accessible only to people from essential services that have been issued special QR codes. Meanwhile, keeping the trend of steady fall in the daily caseload over the past four weeks, Maharashtra saw 3,431 new infections on Friday, taking the tally to 1,913,382. The daily average caseload has dropped to 3,579 in 25 days of December, from 4,702 in the corresponding period in November. With the addition of 71 new deaths, the toll has touched 49,129, as the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state still remains high at 2.57% against the national rate of 1.45%. In Mumbai, 596 new cases and 11 deaths were reported on Friday, taking the tally to 2,89,800 and toll to 11,056. Meanwhile, Pune and Nagpur districts retained their second and third positions after Mumbai, in reporting the daily cases with the addition of 566 and 378 cases, respectively. The number of active patients has dropped to 56,823 with highest, 14,145, in Pune. The positivity rate in the state has dropped significantly over the past few weeks. It has been 5.80% in 24 days of December, against 7.68% in November and 13.47% in October. With the drop in the positivity rate, the daily average testing too has dropped to 61,868 in December, from 63,166 in November and 70,393 in October. “We have been taking due precautions about international passengers coming from countries like the UK, Europe to ensure there is no spread of the new variant of the virus. Our projections about the rise in the cases in the first week of December after Diwali have proved to be wrong, as people took due care. A similar risk hovers in the second week of January, about two weeks after Christmas. If the number of cases continues to be at this level, it will mean that we have managed to control the spread,” said Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the state-appointed death audit committee. Dr Supe said the number of tests is being done in accordance with the infection rate, which has currently dropped significantly. “If we have 500 cases in Mumbai, and if their 15 contacts are traced and tested, the number of tests would not exceed 7,500, which is fine,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-local-trains-for-all-likely-in-first-week-of-jan-maharashtra-minister/story-SOlTECOCSCFx3FDVkNXfqN.html

The administration had proposed desalinating the creek water and using it for potable purposes.The plant was opposed by the opposition who claimed that there were several other ways to increase water resources. The opposition had also filed a petition in the High Court, which the court dismissed last year. The plant also faced opposition from the farmers, which the officials claim was addressed.Last year, before the civic elections, the corporation had given a work order for the first phase of desalinating 20MLD water.An officer requesting anonymity said, “We had spent ₹15 lakh on formulating the proposal and land acquisition so far. However we have now got a letter from the general body to scrap the plant. Thus, we cannot go ahead with the said project.”The total cost of the plant was ₹150Cr.Read more: Mumbai civic body’s desalination plant project: Why not focus on water conservation, ask expertsThe issue of the desalination plant was raised by former standing committee chairman Ram Repale, who asked the general body about its status.Thane Mayor Naresh Mhaske said, “The plant is very costly and not feasible for the city. In the times of the pandemic the corporation has lost heavy revenue and it is not feasible to take this additional cost for the plant. Thus, we have decided to scrap the plant.”Ironically, the Shiv Sena had supported the plant right from the beginning and even approved it amidst chaos in the general body meeting held two years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-civic-body-shelves-idea-of-desalination-plant/story-eBD5vi3v6PdA8EeSJc5IUP.html

The committee will now have to submit its report to the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray by May 31, 2021.The committee has got a second extension this time. After being constituted on March 13, it was asked to submit its report on March 30, but the state was hit by the Covid-19, hence it was given the first extension of eight months till November 30.“Since the cabinet sub-committee was formed, the state struggled with the pandemic and saving the lives of the people was our first priority. We could hold just one meeting before the lockdown was imposed and later could not follow up the discussion,” a senior minister, who is also a member of the committee, said on conditions of anonymity.“The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) too communicated to the state on March 25 that they have decided to postpone the process of NPR till further orders, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak,” said a senior official from the state home department, requesting anonymity.The committee headed by state transport minister Anil Parab was formed, despite differences among the ruling partners of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.Thackeray had supported CAA, NPR, but has termed NRC as problematic. “NPR is proposed along with the census. It happened in 2010 too. Census happens after every 10 years in our country. If there are new columns proposed in the NPR, they will be scrutinised by our government and if it seems problematic, we won’t take it ahead,” he said.“There is no need to be afraid of CAA, as it is not going to strip anyone’s citizenship. CAA will give citizenship to Hindus from the neighbouring countries. NRC is problematic to every citizen, irrespective of caste, creed, religion, any which way. I won’t allow stripping of anyone’s rights,” Thackeray has said.Members of the panel comprise Anil Parab and Uday Samant from Shiv Sena; Nawab Malik and Jitendra Awhad from the Nationalist Congress Party; and Sunil Kedar and Vijay Wadettiwar from the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-gives-extension-to-cabinet-sub-committee-on-caa-npr-till-may-31/story-63liuVJcXTXTSuiTDDdkcM.html

Leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri was also present on the occasion.Rathore said that each year of the BJP rule was weighing heavily on the people of the state who desperately awaited the assembly elections to teach the “haughty” state government a lesson.He said that even as the BJP-led state government is celebrating its three years in office, it has done nothing substantial which it can count as achievement.“Development projects in the state have come to a grinding halt. The BJP government is listing those projects as achievement which were initiated by the previous Virbhadra Singh-led Congress government,” Rathore alleged.The state government also failed to provide people of the state any relief during the Covid-19 crisis, said Kuldeep Singh Rathore.Meanwhile, Congress Legislative Party leader Mukesh Agnihotri said that all the former chief ministers of Himachal are remembered for some or the other contribution to the state, but Jai Ram Thakur will be remembered for ruining the state.Corruption in the last three years came to the hilt and even a senior BJP leader had to resign from the party president post, he said, adding that every kind of mafia was active in Himachal Pradesh to plunder its wealth and resources.“BJP instead of celebrating should focus on actual development of the state as there is nothing on the ground and all its developmental claims are only on paper and in speeches,” said Agnihotri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hp-cong-to-observe-bjp-govt-s-3-year-anniv-as-black-day/story-EhitBA3oMLCySPk2ayukDN.html

Individuals can give the 5kg of plastic waste at a collection centre opposite Pragati College, Dattanagar in Dombivli.“We have been taking up several measures to ensure waste is collected in a proper, segregated manner. Plastic waste is one such waste that people usually dump anywhere and everywhere. One can just collect the waste and give it at the centre and actually buy food out of it,” said Ramdas Kokare, deputy commissioner, solid waste management department, KDMC.This initiative by the civic body is a part of the ‘Zero Waste’ policy introduced by the KDMC for over a year now. This initiative is being implemented jointly with Siddhi Waste To Green Ltd and Trupti Gruha Udyog.As of now, only one collection centre is giving these coupons while in the coming days more such centres will come up across Kalyan-Dombivli.“We have got response from a poli bhaji centre in Kalyan. Soon, we will start this drive in Kalyan also,” added Kokare. Earlier, the civic body had initiated an e-waste collection drive across Kalyan-Dombivli that also received good response from the citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/exchange-plastic-for-food-coupon-kalyan-dombivli-civic-body-initiative/story-qjrSp64NjbyOrcvL5uKF9K.html

The technical advisory committee (TAC) report and a report by an independent structural auditor have confirmed the building is in a ruinous condition.After hearing the submissions, the court observed that the current petition was a delaying tactic by the tenants. “The petitioners and their advocates are well aware that the petitioners cannot be allowed to continue their stay in a dilapidated building and they are always at liberty to seek reliefs qua transit rent and execution of the permanent alternate accommodation agreement, or to even prevent the developer from proceeding with the development without providing the benefits that the petitioners are entitled to in law, but the petitioners certainly cannot continue their stay in a dilapidated building on the pretext of the developer not having extended the re-development benefits to them to which they are entitled to in law,” observed the court. The court has directed the tenants to vacate the building immediately and permitted the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to undertake demolition once the building has been vacated. The matter will be heard next on January 28, 2021, to consider whether any other relief may be granted to the petitioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-hc-relief-for-tenants-of-dilapidated-building-at-mumbai-s-ghatkopar/story-8ct79NsLEvW4ONnYIqM4jP.html

The college is quite popular in Thane and was started in 1969, it is managed by Vidya Prasarak Mandal that has another 12 institutes under its banner. The institute now possesses the freedom to reconstruct and design the course or syllabus from time to time, making it viable to students within Thane city.Apart from the professional and vocational courses, the college can also include skill-oriented courses that will bring more employment.“With the autonomous status, we have the freedom to include modern education techniques and tools that make the education process more attractive and effective. Based on the demands in the job markets and the recent trends, we shall be able to include more courses every year,” said Dr Vijay Bedekar, trustee, Vidya Prasarak Mandal.The institute has been receiving ’A’ grade accreditation for the last three cycles. More than 7,000 students study today in the Arts and Commerce College.An autonomous college has the freedom to determine and prescribe its own courses of study and syllabus. It can redesign courses to suit the local needs and include more skill-oriented courses based on the job requirements in the market. Such colleges also have the privilege to evolve methods of assessment and conduct their own examinations and declare results.The University Grants Commission (UGC), a statutory body under the government of India, is tasked with maintaining standards of teaching, examination and research in university education. As per UGC’s criteria, a college seeking autonomy must be accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), with at least an ‘A’ grade for at least three cycles of accreditation. If the NAAC score is equal to or above 3.51, the institute can be declared as an autonomous institute without an onsite visit by UGC’s expert committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/joshi-bedekar-college-in-thane-gets-autonomous-status/story-MoRItQOxpB08OQmT5GOyNI.html

26-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pawan Hans staff to bid for firm, raise ₹800 crore||A group of Pawan Hans employees plans to participate in the sale process of the helicopter service company and hopes to raise around ₹800 crore to this end. Earlier this month, the government had invited fresh bids for the strategic sale of Pawan Hans along with transfer of management control. According to sources, a group of employees will participate in the bidding process for Pawan Hans. Before submitting their bid, the group will meet Air India officials to learn about the disinvestment and bidding process. “With January 19 slated to be the last date for submission of bids, officers from both Delhi and Mumbai are coordinating with each other and are working toward looking for potential investors to participate in the bidding process,” said a Delhi-based official on condition of anonymity.A source in Pawan Hans said the employees may either tie up with a financial institution or join a prospective bidder, with the first option being considered preferable. “A few senior management officials are set to meet Air India officials. This meeting is expected to seek ideas from the airline employees on the potential investors and the complete process ahead.”A Pawan Hans official said that around 60 employees, including 20 senior pilots and top management, have been actively pursuing the matter. Talks are on with four financial institutions to raise funds. Pawan Hans currently has 349 permanent employees and around 700 employees in total. “According to norms, 15% of the company’s permanent employees should be bidding for the process. Hence, the criterion is met as we have more than 50 employees participating in the bidding process,” said the official. The employees will have to work out a deal that a potential investor would consider profitable. “We are sure of making profits within a year of taking over the company and restructuring it. Our immediate aim is to communicate to our potential investors that the company has been in loss for the last couple of years due to mismanagement. We expect the bid to cost us around ₹700-800 crore,” said a Pawan Hans official. In 2019-20, Pawan Hans reported a net loss of ₹28 crore, which is less than 2018-19’s net loss of ₹69 crore. In 2018, the government had invited bids to sell 51% stake in Pawan Hans. However, the bid was withdrawn after Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) decided to sell its 49% stake in Pawan Hans. In 2019, a second attempt was made to sell Pawan Hans, but the sale failed to receive investor response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-pawan-hans-staff-to-bid-for-firm-raise-800-crore/story-6vv39pVk77ueCLa1xpVBCI.html
26-12-2020||City||Atal Tunnel reverses winter migration from Lahaul-Spiti||The strategic Atal Tunnel built across the 13,050-ft Rohtang Pass, the gateway to Lahaul and Spiti, has come as a relief for residents of the remote, tribal district of Himachal Pradesh as the all-weather connectivity has ensured they needn’t migrate to low-lying hills for fear of being cut off from the rest of the world due to snowfall. Lahaul and Spiti district has the toughest terrain in the region and remains cut off for six months due to snowfall on the Rohtang Pass, which literally means built on piles of bodies in the local Bhoti dialect. Usually, during winter, a majority of tribal residents migrate to Kullu, Manali and the low-lying plains of the state before the closure of the pass. By November, most people head to their houses in other parts of the state. The temperature in Lahaul dips to minus 30 degrees when winter peaks and life for tribal residents is tougher in Spiti valley, which is separated by the 15,000-ft Kunzum Pass. The winter migration is more in the six panchayats of Pattan valley, known for growing potatoes. This is due to poor medical facility in the region. Till last year, the residents were dependent on chopper flights to travel outside the valley. The 2011 census pegged the district population at 31,564.” There was a time when 70% of the population migrated in winter. But with the opening of Atal Tunnel, named after former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, winter migration is down,” says Lahaul and Spiti deputy commissioner Pankaj Rai. “We conducted a random survey to assess the winter migration and found only 30% of the population migrated this time,” he says. CONFIDENCE OF CONNECTIVITY Residents of the three villages of Dimpuk, Koksar and Ramthang near the north portal of the tunnel at Sissu used to migrate with their livestock to Kullu and Manali in November and return in April. The three villages are located in a treacherous terrain and the area is susceptible to avalanches. “But this year, we are still in our villages,” says Anju Shashni, the head of the Koksar panchayat. Government offices in Koksar are still open. “The opening of the tunnel has given hope and confidence to the villagers of Dimpuk and Koksar. We know even if the roads are closed due to snowfall, we can walk up to the tunnel and cross to the other side. Moreover, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, people feel safer at home in villages than migrating to crowded towns,” says Chander Mohan Prasheera, a social activist amd head of the Institute of Vocational (Tourism) Studies at Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla. “A day will come in the near future when people will return and resettle in their villages,” says Prasheera. TOUGH LIFE IN TRIBAL DISTRICT The tribal district does not offer much in terms of quality of education, employment, health and road connectivity. The living conditions in Lahaul-Spiti are bad in routine and turn worse in winter. Power supply remains suspended due to snowfall and people find it difficult to get medical aid when the roads are snowbound “The younger generation is moving out of the valley. Many of my friends have settled down in cities like Chandigarh,” says Sonam Zanpo, 36, who runs a hotel in Keylong. “As a child, we walked for five days to cross Rohtang Pass and there were no inns or hotels along the road where we could take shelter. We would halt at villages en route at night,” says BS Kapoor, a retired chief engineer from Tholang village, 113 km from Manali. The village is home to only 36 families but has produced a significant number of professionals, including bureaucrats, doctors and engineers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/atal-tunnel-reverses-winter-migration-from-lahaul-spiti/story-GVtSL34ZeK9qgIJ2dPOO9O.html
26-12-2020||City||Jai Ram unveils Vajpayee’s statue at Ridge||Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Friday unveiled the statute of former Prime Minister and Bharat Ratna recipient Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his 96th birth anniversary at the The Ridge here. December 25 is also marked as Good Governance Day, which was established in 2014 to honour Vajpayee by fostering awareness on accountability in government among the people.While addressing the ‘Atal Samriti Samaroh’ organised by the state language, art and culture department at the Gaiety Theatre, Thakur paid rich tributes to the former PM. He said Vajpayee was a statesman and a great personality who, due to his politics of principles, gained national appeal. Stating that the great leader and politician would always be remembered by the country, the chief minister said Vajpayee defined highest values of leadership and devoted himself to the nation. Thakur said that Vajpayee was an orator par excellence with the ability to cast a spell on the audience. Even during some of the tensest moments in Parliament, the former PM succeeded in defusing the situation with utmost ease.The CM said that despite being away from active politics for over a decade at the time of his demise, lakhs of youth joined Vajpayee’s last journey which shows his deep impact on people’s lives. He said that the nation was first for the great leader and therefore he is regarded as the true statesman by the country.Thakur said as the Prime Minister of the country, Vajpayee changed India forever in many aspects. He said that during Vajpayee’s tenure between 1998 and 2004, the latter was credited with reviving India’s glory in the global economy. It was due to the strong willpower of Vajpayee that India became a nuclear power, Thakur said adding that it was due the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, a vision of Vajpayee’s, that rural road connectivity gained pace and almost all the panchayats of Himachal were connected by roads.Thakur said that unveiling of the statue at The Ridge was a tribute to this great son of Mother India. He said that the 18-feet structure, which was constructed for Rs 1.08 crore, was also a token of love and affection from the people of the state to the great statesman. Thakur said that Vajpayee always believed in value-based politics and would always be remembered and respected for his simplicity, humanity and benevolence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jai-ram-unveils-vajpayee-s-statue-at-ridge/story-MOq1wVlnwPmaELApdzoBYL.html

26-12-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: Let’s end this separation anxiety and manage waste responsibly||More flexibility, friendliness, politeness neededFor the success of the waste segregation system, the administration must educate the residents about the importance of managing waste by organising door to door visits of officials. Garbage collectors should be trained in social skills to engage with the residents politely. A large chunk of Chandigarh’s population comprises senior citizens and the collectors must help them segregate waste and pick it up. Independent garbage collectors must be adjusted in the system to enable them to earn a livelihood. Collection charges should be economical so that everyone can welcome the new changes.Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliPut collection vehicles to optimum useDetermination is the key to success. The municipal corporation (MC) should not spend on new vehicles if these are not put to optimum use. The collectors are the ones who should be motivated to clean up the city and workshops should be organised for them on waste management, especially making the distinction between dry and wet waste. The public should be informed about this new policy and fines should not be immediately collected from them for non segregation. MC must give up the idea of collecting revenues baselessly. With the right guidance the residents will cooperate in segregating waste.Sumesh Kumar BadhwarOnly sustained efforts will workCollection vehicles amount to a tiny step in the whole waste management process in the city. As proposed, all garbage: Wet, dry and that containing chemicals will be collected from people’s doorsteps. But where will all of it end up? Do we have an efficient working garbage processing plant in the city to process it daily? The local administration and MC officials were on the warpath over the performance of a garbage processing plant at Dadumajra, which was almost two decades old and performing far below its guaranteed performance parameters. The newly appointed consultants have written off that plant and advised the administration to add a new unit. However, the MC has taken over that under performing unit and is now in litigation with the private promoter. Until the final court orders come in, the authorities will not be able to make any changes in the plant and machinery of the plant and no plans have been made to set up a new processing unit. Scientific disposal will take time. The local authorities should also ensure that garbage thrown across the cycle tracks, on pavements and at parks or religious places should be cleared up and should give waste collection and processing tasks to their own employees. Only a systematic and sustained professional approach on all fronts will work.Suresh Verma, ChandigarhRWAs, citizens and admin have to come togetherNo waste segregation plan can work until all three: The citizens, RWAs and administration work together. Once it’s decided that the city shall stay clean no matter what then everyone will do his or her bit to manage waste. Making people aware of the importance of garbage control is the first step in this direction. Priyam Aggarwal, Chandigarh.Sectors should have waste disposal unitsThe welcome step taken by UT Chandigarh to segregate waste at source and also to penalise people for violations will save us from growing mountains of waste created at Dadumajra. Each sector should set up a resource management centre to recycle waste there, thus doing away with the need to cart everything to the dump. Dry waste (Non biodegradable) like paper, cardboard, polythene bags, wrappers, etc should be recycled by compressing these in hydraulic machines to make useful items like planters, benches and tiles. Wet waste (biodegradable) like vegetable leaves, curd, tea leaves, etc should be put in rectangular bins daily to make organic manure which will be ready in 50 to 60 days. This will also increase garden yield by recycling wet waste into organic manure and save us from chemicals like urea. Our ultimate mission should be to reduce, reuse and recycle. TBS BediBasic hygiene countsWhat’s needed most is cooperation from residents in segregating waste in two bags before handing it for collection. What might seem to be a tedious chore for residents will ultimately help the MC meet its waste management targets. Those assigned duties to collect waste need minimum basic training to make the project successful. Collectively we also have the responsibility to practise hygiene, not to spit or throw used wrappers or disposables at will.This becomes even more important during the coronavirus pandemic.Subhash Puri, PanchkulaSmart technology neededThe MC is very short staffed, with just 2,200 sanitation workers against a sanctioned strength of 4,500 employees in a city with a population of nearly 12 lakh. The garbage disposal system and waste management issues are not being addressed urgently. Why is technology not being used to tackle five lakh tonnes of waste that has accumulated in the dumping ground? Information on new technologies that can actually flatten trash in a few weeks is not being sought because of the funds crunch. The sanitation situation is going from bad to worse. The MC had notified the penalties and user charges, but failed to find partners to do garbage collection work. This move could have assisted the MC in streamlining the waste management system, albeit with a token fee in the Property Tax bill. But, in an election year (2019), the MC scrapped this too. It seems that the reins of city sanitation need to be taken over by the residents themselves to help the MC control the mess. Rajiv Boolchand JainHow you segregate waste is important tooWaste segregation starts from home so all citizens must be made aware of and responsible for it at source. Three different bins: Red for wet waste, green for dry and blue for solids such as glass and iron must be used in every household. The collection system from home to processing plant should also be done similarly. At the plant the three different wastes must be processed and recycled separately. The responsibility of residents and waste collecting staff must be fixed keeping in mind that motivation is more effective than penal action. This system will take time to get working. Also, at this time the MC has one shed for all types of waste. This has to stop and sheds should be built for three types of waste.Capt Amar Jeet Kumar, MohaliNeed to access all areas of cityIt is essential to offload dry and wet waste separately at the receiving inlets of the waste processing plant to make it run smoothly. Now it is all the more essential for the waste collectors to pick up the segregated waste from each household from the lanes and narrow bylanes of the city where collection vehicles cannot enter and dump it in the separate compartments of the waiting vehicles at the designated place and time. Such arrangements also have to be made for eateries under the watchful eyes of MC staff concerned. It’s mandatory for all households to ensure that segregated waste is disposed of properly.SC Luthra Start compostingHaving been born and brought up in Chandigarh, I have always found the city to be clean and charming. Small area, low population density, proactive administration and easy-to-manoeuvre roads also make it clean. However, a big problem here is lack of a waste to compost plant. With the ongoing garbage disposal crisis in the city, such plants could be a good addition to ensure that biodegradable waste is transformed to usable compost. This will also encourage the residents to start composting and thus bring down the volumes of waste generated. Abhishek Kumar, ChandigarhPenalties no guarantee for successThe new system has many pitfalls as the habits of the citizens will not change overnight. Unless there is segregation of waste at the origin it will be very difficult for the garbage collectors to carry out the process in vehicles. The MC should have at least launched a drive beforehand to create awareness about the changes in the collection system. Penalties are not guarantees for success and it will antagonise the citizens. Many are even not aware about the classification of garbage in various categories. MC should have taken a lesson from other cities across India, which have ranked in the top three slots of the Swachh Survekshan in this and previous years, on disposing of garbage. However, all of us should cooperate with the MC to make the drive a thumping success.Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhDon’t be lazy and uninformedPeople need shun this lax attitude of mixing garbage. RWAs must start making renewed efforts to ensure that the locals do what is required of them to make the collection drive a success. They must keep bins outside homes with segregated waste for the convenience of collectors. Garbage should be lifted from each house, even where very senior citizens live on their own. In fact, they should be helped by the collectors to move waste. Awareness and co-operation are most important at this juncture.Amanpreet Kaur Bains, KuraliNo segregation? Stop collecting wasteThe authorities should start planning to set up infrastructure to process the amount of waste generated in the city, including building composting units. Those who make compost at home should be allowed to sell it at a centralised facility at a fixed rate. I don’t think that penalising a resident for not segregating the waste will work as the manual collectors have demanded 50% of the penalty, and usually, whenever money comes into play it creates room for corruption. Instead, authorities should stop collecting waste from houses where segregation has not been done. This way people will get back on track on their own. Moreover, authorities need to keep following up with people who are responsible for the execution of this plan and make sure that the measures listed are followed strictly at all levels.Krrish Madaan, AmbalaClear all doubtsThe best way to ensure success of waste segregation in city is to educate people through door to door campaigns to identify wet and dry waste and segregate it in two separate bins in each household before delivering to the collector. Most people are confused about kitchen waste, which is a mix of fruits and vegetables peels, tea leaves and tea bags. Clearing their doubts will help.Rajinder ParshadPull up your socks, peopleA dedicated and disciplined plan has to be implemented to achieve cleanliness objectives, on which, unfortunately, everybody fails miserably, right from politicians, the residents to the workers. No one is keen on performance. Instead of forcing implementation of policies, the administration and MC are being liberal with all segments when it comes to cleanliness. No one is willing to put in some work and do one’s duty, be it government employees or citizens. Unless we develop a constructive spirit and culture, this waste segregation plan too will fail. Instead of trying to help, we specialise in accusing others of faults. Let’s try to clean our homes, then our streets and then cities. There is no other mantra of success. MPS Chadha, MohaliGet the collection timings rightFor success of the new system, there should be 1. Awareness in households of segregating dry and wet waste. The MC councillors can play an effective role in this regard. Leaflets should be printed explaining the benefits of segregating waste and should be distributed to each household2. Without cooperation of the present garbage collectors, the MC scheme will not be successful3. There should be fixed timings for collection4. At the initial stage waste can be lifted on alternate days5. Garbage from upper floors will have to be collected by attendants6. Collection timings should be either fixed before 8 am or after 6 pm, so that working couples can also avail of the facility7. Being the first planned city of India, we are already far behind others in matters of sanitation, so we should make out all efforts to make this proposal a great success.Sham Sunder SharmaCreate an app to track garbage trucksThe government needs to work sincerely to make this drive a success. An app can be created where residents can learn how to segregate waste and also report any problems they face. They should also be able to, through the app, track the truck that collects the segregated waste or communicate with those operating the vehicle. Senior citizens living on their own should be assisted in segregation and collection.Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhMore information requiredThere has been no drive to make residents aware of the segregation system, even though they will be ensuring its success. Many people do not know how to segregate wet and dry waste, they have no idea when the vehicles will visit their sectors. What happens to those living in the upper stories? What’s going to happen to the present door to door collectors? For the success of the waste management system, there should be awareness through media, pamphlets should be distributed and residents contacted through NGO/RWS besides, inducting all door-to-door personnel on MC rolls to lift waste and get paid 50% of the fine collected from defaulters as this is the only means of their employment and source of income in the economically challenging times of corona and otherwise.SK KhoslaFixed timings for vehiclesChandigarh is a planned city but the new system of collecting segregated waste is not an easy job. Most couples in the city work and can’t wait the whole day for the garbage collector to show up. So timings should be fixed for the vehicles. In case that’s not done then a point should be specified at a sector where vehicles can come in the morning once and then in the evenings.Avinash GoyalSystem riddled with flawsSenior citizens and working couples are not likely to take kindly to the new system as the former will have to step out of the gates to dump waste and the latter might have problems with collection timings. Another likely flaw is that the jumbo-sized vehicles will not be able to enter the narrow streets with dead ends. The new system will also not work for people living on the first, second and third floors as they would have to move downstairs to dump waste. The MC authorities would have done better had they kept sector welfare associations and other stakeholders in the loop for rolling out a better and effective system. However, since the drive has already been launched, the authorities must ensure in the first place that it is implemented strictly.Ramesh K Dhiman||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ht-chandigarh-readers-take-let-s-end-this-separation-anxiety-and-manage-waste-responsibly/story-yu1B96H5seocwFJhLP9gKP.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||At Singhu, farmer bounds himself in chains to protest||His tall body bound by heavy metal chains and his fists clenched all through from morning to evening for the last 18 days, a farmer from Fazilka in Punjab has been standing facing the main stage at the Singhu Border agitation site while portraying himself as the symbol of the “slavery” that the farmers have been fighting. The metallic chain, a medium-sized lock and a few iron nuts and bolts attached to them weigh around 5.5 kilos, said the 42-year-old farmer, Kabil Singh. He said he has been standing at the same place and in the same position from 7am to 7pm everyday for the last 18 days even as farmers and other visitors to the site flock to take selfies with him. “I’ll take this position until the black farm laws are repealed or until I drop dead,” said Singh, his fists still clenched. He said that he decided to be the symbol of a silent bound farmer amidst the loud speeches being delivered in front of him from the stage located about 100 metres from him. Singh said that he purchased the chain, lock, nuts and bolts from his hometown in Rukanpura during one of his visits to his home amidst the protests. It takes him about 10 minutes to deck his body in the chains every morning and lesser to remove them every evening. “I just stand this way. I don’t feel anything. The farm labour in real life is much harder than standing with a filos of metals on my body,” said the man decked in clean white kurta-pyjama, a light brown jacket, a green turban and a neat set of shoes. The chain went around his neck and bound his two hands and one ankle. His teenage daughter had passed away last year to a disease and he is left with a 13-year-old son. “My ancestors were farmers. I am a farmer. My son will be a farmer after me. But I don’t want him to be a slave in the guise of a farmer. My sacrifice is for the future farmers like my son,” he said while asking curious onlookers to wait till be got free to pose with them. Aruna Deshpande, a protesting farmer from Aurangabad district in Maharashtra, who was waiting to take a selfie with Singh, said that she was fascinated on seeing him standing in the same position day after day. “His form of protest is unique,” said Deshpande. Singh does quit that standing position a few times a day, through. “When I have to eat or visit the toilet, I am absent from here for a few minutes every day,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-singhu-farmer-bounds-himself-in-chains-to-protest/story-OPMSsgsDGavBMk9HZ1sTjO.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||Seven UK returnees, one contact tested positive for Covid-19||Seven individuals who returned from the United Kingdom between November 25 and December 21, and one of their contacts have so far tested Covid-19 positive in Delhi, a senior government official said on Friday.The Union government had suspended all flights from the UK on December to prevent the spread of a new strain of Covid-19 that is learnt to have emerged there, which experts fear may be more contagious.As on Friday, the senior official said, 19 patients were admitted in the special ward in Lok Nayak Hospital that has been set up for UK returnees and their contacts who test positive for the infection.The 19 include 11 patients who were identified from the last few flights to arrive from the UK in the national capital over Tuesday and Wednesday.The other eight patients were traced by the district administrations through their ongoing reach-out drive, and tested positive on Wednesday and Thursday “The eight include seven UK returnees and the father of one of the UK returnees, who is a resident of Dwarka,” said the senior official who did not wish to be identified.While people arriving from UK on December 22 and 23 — after the government’s announcement — were directly scanned, tested and quarantined (if needed) from the airports, state governments have been entrusted with reaching out and conducting Covid-19 tests on all passengers who have arrived from UK between November 25 and December 21, even if they had previously got themselves tested on arrival.A senior official in the revenue department said around 14,000 passengers arrived at the Delhi airport between November 25 and December 21 – of which around 1,500 are Delhi residents. District officials have initiated a reach out drive to trace them all and get them tested.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had earlier this week told reporters that nearly 7,000 passengers flew into the city from the UK in the last two weeks.But, senior officials later said the number of passengers who actually reside in Delhi would be much lower.Once a UK returnee tests positives, all her /his contacts are to be tested. The contacts awaiting test results and those who test negative have to complete mandatory institutional quarantine. They can either opt for a government facility in Chhatarpur or a paid facility in hotel at Aerocity.The Chhattarpur facility currently has around 60 individuals lodged. Most of them were people sitting in the neighbouring seats of the UK-Delhi flights from which the 11 Covid-patients were identified over Tuesday and Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/seven-uk-returnees-one-contact-tested-positive-for-covid-19/story-Ui25LUwIpUsgo4KUSyRYXN.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||HC directs SDMC, ASI to look into illegal construction near Qutub Minar||The Delhi high court has directed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the zonal deputy commissioner of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to look into the matter of dereliction of duties and fix responsibility of the officers after noting that unauthorized constructions have come up within 40 meters of Qutub Minar, an ASI-protected monument. Justice Najmi Waziri, while hearing a plea on December 23 by one Rishi Sehdev, said, “The construction has been carried out in such a large area – surely, this could not have escaped the attention of either the police, the ASI or the corporation,” the court said.“Let the concerned zonal deputy commissioner of the corporation also look into the matter and fix responsibility of the officers who may be found to be in dereliction of their duties. Similarly, the matter be also looked by the director general of ASI. The deputy commissioner of police (south) too shall look into the matter with respect to the role of the police in this regard,” the court said. During the hearing, the standing counsel for SDMC told the court that the permission for construction was taken from the civic body and the ASI on the basis of “misrepresentation of facts and fabrication of documents”.Justice Waziri said this is “odd” because permission could not have been granted for any construction in the prohibited zone of 100 metres abutting a protected monument. The construction has taken place roughly 40 metres from the Qutub Minar, a world-renowned monument protected monument, he said.The SDMC counsel also told the court that during the construction only one full grown tree has been cut. However, the court, taking note of the timeline of the Google photos submitted by the petitioner, said “quite a number of trees have been felled”.The court also asked all the authorities to file affidavits, along with photographs and relevant documents, within four weeks and posted the matter for further hearing on February 17, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-directs-sdmc-asi-to-look-into-illegal-construction-near-qutub-minar/story-Wd7Ly8pIE4wzcGZSIEU7BO.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||Fewest daily virus cases in Delhi for 131 days; 30 deaths||The national capital on Friday recorded 758 new cases of Covid-19, the fewest in a single day since August 16, even as testing remained high — with the city recording a test positivity rate below 1% on Friday, for only the second time since the state government began sharing testing data regularly.Delhi, in the seven days ending on Friday, recorded a daily average of 952 new infections — the first time this number has dropped below 1,000 since May 31, when it saw a seven-day average of 918 cases.The state government’s daily health bulletin on Friday also recorded 30 more deaths of the infection, taking the overall death toll in the city to 10,414.With 85,749 tests, the positivity rate was recorded at 0.88%, even as a majority of these — 45,521 — were conducted using the gold standard reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Experts have warned that if the RT-PCR tests slacken, it could catch the Capital off guard if the outbreak begins resurging.The positivity rate has been below 2% for 11 days now and it was the second time this week that a positivity rate of less than 1% was recorded. Previously, the positivity rate was 0.99% on Wednesday.Last week, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had that Delhi seems to have overcome the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Delhi had recorded the highest single day spike on November 11 with 8,593 cases in 24 hours.So far, 621,439 people in Delhi have been diagnosed as Covid-19 positive, of whom 603,758 have recovered, government data showed.As on Friday, 2,656 Covid-19 beds in Delhi’s hospitals were occupied, leaving vacant a vast majority of beds reserved to treat patients with the viral infection.“The numbers are encouraging, especially the increased proportion of RT-PCR tests and the low positivity rate. The government should keep up with its currently applicable strategies on testing, tracing and isolation,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fewest-daily-virus-cases-in-delhi-for-131-days-30-deaths/story-sOeP8q0PHbB5HfMRLYFROL.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal says BJP endorsing new farm laws||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for endorsing the three contentious farm laws, even as lawmakers from his party shouted slogans against the new laws in the central hall of the Parliament on Friday. Kejriwal said in a tweet: “According to the BJP, these laws will not cause any losses to farmers. But what will be the benefits? They (BJP) claims that these will enable farmers to sell their produce outside agricultural produce markets. But outside markets, agricultural produce sells for half the price. So, where is the benefit? The truth is that these laws have several disadvantages and no benefits at all.”Earlier on Friday, four MPs of the AAP had protested against the law in the central hall of the Parliament after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was done paying tribute to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his 96th birth anniversary.The AAP’s lone Lok Sabha MP from Punjab Bhagwant Mann later said in a press conference at the party’s head office in Central Delhi, “Today, once again, we demanded that the government rolls back the three laws. Through our protest, we tried to reach out to PM Narendra Modi but he did not even care to listen to us. It clearly shows that the BJP has no intention to listen to the protesting farmers.”The BJP, however, dismissed the allegations.Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “When the Union home minister has given a clear assurance to farmers, we fail to understand why the AAP leaders are misleading them. The AAP should look at its own anti-farmer reforms. They charge road tax on tractors, higher power rate for irrigation and hardly procure anything at Minimum Support Price (MSP). Delhi farmers are in distress because of them.”Farmers are protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The AAP had voted against the three laws in both Houses of the Parliament when they were passed in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-says-bjp-endorsing-new-farm-laws/story-e3YeVBgVaYoXZNQCllLfeL.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||61% of active Covid-19 cases in Delhi’s 5.5k hot spots: Delhi govt data||Around 61% of active Covid-19 cases in Delhi as on December 22 were in areas demarcated as containment zones, up significantly from 35% in mid-November, when the national capital was at the peak of its third wave of coronavirus disease cases, according to Delhi government data.Additionally, the Capital had a far greater number of containment zones on December 22, as against mid-November, even though the city has seemingly passed the third wave of infections, and daily new infections are lower now than during than the former period.As on December 22, Delhi recorded 12,189 total active cases, of which 7,438 (61%) were in the city’s 5,501 containment zones. In comparison, on November 15, the Capital had 43,774 active cases, of which 15,242 (35%) were inside the 4,430 containment zones demarcated at the time. The government attributed the sharp increase in the share of active Covid-19 cases in red zones to its micro-containment policy, which was intensified in November. In fact, till early-December, they also allowed containment zones to be notified with less than three cases identified in close proximity, based on a risk assessment by district surveillance officials. The Capital had 6,501 containment zones on December 11 — the highest count so far, government data showed. It further showed that even though the next 11 days saw a drop in the number of active containment zones (from 6,501 to 5,501), it still remains higher than the number on November 15 (4,430).As new Covid-19 cases in the national capital have continued to decline for around three weeks now, seven out of 11 districts recorded less than 1,000 active cases as on December 22 – compared to only one such district on November 15.Delhi added a daily average of 1,186 new cases in the seven days ending December 22, down significantly from the 6,697 daily average infections it added in the seven-day period ending November 15 — a period that coincided with increased crowds owing to festivities, and hazardous levels of air pollution.State revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said, “Delhi witnessed the third wave of Covid-19 in November, which was the worst so far. During that phase, the government decided to go for an aggressive strategy of creating micro containment zones. The idea was to arrest the spread of the disease at the earliest by bringing in a higher proportion of cases under scaled-up surveillance. Micro containment zones were created wherever district officials assessed transmission risk. The efforts have shown good results and Delhi is in much better shape now.”Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “Containment zones witness scaled up surveillance and concentrated efforts on the fronts of testing, tracing, health checks, etc. So, a higher proportion of active cases in containment zones is a good sign. It shows that the government has done better in identification and demarcation of such red zoned. It also shows that scaled-up efforts have succeeded in reducing Covid-19 cases in Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/61-of-active-covid-19-cases-in-delhi-s-5-5k-hot-spots-delhi-govt-data/story-oomIU13sJ6rPMRL0Sb2mZP.html

26-12-2020||Delhi||Raghav Chadha files police complaint for attack on DJB office||Senior Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairman Raghav Chadha on Friday registered an FIR against Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, a few other leaders of the party and unidentified suspects in connection with the attack on the Jhandewalan office of the water utility. In his complaint, Chadha said that a group of around 200-250 BJP workers entered DJB’s office premises in central Delhi’s Jhandewalan by breaking barricades and scaling the main gate, as “Delhi Police officials watched in silence”. He further said that the group — led by Gupta — physically assaulted and injured several DJB staff who were on duty and issued “imminent death threats” to him.A senior police officer, who did not want to be identified, said that a case under the Epidemic Diseases Act, and that under Indian Penal Code sections 188 (disobedience to an order passed by a government servant) and 427 (mischief causing damage) has been registered at Desh Bandhu Gupta Road police station. “We have not made any arrests so far,” said the officer.As for alleged vandalism inside the DJB premises, the officer said that the board officials will be asked to share details about the damage to property. “Based on that we’ll add sections to the FIR. Friday was a holiday because of which we couldn’t meet the DJB officials,” said the officer. “The goons of the BJP said that they are disgruntled because Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party have stood in solidarity with protesting farmers, because the AAP government did not allow stadiums to be converted into jails, and because the AAP leaders tore apart copies of the contentious farm laws in the assembly. They also admitted to leading similar attacks at residences of the chief minister and deputy CM Manish Sisodia (earlier this month),” Chadha, who is also spokesperson of the AAP, said at a press conference on Thursday, after the attack. The BJP have denied the allegations and hit back saying that supporters of the AAP had led the vandalism. Gupta said the charges levelled against him were baseless. “These are baseless allegations. We had organised a peaceful protest at the DJB office against a scam related to water tankers. A group of people there attacked us and one BJP supporter was severely injured.” Delhi BJP’s media head Naveen Kumar said: “We went there after Chadha did not take our calls regarding a meeting. There, a group of AAP supporters attacked us and then they vandalised the DJB office to mislead people and divert attention from the water tanker issue. No BJP protester engaged in any violence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/raghav-chadha-files-police-complaint-for-attack-on-djb-office/story-yVQ51geU2DiGRlybKyV0fO.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||Riot victims allege police forced them to file false complaints against Pracha, cops reject charge||A group of Delhi riot victims on Friday alleged that the police was pressuring them to file false complaints against advocate Mehmood Pracha, whose office was raided by the police on Thursday in connection with an alleged forgery complaint. According to his office, Pracha is representing, pro bono, nearly 100 people accused in various cases related to the communal riots that broke out in northeast Delhi in February. At a press conference held at the Press Club, the victims also claimed that the police threatened them to withdraw complaints and did not file cases. Sahil Parvez, whose father was allegedly shot dead by rioters, said, “Police officials and authorities did not listen to me while preparing medico-legal certificates or first information reports. Even though I named the rioters, no action was taken against them. Some were arrested and later released on bail. During this time, I was constantly threatened to withdraw my case.” Delhi Police spokesperson Anil Mittal said, “All such allegations are false and baseless. Investigation into cases is being done solely on merits.” Mohammad Wasim,who was seen in viral video showing police assaulting a group of residents and forcing them to sing the national anthem, said, the police refused to register an FIR in the case. “We sought Pracha’s help and were later threatened by police officials at Jyoti Nagar police station to withdraw our case. Police also told us that the person who was going to help us (Pracha) would also be implicated and killed,” said Wasim, a resident of Kardampuri. Mohammad Nasir Khan,who was shot at by rioters and lost an eye in the violence, said he received no legal help by the police in the days following the riots. “I had read about Pracha who took up cases pro bono of marginalised people from minority, Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe communities. However, after bringing him on board, we started getting threats that we should withdraw our complaints or get another lawyer,” said Khan, a resident of north Ghonda.Mohammad Mumtaz, another Delhi riots victim who lost his shop in the February violence in Khajoori Khas, said, “I wanted to name the locals who burnt my shop in the FIR but Dayalpur police personnel insisted on registering FIR against unnamed people. Following this, my house was also burnt by a mob and yet the police insisted on not writing the names of people I identified or even recorded videos of. After we approached Pracha to fight our case, I was asked to file a false complaint against Pracha.” Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020 after initial clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters went out of control and resulted in clashes between Hindus and Muslims. The riots left at least 53 people dead and around 400 injured. Police have arrested at least 21 persons for conspiring to orchestrate the riots. The arrested persons include prominent faces of the anti CAA protests such as former JNU student Umar Khalid, student activists Sharjeel Imam, Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, Safoora Zargar. Police have alleged that the arrested persons planned the riots, mobilised the rioters under the garb of the sit-in anti-CAA protests while the arrested persons have denied the allegations and accused police of launching a witch-hunt against anti-government voices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/riot-victims-allege-police-forced-them-to-file-false-complaints-against-pracha-cops-reject-charge/story-GDqXEVJydSLiecptRqPFSJ.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||Day after raid, Delhi Police book Mehmood Pracha for obstruction||A day after Delhi Police raided the office of senior advocate Mehmood Pracha in connection with a forgery complaint, a first information report (FIR) was registered against him at Hazrat Nizamuddin police station on Friday under sections 353 and 186 (obstructing public servant from doing his duty) and 34 (common intention) of IPC, said deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena. Two police officials privy to the development also said that the police would also send a detailed report about the incident along with video evidence to the court. Both Pracha and the police had recorded video of the raid.According to his office, Pracha is representing, pro bono, at least 100 persons arrested in the 2020 Delhi riots case, including Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad and Gulfisha Fatima. Pracha said the raid that began at noon on Thursday, ended at 2.30am on Friday. He alleged that the police assaulted and intimidated him. While the police said they had obtained a warrant to searched Pracha’s office, many political leaders and lawyers criticised police for the alleged high-handedness. On Thursday, Pracha had also filed a complaint at Hazrat Nizamuddin police station, alleging that some imposters posing as police personnel had visited his office and stolen data from his computers. Police did not comment on Pracha’s complaint.On Friday, as controversy surrounded the police raid, the Delhi Police released a statement on Thursday’s events. Police said that searches were carried between Thursday and Friday at Pracha’s office and the office of another lawyer, Javed Ali, in Yamuna Vihar after receiving warrants under issued under Section 93 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Police claimed the search teams were accompanied by independent public witnesses, staff in uniform, women police officers and videographers.DCP (special cell) Manishi Chandra, whose team had conducted the raids, said Javed Ali “extended cooperation” after seeing the warrant. “Being sensitive to the needs of a practising advocate, a facility was extended to him (Ali) to obtain a mirror image of the seized hard disk so that his normal professional activities do not get hampered. The whole operation that started at Ali’s Yamuna Vihar office around 5 pm Thursday ended at about 10 am on Friday,” he said in the statement. Chandra said the team that searched Pracha’s office was “met with stiff resistance”. “Pracha was served a written request to cooperate in locating the computer wherein the incriminating documents may be present so as to avoid a general search of all the computer systems which were found in his office,” said the DCP, adding that Pracha and his associates got “aggressive and abusive”. DCP Chandra claimed that when the police team tried searching for files with a particular keyword on a computer and informed him that a particular computer had to be seized, he got “verbally aggressive and created a ruckus”.Police had on Thursday said that they conducted searches at Pracha’s office in a case where two lawyers, including Pracha are accused of fabricating evidence and using forged notary stamp. On August 22, police had registered an FIR against Pracha after one of the riot victims told a court that the lawyer has asked him to fake a deposition and frame three people in riot cases. Pracha had then denied the allegations and said that he was being framed by police as he was representing many persons arrested in riots cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/day-after-raid-delhi-police-book-pracha-for-obstruction/story-qnrllxLrrnhVqj3y7dbBnO.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||Mercury likely to fall by end-December: IMD||Cold and foggy weather persisted in the national capital on Friday as the minimum temperature remained below five degrees Celsius for the third consecutive day, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.The Safdarjung observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum temperature of 4.6°C, three notches below the normal.“Moderate” fog reduced visibility to 201 metres at Safdarjung, while “shallow” fog was recorded in the Palam area, Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, said.According to the weather department, fog is categorised as “very dense” when the visibility is between 0 and 50 metres. In case of “dense” fog, visibility is between 51 and 200 metres, “moderate” 201 and 500 metres, and “shallow” 501 and 1,000 metres.Cold wave conditions are predicted in parts of Delhi on Saturday.A moderate intensity western disturbance is likely to lead to a substantial fall in minimum temperatures once again end of this month, according to predictions by weather forecasters.A gradual rise in minimum temperatures, by two to three degrees Celsius, is predicted in the next three days, followed by a drop in minimum temperatures between three and five degrees over northwest India between December 28 and 30.“Minimum temperatures are likely to drop to around 3°C to 5°C after December 28. Normally also, winter is at its peak during end-December and early-January. However, because of the influence of a western disturbance, it can be harsher. Both October and November have been colder than usual this year but December has been mild so far,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.Meanwhile, ‘cold wave’ to severe cold wave’ conditions are likely in isolated pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi and ‘cold wave’ conditions probable in isolated pockets over Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan and north Madhya Pradesh on December 28 and 29.Ground frost conditions are likely over parts of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and north Rajasthan during December 28 and 29. A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. Cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degree C in the plains. Slight improvement in Delhi pollutionAfter three consecutive days of “severe” pollution, Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) improved marginally to fall in the “very poor” category at 357. Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurugram, Noida, all of which had recorded severe air also improved marginally.According the Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality early warning system for Delhi, surface winds are likely to get stronger on December 25, and ventilation will improve resulting in improvement in air quality. “The wind speed increased to 10 to 15 kmph on Friday which helped improve air quality but we are expecting AQI to deteriorate again on December 27 and 28 to lower end of very poor or severe category. When a western disturbance approaches winds slow down which results in accumulation of pollutants,” said VK Soni, scientist at IMD’s air quality management division.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mercury-likely-to-fall-by-end-december-imd/story-utdXosVfOCjEXjZIXwLjJM.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||Man kills 9-year-old, sets body on fire in Maidan Garhi, arrested||A 22-year-old man allegedly kidnapped and murdered a nine-year-old and then threw the child’s body in a pond in south Delhi’s Maidan Garhi — all in an attempt to marry his childhood friend, police said on Friday after cracking the case.The suspect planned and executed the child’s kidnapping and murder after getting inspiration from a television crime show, the police said adding that the woman had turned down his proposal recently because she said she already had a child.Police said the child was kidnapped and strangled to death on November 28. The body was recovered from a muddy pond on Thursday (December 24), after a passerby spotted it and informed the police. The boy’s body was found stuffed in a plastic bag. His clothes were hidden between stones near the pond. The body as well as the clothes were semi-charred. The suspect, identified only by his single name Bittu, had tried to set them on fire to ensure his identity was never established, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur. “After strangling the child, Bittu had thrown the body in the muddy pond in a forested area in Maidan Garhi, went back home, and joined the child’s family in searching for him. He visited the crime scene the next day and noticed that the child’s body was visible in the pond,” said DCP Thakur. Bittu, the DCP said, then pulled out the body, took it inside a forested area and hid it there. He then purchased some petrol and went back to the place where the body was hidden. Bittu then allegedly poured the petrol on the body and sent it on fire. But due to the wet clothes, the body did not burn, said Thakur. “Bittu again hid the body in the forested area and returned home. He went there the next day, removed the clothes and shoes from the body, and stuffed it in a plastic bag. He threw the bag in the pond to make sure the body is not visible again,” added Thakur. Police said that the involvement of Bittu in the child’s kidnapping and murder emerged after the body was discovered on Thursday and technical surveillance of cellphones of people known to the boy showed his presence near the crime scene on the day the kidnapping happened. “We interrogated Bittu. Initially, he tried to mislead us. But when confronted with technical evidence, he confessed,” said a senior police officer. During the interrogation, the officer said, Bittu revealed that he liked the child’s mother and wanted to marry her. However, her family married her to someone else. A couple of years ago, the woman separated from her husband because of a marital discord. She then began living with her parents, the officer said. “Bittu then again started getting close to the woman. He frequented her home and got friendly with her and her son as well. Some days ago, he proposed to the woman, but was turned down by the woman who cited her son as a reason. Bittu then hatched the murder plan,” said the officer. On November 28, Bittu saw the boy outside his home in Bhati Mines and asked him to accompany him to a nearby forest to eat berries. They boarded a Gramin Sewa vehicle and reached Maidan Garhi. From there, they went to a forested area, where Bittu allegedly strangled the child with a towel and threw the body in the pond, said DCP Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-kills-9-year-old-sets-body-on-fire-in-maidan-garhi-arrested/story-MGSRZO26bHbOmNKrHqEffM.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||Soon, smoother ride to Mayur Vihar from Noida||Motorists travelling from Mayur Vihar-I to Central Delhi and from Noida to Mayur Vihar-I will soon have a smoother ride as the Public Works Department (PWD) is likely to open soon cloverleaves (loops) of the newly constructed Mayur Vihar-I flyover on Delhi-Noida Link Road. The 800-metre-long flyover was opened for traffic in January 2019 but the loops — meant to provide seamless connectivity to Mayur Vihar -I and to Delhi — were under construction. The officials say that now the construction of loops is almost complete and it is likely to be opened early next month.  Currently, the road beneath the flyover is closed so motorists have to take detours to reach their destinations in central and New Delhi.These problems will be solved once the cloverleaves are opened. One loop will allow the traffic coming from Noida to come down and drive towards Mayur Vihar. The other loop will start from Mayur Vihar-I side and join the flyover towards Akshardham. The length of both the cloverleaf flyovers will be 300 metre each.“Most of the construction work of cloverleaves is almost complete and only some finishing touches along with streetscaping at a portion of the service road is left. We would have completed it by now but the work was slowed down due to restrictions on construction activities owing to soaring pollution levels and shortage of material. The finishing touches will take only a few days. We hope to open the loops early next month,” an official said.Currently, motorists going towards Akshardham side from Mayur Vihar-I have to travel nearly one kilometre towards Noida to take a U-turn from underneath another flyover on the Link Road. Similarly, those going to Mayur Vihar-I from Noida have to travel nearly a kilometre extra to take a U-turn from underneath NH-24 flyover. “My office is located in Connaught Place and to reach there I have to travel nearly 1.5 km extra. It is because I first have to travel in opposite direction towards Noida to take a U-turn from underneath a flyover and then drive towards Akshardham. It not only consumes more fuel but also more time,” said Himanshu Giri, a resident of Mayur Vihar-I.Ratnesh Singh, another resident of the east Delhi neighbourhood, said the construction of loops was underway for a long time and it should be opened soon so that travel to central and New Delhi can become easier. “If loops are being opened next month, then it will be a New Year gift for us as it would ease our travelling woes,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/soon-smoother-ride-to-mayur-vihar-from-noida/story-OPMQhxN6OS9vGttLsfwhQP.html
26-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt rejects compensation claims of 12 cops who died on Covid duty||The Delhi government has rejected compensation claims filed by families of 12 out of 15 police personnel who were verified to have died of Covid-19 in the national capital, according to documents reviewed by HT. In rejection letters sent to the families, the city-state’s government argued that the officers hadn’t been “deployed on Covid-19 duty” when they were infected by the coronavirus.Since the first case of the disease was reported in the national capital on March 2, 31 police personnel have died of the infection, according to police and state government records seen by HT. Of the 31,Delhi police officers have so far confirmed that 15 officers were on Covid-19 duty at the time they were infected and subsequently died.Three claims are pending with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. Senior police officers are verifying he other 15 deaths before the compensation claims are forwarded to the government. The Delhi government had, in April, announced ₹1 crore in ex gratia (Latin “by favour”) for families of frontline workers who are infected by the virus on duty and die of the viral disease. From guarding containment zones to enforcing the lockdown, managing law and order to feeding the homeless across the city, Delhi Police have been at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic. “We analysed every case carefully and sent them to the government. These were also cases in which the government had promised to award the ₹1 crore compensation after the deaths were reported by the press,” a mid-level Delhi Police officer, who coordinates with the government’s home and revenue departments, said. “Delhi was a red zone and has around 6,000 containment zones even now. The people who died were on field duty and travelling across the city. Informing their families that the compensation has been rejected is difficult.”Constable Yogender Prashad Yadav’s family in west Delhi is one of the 12 who received letters from the government rejecting their claim. Yadav, who was posted at the Paschim Vihar police station in outer Delhi, died of the disease on July 7. His father Jagdish Yadav said: “ My son was among those who enforced lockdown norms. He went to different places to ensure that residents follow social distancing norms. He was even guarding containment zones. I want to ask the Delhi government the definition of Covid-19 duty.”The father added: “When police personnel died on duty of Covid-19, the chief minister had tweeted, promising that the state government would pay their families ₹1 crore as compensation. We request him to honour that promise.”In all the 12 claims rejection letters, the government wrote back to the police that “the deceased was performing his routine duty assigned to him and was not deployed for Covid-19 duty, which is a mandatory condition to become eligible for grant of ex gratia of Rs 1 crore.”.As on Thursday evening, 7,387 Delhi Police personnel were infected with Covid-19, of whom 554 are currently battling the disease.HT contacted the Delhi government to find out why the claims had been rejected, but there had been no response from the administration as of Friday evening. The state government did not also share details of compensation claims it had accepted and against which it had paid families of frontline workers who have died of Covid-19 till date..The state government had on April 19,2020 — in the third week of the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 — issued a notification promising ₹1 crore compensation for the families of frontline workers who die of the disease. “Any person including Doctor, Nurse, Para-Medical Staff, Security/Sanitation Staff, or any other Government Officer/Official including Police Officer/Official, whether temporary or permanent employee or contractual, in Government or Private Sector, deployed for COVID-19 duties by Government of NCT of Delhi, if expires by contracting the disease. During discharge of his/her duty, his/her family shall be compensated with ex-gratia amount of Rupees one Crore, posthumously,” read the notification. NCT is short for national capital territory. The national capital on Friday added 758 new cases of the infection, and 30 more deaths.Aruna Sharma, wife of police inspector Sanjay Sharma, who died of the disease on August 18, said the government’s announcement and subsequent rejection of the family’s claim worsened their condition. Sharma was posted with a police control room van. “Everybody thinks we will be paid ₹1 crore as compensation so they do not offer to help. Had the government not made the announcement, our friends and family would have come together to help us through these times. When the lockdown was imposed, the police did not have the liberty to work from home,” Aruna Sharma said. She said the government’s decision had left them in shock. “Delhi had the most cases across the country at one point. My husband was on field duty. The papers show he even conducted checking on the roads. It was in the police vehicles that accused persons were transported or the food to the homeless was collected for distribution. Currently, we are clueless what to do,” she said.Police expert Prakash Singh, former chief of the Uttar Pradesh and Assam police forces, as well as the Border Security Force (BSF), said: “If it is true that the policemen died of Covid-19 on duty and yet the cases were rejected, then it is very shocking. When people stayed at home, some essential service providers like doctors, police, chemists were on duty.... The police have to go to a containment zone if duty calls. The police functioning did not stop during the lockdown. They were more visible then. Any cop who was on field duty on the roads then deserve the claim much like the paramedic staff.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-rejects-compensation-claims-of-12-cops-who-died-on-covid-duty/story-MZhF1fMVrTqVcLEXr9h8dI.html

26-12-2020||Chandigarh||Year of the pandemic: Khaki warriors face an invisible enemy||From fighting off crime to standing on the frontline in the battle against Covid-19, Ludhiana police proved the age old adage true that when the going gets tough, the tough get going. While nothing could have prepared them to fight the invisible enemy that came in the form of a pandemic, they stood strong even as they lost two of their own -- assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Anil Kumar Kohli and assistant sub-inspector Jaspal Singh – to the virus.When the Punjab government, and subsequently the Centre, brought in a curfew to break to Covid transmission chain, the khaki warriors played a crucial role in enforcing the restrictions. Often at great risk to themselves, the men and women in uniform remained on the ground for hours at end without rest or sleep, facing the wrath of residents who were still trying to come to terms with the unprecedented times. Nearly 70 police personnel tested positive for the virus but they returned to their duty, soon after recovery.The cops also played Good Samaritans as they distributed ration among the needy and made arrangements to send migrants to their native places as the pandemic wreaked havoc to the economy. Rising to the challenges of the pandemic, they also helped cremate the bodies of corona victims as the process required a special protocol. Other challenges amid the pandemic Police had to rope in around 2,000 volunteers to help them enforce the lockdown. As people continued to venture out without masks and curfew passes, police had to establish four open jails to detain the violators. The police collected over Rs 5 crore as fine, through 1.1 lakh challans issued since March. The pandemic forced the police to suspend public dealing for three months –from July to October— and residents were asked to lodge their complaints via email. 3 new posts created The Ludhiana police also witnessed a change in its hierarchy after the government created three new posts of joint commissioner of police and abolished the post of deputy commissioner of police, headquarters. Now, the joint commissioners of police will the senior-most officers after the police commissioner. Deputy commissioners of police will now be third on the hierarchy chart. Also, with the induction of the three new officers, the city now has 44 gazetted officers – which include the police commissioner, five DCPs, 10 ADCPs, 24 ACPs and one DSP (anti narcotics). The city has 28 police stations and one women police station to deal with matrimonial disputes.A crime that shook the cityAmong the most gut-wrenching crimes that the city witnessed was the murder of four members of a family in Mayur Vihar in the last week of November. Builder and realtor Rajiv Sunda, 60, hacked to death four members of his family –wife Sunita Sunda, 58, son Ashish Sunda, 35, daughter-in-law Garima Sunda, 32, and grandson Suchet, 12, with an axe and knife on the morning of November 24. After the gruesome murders, he fled in his Maruti Suzuki Swift car before setting it ablaze and ending his life by jumping before a running train. A suicide note recovered from his house revealed that he had taken the extreme step as he was fed up of his daughter-in-law’s kin, who, he alleged, had been threatening to implicate him in a fake dowry case. He had also mentioned that the accused had not returned the money they had borrowed from him.Cops pulled out of Bains’ security detailLok Insaaf Party head and Atam Nagar MLA Simarjit Singh Bains found himself in a soup in April this year after he made a controversial statement against the police in response to an incident wherein a Nihang Sikh chopped off the hand of a cop on duty. Hurt and demotivated by his statements, four cops in his security detail submitted in writing to the police department that they did not want to serve him anymore as Bains had “insulted” the police department. Later, Bains complained to the Union minister of minority affairs, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and vice-chairman of the National Commission for minorities, Manjit Singh Rai about the withdrawal of his security. He alleged that police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal, in an interview after the incident, had tried to malign his image at the behest of the Congress government.LowsBroad daylight robbery at IIFLA gang of five armed robbers made off with at least 30kg of gold ornaments, worth more than Rs 10 crore, from India Infoline Finance Limited’s (IIFL) gold loan branch on Gill Road on February 17. Four of them had entered the branch and executed the crime in 25 minutes flat, while the fifth robber, who was waiting for them in a car, drove them off. The crime spot is located opposite the office of Punjab Police’s Crime Investigation Agency Staff-3 unit. Before the Ludhiana police could get any clue about the robbers, the Organised Crime Control Unit (OCCU) solved the case and arrested the accused.Finance firm employee’s custodial deathThe custodial death of Deepak Shukla, a finance company employee, on February 27 had raised questions about the working of the police. Shukla’s kin had alleged that he was tortured in custody. They were forced to approach the court as the police appeared to be shielding the errant cops by putting off the registration of the case. The case was finally registered on August 15 after court orders. Three cops–the then station house officer of Division Number 5 police station, sub-inspector Richa Rani, assistant sub-inspector Charanjit Singh and assistant sub-inspector Jaskaran Singh were booked under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code and the Contempt of Court Act.Flushing hooch into Sutlej River The Ludhiana police were caught on the wrong side of the law as a few personnel were pictured disposing off hooch, which had been confiscated in raids, in the Sutlej River. The police had flushed nearly 8.64 lakh litres of lahan (hooch) in river and polluted the water body. The same practice continued even after the hooch tragedy in Amritsar, Batala and Tarn Taran which claimed over 100 lives.No trace of domestic help who executed robbery Police failed to trace a Nepalese domestic help, who along with his two accomplices, had robbed the house of industrialist Sandeep Ghai after holding captive the latter’s elderly parents. The crime took place in the posh Gurdev Nagar locality on October 7. The accused had injured an 11-year-old domestic help and sedated the security guard of the house while carrying out the crime. At the time of the incident, Ghai, along with his wife and children, had gone for dinner to their relatives’ house in Model Town.Cops turn criminals While many laid down their lives in the line of duty, there were a few who brought embarrassment to the force by indulging in illegal activities. Division Number 2 station house officer, Amandeep Singh Gill, 39, was arrested by the special task force of Ludhiana police, after he and his aide Ajay Kumar were found in possession of 10.3-gm heroin on February 18. The SHO had recovered the contraband from five suspects, but instead of lodging an FIR against them, he had set them free for bribe.An assistant sub-inspector (ASI), Sukhpal Singh of Jamalpur police station had shot at his friend’s wife with his service weapon at their residence over a monetary dispute on January 14. At the time of the incident, the two teen daughters of the victim were in the adjoining room.Assistant sub inspector (ASI) Dharminder of Daba police station, along with a woman and a cable operator, had honey trapped a realtor and demanded Rs 50 lakh after claiming that they had a lewd video of him with the woman. The ASI threatened the realtor that he would implicate him in a rape case on the basis of the video. The Daba police had arrested all the accused on June 29.A head constable, Surinder Kumar, deputed at Kanganwal police post, had changed an entire FIR for a bribe of Rs 50,000 to benefit drug peddlers arrested with ‘Ganja’ (cannabis). He was booked on July 18. Five police personnel, including four ASIs and a constable, who were facing corruption charges, were dismissed from service on November 23.HighsDrive against beggingIn a drive against begging, that started in February, police had identified 1,170 beggars at 19 busy locations of the city and started initiatives to rehabilitate them. But the Covid-induced lockdown threw the drive off-track. But the police resumed the drive in November and within a month brought down the number to 435 by rehabilitating them. Police had released a Whatsapp number where residents could contact the police to share details about the location of beggars. Cache of drugs recoveredThe Ludhiana police recovered intoxicant syrups, tablets and capsules worth Rs 10 crore from the basement of a house in Jaipur of Rajasthan in September and October, and disrupted a drug supply chain with the arrest of five accused. Police had claimed to have recovered 13,000 capsules, 1, 76, 560 syrup bottles, 10.29 lakh tablets and 14,400 injections from their possession.Impounded vehicles returned to ownersLudhiana police had also handed over 239 impounded vehicles, 213 mobile phones and Rs 6.74 cash to its owners on superdari (interim custody) on October 30. The total worth of these properties comes to around Rs 4 crore. The step was taken as the police ran out of space to store these at the police stations. The police had earned over Rs 1 crore by auctioning 1, 705 unclaimed vehicles.Robbery at Muthoot Finance foiledPolice, with the help of the public, foiled a robbery at Muthoot Finance company’s Dugri Road branch on October 16. Three of the robbers had fled empty-handed after opening fire, injuring four employees and an onlooker. The robbers had filled gold worth Rs 15 crore in bags and some cash but before they could escape, the employees overpowered them.
