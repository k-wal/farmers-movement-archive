Our business is stronger now than it was in June. One of the key drivers of Uber’s business recovery is low-cost services like autorickshaws. With cities like Delhi and Mumbai, around 80% demand as compared to pre-Covid era, has been met, followed by cities like Jaipur and Chandigarh returning to almost 50% of pre-Covid levels,” said an Uber spokesperson.Ola has witnessed an increase in demand for cabs and autorickshaws in metro cities including Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.“We continue to see a surge in demand, with a positive growth trend over the past few weeks in cities that we operate in. Demand is recovering faster in metro cities like Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi and Hyderabad, with the opening up of offices and increased leisure travel. We continue to strictly adhere to our hygiene and safety protocols with industry-leading initiatives, thereby enabling every ride to be safe for both our customers and driver-partners.” said an Ola spokesperson.Black and yellow taxis and autorickshaws operating in the city have also seen an increase in the number of passengers and improved business since June.However, they have demanded a fare hike to boost the earnings of drivers who suffered losses during the lockdown.“There has been an increase in business after opening up offices, railway stations and airports. However, the demand is not enough for the drivers to sustain. We are hoping for a hike in fares and increased minimum fares. This would help the drivers.” said AL Quadros, leader, Mumbai Taximen’s Union.Further, autorickshaw drivers in the city have stated that as the activities in the city are resuming, passengers prefer travelling in autorickshaws with plastic dividers over buses due to minimal contact exposures.“We have seen many passengers not travelling in autorickshaws that are without plastic covers. The covers provide safety to the passengers and the drivers as well. As offices are slowly opening the demand for autorickshaws have increased across the city. As local train services are shut for the general public, people are opting for autorickshaws over buses as they come in less contact with other people,” said Raju Patil, an autorickshaw driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/surge-in-demand-for-autos-taxis-and-cabs-in-mumbai/story-TgQbyuicoEKai92vD8pBBL.html

Rao’s wife, P Hemlatha, told the court that Rao’s family is happy with the progress in his health, but needed to study the medical report before they could argue for his bail on medical grounds. The court accepted this and restrained the state and National Investigation Agency (NIA) from discharging Rao without informing the court. Rao is among the accused in the case of violence at Bhima-Koregaon case. On November 18, the court had directed the state to shift Rao to Nanavati Hospital for treatment. Rao has been in the hospital since November 19. On Thursday, Hemlatha’s petition regarding Rao’s medical condition came up for hearing and the state submitted Nanavati Hospital’s medical report on Rao before the division bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik in a sealed envelope.After seeing Rao’s report, the bench observed there had been some improvements in Rao’s condition, which Hemlatha’s legal team, comprising advocates Indira Jaising, Anand Grover and R Satyanarayan, confirmed. Jaising requested the court to give the family a copy of the report and to allow them time to study it so that they may argue further. She also requested the court to restrain the state and NIA from discharging Rao and returning him to Taloja Jail. The court acceded to the request and noted in its order, “Pursuant to the order passed by court on November 19, Rao is in Nanavati Hospital. Since the matter is adjourned to December 15, Rao may not be discharged from Nanavati Hospital without informing this court. The earlier order dated November 18 (related to visit of family members) shall continue.” Chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare and additional solicitor general Anil Singh for NIA informed the court they had no objection to the defence’s request. The court will hear the matter next on December 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-case-bombay-hc-extends-p-varvara-rao-s-stay-at-nanavati-hospital-till-december-15/story-LPKuDdgzXgRsa4myRIWYTJ.html

However, only a few hundred farmers agreed to move to the ground while the others are continuing their protest at the borders of Delhi.On Thursday, the number of farmers at the ground further reduced. Harpal Singh, manager of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, said that the farmers from Uttar Pradesh, who were staying put in the camps set up by the government, were not to be seen. “They were there for four days, but it appears that they left on Wednesday night and did not inform anyone before leaving,” he said.The Delhi government has set up makeshift tents, food stalls, toilets and medical camps for farmers at the ground, but farmers have refused all government favours. All the tents, which can accommodate thousands of people, are lying empty. Binder Singh, district president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Faridkot), said, “We do not need anything from the government. We just request the Centre to revoke the three black laws that it has imposed on us. We are living in our tractors and trucks and cooking our food. We have rations for over three to four months.”Malkeet Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Faridkot district, said they are representing their fellow farmers protesting at the Delhi borders. “The government is not allowing them to enter the capital. But some of us have to represent them inside the capital as well. We are doing that and we will not leave till the government accepts all our demands,” he said.The farmers said some of them make daily visits to ongoing protest sites at the Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri border points of Delhi. “We go there and meet our brothers daily. We have been asked by our leaders to stay put. We will leave and join them at the border if they ask us to do so,” Binder Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/up-farmers-leave-burari-ground-those-from-punjab-stay-put/story-JTo698ehgV6l5xVZWkgRdO.html

03-12-2020||Noida||Noida air quality still ‘very poor’, likely to worsen||Noida: The air quality of Noida on Thursday continued to remain under ‘very poor’ category for three days in a row, while that of Greater Noida and Ghaziabad improved to ‘very poor’ from ‘severe’ a day earlier. However, the air quality of the three cities is likely to worsen again over the weekend due to unfavourable conditions, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Thursday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 360 against 394 a day earlier. AQI of Greater Noida was 358 against 406 a day earlier, while that of Ghaziabad also improved from ‘severe’ category to ‘very poor’, with an AQI of 377 against 421 a day earlier. The AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to IMD, the wind direction is still north-westerly but the speed has dropped, leading to lower ventilation of the pollutants. However, the number of stubble fire incidents also dropped, due to which additional pollution mass intrusion into the region was also less, leading to slight improvement in the air quality. The wind speed is likely to drop further on Friday and Saturday, leading to further worsening, the Met department said. “The wind speed on Thursday afternoon reached a maximum of 8 kmph, but the fire incidents would have dropped leading to a little ventilation. A western disturbance approaches the Himalayan region on Friday that will lead to the change in the wind directions from north-westerly to the easterly. The wind directions, when change, tend to slow down the wind speed. So, for Friday and Saturday, the maximum wind speed would be around 5 kmph, which will lower the ventilation and increase the pollution levels,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. The fine particles or pollutants also saw marginal drop on Thursday, yet the PM2.5 levels were three times the safe limit. PM2.5 level for past 24 hours in Noida was recorded at 199 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³) against 255.66 µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 198.31 µg/m³ against 269.52 a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Ghaziabad was 225.04 µg/m³ against 302.79 a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 µg/m³. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), AQI is likely to suffer on Friday. “Air quality is likely to marginally deteriorate for the next two days within the Very Poor owing to calm wind condition. AQI is likely to marginally improve on December 6 due to better ventilation,” said the SAFAR statement on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-air-quality-still-very-poor-likely-to-worsen/story-pNbkkKUNpkHpXILkIPKVFJ.html

The other side of the road (from Noida to Delhi) where the protesting farmers are staying put remained closed on Thursday, they said.The farmers from districts like Gautam Budh Nagar, Etah, Mainpuri, Firozabad, and Bulandshahr, on their way to Delhi to protest the Centre’s new farm laws, had been stopped at the Chilla border on December 1. They have set up camps since then, and continued to stay there ahead of talks between their representatives and the central government in Delhi on Thursday.“Our next course of action will depend entirely on how the talks go today. A delegation has gone from here as well and we are waiting to hear from them. If our demands are met, we will disperse, else we will continue to stay here for as long as it is needed,” said Satveer Bhanu, a farmer from Jewar.The farmers have spent two consecutive nights at the border, sleeping on their tractors or on footpaths.

Several groups of farmers protesting at the UP Gate on Thursday morning blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the highway and it is likely to continue further, police officials said. In its advisory, the traffic police have stated that vehicles coming from Chijrasi, Vijay Nagar, Khoda, among others, will be diverted to routes in Noida while commuters from Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara, etc, should take the Kaushambi-Anand Vihar border to reach Delhi. The police also said that traffic coming from Moradabad and Hapur will be diverted through the Dasna flyover and then towards Raj Nagar Extension in order to move to Bhopra border near Delhi. “The traffic diversions will be in place till the farmers are at the protest site on the highway. So, diversions have been announced to avoid inconvenience to commuters on Friday,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic). The district officials said that they were in continuous talks with the farmers and even got opened one lane of the blocked section of NH-9, but the farmers again opposed the move. “It was after talks with them, we got opened one lane of the blocked part of the highway. But the farmers again started opposing despite giving assurance for opening. Still, we acted with restraint,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. With diversions already in place since Thursday morning, there was huge traffic flow at Kaushambi border with Anand Vihar. “The inner lanes of Kaushambi were packed to capacity with vehicles which were diverted to Delhi through the EDM Mall road. On Thursday evening, the main border road was again jam-packed and vehicles started coming on inside lanes of Kaushambi. In such a situation, we will face issues in coming days,” said VK Mittal, president of Kushambi Apartments RWA. Many commuters were left stranded on NH-9 as the blockade was sudden and the police could not get clues to it. “Commuters were left stranded on NH-9 near UP Gate as the highway was suddenly blocked. Thereafter, all the vehicles had to return back and take other roads in Indirapuram to move to Delhi. The Delhi-Ghaziabad side of the highway was running smooth on Thursday evening, but we will avoid the highway altogether on Friday,” said Kuldeep Saxena, a commuter and resident of Indirapuram. The number of protesters below the UP Gate flyover has swelled considerably and dozens of tractor-trolleys also came in from western UP areas like Bulandshahr with farmers to support the protest led by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). Apart from the BKU, farmers from Uttarakhand and Punjab have also come in and are staging protest at the blocked section of the highway, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/as-nh-9-blockade-continues-traffic-police-announce-diversion-ask-commuters-to-avoid-highway/story-ppTOv926yoi5X39srUCI5H.html

DK Bharadwaj, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said, “The diversion will kick in only when farmers protest causes any blockades and jam in the city otherwise traffic flow will be normal.” Police on Thursday said that extra force had been deployed at Kherki Daula Toll Plaza, Hero Honda Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Shankar Chowk, Kapriwas Border, Bilaspur Chowk, Panchgaon Chowk and Manesar Chowk to implement the plan.

Farmers from Punjab are sitting in protest against three farms laws at certain border points in the NCR with supporters from other states driving down over the last few days to join them. However, they have been stopped outside the district at several occasions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/traffic-police-draws-plan-to-divert-protesters-in-case-of-snarl/story-xjgBykCVqQ4owQ9uzWYjJM.html

The woman’s family alleged that the accused in the shooting incident had kidnapped her in August 2018 and held her hostage at a place in Sohna, threatening her to convert to his religion and marry him.The police on Wednesday summoned five family members, including parents of the accused, Touseef Ahmad, asking them to join the investigation, as the woman’s family alleged that they had played a major role in threatening them to compromise in the abduction case.Adal Singh Rawat, a maternal uncle of Tomar, alleged that she was abducted for three days in August 2018. “She was abducted and was threatened for life. Not only the suspect, but his relatives and parents also had forced her to marry him and were forcing her to convert (her religion). Later, the family used their political powers and forced us to withdraw the complaint. She was scared for her life and knew the suspect would harm her,” he said.Javed Ahmad, Touseef’s uncle, refuted the allegations of conversion and said that they have received a summons from the Faridabad Police despite having no involvement in the incident. “Both of them wanted to get married and there was no pressure on Tomar. Both the families had mutually resolved the issue and had asked both of them not to be in touch any longer. If we had used powers and forced her to change religion, then why did a wedding never took place?” he said. The testimonies of three witnesses — Tomar’s brother, cousin and a friend — were recorded on Tuesday and Wednesday at the district and sessions court, in presence of judge Sartaj Baswan. The friend was with her at the time of the murder, the police said on Thursday.After the murder, a special investigation team (SIT) was formed on October 27, led by Anil Kumar Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (crime), to probe the case.On November 6, the SIT filed a 700-page chargesheet in the murder case. Police said the chargesheet, which lists 60 witnesses, was prepared on the basis of technical, forensic and material evidence recovered during the investigation and was submitted to the court in less than two weeks after the murder.The charges against the suspects were framed on November 23 and the trial in the case began on December 1. Statements of three of the 60 witnesses listed by the police have been recorded so far.The police said statements of 15 more witnesses will be recorded between December 7 and 9.The police said the chargesheet is based on scientific forensic evidence, CCTV camera footage, call detail record (CDR) locations, and swabs collected from the shirt of the suspect, his car and gunpowder swab from his hand.Fingerprints were matched from three samples — from the car, pistol and the woman’s arm — the police said.Tomar was shot dead by Touseef, a resident of Kabeer Nagar in Sohna, in the presence of his friend, Rehaan, a resident of Riwasan in Nuh. Footage of the incident purportedly shows the two trying to force Tomar, a BCom final-year student, into their vehicle when she exits Aggarwal College after writing an exam, the police said.Anil Yadav, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that in the chargesheet, the motive behind the murder has been mentioned as personal enmity, as Tomar had stopped talking to Touseef after the abduction incident and a case her family had registered against him.The police said he had conducted a recce of the college and her residence twice in the week before the murder. He had bought a countrymade gun for Rs 7,000 from one Mohammad Azruddin, of Nuh. The police said Azruddin is a close aide of Touseef’s uncle, who is in Bhondsi jail for abducting a Gurugram police inspector.Yadav said that the countrymade pistol had only one bullet and he intended to shoot her at point-blank range in the chest. He had come with the intention to murder her, he said. “Touseef had allegedly borrowed his brother’s mobile phone a few days ago and was enraged to find that he was in touch with a woman named Nikita. But that woman was from another city in Uttar Pradesh and it was just a coincidence that the two had similar names,” said Yadav. OP Singh, commissioner of police said that they are investigating the case from all angles and have ensured the safety and security of Tomar’s family members. “We have deployed personnel at Tomar’s residence and an arms licence has also been provided to the brother. We have already submitted the chargesheet and if required, a supplementary chargesheet will be submitted. The investigation conducted by SIT has enough witnesses and evidence to prove the suspect guilty,” he said.He said that the family members of Touseef, who have been issued a summons, should join the investigation and if found clean, will be given clean chit. We are following all protocols, Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nikita-tomar-murder-2018-abduction-case-of-student-who-was-shot-dead-reopened/story-Jz8CAaBLyXOn8mXnvEr8GM.html

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia personally handed over tablets to 50 students on Thursday.Sisodia said the Delhi government’s revenue significantly reduced due to a slowdown of economic activities. “This is why we urged companies to help the students under their CSR initiatives. We are happy that Tata Power- DDL has given 1,059, BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) 543 and BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) 300 tablets, respectively, to the schools,” he said.“Soon, the corona vaccine will be released around the world, and this pandemic would be a matter of history. But the loss of education that our students are facing today cannot be compensated by any vaccine. To minimise this loss, the Delhi government is consistently working on solutions,” Sisodia said, adding more such companies should come forward and help students.The education minister asked students to use these tabs for their studies and return it to their school after their examinations so other students in need can also benefit from it.Satyam, a government school student in Ashok Vihar Phase 2, said their family just has one phone. “Everyone uses that phone. If the phone stops working, I end up missing my classes. We have to ask others for help but receiving these tabs will help us a lot,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-to-give-tablets-to-1-900-students-for-online-classes/story-tvpAdcfvdMJh9NX7k9v6IL.html
03-12-2020||Gurugram||Death rate up despite dip in positivity rate||Despite a steady decline in the test positivity rate of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram, an indicator of a deceleration in the growth rate of new infections, the district has continued to see an uptick in the number of the Covid-related deaths over the past four weeks, health department data shows.Official data also reveals the frequency of deaths to be increasing — from about one death per day in September to now nearly five deaths each day — in spite of apparent improvements in Gurugram’s test-positivity rate, which indicates a slowdown in the spread of the virus.Between November 20 and November 26, the district registered over 4,500 new Covid-19 cases, with a test positivity rate of 11%. With 18 deaths occurring during the same period, the death rate for the week was 0.4%.However, the death rate over the next seven-day period, between November 27 and December 3, shot up to 0.9%, despite the test positivity rate dipping to 6%. During this period, close to 3,000 new cases were registered, along with 28 deaths.Acknowledging the increase in the death rate (or the ratio of new deaths to new cases, taken as a weekly aggregate), health department officials speculated that unfavourable weather, coupled with poor air quality, maybe aggravating patients’ symptoms to a greater degree than witnessed earlier in the outbreak.Moreover, Gurugram has also noted an increase in the death rate among patients who do not have comorbidities. Between November 20 and December 3, for instance, a total of 13 deaths without comorbidities were reported, a spike from the six deaths reported over the preceding fortnight.“This trend requires a little more investigation because we typically see mortality increase alongside the growth of new cases, whereas presently, the death rate has been trending upward in spite of new cases slowing down,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram.Addressing the ongoing spurt in Covid deaths, Sharma said, “We have just been through a third wave, in terms of new daily infections, so an increase in deaths was to be expected. If past experience is any indicator, then daily deaths will reduce over the next week along with a further slowing down in daily cases. If that doesn’t happen, then we can say with a little more certainty that air pollution and cold weather are responsible for exacerbating symptoms among some patients.”The district had last seen such frequent mortality in June, when 93 deaths were recorded over 30 days. At the time, experts and officials attributed the spike in mortality to under-preparedness of healthcare systems. Presently, though, they said that the spurt in deaths was to be expected, given the extent of Covid-19 spread over the past two months.“On a hopeful note, our positivity rate has come down significantly over the past two weeks, and has remained under 10% for a few days. From about 800 cases per day in mid-November, we are now getting fewer than 500 new cases daily and testing numbers have been consistent,” Sharma said.However, given that Gurugram has also begun seeing more deaths among healthy individuals, Sharma said the role of extant environmental conditions cannot be ruled out.“Overall though, we are responding well and the situation is under control. Gurugram’s cumulative mortality rate is 0.6%, which is far better than neighbouring cities and districts. We also have enough beds and ventilators and there is no shortage of resources. We are stringently monitoring clinical symptoms among hospitalised patients so that we can make quicker interventions in case complications arise,” said Dr Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/death-rate-up-despite-dip-in-positivity-rate/story-rY6SZ5yjTMrmtOWjsp7MLL.html
03-12-2020||Gurugram||Most Covid-19 deaths among people aged above 60, shows data||Almost two-thirds of the patients who succumbed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, since the outbreak of the pandemic were aged above 60, according to the district health department data. A majority of them were on ventilator support at the time of death, the numbers show.On December 2, the Covid-19 toll of Gurugram crossed 300, of which 193 were senior citizens. As per the data, 82 (27.3%) of the 193 were in their sixties, while 73 were in their seventies and 38 in their eighties. Also, 46 aged 51 to 60 succumbed to the disease.In comparison, 28 deaths occurred among the patients aged 21 to 40, while 29 aged 41 to 50 succumbed to the disease, as per the data, which reiterates that older adults having underlying health conditions are at an increased risk, as Covid-19 burdens their immune system.As per the data, people having multiple co-morbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension and other illnesses, are highly impacted after contracting the virus. These account for almost 30% of the deaths, which has increased from 27.5% share, when the district recorded 200 deaths on October 25. Likewise, deaths due to single co-morbid conditions has also spiked from 22% to around 20%.The maximum surge was seen under the miscellaneous category, which takes into account diseases other than diabetes, hypertension, diseases of liver, kidney or any neurological illness. The category has shown a drastic spike of 21% from the share of 14% recorded in October.“In the miscellaneous category, other diseases like tuberculosis, pneumonia, septicemia, other auto-immune and influenza-like illness are counted,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.“The death audit committee constituted at the district level keeps a record of these deaths to study the cause. Overall in Gurugram, death numbers are controlled due to early referrals and management of home isolated patients.”Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine and public health, PGIMER-Chandigarh, said that in the miscellaneous/other category, unclassified deaths are also included. “In many cases, it is difficult to ascertain the cause of death due to which it remains unclassified.”Deaths among patients having diabetes accounts for 10% of the total toll, the same as it was when 200 deaths were recorded, despite an increase in active cases. Likewise, deaths due to liver, kidney or neurological disorders stood at 1.5%-2%, accounting for a similar share previously. Deaths among patients with heart conditions showed a minor increase — from 8.5% in October to 9.6% in December.As per the data, almost 97% of those who died had been hospitalised, with at least 209, which is almost 70%, put on ventilator support. As many as 76 were on oxygen support, with six on non-invasive ventilation (NIV). In the last nine months, as many as nine people were brought dead, indicating they have not received access to health care at the right time or late diagnosis, as per the data.The occupation-wise break up of the data points out that 59 people had private jobs or business, two were self-employed and three were unemployed. As many as 34 were homemakers while three were labourers/farmers. Also, one health care worker and a government employee died due to illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/most-covid-19-deaths-among-people-aged-above-60-shows-data/story-FjN6gNWeiXRYXJBCr4UKcN.html
03-12-2020||Noida||Farmers’ group blocks Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of NH-9||A section of farmers, who had been so far protesting below the UP Gate flyover near the Delhi border, shifted base to the National Highway-9 (NH-9) that connects to the flyover, and blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway. UP Gate in Ghaziabad is one of the major borders with Delhi and had been witness to the farmer protests under the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) banner since Saturday. The BKU on Thursday had given a call for a “mahapanchayat” under the flyover and the numbers of farmers in the area swelled as more arrived from the Terai belt and even from states like Punjab and Harayana. Soon after, a smaller group of farmers moved ahead and blocked the highway section, while BKU leaders remained under the flyover. The farmers are protesting the Centre’s new farm laws, which they say are against their interests. The association of farmers are in talks with the government representatives who met for the second time at Vigyan Bhawan on Thursday. Some of the senior leaders in the BKU said that the farmers had blocked the highway despite calls that it would create issues for commuters. “There are lot of groups of farmers who had come to the UP Gate site and some went to block the highway. It is likely that it (the blockade) will continue if the government doesn’t decide soon. The decision can be taken in two minutes but the government seems not willing. If talks are prolonged, we will also be forced to continue our agitation,” said Naresh Tikait, national president of the BKU. The Ghaziabad traffic police on Thursday evening announced diversions and advised commuters to avoid NH-9. The highway, as per official estimates, caters to about 120,000 passenger car units per day and part of the Delhi Meerut Expressway project linking Delhi to Meerut. It caters to local commuters of Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida and other nearby areas while it is also used majorly by commuters travelling to Moradabad, Bareilly and Lucknow. “We have lot of hopes that talks turn successful and farmers go back to work. We have no intention to create issues for public. We want resolution of sugarcane prices and even electricity issue which farmers are facing. The farmers have already raised demand to roll back the bills which have been brought by the government,” said Tikaid. Tikait was also joined by Dr Udit Raj, national chairman of All India Confederation of SC/ST Organizations, at the protest site below the UP-Gate flyover. “It is the government whose conduct has forced farmers to block the highway and they have also been forced to sit at Singhu-border. Initially, the government termed that the protesting farmers are only from Punjab. So, it is the dictatorial attitude which has forced farmers to take to highways,” said Raj. “If farmers go weak then workers, who are mostly from SC/ST and Dalits, will also face issues as a result and their conditions will also deteriorate. The bills brought by the government are not transparent and will result in exploitation of farmers at the hand of businessmen. It should be rolled back besides the minimum support price should be fixed. This sector needs protection.” Despite heavy deployment and repeated talks with the farmers at UP-Gate, the district officials could not get the highway opened up for commuting till Thursday night. “The one side of the highway is blocked despite our regular talks with the farmers at the site. The police tried to get one lane of the blocked section opened but farmers again resumed protest at the site. Our officers are continuing talks. The farmers however are allowing passage to ambulances,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-group-blocks-ghaziabad-delhi-carriageway-of-nh-9/story-N8m3KXrPtd8ZCJa7UFDKFM.html
03-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi Dialogue Commission partners with think tank to combat pollution||Delhi government’s policy think tank, Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi (DDCD), has entered into a “strategic partnership” with Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy (Vidhi) to address the issue of air pollution in the national capital. According to the MoU signed on December 3, both institutions will work closely to suggest and analyse policy and legal reforms to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR. Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson, DDCD, said innovative solutions like odd-even road rationing scheme, the introduction of the EV policy, and the PUSA bio decomposer as an alternative to stubble burning, have been launched by Delhi government to tackle air pollution under chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. She said the CM is hopeful that the present collaboration with Vidhi will attain positive outcomes to address and tackle air pollution. Vidhi is an independent think-tank doing legal research to make better laws and improve governance for the public good.“Vidhi will also be helping the DDCD in the analysis of various directions passed by courts and authorities on air pollution,” Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-dialogue-commission-partners-with-think-tank-to-combat-pollution/story-5LSP5ST2UPbsYOpEz6B0UP.html
03-12-2020||Chandigarh||Private schools agree to 8% fee hike, UT admin to take final call||Even as private schools have been urging the Chandigarh administration to allow them to go in for a 16% fee hike in the 2021-22 session as the regular hike of 8% was not permitted this year due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the Independent Schools Association (ISA) has announced it will ask private schools to go stick to an 8% increase next year according to the Fee Regulation Act 2016.The administration, however, will take a final call on the matter. “We had a meeting with the UT education secretary and the UT director of school education (DSE) on Thursday after which we have decided that instead of our previous demand to hike school fees by 16% this year, we will settle for 8% as per the provisions of the Fee Regulation Act,” said HS Mamik, ISA president.Parents not convincedParents’ associations, however, are not convinced. “It is very unfortunate that schools want to increase their fees after the year everyone’s had. School expenditure on electricity and water have gone down. They haven’t been paying their bus drivers and their maintenance staff, so why the need for a hike? Due to online classes parents’ expenditure has gone up. Many parents had to buy phones and high speed internet connections. Schools need to cut them some slack,” said Nitin Goyal, president of the Chandigarh Parents’ Association.A principal wishing to remain anonymous said fee hikes were necessary as many schools had slashed teachers’ salaries and their arrears during the lockdown period had not been cleared. “A fee hike according to regulations is needed,” he said.The ISA will hold another meeting with the authorities in the next 10 days to discuss other issues that include making NCERT books mandatory for students and the EWS reimbursement,allegedly not paid for the last nine years. “The fee hike issue from our end has been resolved and we will ask the other 75 schools which are a part of the ISA to settle for a hike of up to 8%,” said Mamik.Admin to take final callCommenting on the matter, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, DSE, said, “After detailed discussions with the ISA we have put forward suggestions to the senior officers of the administration. They will take the final call.”Private unaided schools that aren’t a part of the association are likely to follow the ISA’s directions.Kavita Das, principal of St John’s High School in Sector 26, said, “This is a decision that will be taken by the management of the school. However, we will be complying with the regulations and not hike the fee by more than 8%.” Anuja Sharma, principal of DAV Model School in Sector 15, said her school hiked the fee by a bare minimum even before the Covid-19 outbreak. “This year also the bare minimum has been done for the running costs of the school.”In June this year the Chandigarh administration had used provisions of Disaster Management Act to not allow private unaided schools to hike the fees by 8%. Parents were asked to only pay the tuition fees according to the 2019-2020 session guidelines. The ISA had then asked for a clarification from the education department if the pending 8% could be ‘adjusted’ later. Schools had earlier challenged the administration in the Punjab and Haryana high court for stopping them from imposing the fee hike. The matter is pending.Meanwhile, the admission process for entry level classes in schools has started and will continue till December 16. Most schools have not put up their fee details yet on their websites. DSE Brar said that since the matter had not been sorted out, schools did not have to upload details as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/private-schools-agree-to-8-fee-hike-ut-admin-to-take-final-call/story-VRiJ1GVRwlCQEAgkWOBs5J.html

The CM transferred Rs 100 crore to the bank accounts of about 5 lakh farmers under Mukhya Mantri Kisan Kalyan Yojana. Under the scheme, a farmer is supposed to get Rs 4,000 every year in two instalments of Rs 2,000 each in addition to Rs 6,000 under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, as per the communiqué.Chouhan said, “I decide in this farmers panchayat that those who own agriculture land for 50 years whether they are brahmins, kshatriya, vaishyas or from the backward classes, they all will be made owners of the land by awarding lease (patta) to them.”Chouhan said, “the speculations about the closure of mandis and discontinuation of support price system are misleading and untrue. Farmers should not pay attention to such speculations.”Also read: Cyclone Burevi - Thiruvananthapuram airport to remain closed on FridayHe said the farm laws introduced by the central government would bring revolutionary changes in the lives of lakhs of farmers in the state and will double their income by 2022.He said, “With the new farm laws, farmers will have the freedom to sell their produce anywhere. The speculations of closure of mandis are misleading and utter nonsense. Farmers are being misguided that the support price system will be discontinued. As long as I am alive, support price system will not be discontinued.”He said, “my government is the government of farmers and in the last 8 months more than Rs 25,000 crores have been deposited in the bank accounts of farmers under various government schemes. Copies related to farming, et cetera., will now be available online and invitation by the revenue board management system for appearing in revenue courts, including mutation, will be made online.”He said, “my government has resumed the welfare schemes for the poor, which were discontinued by the previous government and now budget will be given for the schemes as per the population of the poor in the state. Many farmers are in debt due to the previous government’s loan waiver scheme. Such farmers need not worry. The state government will pay the interest for that period and farmers will be freed of the burden of interest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/people-in-possession-of-agriculture-land-up-to-2-acres-for-50-years-to-become-owners-cm-chouhan/story-VhYwfj7ntLW2cIAyCX7PeN.html

If the Chandigarh administration has its way your restaurant experience could be at a different level altogether: 165 feet in the air to be exact, suspended from a crane, with a 180 degree view of the city and the Shivalik Hills.Proposals have been made to set up or “hang up” a restaurant with a capacity for 24 persons offering five course lunches and dinners with mocktails and later, beer and wine, if permissions are granted.“The project is being considered to give a fillip to the tourism industry in the city. Sukhna Lake, Leisure valley, or Kaimbwala village are the options where the project can be started. The administration will take a call on the location and other terms and conditions of the project at a meeting scheduled on Friday,” said a senior UT official on condition of anonymity as he’s not authorised to speak to the media. Daman Kapoor, MD, DSH Bliss Adventures Pvt Ltd, which aims to bring the flying restaurant concept to the city, said, “This is a unique restaurant. Other places offering such concepts include Agra and Bengaluru.” All safety measures will be in place, assures Kapoor. “The structure will be secured by aircraft standard safety belts on comfortable seats which can rotate a complete 180 degrees.” Visitors will be allowed in batches of 25 with a 40 minute stay. It will take around one and a half minutes both ways for the ‘restaurant’ to be lifted 65m and to return to terra firma. Visitors will have to book the seats online on a given website and mobile app. Ticket prices are yet to be finalised and are likely to range between Rs2,500 to Rs4,000. The restaurant will have age and height restrictions for the visitors. “If approvals are given we will start the restaurant by Lohri 2021,” said Kapoor. Earlier, in 2009, an experiment with sky dining was launched at the Chandigarh National Crafts Mela in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/you-could-be-flying-in-for-a-bite-at-this-restaurant-in-chandigarh/story-5pL07jL0jBjpF0xA2U3OcP.html

There seems to be less consistency.Obama, in his recently published memoir, has said that the Congress leader appeared to be like a student eager to impress the teacher but lacking aptitude and passion to master the subject.Asked about this, Pawar said it was not necessary that we should accept everybody’s view.“I can say anything about the leadership in our country. But I will not talk about the leadership in another country. One should maintain that limit....I think Obama crossed that limit,” he said.Asked about the Congress’s future and if Rahul Gandhi was becoming a “hurdle” for the party, Pawar said the leadership of any party depends on what kind of acceptance he or she has within the organisation.“Though I had differences with (Congress chief) Sonia Gandhi and the family, even today Congressmen have a sense of affection for the Gandhi-Nehru family,” the NCP chief, who quit the Congress over the leadership issue two decades ago, said.

03-12-2020||City||Land laws: National Conference leader Devender Singh Rana hits out at BJP for betraying Jammuites||National Conference (NC) provincial president Devender Singh Rana on Thursday reminded the BJP about the safeguards to lands and jobs in Himachal Pradesh, saying the latter conveniently hid facts to justify denial of rights to permanent residents here.“It is typical of BJP to mislead and hoodwink the public for furthering their petty political agenda,” Rana said while addressing an impromptu series of election meetings in support of party candidates from Nagrota and Dansal.Rana, however, advised the BJP not to test the sagacity of politically agile people of Jammu, who have understood their game plan of trampling the identity of the people of the largest Dogra state, which the saffron party has dwarfed by bifurcating it into two union territories. “The shell-shocked people of Jammu are feeling disempowered and marginalized and the damage caused to their psyche and pride is beyond repair. The recent measures are going to hit Jammu the most,” he added.He asked the BJP leaders to convince the people of Jammu about their ill-advised decisions like domicile keeping in view the checks and balances available in Himachal Pradesh and several other states. “If safeguarding the rights of the people in Himachal is sacrosanct, how come these are of no consequence in Jammu? This is sheer hypocrisy which exposes the intent of the BJP. The harm caused to the legitimate interests of Jammu is unparalleled and doing so under the garb of hyper-nationalism is an insult to the patriotism of Jammuites, who are suffering the most due to these unpopular political decisions.”Rana exhorted the people to throng the polling stations in large numbers and register concern over usurping of their rights by supporting the right candidates who stand guarantee to their identity and unspooling the glorious Dogra pride.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/land-laws-national-conference-leader-devender-singh-rana-hits-out-at-bjp-for-betraying-jammuites/story-j2thg12KSdQVlD5BaWG8PP.html

Such utterances of the top ruling party leaders are highly irresponsible and create hatred and division in the society,” said Sharma.Challenging the BJP to seek votes on its performance and arbitrary decisions in J&K, the Congress leaders said that people would not get hoodwinked by the false promises of the ruling party regarding jobs security and land protection.The senior Congress leaders questioned BJP for its continued alliance with the parties of Gupkar declaration in the Kargil Hill Council. They alleged that BJP leaders were emotionally exploiting voters in Jammu for electoral gains by raking up such issues against their present allies in Kargil, which speaks of the BJP’s politics of deception and falsehood.They also appealed to the people to reject the parties and candidates who are out to divide the voters to the advantage of BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-raking-up-gupkar-pak-issues-to-hide-own-failures-j-k-congress/story-lts7mochUETMQMtZH1gyMK.html

03-12-2020||Kolkata||TMC distances itself from Suvendu Adhikari, rebel hits road||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Thursday distanced itself from former minister Suvendu Adhikari by removing him from the party’s employees’ federation, a trade union front where he was the chairman. Adhikari, who headed three important departments, had resigned from the cabinet on Friday. Without even naming Adhikari, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said during a meeting with the federation members at the state secretariat that education minister Partha Chatterjee, who was chairman of the body in the past, will head it again. Adhikari did not attend any meeting of the federation in recent months. Adhikari took part in three back-to-back non-political rallies at different locations in East Midnapore district, his home turf, on Thursday and made significant statements without naming anyone. His followers put up posters in the heart of south Kolkata, a stronghold of the TMC, in the morning. “One does not need posts to serve people,” said the posters that bore large images of Adhikari. “Some people say I do my politics from a comfort zone. Let me remind them that I have always fought for idealism and will continue to do so. I am into people’s struggle and will be in it,” Adhikari said at a programme at Garbeta. TMC leaders, who carefully watched his moves, said it was apparent that Adhikari was organising his people for his next political move. There are speculations that he may join the BJP or form a political outfit of his own with TMC leaders who have grievances against the ruling party. Also read: Our right to build dam on Brahmaputra, says China as experts warn of impactAdhikari led a huge rally in Contai town to mark the birth anniversary of Khudiram Bose, the first freedom fighter hanged by the British in Bengal. When journalists asked him how would he identify himself, Adhikari said, “I am son of Bengal and son of India.”“I led people’s struggle at Jangalmahal, Nandigram and Netai,” said Adhikari. This was a significant statement because countering the Maoists at Jangalmahal, an erstwhile Maoist-controlled zone covering parts of three districts bordering Jharkhand, became an important agenda for Mamata Banerjee after coming to power in 2011. Before that, the violent struggle against the CPI(M) at Nandigram (where Adhikari is now the legislator) and Netai helped Banerjee oust the Left Front government. The TMC faced a crisis on Wednesday afternoon when Adhikari told the leadership that it was not possible for him to work for the party. Adhikari wrote a text message to Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy, saying the problems he was having in the TMC were far from over. This happened barely 14 hours after the TMC informed the media that Adhikari told top leaders at a discreetly held meeting on Tuesday evening that he would not leave the party. Adhikari even talked to the chief minister over phone in the middle of that meeting. Abhishek Banerjee, the chief minister’s nephew, and election strategist Prashant Kishor attended the meeting and held most of the discussion since Adhikari is unhappy with several decisions taken by them, said TMC leaders. Roy replied to Adhikari’s text message late on Wednesday night. TMC leaders aware of the development said the essence of Roy’s message is that the party informed the media about what happened at Tuesday’s meeting and the fact that Adhikari had agreed to the decisions. The rebel leader was also told in the message that if he changes his stand then it is his entirely his business. “The party will not make any public statement on Adhikari anymore,” Roy said on Thursday. Asked whether the TMC would suffer a big loss prior to the polls if Adhikari joined the BJP, Roy said, “TMC is a big party. It does not make much difference if one or two leaders leave. Mukul Roy (now a BJP national vice-president) had left too. The party will face the elections under Banerjee’s leadership.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-distances-itself-from-suvendu-adhikari-rebel-hits-road/story-B5tORRvUnYbefQfjZg6CTJ.html

Also, the branch is facing acute shortage of staff.This has come to the fore during the ongoing inquiry of the illegal buildings marked by the municipal commissioner to MC additional Commissioner Rishipal Singh.The inquiry was marked following a complaint submitted by RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal. He had alleged that the MC suffered a revenue loss of around ₹50 crore due to its failure to take against the illegal constructions.A building branch official requesting anonymity said that in the reports it has been stated that action is not taken against residential buildings on the recommendations of councillors and other public representatives. But construction of many commercial and industrial buildings has been allowed under political pressure in the past.Slamming the claims, the mayor said, “The officials are free to work with no political pressure. If any councillor or MLA pressurises any official, then they should submit a complaint to me and I will look into the matter. The officials are only making excuses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-constructions-building-branch-staff-under-political-pressure-admit-ludhiana-mc-atps/story-ZZnmZ7GbAg6k400ZWZlZTJ.html

It will be very difficult for the MC to replace manual scavenging with mechanical desilting in old parts of the city, the official said.The initiative was launched on the occasion of World Toilet Day. Monthly evaluation of the work done will be held in February, March, and April on call or by conducting field visits.

However, my putting was patchy as I made some good conversions, but also had three three-putts which all resulted in bogeys,” said Joshi, currently ranked 10th on the PGTI merit list.“Importantly, I replaced the three-iron in my bag with a gap wedge for this week as I felt the latter will suit me more for the yardages at this course. The addition of the gap wedge seems to have helped me as it set up a couple of birdies for me today.”Akshay Sharma, the winner in Panchkula last month, endured a poor start as he dropped a bogey on his opening 10th hole. Sharma then rallied with birdie-eagle on the 12th and 13th where he sank 20 and 10 feet putts, respectively.Sharma impressed with long conversions through the day. He went on to drain birdie putts from a range of 20 to 35 feet on the 17th, third and eighth.Akshay, currently fourth on the PGTI Order of Merit, said, “I didn’t have a great start but the eagle on the 13th really lifted my confidence. It was windy and I struggled with my hitting making only 12 greens in regulation. I sank a lot of long putts today but missed as many as three short putts within five feet.”“I’m feeling the momentum since my win last month. Playing on my home course adds to my confidence so I’m looking forward to another good week,” added Sharma, who followed up his win in Panchkula in early November with a third place finish in Chandigarh the following week.Gurugram’s Veer Ahlawat and Noida-based Amardeep Malik were joint fourth with scores of 68.Bengaluru’s Chikkarangappa, the 2018 champion, was tied sixth at 69, along with the Chandigarh duo of Angad Cheema and Shabeg Singh Kooner and Faridabad’s Abhinav Lohan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jeev-milkha-singh-invitational-2020-day-one-bengaluru-s-joshi-on-top-of-the-leaderboard/story-5vo6HYFScbvUs7mm1lRnwK.html

A dedicated helpline in all Covid hospitals be notified so that the family members, near and dear ones of the patients can get in touch to know about his/her wellbeing.“Such patients, who are willing to afford, be permitted to have trained nursing attendant at their own costs as this would be a long way to reduce the burden on the hospital staff,” the bench stated. The court further directed that the wrapping up of bodies of those Covid patients, who succumb to the disease, shall not be done in the ward.“The state may also consider making Covid test mandatory for people entering the state from the outside,” the court directed.

The state government, during its last cabinet meeting earlier this month, had announced to set up ‘madhugram’ in every district to promote apiculture in state. Officials say that Uttarakhand honey has demand in both national and international market as it is organic, therefore increasing productivity will help locals earn a living. HC Tiwari, joint-director for horticulture in Kumaon region in the state, who also looks after the beekeeping project, said that there are approximately 300 nyay panchayats in the state where ‘madhugram’ or honey clusters are being set up by the department. “Production of honey is a process which can give earnings to people throughout the year except during the monsoon. As Uttarakhand’s honey is famous for its organic properties, it is a good source of income and we are trying to promote the same among locals across the state,” said Tiwari. As part of this initiative, the horticulture department has asked district-level officials to identify areas where beekeeping can be done successfully, like Terai regions, agricultural lands in the hilly districts. After the identification of locations, locals will be trained in beekeeping (as the process involves dealing with a live insect), and then they will be given boxes used as beehives. Also read: ‘We brought our own food’ - Farmer leaders at Vigyan Bhawan meetOne box costs Rs 4000 of which Rs 3200 will be paid by the department and Rs 800 will be borne by the beekeeper. The official further said that the locals can earn an amount between Rs 70/kg to around Rs 300-400/kg for honey, depending on the demand and the type of honey being produced. “The type of honey that will get produced after beekeeping depends on the flowers that the bees suck nectar from. During these winter months, mostly mustard honey is produced as that is the crop the bees feed on. In the months of March-April, it is flower-based honey, which has a higher price, thus the earnings vary accordingly,” added Tiwari. He further said that during the months of lockdown, beekeepers earned around Rs 300/kg as the demand for honey increased, “because people were more focused on building immunity to fight Covid-19 and preferred organic honey”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-to-give-80-subsidy-for-beekeeping-honey-production-to-promote-self-employment/story-Hy8oziO1BpfS98146r6E6O.html

The Iucaa was served notice by PL Deshpande’s nephew’s Jayant Deshpande and Hemant Deshpande on November 18 seeking clarity about the royalty of late author and his wife Sunita Purushottam Deshpande. The Iucaa said on Wednesday that there was no need to drag the issue to the courts and that it could be discussed amicably. According to Iucaa officials, will of late Sunita Deshpande has offered all rights of the plays, books and writings by PL Deshpande to the science body. However, Deshpande family has alleged that there are discrepancies in the way Iucaa is handling the will. “There are many discrepancies in the way Iucaa is handling the will and also arbitrarily charging royalty and fees for using our uncle’s literary work,” said Jayant Deshpande, who owns a transport business. The issue came up when younger brother Hemant Deshpande’s son Yash wanted to use a script for a special programme that he was planning as part of the centenary celebrations of PL Deshpande. “We had written to Iucaa and they sent us a long letter asking for minute details of the programme. As part of the Deshpande’s family, at least we have a right to his works too, but not like this,” said Jayant Deshpande. NV Abhyankar, senior administrative officer, Iucaa, said there has been a misunderstanding and he along with others at Iucaa are looking at an amicable discussion in person. “There seems to be some sort of misunderstanding and miscommunication about the rights as implied in the will as well as about the royalty charged. We received the will from Sunita Deshpande while she was alive. She and Pu La had visited Iucaa on Narlikar’s invitation and had loved the fact that this despite being a UGC-run autonomous research facility, offered a lot of insight into science for children too. In fact, PL and Sunita were instrumental in helping build Muktangan building within the Iucaa campus,” said Abhyankar. PL Deshpande, who died on June 12, 2000, was fondly remembered by fans as Pu La. Pu La had great regard and fondness for Iucaa, due to which his wife in her will gave all the rights of his books and other material to the centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/iucaa-says-it-wants-to-settle-issue-with-pu-la-family-amicably/story-EsxmeOvNSTOnD30ES4ufjM.html

He described the BJP governments at the Centre and state as dictator. He said suppressing the farmer’s movement has exposed the real face of both these BJP governments and now everyone knows they support the capitalists and big corporate houses. Mehra added that the new laws will ruin agricultural institutions like APMC and end the minimum support price to encourage black marketing, hoarding and profiteering of agricultural products.“All this is being done to benefit big corporate houses. Agricultural sector is in great crisis and instead of helping farmers, the Centre is bent on destroying them,” he said.“Neither the agricultural budget and subsidies are being increased nor are farmers provided with agricultural equipments or waive off on loans,” he added.“The recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission have been pending since the last two decades and are not being implemented. Therefore, it has become extremely important that the workers, farmers, women, youth, students, socially and economically weaker sections of the country unite and raise their voices against the government to stop implementation of policies that only benefit corporates and capitalists,” Mehra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/citu-left-parties-in-himachal-extend-support-to-farmers-protest/story-HqUgO3j3UhmlWUnh4hFOKN.html

PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “I have instructed the estate department to check the present status of all the properties owned by the municipal corporation. There are complaints that at many places the PMC properties which are vacant have been encroached.” To increase the revenue for the municipal corporation, the municipal administration is planning to lease these properties and develop with the help of private partners. According to Rasne, the civic body owned thousands of properties which fell under various reservations and amenity schemes. “It is tough to maintain all these properties. With the influence of local leaders, some of the prime properties are getting misused. PMC is not getting any revenue from these properties,” he said. “I am planning to bring a new proposal and very soon to rent out some of the properties. It would help to get good revenue for the municipal corporation. It would be a win-win situation for both the civic body and the citizens. PMC would get more revenue and properties would be saved from encroachments,” Rasne said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-to-survey-properties-for-encroachment/story-AE0f9e1tC59ygAIl90TJhL.html
03-12-2020||Pune||More fire incidents than last year as shortage-of-firemen issue heats up||The eight-month lockdown restrictions because of Covid situation have not eased firefighters workdays. The number of incidents reported by the Pune fire department between January and November outnumbers those registered in 2019. The department saw 750 small and big fire and natural hazard incidents from January till November, 2020, according to officials. The 2019 figure was 650. The department is facing a shortage of over 510 men and requires 12 more fire stations to provide better services to citizens. During the recent fire incident at Lohiyanagar in Bhavani peth slums on November 23, the response time was delayed by more than 25 minutes as trained drivers were unavailable. The shortage of firemen delayed the control of fire by the men on ground. According to the civic activists, manpower crunch is affecting the operational effectiveness of fire department. Civic activist Vihar Durve said, “The fire department does not have the necessary infrastructure to keep pace with rapid urbanisation in the city. Manpower shortage is severely affecting their work. We feel that the department must be run professionally and adequate number of resources must be dedicated to it.” The fire department said that three stations which have been constructed over one year are yet to function due to lack of manpower. “The control room had around 55 persons during the initial years, but now 10-12 staff are managing in shifts. The current manpower of 490 persons is just half of the manpower needed to cover the city requirements,” said Prashant Ranpise, chief fire officer, Pune. Of the 510 vacant posts, 390 are exclusively for firemen, he said. The fire department is also facing shortage of drivers and have to summon those appointed on contractual terms from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) vehicle depot in emergencies . And most of the drivers from PMC vehicle deport are not trained in driving fire engines. The department also needs drivers for quick response vehicles “Devdoot” as it has to depend on contractual drivers. Even fire assistants hired on temporary basis make it difficult for the department to function, states an internal circulation study of the department. Ranpise said, “There are critical issues related to manpower shortage, including trained drivers, assistants, firemen and other skilled staff, and we have conveyed our need to the PMC for swift action. The work is getting affected due to expanding nature of the city and growth in population. New recruitment has been stalled as the state government has not given its approval for the recruitment roster prepared by the PMC in 2014. Hence, neither can new recruitment be done nor can there be promotions. We can’t operationalise the three new fire stations due to lack of manpower and work is suffering.” Pune Mayor Muralidhar Mohol said “All the grievances and demands of the fire brigade will be taken up with the state government and necessary funds will be injected to increase the functioning capability of the fire brigade department.” Fire department expansion, a necessity Info: Manpower crunch is affecting the operational effectiveness of fire the department in Pune 2020: 750 big and small fire hazards in Pune2019: 650 big and small fire hazards in PuneManpower shortage: 510 staff Fire stations needed in Pune: 14 Control room staff earlier: 55 Control room staff now: 10-12 Fire stations non-functional for lack of staff Dhanori Kale Padal Gangadham Spaces reserved for new fire stations Nana peth Tingarenagar Wadgaon Budruk Narhe Response time delayed by 25 minutes in a recent fire due to shortage of workforce||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/more-fire-incidents-than-last-year-as-shortage-of-firemen-issue-heats-up/story-af7fHrW59fbBTC2IagQVLI.html

The two accused —Shubham of Kakowal Road and Deepak of Sarpanch Colony — had been on the run, while three of their accomplices —Gurpreet Singh of Bawa Colony, Sanjiv Kumar of Anandpuri and Mohit Sharma of Vishwakarma Colony — had already been arrested on October 19.Division Number 6 station house officer inspector Amandeep Singh Brar said Shubham had surrendered himself before the court of judicial magistrate Himanshu Arora on December 1. The court had remanded him two days in police custody. The interrogation led to the arrest of Deepak from his house on Thursday and the seizure of the weapons used to commit the crime that had been buried under a tree near Gurudwara Ganga Ghat. Police said the accused had left the city to evade arrest but had returned shortly after. The accused had committed the robbery at Gill Road near the Advanced Training Institute (ATI) on October 9. The car-borne robbers had hit the victim’s scooter and after he fell, they made away with the scooter containing the cash. They also injured the victim using sharp-edged weapons and threatened him with a pistol before fleeing. A case under Sections 394 (injuring the victim while committing robbery), 201 (hiding evidence), 411 (retaining stolen property), 324 ( voluntarily causing hurt ) of the Indian Penal Code and different sections of the Arms Act was lodged against unidentified robbers at the Division Number 6 Police Station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2-wanted-for-3-4-lakh-robbery-land-in-police-net-in-ludhiana/story-f8liDm6Km7vqYZoA8VHgvO.html
03-12-2020||Pune||Daily Covid-19 test target puts additional financial burden on PMC||PUNE The state government’s order of daily Covid-19 test target for all civic bodies in the state has put the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in a soup as the increased RT-PCR tests mean additional financial burden on the civic body.The PMC which has a population of 35.38 lakh has a target to conduct 5,840 tests daily, according to the target set by the state government. Currently, the PMC conducts about 2,900 tests daily. However, it is now pondering on the expenses it might have to incur to keep up with the target.Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Currently, we have maintained a ratio of about 75:25 RT-PCR and RAT Covid-19 tests which means that we have maintained the proportion as recommended by the state government.”“We have already spoken to the National Institute of Virology and its current capacity is not enough to suffice the new targets and if we speak with private laboratories it will cost the civic body dearly,” she said.As per the target of 5,840 Covid-19 tests daily, the civic body has to conduct at least 75 per cent of the tests through RT-PCR by February 2021. This would mean that the civic body will have to conduct at least 4,380 RT-PCR tests every day and at the cost of Rs 1,000 per test, so it will have to shell out Rs 43,80,000 every day.Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer, PMC, said, “We do not have a bifurcation as such but about 30-35 per cent of the tests are RAT while others are all RT-PCR and we are decreasing our dependence on RAT.”“We have 16 private labs for RT-PCR while five government labs. The civic body sends its samples only to the government facilities which offer services for free. However, due to limited testing capacity at government facilities, the PMC might have to depend on private testing laboratories which may cost dearly,” he said.The state government in its letter wrote that the civic bodies may use their CSR funds or the local funds to meet the expenses due to the increased expenditure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/daily-covid-19-test-target-puts-additional-financial-burden-on-pmc/story-2VwaJKGSfamaJJt7adaigJ.html

03-12-2020||Pune||TB treatment could be shortened to four months, shows Sassoon hospital trial||BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital (SGH) has successfully reported through a trial that with better drugs the tuberculosis (TB) treatment trial could be shortened from the current six months course to four months. This will not only be cost effective for patients, but also be less damaging due to the reduced drug usage and the adverse effects caused by the same. The study was conducted over two years and has been found to be effective for mass treatment too. The hospital’s pulmonary department had collaborated with the World Health Organisation and US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The SHINE trial or Shorter Treatment for Minimal Tuberculosis in Children was termed as successful during the virtual 51st union conference on lung health which was organised in October. The trial showed that a shortened four-month regiment of the drugs, namely rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide plus or minus ethambutol in children with smear-negative, non-severe TB was as much effective as the current and standard six-month treatment, with no difference in adverse events. These findings have the potential to change current treatment guidelines for children with drug-susceptible TB. The trial was conducted on 86 participants in SGH. The WHO noted, “Long treatment regimens can result in high costs to families and health services, potentially with added toxicity, risks of drug-drug interactions in children living with HIV, and problems with pill-burden and adherence.” Dr Murlidhar Tambe, dean of BJMC and SGH, said, “India assumes the world’s largest burden of tuberculosis, and the treatment is prolonged and difficult—particularly for children. Our team is proud to have contributed to findings that shorten the length of treatment, and we are grateful to the families who participated in this important effort.” Dr Samir Joshi, who was also involved with the study, said, “We found promising results in a shorter time with changed drugs specifically rifampicin which was earlier expensive but over time has become cheaper. This is time and cost saving for the monitoring doctors and patients too, who do not have to travel repeatedly to the hospital for regular follow up. Also, reduced use of drugs means that it is less damaging to the patients. We would also recommend it for mass treatment, however, it is the call of the government.” The team from India included BJGMC JHU-India SHINE team members, Dr Aarti Kinikar-BJGMC principal investigator; Dr Vidya Mave- JHU Pune principal investigator; Dr Priyanka Raichur- study coordinator; Dr Mandar Paradkar; Savita Kanade; Aparna Nijampurkar; Vandana Kulkarni and Neeta Pradhan.A similar study by BJGMC also found that the four month course of daily TB treatment is as effective as six months in adults. The results of a Phase 3 trial found that a daily regimen of high-dose rifapentine with moxifloxacin administered over four-months is as effective as the current six-month standard of care. With no difference in adverse events, the shortened treatment is just as safe. The study enrolled more than 2,500 participants from clinical sites in 13 countries, including the BJGMC-JHU-India clinical research site in Pune, where 61 participants were enrolled, which was the largest drug-susceptible TB treatment trial ever conducted by CDC or NIAID.Doctors from SGH said that for the adults’ study, the team included Dr Sanjay Gaikwad; Dr Lokhande; Dr Vidya Mave; Dr Nishi Suryavanshi; Dr Neetal Nevrekar; Dr Sandesh Patil; Vandana Kulkarni; Neeta Pradhan; Savita Kanade; Sadaf Inamdar; Sameer Khan; Smita Nimkar and Sapna Adhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/tb-treatment-could-be-shortened-to-four-months-shows-sassoon-shine-trial/story-I2HZhn2rLWlnUJLC3PKTxI.html

Sharma, in a statement here, said health services were in a shambles even as Covid fatalities had increased.“The state cabinet’s decision to cancel the winter session of the Himachal Pradesh assembly reflects this government’s incompetence in dealing with the situation.” More than 200 questions were to be asked about health facilities and related problems during the session. It was important because in the current circumstances when there was community spread of the disease, the government had not revealed plans to deal with the crisis, he added.It should come out with the truth. Every village in the state had reported a spurt in cases, but the government was running away from its responsibility. Hardly any facility existed for Covid patient management in the state hospitals, the Congress leader alleged. Even as the elections for municipal corporations had been cancelled, arrangements were being made for panchayat polls. “How will the government ensure that there is no overcrowding at the polling booths? How many staff are to be employed for a smooth election process?”Sharma asked. “History will remember that during a global pandemic there was incompetent government in the state which was unable to take effective decisions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hp-govt-hiding-truth-about-covid-community-transmission-cong-leader/story-T21dh3kV4fLRxmGhvfKsWL.html
03-12-2020||Pune||Stone crushing work halts in Gevrai taluka after threat to orphans’ health||Sachin Khade, the tehsildar of Gevrai taluka has issued an order to stop the stone-crushing work at Govindwadi Manyarwadi grampanchayat, Gevrai taluka. The “stop work” order was issued to a stone-crushing machine, following complaints of environmental pollution and illegal digging by the private firm which operates the crusher. The order came following complaints from villagers that orphans staying at the Sahara Balgram orphanage in the vicinity of the stone crushing site were facing serious health issues due to indiscriminate stone crushing activity. Gevrai tehsildar Khade said, “We have issued a written notice to the crusher owner that, if he is found operating without permission his equipment will confiscated. Currently, the crusher is shut.” Sahara Anathalay Parivar, which runs the institute under the aegis of Aai foundation, has been taking care of the orphans for the past 16 years. The stone crusher is located at a distance of one km from the orphanage, where 106 orphans between the ages of six and 18 are cared for by the management. The institute, in a petition dated November 2 addressed to the district collector, states that the orphans were facing serious noise-related issues due to constant blasting at the stone-crushing site. District collector Rahul Rekhawar said, “The crushing site is currently non-functional. It was permitted earlier. Now there is no permission.” The petition also pointed out that pollution emanating from the project is a serious threat to the children’s health.

03-12-2020||Pune||Patient’s condition vital in determining CFR: PMC study||PUNE A Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) study, based on data from its internal app tracking critical Covid-19 patients, has found that the baseline severity, or condition in which patients were admitted to hospital, proved to be a major factor in determining the case fatality rate (CFR). While the CFR for those who did not need oxygen on admission was about 3 per cent, it was 75 per cent among patients who needed a ventilator upon admission. It also found that males had a higher CFR than females. The study was concluded based on data filled in by 70 city hospitals and found that of the 4,644 critical patients, 901 died during a hospital stay. A total of 3,743 were discharged. The duration of the hospital stay averaged seven days. It also concluded that the hospital mortality progressively increased from lower to higher age groups. Mortality was 4.1 per cent in patients younger than 30 years of age, but increased to 32.6% in patients aged 61 years or above. Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director of Sahyadri Group of Hospitals, said, “We have found that the recovery time of critical Covid-19 patients is difficult. The oxygen requirement of the patients is too much as the lung damage is extensive. By the time the patient is admitted on the ventilator or in the ICU, the damage to the lungs is so severe that the recovery time exceeds other infections. We do not have many options to treat a Covid-19 patient since it is a new disease.” The study found that early detection of Covid-19 and treatment proved to be critical factor in saving lives. Age groups, gender, baseline severity of admission, history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, epilepsy, mental disease, organ transplant and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the time of admission to hospital were considered as potential predictors of mortality. The model showed that age greater than 60 years, history of hypertension, history of lung disease and history of kidney disease were significant independent predictors of increased hospital mortality, in addition to strong independent effect of baseline severity on admission. In patients less than 30 years of age, and those between 31 to 45 years of age, only severity of illness on admission was an independent predictor of mortality. In the age group 46 to 60, and above 60, in addition to baseline severity of illness, history of hypertension and history of pulmonary disease were significant independent predictors of mortality. In addition to these, higher systolic BP on presentation was a predictor of mortality in the age group 46-60 years, and history of kidney disease was a predictor of mortality in age greater than 60 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/condition-of-patients-when-admitted-to-hops-major-factor-in-determining-cfr-study/story-Kr8fUf10GOtxD1ychTZj0H.html

Velenkar said, “Pune Municipal Corporation in 2017 decided to stop drainage water flowing from nalas and erected drainage lines for it. A total of Rs 56 crore was spent on this work. The sewage line erected between Gandhi lawns and Saket Society located at Pathwardhan Baug was completed in 2018.” Velenkar alleged, “While erecting this pipeline, the contractor did not connect the drainage lines to the chambers. When we raised this issue with the municipal commissioner in November 2019, he instructed the contractor to complete the work, but the work did not get completed.” Sajag Nagrik Manch has now written a letter to municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar demanding action against the contractor and concerned officers.

03-12-2020||Chandigarh||Nigam Bhandari is president and Yadupati Thakur working president of HP Youth Cong||Nigam Bhandari and Yadupati Thakur have been appointed president and the working president, respectively, of the Himachal Pradesh Youth Congress (YC). Both will be holding the leading positions in the state unit of the party for the first time. Bhandari belongs to Kinnaur district and has been a part of the Youth Congress for a number of years in Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu’s group. Thakur, who is from Sarkaghat in Mandi district, has also led the National Students’ Union of India, the student wing of Congress, for quite some time. He is known to be close to former chief minister Virbhadra Singh. Election for the new president was held for the October 30 in which Bhandari polled 40,010, Thakur got 37,375 and another candidate, Amit Pathania, got 5,998 votes. There were 540 NOTA votes. All three leaders of the YC were interviewed on behalf of the All India Youth Congress in Delhi. To have a member of Sukhu’s camp as the state YC president is believed to have dealt a big blow to veteran Congressman Virbhadra Singh’s camp, sources say. However, the Congress high command has tried to reconcile the two factions by appointing Thakur from Virbhadra Singh’s camp as acting president. Bhandari and Nigam later met Rajiv Shukla, who is in-charge of Himachal Congress, in Delhi. Congratulating the new leaders, Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee president Kuldeep Singh Rathore said he hoped the YC would make a concerted effort to strengthen the Congress and connect more youth with the organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nigam-bhandari-is-president-and-yadupati-thakur-working-president-of-hp-youth-cong/story-9Z6eKHTa9yAFCB5jIURz3H.html

The chief minister later told mediapersons that while he and his government were not involved in mediation in any way and the matter had to be resolved between the Centre and the farmers, an early resolution was vital in the interest of both Punjab and the country. Stressing the need to protect the minimum support price (MSP) and continue with the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) based mandi system, Amarinder urged the Union home minister to listen to the farmers with an open mind to resolve the standoff quickly so that farmers from Punjab and other states, including a large number of women, can return to their homes. A solution has to be found at the earliest, he said, adding that he had come to meet the home minister to reiterate Punjab’s stand on the imbroglio and the need to secure the future of the farming community and agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capt-amarinder-meets-amit-shah-appeals-to-centre-farmers-to-find-early-solution/story-dTz9aFsX2HbU9gvZMhW1hP.html
03-12-2020||Chandigarh||Supreme Court grants anticipatory bail to former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in murder case||The Supreme Court on Thursday granted anticipatory bail to former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini in the 1991 disappearance and murder case of a junior engineer. A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah allowed the appeal of Saini against the order of the Punjab and Haryana high court, declining him the pre-arrest bail in the 29-year-old case. The top court directed Punjab Police to release Saini on bail in the event of arrest on furnishing of a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and two sureties of the like amount. It had reserved the order on the plea of Saini on November 17 in the alleged murder of Balwant Singh Multani. Also read: Five years on, probe into police firing at Faridkot’s Behbal Kalan, Kotkapura still a work in progressSaini was booked in May in connection with the disappearance of Multani when he was working as a junior engineer with the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (Citco). The top court had on September 15 granted interim protection from arrest to Saini in the matter and sought the state government’s reply on his plea, challenging the high court order refusing to grant him anticipatory bail. DECORATED OFFICER FACING POLITICAL VENDETTA: ROHATGI During the hearing of the matter, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Saini, submitted that his client had been a decorated officer who rose from the ranks and was a prime target of terrorists for his ruthless handling of the menace in Punjab and that the present case is an example of political vendetta as some FIRs were registered against the present chief minister by him when he was in service. The state government had opposed the plea, saying the grant of anticipatory bail to Saini at this stage would hamper the probe. The top court had asked the state government why the custody of Saini would be needed when almost 30 years have passed since the alleged offence was committed. On September 8, the high court had dismissed Saini’s two pleas, including the one on anticipatory bail in the case. MURDER CHARGE AFTER TWO COPS TURN APPROVER Saini had approached the high court after a Mohali court dismissed his bail plea in this case on September 1. On September 3, Punjab Police claimed that Saini had absconded, while denying his wife’s claims of withdrawal of his security cover. A Mohali court had on August 21 allowed Punjab Police to add the murder charge against him in this case. This came after two former Chandigarh Police personnel, former UT police inspector Jagir Singh and former assistant sub inspector (ASI) Kuldeep Singh, who are also co-accused, turned approver in the case. Multani, who was a resident of Mohali, was picked up by police after a terrorist attack on Saini, who was then the senior superintendent of police in Chandigarh, in 1991. However, the police had later claimed that Multani had escaped from police custody of Qadian police in Gurdaspur. Saini and six others were booked on the complaint of Multani’s brother, Palwinder Singh Multani, who is a resident of Jalandhar. The case was registered against them under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causes hurt) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at Mataur police station in Mohali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/supreme-court-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-former-punjab-dgp-sumedh-singh-saini-in-murder-case/story-J51WqIagBi2vn904CXkXJK.html

Besides Kachhi Dargah-Bidupur bridge, another four-lane bridge on the river has been proposed near Danapur. While the Central government has decided to bear the civil cost of the entire project, the State government was supposed to bear the expenses for land acquisition.A senior officer of the RCD said that the Central government had agreed to spend Rs 800- Rs 1000 crore on purchasing the land from farmers and other agencies. “As this is a greenfield project, the farmers need to be taken in confidence for selling their land as per the prevalent land acquisition act,” the officer said.The NHAI has already started the process of building 39-km long, four/six lane road between Kanhauli in Bihta and Ram Nagar in southern Patna, which will be the first phase of the ring road project, which has been sanctioned under the PM’s special package to Bihar in 2014. A sum of Rs 823 crore would be spent on the first phase.Also Read: RJD begins probe into poll defeat, focus on Kosi & Seemanchal routAdditional chief secretary, RCD, Amrit Lal Meena said the process of land acquisition between Ram Nagar and Kachhi Dargah would be completed soon, as the modalities for financial support from the Centre had been stipulated for the project.As proposed, the ring road will be connected with Patna-Ara stretch of national highway 30 at Bihta, and those willing to go towards Begusarai or Gaya need not pass through the dense traffic in the capital city, once the ring road is complete in the next three years, said a senior RDC officer.Also Read: Sushil Modi files papers for RS by-poll, Nitish says it’s rare distinctionThe proposed alignment of the ring road passes through Bihta, Naubatpur, Dumri, Beldari Chak, Ram Nagar, Kacchi Dargah (all located in Patna), Bidupur (Vaishali) Asitpur, Nayagaon, Dighwara (Saran), Shepur and Bihta (Patna district).Bihar State Road Development Corporation (BSRDC) managing director Sanjay Agrawal said the construction of the 22.7km-long Kachhi Dargah-Bidupur bridge connecting Patna to Vaishali was going on in full swing. “The project would be complete by the end of next year, if everything goes well with the plan,” said Agrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/center-to-bear-cost-of-key-stretch-of-land-for-patna-outer-ring-road-project/story-D61u1OZhhmt39ueTnQOSOM.html

03-12-2020||Mumbai||MOFA doesn’t apply to MMRDA land: Bombay HC on key legal point raised by flat buyers||The Bombay high court has refused to stay the construction of an additional residential-cum commercial wing at Universal Garden-1 at Oshiwara west, observing that the purchasers of flats on land belonging to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) cannot invoke provisions of the Maharashtra Ownership Flats (Regulation of the Promotion of Construction, Sale, Management and Transfer) Act (MOFA), 1963.The plea was moved by the association of flat purchasers from Oshiwara District Centre (ODC). Justice AK Menon said no relief can be granted to the flat owners’ welfare association and its 97 members by invoking provisions of the 1963 enactment.“On a plain reading of Section 31, with Schedule-II of the MMRDA Act, it becomes clear that MOFA does not apply to MMRDA or any land or building belonging to or lands vested in the authority,” said justice Menon.The association and its members have filed a suit against the developer, Pagarani Universal Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., for a declaration that the developer had no right over any additional floor space index available on the property and cannot put up any additional construction on the property without their consent.They had moved a plea for urgent interim injunction against the developer for stopping the ongoing construction of an additional wing, a residential-cum commercial building, on the property, after MMRDA issued the commencement certificate for construction of ground plus eight upper floors to the developer.The association and its members contended that the developer had exploited to the fullest the development potential of the land available at the time, and had no right to construct a new building without their consent. They asserted that the permission granted by MMRDA, allowing the developer to utilise additional FSI, was illegal for being without their consent.They insisted that MOFA was applicable to their case, as their agreements with the developer referred to several provisions of the 1963 enactment, although the MMRDA Act, 1986, specifically excluded applicability of MOFA to the lands and properties belonging to the authority.HC refused to accept the argument, holding that the provisions of MOFA, statutorily excluded from applying to MMRDA lands and properties, could not be invoked by the association and its members.The judge rejected the argument advanced on behalf of the association that the developer was bound by the obligation under MOFA because of the terms of their contract with the developer.Also Read: 15-week transformation for Navi Mumbai mangroves: 7,000kg trash removedHC also noted that there were clauses in the agreement, clearly indicating that the consumption of future FSI would not be affected by terms of the agreement and the developer will have an absolute right to additional construction or consume any balance FSI or TDR on the property.Prima facie, the judge said, these clauses may appear to be contrary to the settled legal position, as contemplated under section 7 of MOFA, that once flat purchasers are put in possession and the time for formation of society is expired, developer cannot exploit the land over and above what is disclosed to the flat purchasers, without their consent.“These are aspects which would come into play only if provisions of MOFA are applicable,” said justice Menon.The single judge bench was also of the opinion that perhaps there was no contravention of section 7 of MOFA in this case, as some clauses in flat purchasers agreements with the developer showed that he was constructing wing A and intended to make further construction in future.“Each of the agreements for sale are said to make reference to buildings that are yet to be constructed,” said the court. “The construction now underway is therefore clearly fitting the description of the further construction that was contemplated in the said annexure which forms part of the agreements for sale,” the judge noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mofa-doesn-t-apply-to-mmrda-land-bombay-hc-settles-key-legal-point-raised-by-flat-buyers/story-XWQtEaM9SqawSTvyF4X3YL.html

03-12-2020||Bhopal||MP triple murder mystery solved with 3 arrests but serial killer still on the loose||Police in Ratlam district in Madhya Pradesh claims to have solved a triple murder case, about a week after the heinous crime took place, with the arrest of three of the four accused. The main accused, a Gujarat resident, is a serial killer involved in at least six murders including two in Gujarat and the remaining in Madhya Pradesh. 38-year-old Dilip Dewal, the mastermind behind the killings, is known for looting homes and killing the occupants, who are mostly women to ensure less resistance leaving no evidence behind, the police said. In Ratlam, three members of a family namely Govind Solanki, his wife Sharda Solanki and his daughter Divya Solanki were shot dead in their house at Rajeev Nagar on the intervening night of November 25 and 26 when people were busy celebrating chhoti Diwali (Dev Uthani Gyaras) festival with firecrackers drowning out the gun shots fired by the assailants. Police said the occasion was chosen carefully for this purpose. “During the investigation, police found that serial killer Dilip Dewal, a resident of Dahod Gujarat, killed them with the help of three persons--Anurag alias Bobby, Gaurav Bilwal alias Golu, both residents of Ratlam and Lala Bhabor, a resident of Dahod, Gujarat. The accused entered the house to loot valuables, said Gaurav Tiwari, superintendent of police, Ratlam. Police have arrested Anurag, Gaurav and Lala while Dilip is still absconding. The latter was awarded life imprisonment in Dahod for killing a businessman but he jumped parole two years back. Since then, he had been staying in Ratlam with a changed name. Police have seized at least two fake Aaddhar cards used by the serial killer, said the SP. According to the police, Dilip decided to rob Solanki, who used to run a saloon, after learning that he had recently sold a piece of land. “Govind Solanki used to run a salon in his house. Dilip came in contact with Govind on the pretext of a haircut to see the location of rooms in the house. After all the planning and recce, Dilip entered his house on the night of November 25 along with Anurag and Gaurav. He first shot Sharda who was watching a television programme followed by her daughter, who rushed out of her room after hearing the gunfire. Both died on the spot. The accused looted cash and jewellery and were about to leave when they saw Govind Solanki enter the house around 9 pm. They waited for him to enter the house and then shot him dead,” said the police officer.

According to the SIT officials probing the scam in Haridwar and Dehradun districts, the accused, arrested on Wednesday from Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, is identified as one Anil Kumar. “During the investigation of the fraud, it was found that Kumar, the director of four ITIs including three in Haridwar and one in Dehradun, had shown fake admissions in the institutes,” said superintendent of police, Manjunath TC, who is heading the SIT. “Showing the fake admissions, he had drawn Rs 3.46 crore from the state social welfare department as scholarship money. Cases were then registered against him, three in Haridwar and one in Dehradun,” Manjunath added. The police officer said that Kumar had however got a stay from the high court in the case.

Soon after that, the court issued a non-bailable warrant against him. He was then finally arrested on Wednesday and produced before the court which later sent him to jail,” said Manjunath. As per the directions of the Uttarakhand high court, there are two SITs of the Uttarakhand police probing the scam. One of them is headed by inspector general Sanjay Gunjyal, who is investigating the cases in 11 of the total 13 districts except Dehradun and Haridwar. The other SIT headed by Manjunath is investigating the alleged scam in Haridwar and Dehradun districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-sc-st-scholarship-scam-iti-director-arrested-over-3-46cr-swindle/story-lVW20zcU50Fu6NQnGhIzAN.html
03-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s AQI improves marginally but remains in very poor category||Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the very poor category though showing a marginal improvement on Thursday morning. At 7am, the air quality index (AQI) was 345, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The average AQI on Wednesday was 373. However, government agencies have forecast a deterioration in air quality from December 4 onwards, as winds are going to turn calm. At the same time, a change is likely in wind pattern from north-westerly to easterly, which may bring moisture allowing accumulation of pollutants close to the ground. On a scale of 0 to 500, an AQI value between 300 and 400 is considered very poor, and that above 400 is considered severe. Also read | Why Delhi may be on right track in Covid-19 fightAccording to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the air is likely to remain in the very poor zone on Friday, but from Saturday, wind speeds will slow down and there will be further deterioration of air quality. They warned that on December 6 and December 7, the AQI might even slip to the severe zone, scientists said. “From December 4, the winds will slow down again. Our forecast says that on December 6 and December 7, the air quality will be at its worst and is even likely to slip into the latter end of very poor or severe,” a senior IMD scientist said. He added that the change in direction is due to a western disturbance that will affect Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh from the night of December 3, which will also have an impact on Delhi. “Whenever there is a change in wind pattern, winds turn calm and trap pollutants,” he said. IMD also said that there is a forecast of shallow fog on December 4 or 5. The minimum temperature will go up and settle at 10-11 degrees Celsius in the next two days. On Wednesday, the Safdarjung Observatory, which is considered the official reading for the city’s weather, recorded a minimum temperature of 8.2 degrees Celsius, a point below normal. The maximum settled at 26.7 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-aqi-improves-marginally-but-remains-in-very-poor-category/story-F4ACPgAmrUpvJyPILgShIL.html
03-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The best staircase chai||Arpit Kakar always has trouble getting home. Ever since he set up a tea stall by filling up his staircase with everything from boxes of tea leaves to a hot plate.“I lost my job so decided to set up my own tea stall back in July,” says Mr Kakar, flashing his dazzling smile laced with too much kindness and hospitality. This unnamed stall here on a central Delhi pavement is just across the road from Daryaganj police station and caters to a good number of surrounding shopkeepers.The stall is extraordinary to look at—just where else would you come across a chai place rustled out of a flight of steep but narrow staircase? It is so cramped that the tea man can’t even sit down. But, then, customers keep Mr Kakar busy. This evening the nearby watch repair shop needs four cups of his tea right away, please, even as a passerby asks for chai: with Mr Kakar chatting with him in perfect English.“I was working as a data entry operator in a government hospital but then the contract ended and the (coronavirus-triggered) lockdown started,” explains Mr Kakar, in his 20s. “No way I could find a new job.” He credits the idea of starting the stall to “my loving mom, Anshu Kakar.” His father, who was bedridden for 20 years, died last month.Every few minutes Mr Kakar needs to tour the lane with his thermos, personally serving piping hot chai in each of the shops he’s made arrangements with. “I’m a one-man army,” he says, laughing. But the true pleasure of his ginger-flavoured tea is secured by drinking it right in front of his stall. Every little inch of the staircase has been converted to cater to stall requirements: this extreme utilisation of all the possible free spots of space is evocative of cramped cities like Mumbai.Pursuing his grad studies through correspondence, Mr Kakar opens the shop every day around 9.30am to—“whenever I run out of milk!” He’ll then head up the stairs to the apartment shared with his mother and Madhu bua (aunt), and doggie Boxer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-best-staircase-chai/story-XYFGfY3Z3XXtnBcTjDpnaP.html
03-12-2020||Mumbai||Pratt & Whitney maintenance facility to be set up in Mumbai see slow progress due to GST issue?||Pratt & Whitney’s (P&W) first-ever engine maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) facility (in association with Air India Engineering Services Ltd) that is to be set up in Mumbai is seeing slow progress due to Goods and Service Tax (GST) issue. P&W has been seeking 5% GST on engine parts as the current tax rate of 18% is not viable for their business. However, the government has not yet officially responded to its demand. This has resulted in the MRO failing to take off, even a year after the two parties signed an agreement to establish this facility.AIESL, Air India Ltd’s engineering wing, along with aircraft engine P&W had announced their decision to work together for maintaining engines, including the problematic ones fitted on Airbus A320neos. This had come amidst glitches in P&W engines, resulting in several mid-air scares.Pratt & Whitney spokesperson did not clarify if there was a slow down due to GST related issues. “Our collaboration with Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL) remains strong, despite the challenges faced by the industry due to the pandemic and we continue to work with them to progress our MRO partnership.”Sources close to the development said the government levying 18% GST on engines has been a concern for the engine maker, due to which the process of coming up with the facility has slowed down. Another source close to the matter said, “Recently, the GST issue is being worked out but nothing has been made official yet. As of now, it is decided that every MRO work except the ones related to the engine of an aircraft will be performed by AIESL. Both the parties are however scheduled to discuss the details in a meeting this week. The signing of the contract between the two parties is expected to take place in the coming few days.”“Pratt & Whitney encouraging the establishment an aircraft engine MRO in India offers more than one benefit: it brings our engine support in closer proximity to our customers in the region, it supports the government’s vision of developing India as a major regional MRO hub, and it also makes business sense for the company to leverage India’s skills – to add to our advanced and competitive global MRO capabilities. For these reasons in 2020, we expanded our global network of MRO providers for the Pratt & Whitney GTF™ engine, to include AIESL in India,” P&W spokesperson added.Since January 2019, there have been several incidents in India involving the new Airbus A320neos fitted with P&W engines; in many of these cases, the aircraft was forced to turn around. The New Engine Option (neo) is an upgrade carried out by European aircraft maker Airbus on its aircraft such as A320, A319 and A321 from the CEO (current engine option). Neo engines are more fuel-efficient, which in turn reduces the total cost of operations.P&W powers more than 700 aircraft in service in India, including more than 150 GTF-powered A320neo family aircraft. Hyderabad is home to P&W’s state of the art customer training centre, which provides maintenance training to India’s growing aviation workforce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pratt-whitney-maintenance-facility-to-be-set-up-in-mumbai-see-slow-progress-due-to-gst-issue/story-7MoLVKMFPUN87jhuGR43oM.html
03-12-2020||Mumbai||Meadows, grassland pastures the size of Pune city to be developed across Maharashtra forests by 2024: Forest Minister||To reduce forest fragmentation, increased carnivore prey base, have an abundant food source for herbivores, provide zones for agriculture and animal husbandry, the state has decided to cultivate 8,300-hectare (ha) land as meadows and grasslands within forest areas in 2021.Over the next four years, the state plans to cover 33,200 ha (8,300 ha per year) under the Forest Meadow and Fodder Area Development Program said forest minister Sanjay Rathod on Wednesday. The area is equivalent to the size of Pune city (331.2 sq km).“This approach has different dimensions with the main idea to reduce the stress on forests. We have to consider the food chain, which is in danger due to lack of food or space for wildlife. To increase wildlife numbers, we want to ensure there is enough fodder availability for herbivores, and in turn, build good prey availability for carnivores. At the same time we have to ensure herbivores do not stray outside forests in search of food,” said Rathod, adding that for the first time in the state, such a massive forest meadow and fodder area development program was being done.Grassland patches in Maharashtra are found across Marathwada, Vidarbha, Solapur, Satara and other isolated patches along the Western Ghats. According to the Forest Survey of India, permanent pastures, grazing lands, and fallow land account for just 8% of the state’s geographical area. However, there is no estimation or study on how much of this falls within forest areas.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on August 7 during the 15th meeting of the State Board of Wildlife (SBWL) had instructed the implementation of the scheme to increase wildlife in Maharashtra.According to a survey conducted by the Department of Land Resources under the Ministry of Rural Development with the help from the National Sensitivity System, Maharashtra has a total geographical area of 3.07 lakh square kilometres, of which 61,579 sq. km is recorded forest area while 53,484 sq. km is fallow land (17%). “The Maharashtra government has reserved 2,000 sq. km or 2 lakh ha for meadow and fodder grazing area development in the state over the next 10 years,” said Rathod further explaining that the scheme would benefit large areas of the state that are drought-prone and aid animal husbandry through the availability of fodder for livestock and overall livelihood of tribal farmers. “Due to intense cattle grazing in forest and non-forest areas, some zones have become barren and unproductive. Grasslands will not only be useful for cattle and herbivores but also water and soil conservation. It will provide further protection to large biodiversity within and outside forest areas,” said Rathod.While Rs. 50 crore has been earmarked for 2021 under the program by the Maharashtra wing of the Centre’s Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), ₹200 crore has been allocated for the next four years (Rs.50 crore per year).Shailesh Tembhurnikar, chief executive officer, Maharashtra CAMPA, said part of the 2021 fund had already been disbursed and nurseries for grass seed collection would start from December. The scheme implementation would commence from February 2021. “We will be tackling this in phases. The first phase will be across at Yavatmal, Buldhana, Wardha, and Aurangabad followed by other zones in subsequent phases. With the availability of these grasses, there will be a fillip for dairy development across villages. This pattern will be followed after four years to reach the 2,000 sq km mark,” he said.Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), said “Areas where villages have been rehabilitated from within forest areas and tiger reserves need to be converted into meadows. This will increase herbivore population for prey base and curtail animal movement to farmlands by minimizing forest fragmentation. These grasslands are also important habitats for migratory and resident birds.”Independent experts said grasslands or pastures were important ecosystems of Maharashtra. “They used to be an important source of fodder grasses. Our study has shown that over the years due to constant burning and overgrazing, palatable species are replaced by unpalatable grasses leading to a decline in their fodder potential. Community protections by some groups like Vasudha and Samvedana helped establish good fodder grass in the Khandesh and Vidarbha regions,” said Dr Mandar Datar, scientist, Agharkar Research Institute, Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/meadows-grassland-pastures-the-size-of-pune-city-to-be-developed-across-maharashtra-forests-by-2024-forest-minister/story-fWQZJMeLzqKxk85nI2NEJL.html
03-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s public bike-sharing now popular, 9,772 trips made in November||The newly-introduced electric bike sharing scheme in Bandra Kurla complex (BKC) is gaining popularity, said the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is gaining momentum. According to data shared by MMRDA, 2,967 new users registered for Yulu Bikes’ service in November. The electric bikes were launched on August 31 to facilitate last-mile connectivity between office complexes and the suburban train stations in Bandra and Kurla. As per data shared on Tuesday, 9,772 trips were registered in November, covering a total distance of more than 66,000 kms. MMRDA said, “We’re delighted to announce that since the @YuluBike services were launched in BKC, we have added 7000+ new users, 27000+ trips, 1.62 lakh+ kms & have saved 16+ tonnes of carbon emissions! (sic).” MMRDA expects numbers to rise steadily as more businesses open in BKC in the coming months. Officials said they predicted a spike in numbers once the suburban railway network resumes services for everyone. At present, the rail network is only partially open and footfall is still low in BKC, compared to pre-lockdown times. On August 31, MMRDA had launched the public electric bike-sharing facility in BKC. Currently, there are around 18 zones of docks in and around BKC from where commuters can access the bikes. While Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had inaugurated the bikes in January, the launch was postponed owing to lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-public-bike-sharing-now-popular-9-772-trips-made-in-november/story-p97yL0g1XUowmx7ysBvtxN.html

03-12-2020||Mumbai||Organisations from Maharashtra to launch state-wide protest in support of farmers on Wednesday||Jan Andolananchi Sangharsha Samiti (JASS) is set to demonstrate and participate in the state-wide farmers’ protests to be held at different timings throughout the state on Thursday. In Mumbai, the protest will be held at Bharat Mata Cinema at 12 noon. However, leaders of the Samiti said this will not affect the functioning of banks, industries, and any services that employ labour class, and no traffic blockades will take place, and no urban routine life will be disrupted for any citizens. The Congress, too, will stage state-wide protest to support farmers’ agitation. The demonstrations organised by JASS, where 48 mass organisations of labourers, social activists, bank employees, trade union organisations, and farmers’ organisations have come together to extend support to farmers, will be held as token protests. All employees, such as bank employees and essential service workers, will report to work wearing badges in support of the farmers’ cause. A day-long fast has also been planned as part of the protest, and any member wishing to participate can fast at their own convenience. Vishwas Utagi, convener of JASS, said, “It is not a bandh or a state-wide strike. We have the support of many intellectuals, journalists, writers, and members of political parties who will participate in the protest. It will be held across all 400 tehsils, and 36 districts of Maharashtra at different timings throughout Thursday.” The group has formed a Trade Unions Joint Action Committee to coordinate the protests. This committee consists of Maharashtra units of INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AICCTU, AIUTUC and Bharatiya Kamgar Sena MahaSangh, NTUI, TUCI, state government employees’ union, Shramik Ekta Mahasangh (Pune). Meanwhile, state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat on Wednesday announced that the party will hold a state-wide agitation on Thursday to support to the cause of the farmers protesting in Delhi. In a press statement on Wednesday, the Congress said, “The Congress has opposed the anti-farmer laws of the BJP government from the very beginning. The Maharashtra pradesh Congress has been protesting for the past two months with various agitations demanding repeal of these black laws. A large number of people will also participate in tomorrow’s agitation and express their opposition.” “The demands of the farmers are right and we stand firmly behind them,” Thorat said.Utagi said agriculture is a state subject, and the group is urging the Maharashtra government to introduce a bill to safeguard the interests of farmers in the state in the next Assembly session. “The Centre cannot encroach on state subjects, so we are fighting for preserving the state’s autonomy as well,” Utagi said. He added, “The NCP, Congress, and Sena have supported the cause of farmers earlier as well, and have assured us support this time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/organisations-from-maharashtra-to-launch-state-wide-protest-in-support-of-farmers-on-wednesday/story-AsXrKsdE22s4x86SCtXOCI.html
03-12-2020||City||Displaced by calamity 15 years ago, Kupwara’s fringe villagers face eviction from temporary settlements||After dozens of houses in Rangwar, a fringe hamlet of the district, got razed to the ground in the 2005 earthquake, the villagers were forced to descend nearly three kilometres to the Chowkibal-Tangdhar main road to find shelter.Though a harsh winter was upon them, they could only manage to get settled in tin and wood sheds on a vacant plot near the road.Fifteen years down the line, these displaced villagers have received eviction notices from the J&K forest department and threats of forcible demolition of their temporary settlements set up along the banks of Drangyari stream, which they have also named Rangwar.The original Rangwar village, which is surrounded by snow-capped mountains and dense forests, has remained a frequent witness to natural disasters and the ensuing destruction. Its natives say that the village had been declared dangerous by the geology and mining department after they had conducted a survey there.As per their accounts, floods that had struck the hamlet in August 1992 washed away many houses. This was followed by a landslide in March 1995 which damaged over a dozen houses and another flood that caused similar havoc. However, they say, the 2005 earthquake brought ultimate devastation compelling them to vacate their village entirely.Officials had then directed them to settle on a vacant plot close to the forests, the villagers said. “Rangwar was always at risk due to landslides and floods and when we had to leave it after the earthquake in 2005, the officials asked us to construct temporary sheds till they could rehabilitate us properly,” said Afsar Khan, a member of the Halqa panchayat.“The floods in the Khemil stream washed away almost all the plain land of the village and the land that was meant for us was taken over by the army. The government should either give us substitute land or shift the army camp from the place which was actually meant for us. Till then, we won’t vacate the temporary settlements,” a villager said.After witnessing the eviction of tribal people from forest areas in various parts of J&K as the Roshni Act was scrapped, Rangwar natives are more worried.Holding the eviction notice in his hands, Imran Ahmad, who was six years old when his family settled here, said the officials threatened to bulldoze their temporary houses. “Where will we go in this cold winter? We will die here but won’t allow anybody to touch our shelters. We are poor; our only source of income is working with the army as porters and taking their items to the LoC or in the fields of local villagers. This is great injustice,” he lamented.“Two years ago, my husband died and now I am living alone here. Where will I go if they (officials) will dismantle my shelter,” asked Saleema Begum.Villager Alam Khan said even this place is not safe for them as it becomes a frequent target during India-Pakistan shelling along the LoC. “In August, three persons sustained injuries when shells fired from across the LoC landed close to houses. We will move if alternative land is given to us.”Divisional forest officer (Khemil) Mohammad Ayub confirmed that notices were served to the people who have set up shelters on the forest land. “They (villagers) have occupied two hectares of forest land. Notices have been served to them and the department is waiting for orders from higher authorities. The area is already under snow.”When asked if similar notices were issued to the army for occupying five to six hectares of forest land a few hundred metres away, the officer said the department hadn’t done so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/displaced-by-calamity-15-years-ago-kupwara-s-fringe-villagers-face-eviction-from-temporary-settlements/story-8Cmq4xbxdIwe3Gte4gFjYN.html

Shubham, who is facing several criminal cases, including one of killing a Hindu Sangharsh Sena leader in Amritsar, had even got a video of the recce in his mobile phone in the jail through his henchman Rishu, alias Gift, the police said. Rishu was arrested on Wednesday on the instance of Shubham was brought to Amritsar on production warrant a couple of days back. Munish (28), a resident of Gopal Nagar locality in the city, was shot dead by two bike-borne assailants in broad daylight on November 27. They pumped seven bullets in the body of Munish, who worked in a scooter repair shop. He was the brother of Sunny, alias Gorilla, a jailed gangster who is also facing several criminal cases. The police claim to have identified the two assailants as Jaswinder Singh, alias Jassi and Ranjit Singh, alias Prince, who are absconding.Gorilla is a close associate of Shubham’s old rival and notorious gangster Simran Singh. Simran is accused of killing Shubham’s father Baljinder Singh, alias Kalu, a Punjab Police constable, in 2017. Also, Shubam is accused of killing Simran’s father Hardev Singh, who ran a dhabha in Amritsar, in 2016. Addressing a press conference, assistant commissioner of police (ACP-detective) Harminder Singh said, “During his questioning, Shubham told us that Munish’s brother Sunny Gorilla along with some others had killed his father. He used a foreign-based number to call his henchmen from the jail to get the killing done. Shubham asked Rishu to conduct a recce of the spot before committing the crime. Rishu even sent a video of the recce on Shubham’s mobile.” Shubham further sent the clip to his aides Jassi and Prince to commit the crime, the ACP said. “We have also seized Rishu’s mobile which was used for making the video. Shubham also called his other accomplice Gurbhej Singh, alias Bheja of Tarn Taran to provide firearms to Jassi and Prince. We have found that it was Rishu and Bheja who made a Facebook page in the name of Shubham to spread fear,” he added.

These and residents of Sherpur, Longowal, Kheri, Namol and other villages are also participating in farmers’ protests under the banners of Zameen Prapti Sangharsh Committee (ZPSC) and Krantikari Pendu Mazdoor Union (KPMU). The leaders and cadre of these left-leaning dalit-labour unions joined the protest with red flags, raising slogans of farmers-labourers’ unity. Around 50 members of ZPSC had started for Delhi on Tuesday night, and over 100 members of KPMU have already joined the protests. Farmers and dalits, however, have been known to clash over the issue of 33% share of dalits in common reserved panchayat land in villages of Sangrur district over the past five years. “The three farm laws will not just ruin the farming community; these will snatch bread from the hands of the labourers as well. The concept of contract farming is anti-farmer and anti-labour class. Agriculture is the base of Punjab’s economy and the black laws will not spare dalits,” Lakhvir Longowal, state general secretary, KPMU, told HT over phone. State chief of ZPSC Mukesh Malaudh said, “The fight is against fascism. It is the need of the hour that farmers, labourers and minorities along with other marginalised sections should join hands to defeat a fascist government that the BJP is leading.” He added, “The new agriculture laws will affect people from all walks of life. We support farmers’ agitation and will oppose these laws.” SANGRUR SAD WORKERS MARCH TO DELHIOver 500 workers of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) started for the Tikri border to extend support to farmers via Khanauri border of Sangrur on Wednesday. “We are going to join the protests as farmers, not as party workers. A batch of around 500 people from Dirba, Sunam, Dhuri, Malerkotla and other parts of the district marched in 100 vehicles,” said Winnerjit Singh Khadial, SAD spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dalit-labour-unions-joining-farmers-stir-on-delhi-border/story-NFOWNFyve87MfLMDp7jg6K.html
03-12-2020||Mumbai||Mini Assembly polls in Maharashtra may see mega drama in MVA parties||As the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of the Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) completed a year in office last week, the focus of all prominent political parties in the state is now on the elections to 15 civic bodies and 27 zilla parishads scheduled in 2022. Touted as mini Assembly elections in political circles as they would be held across the state, the polls will be seen as people’s response to the performance of the MVA government. However, the ruling partners of the MVA don’t seem to be on the same page about these elections. Twenty-seven zilla parishad or district councils (out of 34), which govern the rural parts of any district, are scheduled to face polls in 2022, while 15 of the 27 municipal corporations will have elections in the next two years. Many of these local bodies are currently ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was in power from 2014 to 2019. When the MVA was formed to claim the power in the state last year, it was unanimously decided to fight all legislative Council and local body elections together. In line with it, Shiv Sena chief and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in his recent interview said all MVA partners will contest all local body elections, including to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), together as an alliance. “Three parties have come together as the MVA to form the government. Let anybody say anything, we will fight all local body elections, including BMC, together,” Thackeray had said. However, recently, leaders from the Mumbai Congress, during their meeting with HK Patil, party in-charge for Maharashtra, said the party should fight the BMC elections separately to keep its voter base strong in the city, where it was born 135 years ago. The leaders said that it will be further decimated if workers do not get sufficient seats to contest. The 2017 BMC elections had witnessed a lot of drama, as the Sena and BJP had contested the polls separately, snapping 25-year-old ties and despite being in power in the state government. The Sena and BJP launched sharp personal attacks on each other and ended up winning 84 and 82 seats, respectively. The Sena currently has 97 seats, BJP 83, Congress 29, NCP 8, Samajwadi Party 6, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen 2 and MNS 1. The Sena had poached a few corporators from other parties including MNS to widen the gap after the results. Leaders from the ruling parties feel for a few local bodies like Mumbai, sharing the traditional vote banks could be a major hurdle in fighting the polls together. “With 96 corporators in its fold, the Shiv Sena would want to fight at least 130 seats, while the NCP would vie for at least 30 seats, leaving us with hardly 65 seats. It will be too little for us, as our seat tally was 52 in the 2012 elections, although we did poorly in the last election. Secondly, there is always a fear of losing Muslim and north Indian votes if we forge an alliance with the Sena in Mumbai,” said a Congress leader from its Mumbai unit. Eknath Gaikwad, Mumbai Congress chief, said “These are the things to be decided during the elections, but we have been preparing ourselves for both the possibilities. We are ready to fight in all wards, if need be. There would be no issue with an alliance if we get respectful treatment and the seats we want. After all, every party has right to spread its wings, and we are not exception. I feel that the three ruling parties should stand united during the BMC elections.” An NCP leader said, “Seat-sharing would not be a problem for three parties if all of us amicably decide to come together to keep the BJP out of power. The Congress and NCP can fight 75 and 20 seats and go for a better strike rate.” With a population of 13 million, Mumbai accounts for roughly one-third Marathi speaking voters, 30% north Indians and Muslim voters and 15% Gujaratis and Marwaris. The BMC is one of the richest civic bodies, with an annual budget of ₹33,441 crore for the current financial year. Power in BMC is crucial for the Shiv Sena, while the BJP is determined to wrest power from its former ally. North Indian Hindu voters are believed to be inclined towards the BJP, while the Sena banks on Marathi voters. The Congress counts Muslim and Dalit among its traditional voters. Pratap Asbe, political analyst, said a strong fight by the three-party alliance will help polarise anti-BJP voters. “The Congress and NCP will have to compromise on seat-sharing in BMC elections in larger interest of the alliance. Only elections cannot be the platform to widen the party base if the party has not put in any efforts throughout five years. The Congress should understand this, at least from the lesson given by the Bihar polls. It would be wrong to say that Muslim voters will move away from the Congress because of joining hands with communal Sena, it is not true. In fact, Muslims may stand by MVA to keep the BJP out of power,” he said. There is a buzz that the BJP will forge an alliance with Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) for the civic polls in Mumbai. However, the BJP leaders say their party would benefit more if the MNS fights independently, as it will damage the Shiv Sena. Atul Bhatkhalkar, BJP legislator and party’s poll in-charge for BMC elections, said his party was all set to take on the alliance. “Three parties have come together because they have accepted defeat. The alliance will face anti-incumbency, for the Sena’s corrupt rule of more than two decades and also for the MVA’s failed rule in the state. Against it, Mumbai has witnessed how many of its infrastructure projects, including Metro, MTHL, coastal road, sewerage projects, BDD chawl development, got a push during the Devendra Fadnavis government. We are not allying with the MNS, as we are confident about winning more than 115 seats in the Mumbai civic body. We are not bothered about religious or caste equations in the city, as we firmly believe in development plank,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mini-assembly-polls-in-maharashtra-may-see-mega-drama-in-mva-parties/story-feGKvNUd560Qb2GucFQiLJ.html

03-12-2020||Mumbai||Ripping off minor’s clothes in rage without sexual intent does not fall under Pocso Act: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) last week observed that the charge of sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012 is not attracted unless it is shown that the act was committed with sexual intent and granted anticipatory bail to a Pune resident, accused of tearing off clothes of a minor and touching her inappropriately while physically assaulting her.Justice Bharati Dangre granted pre-arrest bail to Omkar Gaikwad primarily on the grounds that nothing in the first information report (FIR), registered with Chaturshringi police station at Pune on October 20, indicated that the accused had committed the acts with sexual intent.The complainant, a 20-year-old woman, alleged that her family had a dispute with Gaikwad over leave and license agreement with respect to a shop and had exchanged legal notices over the same. In this backdrop, the complainant alleged that Gaikwad barged in their house along with his wife and two others on October 19, and started assaulting her parents. Later, she alleged, Gaikwad also assaulted her and her younger sister, a 17-year-old. She further alleged that during the assault, the accused ripped off her and her minor sister’s clothes and touched them inappropriately.In view of these allegations, police had applied section 7 of Pocso Act under which a person is booked for committing sexual assault with sexual intent and touching private parts of a child or making the child touch the private part of such person.With regards to the charge under the section, justice Dangre said so far as the complainant’s younger sister was concerned, Gaikwad was accused of assaulting her during which he touched her chest and private part and made her fell on the ground.“Prima facie, the offence under section 7 and the punishment under Section 8 of the Pocso Act would not be attracted unless and until sexual intent is specifically proven,” said the judge. “This is a matter of trial, since FIR does not make out any sexual intent,” she added. The court granted anticipatory bail to the Pune resident, observing that “prima facie, in absence of the sexual intent being exhibited by the applicant and in the backdrop of the agreement, which possibly is a point of discord between the parties, the applicant is entitled for protection in anticipation of his arrest.”In case of arrest, he has been ordered to be released on furnishing personal bond in the sum of ₹25,000 and one or two sureties in the same amount.Noted lawyer Abha Singh said the HC rightly granted pre-arrest bail to accused. She asserted that there was a dispute with regards the shop which was the bone of contention and the assault was a result of the dispute. In a fit of rage the accused might have pushed, pulled or assaulted the minor. This does not appear to be sexual assault as the acts are not committed with sexual intent. This can at the most be “affray” as contemplated under the Indian Penal Code, but certainly not a sexual assault, she said adding that “sexual intent” is a specific requirement of section 7 of Pocso Act, and in such cases, police have to be extra cautious.Agreeing with the view, advocate Wahab Khan said that in cases like this, intention plays a crucial part. “There have been cases where Pocso Act is misused whereby false cases are registered to settle in other disputes. Pocso Act is majorly misused in matrimonial disputes. In such circumstances, the court is required to see if there was an intention to sexually abuse the girl or an incident happened because of an accident,” he added.Intention to sexually abuse minor is an important ingredient of the offence in question, said advocate Prakash Salsingekar who has handled several cases under Pocso Act.“For instance, if a man and a minor are walking along and he touches the minor, every such touch will not be punishable under section 7. It will be a punishable offence only when the touch or the act is done with sexual intent,” said Salsingekar. “If the man accidentally touches the minor because of rush or inadequate space etc., it would not be considered as an offense,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ripping-off-minor-s-clothes-in-rage-without-sexual-intent-does-not-fall-under-pocso-act-bombay-hc/story-oyoP2EFvwwONQWaeb62JjJ.html

Everyone, however, was awarded extra time to finish the paper.An official from the varsity’s LLM department told HT that all applicants were informed about the glitches on time. “Intimation was given to students that in case if students logging in late due to technical error or electricity problem then they will be awarded extra time.

03-12-2020||City||Himachal: Dissension in BJP’s Bhoranj unit irks party leadership||Dissensions have surfaced in the Bhoranj unit of BJP and the party leadership, which is aimed at forming the government again in 2022, is rather displeased about it.During the fourth death anniversary of former BJP minister ID Dhiman at his Diyalri residence in Bhoranj two days ago, his son Anil Dhiman signalled to his father’s friends and followers that he was intending to contest the next elections from Bhoranj. While hundreds of party members and even Congress leaders were present on the occasion, BJP’s Bhoranj MLA Kamlesh Kumari was not invited.This has irked the party’s top leaders who have decided to hold meetings with the party cadre of the constituency seeking reconciliation among them.The BJP has been winning the Bhoranj seat, earlier known as Mewa (reserve) seat, outclassing the Congress every time.However, the signal of revolt by former MLA Anil Dhiman has revealed that all is not well in BJP’s Bhoranj unit.Anil Dhiman had won the by-election after the death of his father by a margin of 8,290 votes. He had defeated Promila Devi of Congress. However, he was denied the party ticket in the general elections and Kamlesh Kumari was elected. She had won the election defeating Suresh Kumar of Congress by more than 6,900 votes.Sources in the BJP say that the confidants of Dhiman family and senior BJP workers are unhappy with the party leadership for ignoring their leader, Anil Dhiman. There are also indications that a powerful Congress lobby is trying to bring Dhiman into its fold and field him from the Bhoranj seat in the 2022 elections.Infighting flares up in Cong over PRI polls Supporters of senior Congress leaders Suresh Kumar and Prem Kaushal of Bhoranj assembly segment virtually came to blows when Kaushal was delivering a speech during the party meeting in Hamirpur on Wednesday. Kaushal said that wrong allotment of tickets was the main reason for the party’s defeat in all elections including the last Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) elections. This infuriated his old rival Suresh Kumar and both exchanged words while their supporters too entered the arena. However, Inder Dutt Lakhanpal, MLA from Badsar assembly constituency, intervened and prevented the groups from fighting. He told them to behave in a decent manner and not make a mockery of the party discipline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dissension-in-bjp-s-bhoranj-unit-irks-party-leadership/story-2lV0ShPcDUleCYrogpr5OP.html
03-12-2020||Mumbai||Firm moves Bombay HC seeking ₹10,000-crore in damages from Maharashtra govt for cancelling Dharavi revamp project tender||Seclink Technology Corporation (STC), a United Arab Emirated-based firm and the highest bidder for the ₹28,500-crore Dharavi redevelopment project whose tender was scrapped recently, has filed a suit in the Bombay high court (HC) seeking damages of ₹10,000 crore from the Maharashtra government for its decision to cancel the tender. STC has also moved the International Court of Arbitration at Geneva on the same grounds. STC contended that it was forced to approach the HC and the Arbitration Court due to the injustice meted on it. “We were the highest bidders when the tender was opened in 2019 and should have been rightfully awarded the contract. We had kept aside ₹28,572 crore in our escrow account which has been lying in there from the two years. We could have deployed this fund elsewhere,” said a spokesperson of the STC who did not want to be named. “We were denied the opportunity on flimsy grounds for which we have sought the compensation,” he added. Another reason for this move was the new tender which tailor-made to deprive them of the project, he alleged. “The upcoming tender is being manipulated to ensure that the favoured company gets the project,” he said.In February 2019, STC emerged as the highest bidder to transform India’s largest slum pocket outbidding Adani Infrastructure and Developers Private Limited. STC had quoted ₹7,200 crore while its competitor Adani Infrastructure and Developers Pvt Ltd had bid at ₹4,539 crore. STC’s problem began when the then Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government decided to use railway land near Dharavi for rehabilitation of slum-dwellers and to acquire it by paying ₹800 crore to the railways. The State government sought the AG’s views as the railway land was an added component to the project and as such it changed the project specifications. AG Ashutosh Kumbhakoni advised that fresh tenders needed to be called for, as the costs of the railway land and rehabilitation was added later and not incorporated in the original tender document. However, the government changed by then. The AG’s opinion was accepted by the Uddhav Thackeray-led government which cancelled the tender and is in the process of issuing fresh one.STC has assailed the state for cancelling the project on the railway land issue. “We had agreed to pay the state three times the amount — ₹2,400 crore — for this railway land, but our pleas fell on deaf ears as they wanted to snatch the project from us,” said the spokesperson. State housing minister Jitendra Awhad said he was unaware of any case being filed in the Dharavi issue. “I am unaware of any such suit being filed by Seclink. I will get the details from our officials,” said Awhad.The development has added another chapter to Dharavi makeover project which is stuck for almost two decades now. Pankaj Kapoor, managing director of Liases Foras, a real estate research firm, said the whole project is flawed and unlikely to succeed. “Dharavi is a mini-township with a bustling cottage industry. Majority of the Dharavi residents work in this place itself and this aspect is being ignored. The whole focus is on constructing a concrete township instead of ensuring their livelihood,” said Kapoor. The Dharavi revamp project commenced on February 4, 2004, but has been marred with controversies with one of the key issues being the eligibility for the redeveloped flats, as it was found that majority of the present residents did not qualify for new houses. The constant flip-flops by the successive governments have only caused large scale hardships to the local population. The state intends to revamp 601 acres of Dharavi and plans to rehouse 59,165 residents in plush new houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/firm-moves-bombay-hc-seeking-10-000-crore-in-damages-from-maharashtra-govt-for-cancelling-dharavi-revamp-project-tender/story-Of3m7ZFIYnyy0Fs1aSQvIO.html

With a 25% reduction in syllabus across classes, schools said they are unsure about the paper pattern. “This year, learning is online and children are under tremendous pressure due to Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown. Class 10 and 12 board exams are really important as marks determine the future of these children. We are hoping the board simplifies the paper pattern this time,” said a principal of a suburban school. A senior official from the state board said the paper pattern is unlikely to be changed. “The syllabus and paper pattern for Class 10 and 12 have undergone changes in the recent years, and it is not expected to change this year,” said the official. Parents said they want the department to, at the very minimum, release a tentative exam schedule and a blueprint of the question papers to help students. “We understand that planning anything in the current situation is tricky, but students are really worried because there is a lot of uncertainty. We just hope that whatever the department plans is announced well in advance,” said Sandhya Ranade, a city-based parent. In early November, Gaikwad had said that exams for SSC and HSC are unlikely before May due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation conditions in Maharashtra. However, the department and the state board are yet make the announcement official..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-need-clarity-on-ssc-hsc-exam-dates-test-pattern-says-parents/story-e3JlURo3WwF2xsCifh9orO.html

03-12-2020||Mumbai||MSC Bank fraud: ED neither complainant nor a victim, can’t be heard on closure report, says court||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is neither the complainant nor a victim, the special anti-corruption bureau (ACB) court has said, while rejecting a plea of the agency seeking permission to intervene and oppose the Mumbai Police’s report seeking to close the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank fraud case.“One investigation agency being not happy with the work of other investigation agency and therefore wants to intervene, this itself is foreign to criminal law,” observed the special court.The economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police has, in September, filed a closure report in the alleged ₹25,000-crore fraud at MSC Bank. EOW filed a C-summary report before the special anti-corruption bureau (ACB) court after its special investigation team (SIT) found no criminal aspects to be investigated in the case.ED, which started investigation into money laundering aspects of the purported fraud, had approached the special court seeking permission to intervene and oppose the closure report. The agency claimed that as the high court (HC) has directed to register an FIR, no contrary report can be filed by the agency.The plea was rejected by the special court on November 26. However, the detailed order was released on Tuesday.The special court held, “It was not expected that the investigation to get influenced by the findings given by the Hon’ble High Court and [Mumbai Police] was expected to carry out investigation in fair manner in accordance with the law. Accordingly, it was open for the investigation officer to submit report under section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC); same can be a charge sheet or can be closure report in the form of summaries (sic).”“It is only the person lodging the complaint, or injured or aggrieved person who is entitled for hearing in the proceeding for dropping of a case. The intervener (ED) does not fall in any of the above categories,” said the court.The complaint pertained to thousands of crores obtained in loans by sugar cooperatives, spinning mills and other processing units from district and cooperative banks.MSC Bank, the apex bank that controlled credit to the co-operative sector in the state, was handled by then ruling politicians. It landed in trouble in 2011 after an inquiry report by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) found the bank was in red with a negative of ₹144 crore. The report indicted the board of directors of the bank for financial mismanagement that led to ballooning of non-performing assets. This was largely due to handing out of loans to sugar co-operatives and spinning mills in violation of all norms.The Mumbai Police in its closure report, however, justified the actions and claimed no case was made out. ED, then, questioned the probe.In its plea, ED had claimed that during their investigation they referred to reports of NABARD available since 2000-01. “On perusal of the said reports, it is found that NABARD has pointed out various irregularities in its every inspection report from the period 2000-01 onwards. The said irregularities pertain to working of the Board of Directors (BoD) of the bank, size of the various committees of the bank, documentation and proposing of loan proposal, sanctioning of the loan proposals, non-compliance of various RBI circulars and directions from NABARD, etc,” ED claimed.The central agency has further claimed, “During the course of investigation, it was found that loans were given to the sugar mills/companies controlled by relatives of the directors of the bank without assessing loan repayment capacity of the sugar mills/companies.”The agency also alleged that the bank did not follow the process stated under the SARFAESI Act, 2002 while auctioning defaulting Sugar Sahkari Kharkhana (SSK).“It is also found that though the reserve price was decided based on the valuation of the valuers, the same was not disclosed in the advertisement as well as in the tender form of the above said 5 SSKs. Therefore, the offer amounts were received well below the reserve price and the SSKs were sold below the reserve price,” the agency claimed.ED further alleged that, “Some SSKs were indirectly sold to the then director/office-bearers of the bank and the financial investigation in this regard raises suspicion about transparency in the auction proceedings conducted for sale of the said SSKs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/msc-bank-fraud-ed-neither-complainant-nor-a-victim-can-t-be-heard-on-closure-report-says-court/story-eP9pyEahunRyf09JBtTbfP.html
03-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Stir on Western Railway to get pre-Covid timetable on track||After passengers’ agitation on the tracks on Wednesday morning, the Western Railway (WR) has decided to revoke the plan to go back to the pre-Covid timetable from December 3 and will continue with the schedule for Dahanu-Churchgate services which was introduced after the curbs were lifted. In the pre-Covid schedule, the first train from Dahanu starts at 5.40am and reaches Churchgate at 7.34am. The schedule introduced as part of the unlocking slotted the first train at 4.40am from Dahanu, which would reach Churchgate at 7.04am. Miffed with the change as it would lead to crowding on platform, passengers, mainly essential services workers, staged a rail roko at Palghar, Kelwe Road and Saphale railway stations at 5.30am, disrupting local as well as outstation train services. The services were resumed only at 6.58am, after the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and WR staff convinced the protesters that their demand would be looked into. “The notification of restoration of Dahanu Road suburban services as per suburban working timetable has been cancelled. Therefore, the local train services scheduled to depart from Dahanu Road at 4.40am to Churchgate for essential staff and permitted categories will continue to run,” said Sumit Thankur, chief public relation officer, Western Railway. Currently, the trains carry only essential service employees such as civic nurses, technicians, ward boys, medicos, pharmacists, besides employees of Mazgaon Dock, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Mantralaya, police and other services. Sarita Sankhe, a resident of Boisar and a staff nurse at Shatabdi Hospital, Kandivli, said, “Earlier I used to reach my workplace around 6.30am and relieve the night duty staff. If the timing changes, the night duty staff will have to stay put for at least 30 more minutes. Also, earlier, there was no bio-metric attendance system at my workplace, but from mid-December, it will resume and I will be marked as latecomer.” “We have registered a first information report (FIR) against unidentified protesters under sections 142, 143, 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code, Disaster Management Act, 2005 and State Covid-19 Regulation Act, 2020 and also section 174 (obstructing running of train) of the Railways Act, 1989. We are going through the video clips of the accused who were protesting at the railway station and we will arrest them,” said sub-inspector Vishwasrao Mudavatkar of Palghar government railway police (GRP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-stir-on-western-railway-to-get-pre-covid-timetable-on-track/story-keL98ldi78gyWmBuzovkJL.html

The Sena leader first underwent angioplasty in November 2019, when the state was witnessing the height of the political drama following the Assembly elections. According to people close to the Rajya Sabha MP, he was supposed to undergo another angiography in April-May but decided against it due to the pandemic situation.

However, the authorities did not pay heed and no response was provided, due to which the NCBC is taking a strict action,” said complainant Ajay Prajapati, coordinator of Bhartiya Prajapati Heroes Organisation, Chandigarh.In response to a letter by this organisation, requesting GMCH-32 authorities to include reservation for OBC candidates on the pattern for SC/ST candidates, a response was received from the registrar stating that the request had been looked into, but not acceded to without specifying any reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-only-medical-college-put-on-notice-for-not-granting-obc-reservation-in-professional-courses/story-bMsTw1uqH9ndL4gNcwHQfJ.html
03-12-2020||City||BJP, Cong spar over no winter assembly session||A war of words has erupted between the opposition Congress and ruling BJP over the Himachal cabinet’s decision to cancel the winter session of the state assembly.The cabinet in its meeting held on Tuesday had recommended against convening the winter session in the wake of recent spurt in Covid-19 cases in the state.While Congress accused the government of running away from discussions on important issues, the BJP defended the move.Hitting out at the Jai Ram Thakur-led administration, Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore said the state government takes a decision in the morning and changes it by the evening amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“It reflects the state government’s incompetence. It has completely failed to deal with the crisis,” he said.He said Covid-related deaths were on a constant rise in the state while health services were in bad shape. There is complete chaos at the hospitals and people are scared of visiting the health institutions, said Rathore.“The government has run away from facing the opposition’s questions by cancelling the winter session of the assembly as we were seeking answers for the mismanagement in dealing with the Covid situation,” he added.Meanwhile, BJP chief spokesperson Randhi Sharma hit back accusing the opposition party of playing politics during the pandemic. Sharma said that due to the rising virus cases, the government has imposed many restrictions in the state. Night curfew has been implemented in four districts and only 50 people are allowed in social gatherings.“All these steps were taken to curb the virus spread. In such a situation it was not appropriate to hold the winter session of the assembly and so it was deferred. BJP supports this decision,” he said.Former chief minister and senior BJP leader PK Dhumal also hailed the government’s call terming it timely and in the larger interest of the people. He argued that saving the lives of citizens was more important than holding the session and all the parties should show cooperation. Dhumal also appealed to the people to abide by the government’s instructions on Covid safety.Cancelling session to do no good: CPI (M)Meanwhile, lone CPI (M) legislator Rakesh Singha has shot off a letter to the chief minister expressing displeasure over the government’s decision to cancel the session and asked to reconsider the move.Singha said he was surprised that the government suddenly called a cabinet meeting and decided to cancel the session. “However, the government seems to be losing the battle against Covid-19 and has left the people to their fate,” he alleged.The Theog legislator said the decision to cancel the session was beyond comprehension and would to do no good as virus cases were likely to surge in the coming months.‘Conduct assembly meets online’Social media chairman of Himachal Congress, Abhishek Rana, on Wednesday suggested holding of the winter session online rather than in the Vidhan Sabha complex to avoid the risk of virus spread among the legislators and other attendees. Rana clarified that in the era of technology when educational institutions and even the Supreme Court were conducting their work online through video conferencing, there should be no hitch in holding the state assembly session in a similar manner.Forest minister flays CLP leader’s ‘political rant’As the exchange of words continued over the winter session issue, forest minister Rakesh Pathania flayed Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader Mukesh Agnihotri stating that though the government recognized him as the leader of opposition, it seemed that his own party MLAs didn’t consider him their leader. “If the government takes a decision and later changes it keeping in mind the public interest, no one should play cheap politics over it,” said Pathania.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-cong-spar-over-no-winter-assembly-session/story-8u44AxvFFR8kwwmJQapAcK.html

The police have arrested former Malluwal Baniya village (Zira, Ferozepur) sarpanch Rachpal Singh, while three other co-conspirators — Harjinderpal Kumar of Manakwal village, Ludhiana; Lal Singh of Amargarh Badiyan village, Zira and Sukhdev Singh alias Sukha of Jhotian Wali village, Fazikla, are on the run. All the accused are already facing trial in several criminal cases, including murder and kidnapping.On Tuesday, the toddler’s father, Pankaj Gupta, a hotelier and realtor, informed the police that their driver, Harjinderpal, had taken his son for a spin in their Maruti Suzuki Swift car but had not returned. Later, the kidnappers demanded ₹4 crore for their son’s release, said commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal. Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta sounded an alert in all districts of the state and pressed around 2,000 police personnel to trace the child. “We were keeping tabs on the location of the driver Harjinderpal who had switched off his phone in Moga. We dispatched several police teams to Moga and conducted multiple raids with help of the local police. Meanwhile, Gupta’s Maruti Swift car was found abandoned in Ludhiana,” Agrawal said. After the police launched an intensive search, the kidnappers abandoned the boy in a Volkswagen Polo near Dagru Railway crossing. “Around 8am, the kidnappers called Mukta Gupta, the boy’s mother, and informed her of the child’s whereabouts. We recovered the child safely with the help of the Moga police,”said Agrawal.A case was registered under Sections 364A (kidnapping for ransom), 369 (abducting a child under ten years), 342 (wrongful confinement), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 381 (theft from employer) of the Indian Penal Code at the Dugri Police station.“We arrested one Rachhpal Singh and seized a .32 bore pistol, 35 bullets, .12 bore double-barrel gun, a single-barrel gun, 62 live cartridges and two shells from his possession. A hunt is on for the remaining accused,” the police commissioner said. A fake police uniform and a fake identification were also recovered from him. Conspiracy hatched over two years Agrawal said the accused had been hatching the conspiracy for two years. “Harjinderpal had joined as driver two years ago with the intention of kidnapping any family member for ransom. On Tuesday, he kidnapped the child,” he said.The boy’s father Pankaj said his father Prem Gupta had hired the accused two years ago. However, as his father passed away a year ago, he was not sure whether his father had police verification done but says he has a photocopy of the accused’s Aadhar Card.The police chief said Harjinder was a habitual offender and had been facing trial in five criminal cases — including kidnapping, robberies and forgery in Fazilka, Sirhind, Haryana and Rajasthan. Lal has two cases, including murder and kidnapping, registered against him and Sukha has six cases, including drug peddling and robbery, lodged against him. Interdepartmental credit war The Ludhiana and Moga police have indulged in a credit war after the safe recovery of the child. Moga superintendent of police Jagatpreet Singh held a press conference and claimed they had rescued the child with help of Ludhiana police after a long operation. The SP handed over the child to his parents in front of the media.Hours later, the Ludhiana police held a press conference in Ludhiana and handed over the child to his parents again||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2-year-old-kidnapped-for-4-crore-ransom-rescued-from-moga-1-held/story-urhiWza9OrsxgKeoZ8NzTM.html

The project was given in-principle approval by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore in November last year.After putting it on the backburner in the wake of the pandemic and budget cuts imposed by the Centre, the UT administration has now speed-tracked the project. With drawings and designs in place, the UT engineering department will now initiate the tendering process by first preparing the cost estimates.The administration had come under severe criticism for first constructing the pedestrian underpass between the Rose Garden and Sector 17, which has a very low footfall, rather than adhering to the long-standing demand for an underpass between PU and PGIMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-urban-planning-department-okays-drawings-of-underpass-connecting-pgimer-pu/story-n0t7qKOfNb3LQkyqLwGg0K.html

03-12-2020||Chandigarh||Delimitation of Mohali MC wards: HC summons official record from Punjab local bodies dept||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday summoned the record pertaining to delimitation exercise carried out by the Punjab local bodies department to redraw the boundaries of Mohali MC wards.The high court bench of justice Jitendra Chauhan acted on the plea of one Bachan Singh and others who had challenged the exercise. It was argued that the process of delimitation was in violation of the Delimitation of Wards of Municipal Corporation Order of 1995.The court was told that objections were moved on October 29. However, neither the objections were decided by passing a speaking order by the competent authority nor any survey of the population was conducted. The whole process of readjustment was illegal, the court was told.The government counsel had told the court that objections were considered and rejected by a detailed order by the competent authority. In view of this, the court fixed the matter for December 3 and directed that all the documents/material collected during the population survey be made available to the court on Thursday.As per the councillors of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), 70% seats held by them in the previous Mohali municipal corporation House had been re-carved or reserved or deserved to their detriment. The five-year term of the House ended on April 26 this year. Among the 50 wards, 25 have been reserved for women besides five for scheduled castes (including two for women) and two for backward classes (men). As many as 23 of 33 wards previously held by SAD-BJP have been affected, while wards of only two former Congress councillors have been converted to the general category; the remaining 13 have been left untouched.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delimitation-of-mohali-mc-wards-hc-summons-official-record-from-punjab-local-bodies-dept/story-vuGmI4Z6ZLDE4CWKLW8VbM.html

03-12-2020||Chandigarh||Admissions for 2021-22 session begin in Chandigarh schools||Admission process for the 2021-2022 academic session will start from Thursday. Amid the pandemic, it is expected that many schools will release the admission forms on their website and accept them online.All 114 government schools, 77 private recognised schools and eight aided schools had to upload the admission information on their website by Wednesday. Forms will be submitted between December 3 and December 16. It is expected that there will be over 3,000 seats up for grabs across various private schools this year.The admissions for entry-level classes will be for children born between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. The forms will be available free of cost, but ₹100 will have to be paid at the time of the submission by general candidates. In government schools, preference will be given to those staying in the institutes’ proximity.In case more applications are received than the number of seats available, a draw of lots will be conducted. One of the principals said it becomes too much of a task to hold draw of lots in both online and offline modes, so for uniformity, most of the schools are opting for online method only.DEO had also written to school heads, asking them to make sure that forms can be obtained from their websites and submitted online. Many schools will be opting for an ‘online-only policy’ for general candidates. Information displayed on the websites of most schools confirmed this. EWS ADMISSIONS MAY TAKE LONGEREven as the admission procedure has already started, parents haven’t been issued required certificates yet, which are necessary for taking admission in EWS category.

The Independent School Association (ISA) will meet UT education secretary and director school education regarding the issue of increasing the fee for the 2021-2022 session on Thursday. ISA president HS Mamik said, “Since fee hike wasn’t allowed for the 2020-2021 session, we should be allowed to increase it by 16%. But whatever the final decision is, we want clarity from the education department.” DSE Brar said till the meeting, schools don’t have to upload their fees information online.Mamik added that they will also discuss other issues, including prescribing only NCERT books and 15% EWS seat reservation in all schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/admissions-for-2021-22-session-begin-in-chandigarh-schools/story-i1Ixj7RsdSwZM6aWTUeqWN.html
03-12-2020||Mumbai||Amid Covid-19 pandemic, water and sanitation still a luxury for many in Mumbai: Report||The Covid-19 pandemic was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on March 11 this year. Since then, various national and international organisations have been emphasising on maintaining personal hygiene and sanitation, of which, washing hands multiple times a day is of utmost importance. But in Mumbai, the financial capital of the country, washing hands regularly and personal hygiene are privileges for close to 20 lakh people living in the slums.According to a recent report released by Mumbai-based Pani Haq Samiti (PHS) and the Centre for Promoting Democracy (CPD), of the 292 households they surveyed in the city, only 9.25% had personal toilet facilities, while 18.15% resorted to open defecation owing to lack of access and 75.34% were dependent on shared toilet facilities despite the fear of the infection. The report, “A ground assessment of Wash realities of Mumbai’s informal settlements during Covid-19” released in November, further revealed that 24.4% of the households did not receive daily water supply, while 19.31% could not access safe potable water during the lockdown.The surveys, conducted in July, included citizens from across settlements like Bhim Nagar, Indira Nagar in the eastern suburbs, Ambedkar Nagar, Siddharth Nagar in the western suburbs, transit camp and Kaula bunder in Mumbai city and even those living on footpaths.The report noted a recommendation by WHO to wash one’s hands for at least 20 seconds, which would require minimum 0.5 litres of water. This meant that, “A family of five living in a notified-slum of Mumbai, receiving less than 60 litres of municipal water supply per family per day, would use 25 litres or over 40% of their water supply just for washing hands. The remaining water would then have to be split between all other domestic uses like drinking, cooking, washing and bathing,” the report quoted.Sitaram Shelar, convenor of PHS, said, “Before Covid-19, the citizens would somehow jostle for water by stepping out, which was made further impossible during the lockdown with several restrictions. We had written to the municipal corporation earlier that we have identified 62 communities in the city that have no access to safe water and must be provided with public taps on humanitarian grounds.” The organisation is now looking at meeting the municipal commissioner to submit the report, Shelar said. “We are also looking at writing to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and prime minister Narendra Modi,” he added.PHS is a collective of community leaders from 54 settlements across 17 wards in the city. It has been working towards equitable distribution of water in Mumbai since 2014. It has also filed a public interest litigation in the Bombay high court (HC), which later gave a judgement upholding the right to water as a precondition to right to life. However, owing to various administrative blocks, including a policy by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) that people must obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from respective authorities (where shanties are built for example, central government or collector land) to get access to water, as many as 20 lakh people in Mumbai do not have access to safe drinking water, PHS noted. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, in-charge of the water department said, “As a policy, we provide water connections to everyone. However, it is a dynamic process and we fulfil the requirements as and when the requests come in. There might be procedural issues when it comes to encroached areas such as obtaining permissions that delay the process. However, for slums, we provide water at 70 litres per capita.” A senior civic official from the solid waste management of BMC, who did not wish to be named said, “By March 2021, we are building 21,000 additional toilet seats in slum areas. We have completed more than 50% of the work already. As far as public toilets are concerned, we look at sanitising it at least four-five times a day in wake of the pandemic.” In its report, the organisations have also listed a number of recommendations that can be implemented to improve the situation. It recommends a thorough study by BMC to understand ground realities, adopting an inclusive policy towards water and sanitation, making the centuries-old pyaaus (drinking water fountains) in various locations in the city functional and accessible to people and making sanitation economical and accessible for people.“Water and sanitation must be considered a public good and its basic universal access must be ensured by the state. Universal access to water and sanitation is an imperative step on the way forward to collective health and recovery,” it stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-water-and-sanitation-still-a-luxury-for-many-in-mumbai-report/story-63oanSUDpJwCkqbhaLG4jN.html

I have received six applications for the mayor seat (reserved for women),” he said.On the farmers’ stir, he replied, “Farmers are not happy on a particular issue that will be soon resolved, but they are overall satisfied with the party.”State election commissioner Dr Dalip Singh will address a press conference regarding elections of the civic bodies of Ambala, Panchkula, Sonepat and some other municipalities at 12.30pm on Thursday, where he is expected to declare the dates. Deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma has appointed SDM (Ambala city) Sachin Gupta as the nodal officer for the polls. “Gupta has been given the responsibility in the absence of additional deputy commissioner Preeti, who tested positive for coronavirus last month.

As thoroughly drenched teachers didn’t move from their spot on the Panchkula-Chandigarh border, some were finally taken to the CM’s residence for a talk.Chandigarh Police said water cannons were used as the teachers tried to cross barricades.Jitender Kundu, vice-president of association of primary teachers, Rajkiya Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, Haryana, said that hundreds of teachers had sought interdistrict transfer and last year, these teachers were given an option to choose their district online.“On November 15, the Haryana education department had issued an order of interdistrict transfer of 2,544 primary teachers. They were asked to join their new workplace within two days. Many teachers shifted from their places, but on November 27, another order was released by director elementary education, Haryana, wherein he cancelled the previous order,” he added. “The teachers are told that there has been no transfer and asked to join their previous work station,” Kundu said, adding that the next decision will be taken after April 2021.Kundu said teachers were left harassed and the union held a meeting with the director elementary education, Haryana, on December 1, wherein he assured some solution by the evening. “But when we didn’t get any response till today morning, we decided to hold a peaceful protest and walked towards the CM’s residence in Chandigarh,” he added. Over 1,500 primary teachers had come to Panchkula on December 1, Kundu said.As per the Panchkula police, hundreds of primary teachers started a march towards Khattar’s residence around 3pm and were stopped by Chandigarh Police at the border. Water cannons were used around 3.30pm and when the teachers didn’t move by the evening, a representative was taken to the CM’s residence for talks.Tarun Suhag, state president of the organisation, met the OSD to Haryana CM at his residence. “We have been assured that our demands will be met, else we will sit on protest after two days at Jagadhri,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/teachers-on-way-to-haryana-cm-s-residence-brave-water-cannons/story-wAmPlabDDhuSZAmFn0YYzJ.html

03-12-2020||City||Mohali District Bar Association extends support to farmers||Members of Mohali District Bar Association on Wednesday extended their support to the farmers agitating in the capital against agricultural laws. In a meeting held under the chairmanship of DBA president Manpreet Singh Chahal, the members felt that it was “highly reprehensible and undemocratic to try to stop the farmers’ agitation and torture them while they were fighting for their legitimate rights”. “If the citizens of India are restrained from entering a state and if the police, at the behest of the government, obstruct the way, then it is disrespect to the people’s mandate and a violation of the federal structure,” he added. The association said that the central government’s attitude towards the farmers was bound to give rise to various doubts and suspicions as to why the government was adamant to implement the controversial laws at any cost. The members passed a resolution in favour of the farmers’ movement and still stand by the farmers and call all the advocates to support the agitation. “We urge the Centre to engage in open dialogue with the farmers and withdraw the agricultural laws or amend them as per the demand of the farmers,” Mohali DBA said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-district-bar-association-extends-support-to-farmers/story-uXkS0F1CaaJQ8CfN0cctFN.html

03-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai blood banks’ stock may last only for a week: SBTC||When the Assam-based Rehmans landed in Mumbai on November 16 for the treatment of their nine-year-old daughter Fariha Amina Rehman who suffers from leukaemia, a cancer of blood-forming tissues, little did they know that the city’s supply of blood was running dry.Data collated by State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) — which monitors the functioning of blood centres in the state — showed that as of November 27, the total units of blood available across the city was around 3500 units, prompting its director Dr Arun Thorat to state Wednesday that the city had barely a week’s stock of blood supply. The average requirement of blood during the pandemic has been up to 600 units a day.“Since the outbreak of the virus, there’s been only a 50% response from the public to blood donation camps. Even though Mumbaiites are stepping out with the gradual relaxation of the lockdown, they refuse to donate blood for a good cause. We have blood stock only for a week,” said Thorat.To be sure, blood banks have still been receiving blood through donations, albeit in a depleted form. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has put a stop to mega blood donation camps as a result of which the stocks are not being replenished as before. An unintended consequence of this is that blood banks are now asking persons in need of blood to arrange for replacement blood — a practice that is in violation of the National Blood Transfusion Council rules.The Rehmans, who had never visited Mumbai before or had any family in this city to help them, had no choice but to find replacement donors for Fariha, a student of Class 3 in Nagaon. And then, another complication struck. Fariha, whose white blood cell count was already low developed haemorrhoids serious enough for her doctors at the Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) in Parel to consider surgery before starting chemotherapy. Though she is on antibiotics at present, her family has been looking for replacement donors to donate either her blood type — B positive — or any other type in the eventuality that she undergoes surgery. “Her chances of survival are already less, but we are doing everything we can to save the girl. Through my friends, I am trying to contact people in Mumbai to arrange for replacement blood but that’s not enough. We need more to keep her alive,” said Anjum Mehmed, her uncle, who accompanied her father Hizbur Rehman, an inspector at a cooperative society, and her mother Shajina Ahmed, to Mumbai. Mehmed eventually found a list of regular donors and he began to call them, one number at a time. Seven people have donated blood so far. But it’s not enough. Regular blood transfusion is what will keep Fariha alive.When asked whether TMH was asking patients to arrange for replacement blood, Dr Sunil B. Rajadhyaksha, head of the transfusion medicine and SBTC member said that patients were not being forced to arrange for donors. “We have often noticed that the relatives of patients don’t donate blood. So, to encourage the habit of donation, we ask them to donate. But it is not forceful. So, rather than saying replacement blood, we prefer the term relative blood. Many a time, these relatives turn into a regular when their fear of blood donation gets over. It is aimed at developing a good habit among people.”The hospital, which is renowned for its cancer treatment, requires on average 28,000 units of blood annually, and 80 units of blood daily. However, anticipating a crisis soon after the lockdown was declared in March, the hospital turned to residential societies to collect blood.“In the initial days of the pandemic, other hospitals didn’t have to worry about blood shortages as the footfall of patience declined by almost 80%. Whereas at our hospital we had enough number of in-house patients who needed a regular supply of blood. So, we decided to collect blood from nearby residential societies. Our hospital staffers contacted their buildings and arranged for blood camps,” Rajadhyaksha said.TMH is still holding camps at residential complexes, community halls and sports clubs with social distancing measures in place, he said. However, the response remains tepid. “If 75 people register to donate blood, only 30 of them actually come forward for donation. Earlier, at each camps, we used to get around 100 units of blood. But now, it has fallen to around 40 units of blood,” he said.All blood banks, whether in private or government hospitals, or those run by charities, are down to their last few bags. SBTC data from November 27 showed that King Edward Memorial Hospital, Parel, which uses more than 150 units of blood every day had only 90 units of blood components and not a single unit of platelet, while JJ group of hospitals (which includes St George, Cama Maternity and Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital hospitals) which require more than 250 units of blood every day had only 31 units of whole blood, 83 units of blood components and four units of platelets.The various components of blood — plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets — have different uses for patients. While platelets are essential for persons suffering from cancer, red blood cells are needed during surgeries and white blood cells are needed for transfusion.Officials of the SBTC and the Food and Drugs Administration have been holding regular meetings on the crisis. At a recent meeting held earlier this week, FDA minister Dr Rajendra Shingne appealed to political parties and government servants across the board to celebrate events and festivals by donating blood. “Earlier, corporate companies and religious organisations would hold mass blood donation camps that have stopped due to the pandemic. Housing societies too are no longer conducting blood donation camps. This has affected smooth collection of blood,” he said.“Almost 30% of the blood donated comes from camps held at corporate houses. That source of donation has been cut off completely. Presently, most blood donors are relatives of the patients. Since the pandemic, our blood stock has decreased to 15% capacity. It’s an everyday struggle now,” Dr Devang Shah, a blood bank officer at privately-run Anviksha Blood Bank in Ghatkopar.The worst affected are people who require blood regularly. This includes leukemia patients like Fariha, and those suffering from thalassemia, like the Pushkarnas.“For many years, I have been undergoing transfusion at Dr MB Agarwal day care centre at Dadar TT by arranging blood from JJ Hospital blood bank since my children have SBTC thalassemia cards. But there has been a severe shortage for the past four months, and the blood bank has been unable to help us,” said Sandeep Pushkarna, who along with his teenage children, aged 13 and 18, are thalassemia majors and need blood transfusions every 15 days. They were able to receive blood units from Anvishka Blood Bank once, but are now seeking donors much like Fariha’s family.According to SBTC, there are 2,400 children suffering from thalassemia in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.Kandivli-resident Abhay More, 34, who has been donating blood regularly for the past 12 years, received an emergency call on November 14 from the Wadia Hospital in Parel to donate AB- blood for a pregnant woman who had been admitted with delivery-related complications. Due to restricted public transport available, More had to request a neighbour to ferry him to the hospital as he couldn’t afford to pay taxi fare. “Earlier, I used to donate blood 2-3 times a year. But since the pandemic, I stopped donating blood as my father is a diabetic and I didn’t want to take the risk [of contracting Covid-19],” he said.According to Vinay Shetty, vice-president of Think Foundation, a non-governmental organization that works for patients suffering from blood-related ailments with the state health department, donation camps need to be made more accessible. “People will donate if we can bring the process of donation at their door steps. For that, we need to focus more on residential buildings,” he said.“Since November, we started organising smaller blood camps in neighbouring areas,” said Dr Arun Ghule, president, Maharashtra Association of Medical Doctors at KEM Hospital. “Every day, medical students are donating blood for patients. They mostly donate blood during their day off. We can’t see patients who die for lack of blood.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-blood-banks-stock-may-last-only-for-a-week-sbtc/story-NZuT4Kuw1oBKNrwH9uRNYO.html
03-12-2020||Chandigarh||Violation of CVC guidelines: Chandigarh police begin shuffling cops posted in 1 unit for over 2 years||Stung by extortion allegations, Chandigarh Police have now started the process of shifting cops posted in a single unit for more than two years. The UT police department has already identified officers posted on sensitive posts for more than two years in violation of the central vigilance commission (CVC) guidelines. “All unit in-charges have been asked to rotate the staff and we, too, would be shuffling the cops in adherence to the CVC guidelines,” said superintendent of police (SP) Manoj Kumar Meena. The move comes after two cops — Anil and Pawan — posted in the crime branch were identified through a clip submitted by a liquor contractor of Sector 40, who had alleged that the duo were extorting money from him. Sources said that one of the accused had been posted in the crime branch for more than two years in violation of the CVC guidelines. In September, SP Meena had issued an order asking the unit heads to prepare list of police officials posted in a unit for more than two years. The order was issued on behalf of the Police Establishment Board (PEB), Chandigarh Police, that mandated to ensure proper shuffling of officers posted on sensitive posts as per the CVC guidelines. All SDPOs and DSP (PCR), DSP (traffic) (administration), DSP (EOW), DSP (crime) and DSP (woman and child safety unit) were then directed to identify such officials and send their names to PEB. This list was prepared after complaints started pouring in about few police officials being posted in one unit for long durations. DSP ASKED TO INQUIRE INTO ACCUSED COPS’ ABSENCE The police department is yet to act against Anil and Pawan, who are seen in the video clip submitted by the liquor contractor along with his complaint alleging extortion. The liquor contractor, who has about eight liquor vends in Chandigarh, had accused policemen of extorting money from him. He claimed that he was paying them ₹96,000 per month for the past few months. The accused cops are alleged to be at large ever since the complaint was lodged. “We are yet to receive written communication about involvement of the policemen posted in crime branch in extortion,” Meena said. “There were news reports that few personnel in crime branch have gone underground. DSP (crime) has been asked to inquire and submit report regarding this absence,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/violation-of-cvc-guidelines-chandigarh-police-begin-shuffling-cops-posted-in-1-unit-for-over-2-years/story-GpBXA1O1PBzp0QPAqaHXGJ.html
03-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra cabinet decides to relabel colonies with caste-based names||The Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal to rename colonies and areas that have caste-based names. Instead, it will be named after social workers and leaders or their related work, state social justice minister Dhananjay Munde said.The state cabinet also gave its nod to the proposal of withdrawal of social and political cases registered between November 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019. Most of the cases likely to be withdrawn are those registered against political workers and leaders for their agitations over various issues.Across the state, several rural as well as urban areas are named after castes such as Maharwada, Mangwada, Bhrahmanwada, Mali Galli, Dhorvasti, among others. According to Munde, such names do not suit a “progressive” state like Maharashtra.“Keeping that in mind and to maintain social harmony and goodwill in the state to increase national unity, all caste-based names of areas and localities in rural and urban parts of the state will be changed. They will be named after social workers or something corresponding to their work, for example, Samata Nagar, Bhim Nagar, Jyoti Nagar, Kranti Nagar,” a statement from Munde’s office said.The urban development department will decide on the process in urban areas, while the rural development department will do the same for their areas, the statement added.In 2012, the government changed the name of an award by dropping the word Dalit from it and renamed it Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Samaj Bhushan Award. The state government had already issued a government resolution in September 2019 to drop the use of the word Dalit from all government correspondences and schemes. All correspondences now use scheduled caste and Nav Bouddha instead.On the proposal to withdraw social and political cases, the earlier Devendra Fadnavis government, soon after assuming power, had taken a decision to withdraw such cases registered before November 1, 2014. The current Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government extended the period to December 21, 2019. The government also dissolved the committee appointed under the finance minister by the earlier government to review such cases and has allotted power to the home minister.The process for withdrawal of cases registered against protests by the Maratha community for reservation between 2016 and 2018 and the protests at Aarey colony against the earlier state government’s decision of cutting trees for a Metro car shed at Aarey in October last year has already begun. “Those are not part of the decision taken today, as the process for their withdrawal has already started. We will take a review of the other cases that are political/social in nature and had no loss of life or damage to properties,” said an official from the home department.The officer said that cases are withdrawn under section 321 of the criminal procedure code and only after permission from the courts where they are being tried.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cabinet-decides-to-relabel-colonies-with-caste-based-names/story-UocX9gniZxZIPgoP9sbwSI.html

03-12-2020||Delhi||Won’t budge even an inch, too much at stake for us: Farmers||A day ahead of the next round of talks with the government, farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders said they will not budge an inch till the three new farm laws are not revoked. The farmers said they are under huge debt and that the new laws will make their condition even worse. “I am under huge debt. My family will be on the streets if the government does not revoke the new farming bills,” said Jasdeep Singh from Bahadurpur village in Sungrur district of Punjab, one of the thousands of farmers protesting at the Singhu and Tikri borders for the last six days.Explaining his situation, Singh said his family of six is completely dependent on the five acres land they own and use to produce wheat. “We produce around eight quintals of wheat and sell it at the mandis at a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs1,835 per quintal. Now, with no assurance of MSP in the new farm law, the corporates will not give us more than Rs 900 to Rs 1,000. Our income will be reduced to half. How will we survive and pay our debts in that situation?” he said.Sitting next to him at Singhu border on Wednesday, Singh’s mother Amarjeet Kaur said, “Just four days before we left to participate in the protest, a family committed suicide in our neighbourhood after they failed to pay back their debt to the bank. These incidents will become frequent now.” She says her family has to repay a debt of Rs 8 lakh. The farmers fear the new laws will do away with a guaranteed MSP, enabling private players to procure the produce at much lower rates. The government has been saying the MSP system will not be done away with.Raising similar concerns, Karanweer Singh, a farmer from Charuni Jattan village of Kurukshetra in Haryana, said his family of 12 are dependent on the produce they harvest from their 15-acre land. “A major portion of our produce is consumed at home and the remaining is sold at the mandis on the MSP. What will we earn if there is no MSP? I will have to withdraw my children from schools because I won’t be able to pay their fees,” he said, adding his family has to repay a loan of Rs 4 lakh before the next harvesting season.Balwinder Singh Rana, president of Majja Kisan Sangarsh Committee Punjab, said farmer associations across the country have decided not to accept anything but complete revocation of the three laws. “More than two lakh farmers from Maharashtra, Haryana and Punjab will soon join us in our protest. We won’t accept any amendment in the laws. The government cannot do away with the mandi system and abolish the MSP.”Kunwant Singh Sandhu, general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha (Punjab), said, “We will go for the meeting called by the Centre on Thursday but we will not accept anything other than complete revocation of the three laws.”Several small farmers feared they will not be able to sell their produce outside the current mandi system. Kulwinder Singh, a farmer from Moga, said he cultivates wheat and rice on a two-acre land for his family of six. “The new laws have opened up the market for corporates. Now, the rich farmers, who have the resources and can sell their produce directly in cities like Delhi or Mumbai, will benefit. Small farmers like me will be in a disadvantaged position,” he said.Pranjeet Singh, 65, a female farmer from Fatehabad in Haryana, said, “We are not sitting on the streets leaving our houses by choice. We are here so that the future generations don’t question us on how we let the government ruin their lives? The government can see smoke coming out of our farms from 500 kms, but they can’t listen to us when we are sitting at their doorstep.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/won-t-budge-an-inch-s-ay-protesting-farmers-on-new-farm-laws/story-zeL7FBQQ0GzqDG0tUZFfLL.html
03-12-2020||Delhi||Traffic hit as Kalindi Kunj is briefly shut to stop farmers from Noida entering Delhi||Wednesday saw attempts by farmers to block another border point to Delhi -- the Kalindi Kunj border that connects Noida with south Delhi -- even as the Singhu and Tikri borders remained completely blocked to traffic for the sixth consecutive day. The police, however, managed to convince farmers at the Chilla border (also between Delhi and Noida) to clear one carriageway for traffic by Wednesday afternoon. This borer point had remained shut since Tuesday.With all the closures and standoffs, traffic and commuting between NCR cities were a nightmare of humongous proportions on Wednesday. The Kalandi Kunj border -- connecting Noida with south Delhi -- had to be briefly shut on Wednesday evening after about a 100 farmers on tractors arrived there from Noida and tried to enter Delhi. The police quickly placed iron barricades and deployed extra personnel to prevent more such attempts. The sudden closure of the Kalandi Kunj border, that too during the evening rush hour, caused heavy jams on both carriageways. The problem was compounded as the Chilla border had remained shut since Tuesday evening and motorists had not alternative but to choose the Kalindi Kunj route. But, by 4.30pm even that was not an option. Kalindi Kunj remained closed only briefly but by then, the tailbacks were long. When the border was reopened, police started stringent checking, which made matter worse as the vehicle queues got longer. While RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east), said the road was blocked for only five minutes and the farmers were convinced to return to Noida by then, the Delhi traffic police’s Twitter account took over an hour to update that the road was reopened.“We initially closed only the carriageway from Noida to Delhi. But then people started driving on the wrong side, and that caused a jam, so we closed the other carriageway as well. The border was opened and traffic restored after the farmers returned to Noida,” Meena said.As far as the Chilla border was concerned, motorists had a harrowing time till Wednesday afternoon since both carriageways between Noida and Akshardham were closed. Police had opened alternative routes, but even those were congested due to the diverted traffic volume.Around 2pm, the Delhi to Noida carriageway on Chilla border was opened after senior police officers met farmers and apprised them about the jams and the inconvenience to people.“The police officers told us that ambulances as well as private vehicles carrying patients were stuck in jams. Although it was the police who had blocked it, and not us, we shifted ourselves to the carriageway from Noida to Delhi on the instructions of the police. We are here for a peaceful protest and not to cause problems to the public,” said Bhanu Pratap Singh, national president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).The traffic situation at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border, on the other hand, remain the same as over the past few days -- the traffic flow was normal on the elevated Delhi-Meerut expressway and one carriageway going towards Ghaziabad from Delhi.The Singhu and Tikri borders remained out of bounds to motorists for the sixth consecutive day. After a few hundred farmers managed to sneak into Delhi through internal roads near the Singhu border, the police on Tuesday confined them to a segregated area at the Singhu crossing. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-hit-as-kalindi-kunj-is-briefly-shut-to-stop-farmers-from-noida-entering-delhi/story-rWVnqsBIo3smW1MxnZVjMK.html
03-12-2020||Delhi||Dense areas with less than three Covid -19 cases can be red zones in Delhi||The revised containment policy implemented in Delhi earlier this week allows districts to create containment zones in densely populated areas, even if there are fewer than three cases, if officials assess that there is a high risk of transmission, said a senior government official.The official further said the revised containment policy was implemented on Monday. The revised strategy also requires districts to ensure that all elderly residents, pregnant women and people with comorbidities – collectively referred to as “high risk” individuals – living in containment zones are subjected to RT-PCR tests along with all symptomatic people and contacts of Covid-19 patients.As on Wednesday, Delhi had 5,772 containment zones, of which at least 331 were notified on or after Monday, government data showed.In his meeting with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, Union home minister Amit Shah had recommended a revised containment policy for the capital to stem the tide of cases.Under the policy, applicable till last week, the districts adhered to a protocol which required them to identify at least three cases for initiating the process of demarcating an area as a containment zone. The zone could range from a single house to an apartment or part of a lane comprising a few houses and shops, as opposed to entire lanes and blocks which were sealed as containment zones till late June.Under the new policy, the government would continue with the micro containment policy (smaller areas) while scaling up testing and surveillance measures. The protocol has been minorly tweaked to allow districts to create containment zones with fewer than three cases on the bases of a risk assessment in a case to case basis, said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified.Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said, “We are leaving no stone unturned to arrest the spread of Covid-19. District teams have been entrusted with assessment of transmission risk and the creation of micro containment zones wherever necessary. It has helped in reducing the number of cases and the positivity rate in recent days. Testing and surveillance in the containment zones have been scaled up.”Delhi recorded 3,944 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday – the first time since October since October 22 when daily cases have fallen below the 4,000-mark. With 78,949 total tests, the positivity rate was 5% -- as against 15.33% recorded on November 15, the government’s daily health bulletin said.Several resident welfare groups, however, pointed out that the containment efforts would not make much of a difference unless the government scales up contact tracing.“Transmission can primarily be controlled only with timely detection and isolation of Covid-19 patients. The government must scale up contact tracing,” said Saurabh Gandhi, general secretary,United Residents of Delhi, an umbrella body of resident groups.BS Vohra, president of the East Delhi resident welfare associations’ front, said, “Containment zones are much smaller now. Also, now posters are not stuck outside the homes of positive persons and so, there are no visible markers for people to know who or where to keep away from. People are totally dependent on the government in terms of contact tracing. Containment and other efforts would yield results only if contact tracing is done appropriately.”The government, however, said currently around 15 contacts per Covid-19 patient are being identified and tested – as against two contacts per Covid-19 patient till late September.Gahlot said, “Contract tracing was scaled up before the festive season and, currently, around 15 contacts per Covid-19 patient are being identified and tested.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dense-areas-with-less-than-three-cases-can-be-red-zones-in-delhi/story-D4MlCCOKwTEfHqGSdD77eN.html

03-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi runs record 78,949 tests, positivity rate drops to 5%||Delhi on Wednesday created a new record, conducting more than 70,000 tests for the viral Covid-19 in a day, almost half of which were done using the more accurate RT-PCR method. The daily state bulletin on Wednesday said that the city had conducted 78,949 tests in a day, including the highest number of RT-PCR tests at 36,370.The state reported 3,944 new cases and 82 deaths due to Covid-19 on Wednesday, taking the total number of people affected by the viral infection in the city to more than 578,000 . At least 9,342 people have succumbed to the virus, so far. So far, the highest number of tests conducted in a day in the city was 69,051 on November 28. The government had planned to scale up testing to between 100,000 and 120,000 tests a day in mid-November after a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah. Despite the high number of tests, the positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive among those tested — dipped to 5%. The positivity rate in the city has dropped below the current 5% only once so far.It was 4.99% on October 6.During the “third wave” of cases, the daily positivity rate in the city had shot up to a high of 15.33% on November 15. “Positivity declined to 5% today from 15.26% on November 7. Highest total tests 78949 and highest RT-PCR tests (36,370) ever with lowest RT-PCR positivity of 8.99%. Steadily corona cases and positivity coming down. Hope this will continue. Please observe all precautions,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a tweet. On November 7, the positivity rate as per RT PCR tests had touched 30%, the highest so far. Experts believe that the spread of the infection has been controlled if a positivity rate of 5% or less is maintained for two weeks. During the month of November, there was a difference of almost 16% on average in positivity rate of RT-PCR tests and rapid antigen tests conducted, data shared by the health minister shows. For Tuesday, the positivity rate of samples tested using RT-PCR and other molecular tests was 8.9% as compared to 1.6% among those tested using rapid antigen test. “The current peak in the number of cases was driven by the interaction of people during the festive season and the high levels of pollution. Now, both have gone down – people are stepping out but there is no mad rush at the markets and the pollution levels are also much better. With such a huge number of cases, I think at least 40% or even more of Delhi’s population may have been exposed to the infection. This means we are unlikely to see huge surge in number of cases again; now fewer number of infections would persist,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. With the decrease in the number of cases being reported daily, the number of hospitalisations has also gone down. For the first time since November first week, the number of people admitted to hospitals across the city with the infection came down to 7,366. This is still higher than the peak number of hospitalisation – just over 7,000 – seen during the second surge in the number of cases Delhi had seen in September. As for the first wave of infections, at its peak just over 6,200 people were in hospitals. The rising number of hospitalisations, especially those in need of critical care, had prompted the Delhi government to increase 663 ICU beds in its own hospitals and ask around 75 private hospitals to reserve 80% of their total ICU beds for the treatment of Covid-19. “Bed vacancy for Covid patients in Delhi hospitals increased to 11,341 from 7,973 since Nov 11 (more than 60% Covid beds are now vacant). During the same period, ICU bed vacancy increased to 1,732 from 518. Since Nov 7 Covid severity is coming down. Please observe all precautions,” said Jain in a tweet. As on Wednesday evening, almost 39% of the hospital beds earmarked for Covid-19 were occupied and just about 65% of the ICU beds were occupied, according to the data on government’s Delhi corona app. The ICU occupancy had gone up to 86% during the current surge in infections. Despite fewer hospitalisations, ventilator beds in big hospitals like Sir Ganga Ram, Indraprastha Apollo, Max, and Fortis continue to be completely full. “Our ICUs are still running at capacity and even the wards are full. This is because we had long waiting lists of people and we get patients referred to from smaller centres as well. However, seeing that the number of cases in the city are on the decline, it is likely that we will start seeing a decline in some says,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head of the department of pulmonology at Fortis, Shalimar Bagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-runs-record-78k-tests-positivity-rate-drops-to-5/story-rQez12ukoEl8E4FevszgjI.html
03-12-2020||Delhi||National Green Tribunal extends ban on firecrackers||The National Green Tribunal on Wednesday extended the ban on the sale and use of all firecrackers during the Covid-19 pandemic in Delhi-NCR and other cities, where the ambient air quality is in the poor category or worse. The green court said that during Christmas and on New Year, the use of green crackers will be allowed between 11:55 pm to 12:30 am, but only at places where air quality is in the moderate zone or better. A bench headed by NGT chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel, said its direction to restrict the use of firecrackers in places where air quality is ‘moderate’ or below for green crackers and for the duration of not more than two hours, will continue. “There will be a total ban on the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers during Covid-19 pandemic in the NCR and all cities/towns in the country where the ambient air quality falls under the ‘poor’ and above category,” the bench said. The NGT also directed all district magistrates to ensure that firecrackers are not sold in Delhi-NCR and ordered strict compliance of the ban. The bench said that if individuals face problems due to burning of firecrackers they can consult the district magistrate for compensation. It said, “Any victim of pollution, apart from other remedies, can approach the district magistrate for compensation.” The air quality in Delhi remained in the very poor category on Wednesday, and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that with temperatures and wind speeds reducing, the pollution levels are likely to become worse in the coming weeks. Last month, ahead of Diwali, the NGT had imposed a complete ban on the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight in not only Delhi and NCR, but well as in places which had recorded ‘poor’ air quality levels in 2019. The NGT had then attached a list of 122 places across the country, which had recorded poor air quality levels in November 2019. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said that a cracker ban can only be successful if its enforcement is ensured efficiently. “Firecrackers were banned even during Diwali, but across neighbourhoods in Delhi and even in NCR towns, we heard cracker bursting and its impact was also seen in the air quality on Diwali night and a day later. Bans can only be successful with effective enforcement and awareness among citizens. They need to be made aware of the side effects of large scale cracker bursting on their and their family’s health,” said Roychowdhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/national-green-tribunal-extends-ban-on-firecrackers/story-zkgiEHNozKcMRq3JWqJWJL.html
03-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality to worsen from Dec 4, may be severe on Dec 6, says Met dept||Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the very poor category on Wednesday as wind speed was negligible through the day. India Meteorological Department (IMD), however, said the worst is yet to come and the air quality is likely to deteriorate even further from December 4. As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) on Wednesday was 373, categorised as very poor. This was a marginal deterioration from Tuesday’s was 367, and quite worse than Monday’s 318, though both are in the very poor category. On a scale of 0 to 500, an AQI value between 300 and 400 is considered very poor, and those above 400 are considered severe. According to the IMD, the air quality is likely to remain in the very poor zone till Friday and is likely to nosedive more from Saturday as the wind speed slows down further. The met agency warned that on December 6 and December 7, the AQI might even slip to the severe zone. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said the reduction in wind speed from November 4 will lead to an accumulation of pollutants. “Friday, the wind speed will still be ample, but from December 4, it will slow down again. Our forecast says that on December 6 and December 7, the air quality will be at its worst and may even slip into the severe zone,” Soni said. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that currently, Delhi is receiving north-westerly winds but it the next few days, the wind direction will change to easterlies. “The speed will slow down and there will also be an increase in moisture in the air, which will also lead to pollution particles sticking closer to the ground,” Srivastava said. He continued, “The change in direction is due to a western disturbance that will affect Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh from the night of December 3, which will also have an impact on Delhi. Whenever there is a change in wind pattern, winds turn calm and trap pollutants.” IMD also said there is a forecast of shallow fog on December 4 or 5. The forecast added that the minimum temperature will go up and settle at 10-11 degrees Celsius, over the next two days. On Wednesday, the Safdarjung observatory --- the official marker for the city’s weather --- recorded a minimum temperature of 8.2 degrees Celsius, a point below normal. The maximum settled at 26.7 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/air-quality-to-worsen-from-dec-4-may-be-severe-on-dec-6-says-met-dept/story-9hy1YnGntq9mQkJO7x7a1O.html
03-12-2020||Delhi||Field trials of Pusa’s stubble solution show mixed results||Deepak Yadav, a farmer in Jhuljhuli village of south-west Delhi’s Najafgarh, picks up and displays the stubble of a late variety of Basmati strewn on his two-acre farm. It’s in the same form it was in more than a month ago when district officials sprayed the Pusa bio-decomposer on the farm, they had told him the post-harvest stubble would turn into manure in 15 to 20 days.For some reason, the bio-decomposer doesn’t quite seem to be effective on the post-harvest stubble of the fine-grained rice.“We had got the bio-decomposer sprayed on our field on October 23 and it has been a month and the stubble has not shown any sign of melting,” said Yadav, 33 . He quickly added: “We are not nitpicking. The Delhi government’s initiative could be a good solution for farmers cultivating mota chawal (non-basmati rice), but we have not benefitted much.”The Pusa bio-decomposer has been developed by scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi to turn post-harvest crop residue into manure, and has been plugged by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as a potential solution to the annual practice of stubble burning in neighbouring agrarian states such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh that covers the national capital in a blanket of smoky haze every winter.In the capital, the bio-decomposer was sprayed free in 25 villages between October 11 and November 20. Hindustan Times visited some villages in the rural pockets of Delhi to find out how effective it had been. Some farmers found the solution to be useful in converting stubble into manure, some said that it was taking much longer than the 15-20 days the Delhi government said the process would take.The free spraying was not done everywhere, but interested farmers could contact the district administration and get their farms sprayed if they wanted to. The government survey was limited to 2,000 acres of non-basmati fields. In the same village where Deepak Yadav grows basmati, three farmers cultivate non-basmati varieties. Two of them said they seen noticeable results in their fields where the bio-decomposer successfully turned the sturdy stubble into manure. “The stubble from non-basmati varieties is thicker and coarser, and when we use harvesting machines, the remains of the straw requires some kind of intervention. It took around 22 days for the stubble to turn into manure. It is good that the government is coming up with solutions for farmers and providing this free of cost,” said Kushal Singh, who owns eight acres in Najafgarh.The early response for the decomposer may be mixed, but most farmers say the solution could be a viable option. Farmers should be told how exactly the solution works, under what circumstances it could take longer than the promised 15-to-20 days to turn stubble into manure, and what the farmers need to do to ensure the process is faster and more effective, they said.How the solution worksThe bio-decomposer is being tested in the fields of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab and factors such as temperature and quality of stubble plays a role in the impact of solution, said Dr AK Singh, director of IARI . He said the process takes at least 25 days, but could last as long as two months.He said that bio-decomposer works on stubble after it has been cut into small pieces by the Super Straw Management System (SMS). SMS is a machine attached to a combine harvester, which chops the stubble remains into pieces. The solution is then sprinkled over the stubble.“Once the field is harvested, the solution has to be sprayed in the field after which the field should be plowed with a rotavator machine so that the solution is mixed with the soil. The field should then be irrigated and left for 25 days. When left for 25 days, we have seen that the effectiveness of the decomposer was as much as 90%,” Singh said.He said that for the decomposition to be effective, a minimum 25 days is needed between paddy harvesting and sowing of the wheat crop. When the temperatures are lower or when the bio-decomposer is used after machines such as Happy Seeder are put to use, the time for decomposition was around two months, Singh said. The Happy Seeder is a machine that cuts and lifts rice straw, sows wheat, and deposits the straw over the sown area as mulch.A senior official of the Punjab agriculture department said that in the agricultural demography of Delhi, such simple solutions could be easier, but Punjab has nearly 2.7 million hectares of land under paddy cultivation, of which 600,00 hectares is used to grow basmati varieties.“It is great that the Delhi government is taking the initiative and wants to find a solution for the problem of stubble burning, but agrarian states such as Punjab, Haryana and even UP have been experimenting with solutions for years now, and if things were this simple, then we would be the first to implement it. We are not denying that a certain bio-decomposer could be yielding better results, but the result depends on multiple factors,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Farmers who harvested their fields in the latter part of October or early November, when the temperatures start falling, would have possibly seen that the process takes longer, said a Delhi government spokesperson.“I don’t know which farmers are finding it to not be effective, but it could possibly be because in lower temperature the fungal growth takes time. The field should also be irrigated, because the fungus needs that to grow. But the non-basmati farmers that we have surveyed have seen a tremendous result from the Pusa bio-decomposer,” the spokesperson said.Delhi is differentTribhuvan Singh, a farmer in Daryapur village of Najafgarh, said the practice of setting fire to stubble to clear the fields has been almost done away with in Delhi. He said that because of small landholdings, it is easier for farmers here to hire labour and manually get rid of the stubble.“There are two problems. Since the fields are smaller, the use of mechanised harvesting is neither a feasible option, nor a very popular one here. Another reason is that when you harvest some fine basmati varieties by machines, the grain tends to split and this fetches lower prices in the market. So the need for such a bio-decomposer is barely there in Delhi,” said Singh.The Delhi government had on November 5 announced the formation of a 15-member impact assessment committee to study the effectiveness of the Pusa bio-decomposer in 2,000 acres (810 hectares) of Delhi. Based on the committee’s report, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had written to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi and adjoining areas, calling the bio-decomposer a “success” in Delhi and suggested that the new body direct states such as Punjab and Haryana to use the technique.The Basmati Survey Report, 2018-2019, by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) showed that Delhi had a total of 1.58 hectares of land under rice cultivation, out of which in 1.2 hectares basmati varieties were being grown.Similarly, in states such as Punjab and Haryana there was a consistent shift towards the cultivation of basmati varieties, instead of non-basmati ones. The APEDA report shows that in Punjab, between 2018 and 2019, 549.19 hectares of land was under basmati cultivation, compared to the total of 2863.08 hectares under rice cultivation. In Haryana, out of 1278.79 hectares of land under rice cultivation, 631.75 hectares were under basmati.Latest data also shows that the area under basmati this year in Punjab was the highest in five years, a 4% increase compared to last year.“In Delhi, the practice of stubble burning is not prevalent. That is also because the city has a major packaging industry, so the stubble from paddy is sold off at a good price, without having to burn it. This was just an experiment. We need to send out the message that this is a feasible solution. Happy seeders, etc have not worked because those are not practical solutions,” the Delhi government spokesperson said.She added, “These machines are hardly used for 20 days in the whole year. Even if all the subsidies were working perfectly and reaching the farmers in time, it is very expensive. No one will invest that much for its use for just 20 days in a year. The bio-decomposer is a great alternative.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/field-trials-of-pusa-s-stubble-solution-show-mixed-results/story-bebas4zBCsPAOJWZGth89M.html
03-12-2020||Delhi||North MCD plans to allow open-air dining at restaurants||In a bid to boost its revenue, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to allow open-air dining at restaurants in its jurisdiction in tune with a similar policy passed by its south Delhi counterpart in September-October this year. A proposal approved by the civic body’s standing committee now needs a nod from the House.The draft policy says open-air dining would be allowed only at those restaurants where the open areas or terraces are privately owned, which means there should be no encroachments on public land or footpaths.A senior official of the north corporation said the proposal was mooted after representatives of the National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) had in September requested it to allow open-air dining at restaurants.“The policy to allow open-air dining at restaurants was passed in a standing committee meeting last month. We will send it to the house meeting of the municipality for a final nod later this month. The draft policy is similar to the one passed by SDMC, so most terms and conditions are likely to remain same,” the official said.The draft policy approved by the north corporation said barbecue or cooking of food will not be allowed in the open area and it will be limited to only serving food. The policy said liquor will be permitted only at licensed terraces or other open spaces available with restaurants. “To serve liquor, restaurant owners will have to install view cutters and high parapet grilles (at least 1.5 metre high) so passerby do not face inconvenience. The open space should not have a direct opening to the main road,” the policy proposal read.Jai Prakash, mayor north corporation, said restaurant owners will have to produce a structural safety certificate, procure a NOC from the fire department and pay a licence fee to the civic body to avail of the benefit. “The fee is likely to remain the same as the policy approved by SDMC. Such innovative moves are required to boost revenue, especially when the civic body is undergoing a severe financial crisis,” Prakash said.The licence fee will be Rs 100 per square feet for normal restaurants and Rs 200 per square feet for star rated (4-star and above) dining restaurants and hotels. The draft policy also says light music can be played but should not be beyond permissible decibel levels. Sandeep Anand Goyle, member managing committee of NRAI, said that the decision would benefit the industry and help the cash-strapped civic body to generate more revenue.“There are many restaurants with open space available in areas such as Civil Lines, Kamla Nagar, Rohini, Karol Bagh among others. Such a practice is already in place in many cities. SDMC had already approved this policy and now we hope other municipalities such as NDMC and EDMC will allow open-air dining facility,” Goyle said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-mcd-plans-to-allow-open-air-dining-at-restaurants/story-7OtlpuMoLu6kFWA4u9AbQK.html
03-12-2020||Delhi||Jamia Millia Islamia to hold semesters in monitored online mode||Keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic, Jamia Millia Islamia will hold its semester exams in December in the online mode using the “proctored ” method, which uses technology to monitor a user computer’s webcam and audio to check for unfair means. The decision was taken after a meeting of university officials with vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar and deans of all faculties on Wednesday.“The concern of travelling during the pandemic is genuine as there has been a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi and other states. Since calling them here for offline exams during such a scenario would not be safe, we have decided to hold proctored exams for the students,” Akhtar told HT.Following the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown in March, institutes in the national capital – including Jamia – have been closed for regular classes and exams. During the last semester, the university evaluated its students based on multiple assignments. Following the University Grants Commission guidelines over conducting exams, the varsity decided to conduct exams this time instead of doing assessments.“Students will be provided the schedule beforehand. They would have to sit in front of their computers, download the question paper, write it without using any unfair means on a sheet of paper, and send it to us by either scanning it or taking a photograph,” Akhtar said. The university plans to rope in agencies that conduct such exams.Controller of examinations and registrar Nazim Hussain Jafri said, “Online exams can be conducted in three ways such as centre-based, open book, or the proctored way. We found that the proctored way would be most feasible as it would help to check against unfair means. There will be cameras which will help us determine if students are looking here and there for help.”Akhtar said students without access to laptops and computers will be able to use their phones for the exams. “If the computer software detects any movement or hint of unfair means, it will alert the systems and our teachers, who will be overseeing the exams as invigilators, will check that student,” she said.The decision is likely to bring relief to students who had been concerned over the fate of their papers following the November 26 notification that said exams would be held from December 29 without any other details.Laraib Ahmad Neyazi, a postgraduate student at the university, said, “The recent surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, having entered its third wave, has become a major issue of concern, especially for outstation students. Since there was no official notification over how exams will be conducted, it had been unsettling. If the authorities had decided to conduct offline exams, booking tickets during a pandemic would require time and will be subject to availability.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jamia-millia-islamia-to-hold-semesters-in-monitored-online-mode/story-RX2AU8BrNXHbf5zL9Th9jO.html

03-12-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 in Mumbai: BMC relies more on antigen tests since September||Amid the fear of a second Covid-19 wave, the city’s civic authorities are relying more on the less-dependable, but quick-result Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) than the Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, considered the gold standard in detecting the presence of the novel coronavirus, the pathogen responsible for Covid-19.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) dashboard, of the 3.52 lakh tests conducted in September in Mumbai, 69% were RT-PCR while the remaining were done using RAT kits. In October, of the 4.07 lakh tests, 60% were RT-PCR and 40% RATs. In November, the usage of RT-PCR kits was at its lowest in three months. Of the 3.59 lakh tests in November (up to November 29), 54% were through the RT-PCR method and 46% via rapid antigen kits. While the positivity rate (the number of people that test positive out of every 100 tested) of RT-PCR tests is between 10% and 12%, the positivity rate of antigen tests is only 3% or 4%.Also read: ‘Free’ mask, Rs 200 fine in Mumbai for rule violators: BMCMumbai is testing anywhere between 12,000 to 19,000 samples every day. BMC, however, maintains its RT-PCR testing capacity is around 15,000 samples a day.Civic officials also claim that the actual number of RT-PCR tests has not dropped drastically, although the ratio may have changed, and that every symptomatic citizen testing negative via rapid antigen kits was made to undergo RT-PCR test. Its data substantiates the claim.In 30 days of September, 2.42 lakh tests were performed using RT-PCR and 1.09 lakh using rapid antigen kits. In 31 days of October, the number of RT-PCR tests went up to 2.43 lakh, with 1.64 lakh rapid antigen kits. However, in November (up to November 29) the number of RT-PCR went down to 1.97 lakh, compared to 1.62 lakh rapid antigen kits.Mumbai recorded 58,195 cases and 1,236 deaths in September; 50,006 cases and 1,281 deaths in October, followed by 25,052 cases and 535 deaths in November (up to November 29).Also read: Covid-19 situation under control, need to watch till mid-December: Mumbai civic bodySuresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “There is no change in the testing strategy of the BMC. RT-PCR still remains the gold standard, and we are scaling up our capacity of conducting RT-PCR tests. But the overall positivity rate of RT-PCR kits has also gone down to 10-12% now; this was much higher two or three months ago, which helps in reducing the overall positivity rate.”Kakani added, “The ratio proportion for RT-PCR tests may have gone down, but there is no huge fall. We are constantly increasing testing, if you see the overall data. However, in the past two months, a lot of curbs have been lifted. Due to this, we need instant results and rapid antigen kits are preferred. We have set up free testing centres, and are conducting free testing for hawkers, BEST bus drivers and other citizens that have multiple contacts, including passengers coming from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and Goa. Even here, symptomatic citizens testing negative in rapid antigen kits are being tested via RT-PCR.”Overall, since February 3, over 18.96 lakh samples have been tested, of which, according to BMC, 30% are using rapid antigen kits, as of November 29.The testing figures have drastically increased in the city post July 7, when the BMC liberalised testing.Due to this, any citizen irrespective of being symptomatic or not can get tested for Covid-19. The one-lakh-test mark was crossed on May 6, four lakh on July 14, five lakh on July 29, eight lakh on September 3, and the 10 lakh on September 22. In the next two weeks, Mumbai is set to cross the 20 lakh mark.Also read: Mumbai civic body records 3% positivity rate at free Covid-19 testing centresExperts feel the BMC should focus both on increasing Mumbai’s testing and also ensuring a balance between RT-PCR and rapid antigen kits testing in order to handle the positivity rate and fatality rate better.Dr Rahul Pandit of Fortis Hospital, a member of Covid-19 task force of Maharashtra, said, “As a member of the task force, I strongly feel that maximum testing should be done using the RT-PCR method. Rapid antigen kits should only be used on patients who are in the hospital with symptoms of Covid-19. Rapid antigen kits cannot be used for the general public. However, in Mumbai, the rapid antigen kits ratio at times is around 45-55%, which should not be the case.”Dr Om Shrivastava, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said, “I feel we should test 10 to 30 times behind every positive case. For example, if we are saying on Monday, the city had around 600 cases, we should be testing at least 25,000 samples daily.”Another member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, Dr Shashank Joshi, said, “The ratio of rapid antigen testing went up because Mumbai’s capacity to test using RT-PCR method saturated. We need to add more RT-PCR testing facilities in Mumbai. That is the reason why the ratio of RT-PCR to rapid antigen appears to have changed over September, October and November.”“We need to continue testing as we unlock more so that we diagnose and treat faster quicker and reduce our test positivity rate and improve our case fatality rate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-in-mumbai-bmc-conducting-more-antigen-tests-than-rt-pcr/story-sm8uKhLT6XaqZ5kdFnq0II.html
03-12-2020||Delhi||More DU Colleges come forward to help students in distress amid Covid-19 pandemic||After St Stephen’s College set up a Covid-19 Resilience Fund to support tuition fees of underprivileged pupils, a few other colleges and their alumni associations in Delhi University (DU) have stepped up measures to help students facing financial constraints due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Old Students Association (OSA) of Hindu College has decided to help students facing challenges in paying their fees. In a statement issued on Friday, Ravi Burman, president of the association said, “The pandemic has created major problems for students from the economically weaker sections and they are facing a huge challenge in paying the college annual fees. The Old Students Association (OSA), Hindu College, has decided to help such students, whose family annual income is below Rs 5 lakh, with a one-time study grant to cover their annual college fees up to rupees twenty thousand only.”Earlier on November 24, St Stephen’s had announced a fund to support tuition fees of 50-100 students facing financial constraints due to the pandemic and urged present students and alumni to donate for the cause.There have been demands for financial support to students from economically weaker families across DU colleges in the wake of the recent death by suicide of a student of Lady Shri Ram College (LSR) due to financial distress and the pressure of online education earlier this month. Hindu College Principal Anju Srivastava issued a statement saying, “All donations intended for the benefit of the students of the College or any other activity or purpose in the College should be through cheques in the name of the Principal, Hindu College, Delhi and sent to the College Office.The College channelises all such assistance through its Students Aid Fund committee.”“The college invites applications from needy students and, on the basis of complete data made available by individual students to the College, takes informed and considered decisions to help all the needy students taking into account the total funds available for this purpose. It goes without saying that with additional funds, the College would be able to meet the financial need of a larger number of applicants,” the statement read.Janaki Devi Memorial College started helping some students in distress with unutilised students’ fees from the last academic session. Principal Swati Pal said the college has a robust system to help students from economically weaker sections. “The number of students who need help has increased this year due to the pandemic. So, the college felt the need to increase the amount we generally use to give fee waiver to students every year. We decided to use some amount of money collected as students’ fees last year and lying unutilised for the purpose. It is students’ money and should only be used to help students. So, around Rs 3 lakh has been added to our students’ assistance fund. Now, the amount we usually give to students has substantially increased,” she said.Rajdhani College has also come up with the initiative named “uthhan”, under which it sends study material through speed post to students who are unable able to access online education. The college has so far helped over 350 students living in different parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/more-du-colleges-come-forward-to-help-students-in-distress-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-T84eIKJZMxDXS1KoOMtRCL.html
