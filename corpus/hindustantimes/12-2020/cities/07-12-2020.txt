07-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Two more arrested in connection with competitive exam racket||Noida: Police on Monday arrested two more suspects in connection with a racket involving impersonators of candidates for various government recruitment exams. The suspects were identified as Wazir Sangwan, 35, a resident of Dadri and his accomplice Pawan Yadav, 40, a resident of Rewari in Haryana. Sangwan ran a coaching centre in Dadri and lured candidates to get jobs through fraudulent means, the police said. Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Zone 1, said that on November 28, Sector 58 police had arrested nine suspects, including two constables of Delhi Police, for their involvement in the racket. He said that there was an examination for recruitment of Delhi police constables at a centre in Noida Sector 62. “The exam coordinator informed police that they have found some suspects impersonating in the examination,” he said. A police team immediately rushed to the spot and arrested three suspects – Arpit, Dinesh Chaudhury and Aman from the exam centre. During interrogation, they revealed that they were members of a gang impersonating in exam for money. “Based on their interrogation details, the police arrested six others – Dinesh Joshi, constable Ravindra Kumar, constable Manjeet Singh, Shiv Kumar , Mukesh and Sonu from outside the exam centre,” Rajesh said. The DCP said that during interrogation, the suspects had revealed that Dinesh Joshi used to run the gang with the help of other suspects. One accomplice Ravi is said to be an income tax officer in Delhi while another Arvind Jogi is an assistant section officer and awaiting his joining, the police said. Rajnish Verma, assistant commissioner of police, Noida zone 2, said that so far the gang claimed to have placed over 100 candidates in government jobs. “We have traced 15 candidates who have got jobs through fraudulent means. We will write to the concerned department to take action against them,” he said. The gang members used to charge Rs 10-20 lakh from each student for their recruitment. Verma said that the gang members used a mobile app to doctor the applicant’s photo and produce new photo which matches with the impersonator. “The suspects used the doctored photo for application and then used a forged ID to appear in the exams as impersonators,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-two-more-arrested-in-connection-with-competitive-exam-racket/story-9snf1iErFVJe7UNiK5F3rN.html
07-12-2020||Mumbai||Money laundering case: Shiv Sena MLA’s close aide sent to ED custody till December 9||A special court set up to try cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on Monday remanded Amit Chandole, a close aide of Shiv Sena member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Pratap Sarnaik, to the custody of Enforcement Directorate (ED) till December 9, for further interrogation in a money laundering case.ED was given Chandole’s custody after a single bench of the Bombay high court (HC) set aside the order of a holiday court which had earlier rejected ED’s plea to extend his custody and had instead remanded him to judicial custody. ED had later approached the HC to set aside the holiday court’s order. Justice Prithviraj K Chavan observed, “Having taken into consideration the totality of the facts and circumstances, I am of the considered view that the learned Additional Sessions Judge holding charge of the holiday court has not exercised his jurisdiction with due application of mind and approached to the matter in a very casual manner. I am mindful of the fact that the liberty of an individual is of paramount importance. However, at the same time, a balance needs to be struck between an individual’s right as well as there should be no prejudice to the free, fair and full investigation. Material placed on record, prima facie indicates complicity and nexus of respondent No.2 (Chandole) in the alleged crime.” The court then directed the sessions court to rehear the matter at 3pm. ED through additional solicitor-general Anil Singh had submitted that the three-day remand granted by the sessions court on November 26 was insufficient as both Saturday and Sunday were non-working days, and the investigating agency could not go through the vast amount of records which included computer data, bank accounts and various other transactions and communications by Chandole with regards to the amount which his account was credited with from the Topsgrup Security firm. In October, a former employee of the security agency had lodged a complaint alleging that Chandole was the recipient of a large chunk of payments made by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to the security agency for providing security personnel. Chandole’s counsel advocate Rizwan Merchant had, however, opposed the revision application of the ED before the HC and argued that there was no perversity in the sessions courts order and it was a well-reasoned order. Merchant had argued that because the ED had failed to provide any incriminating evidence against Chandole’s complicity in the transactions the revision application was not maintainable under section 19 (1) of the PML Act which was invoked to book Chandole. The case against Chandole was registered based on an October 15 complaint by Ramesh Iyer a former employee of Tops Security Group. Iyer has alleged that Chandole was the beneficiary of a 2014 contract between the Tops group and MMRDA. The contract was for the supply of security guards and some part of the amount paid by MMRDA went to private accounts of Chandole. ED has claimed that from the investigation conducted so far it appears that Topsgrup obtained the contract from MMRDA in collusion with Pratap Sarnaik through illegal means by a well thought out strategy. These illegal manoeuvres aimed to get additional inadmissible benefit by inflating the bills at the cost of MMRDA and illegal cash gratification to Sarnaik for facilitating this scam. Against this active role and criminal conspiracy, Sarnaik used to get 50% profit earned out of the said contract through Chandole. Corroborating this sequence of events, Chandole accepted receipt of cash from Topsgrup. The billing was done by Tops Group by inflating the number of contracted security guards deployed. Therefore, part of the amount received by Topsgrup from MMRDA appears to be proceeds of crime. The 50% profit of the said contract was being shared by Topsgrup with Sarnaik through Chandole and sometimes, through bank transfer to the account of a third person. In such a way, Chandole appears to be the recipient of proceeds of crime fraudulently obtained by Topsgrup from MMRDA, ED alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/money-laundering-case-shiv-sena-mla-s-close-aide-sent-to-ed-custody-till-december-9/story-JI42N306PXKvsXaSOtor6N.html
07-12-2020||City||Fire at Ulhasnagar hospital, 16 patients shifted at night||A fire was reported at the Maxilife Hospital at Shantinagar in Ulhasnagar on Sunday night, forcing 16 patients to be shifted to neighbouring hospitals. According to fire brigade officers of the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC), the blaze broke out in the intensive care unit (ICU) on the first floor of the two-storey building, around 9.30pm.Ten Covid-19 patients and six non-Covid patients were shifted to other hospitals after the fire broke out due to a short circuit that led to a minor explosion in the air conditioner (AC) in the ICU.Three fire tenders were sent to the hospital. “No one was injured in the incident. The fire had, however, affected the machines and other properties inside the hospital,” said a fire officer of UMC. “The blaze was controlled with the help of the fire system inside the hospital. However, there were a lot of fumes, and the patients had to be shifted. Primarily, it is suspected that the circuit in the AC caused the blaze,” said Dr Jafar Ahmad Ansari, chief executive director of Maxilife Hospital.An 80-year-old Covid-19 patient who was shifted from Maxilife Hospital to Optilife Hospital in Dombivli had to be placed on a ventilator. His son claimed that the patient was not provided with oxygen while being shifted. “My father was admitted at the Maxilife Hospital a week ago after he tested positive for Covid-19. He was on oxygen support. He was shifted to another hospital in Dombivli on Sunday night due to the fire incident. We didn’t know where he was shifted and searched for him at five different hospitals. When we reached the Dombivli hospital, they asked us to pay ₹1 lakh,” said Dinesh Pulwani, son of the patient. However, after taking up the issue with the authorities, the hospital waves the ventilator charges. UMC commissioner Raja Dayanidhi said, “We had informed the war room to ensure the patients get admission in hospitals. One patient had complained about the Dombivli hospital, for which we contacted the person and also made alternative arrangements at a government hospital in Bhiwandi. The matter was resolved, and only pharmacy bills will be incurred by them for now.” Dr Sudarshan Patil from Optilife Hospital said that the whole issue was a misunderstanding. “We have provided admission to the patient on Sunday night. There was a misunderstanding regarding the patient, which was cleared and admission was given on time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fire-at-ulhasnagar-hospital-16-patients-shifted-at-night/story-xhnUVvELLJIyV5nSeiI89H.html
07-12-2020||Gurugram||Air very poor, fog to persist||Air quality in the city remained “very poor” on Monday, recording 357 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin, in the same range recorded a day prior, when an AQI of 325 was recorded on Sunday. Dense fog was also observed in the morning hours, but visibility information was not available for Gurugram on Monday.Despite the slight deterioration in air quality, Gurugram remained the least polluted city in the National Capital Region on Monday, followed by Faridabad, which recorded an AQI of 388. Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida, meanwhile, all recorded “severe” air, with AQI of 400 or more. As per official forecasts, air quality over the region is expected to improve over the next five days, with northwesterly winds between eight to ten kilometres per hour expected to prevail. Monday’s early air quality warning bulletin for Delhi-NCR stated, “Air quality is likely to improve but remain in very poor category 08.12.2020 and 09.12.2020.” As per the central control room for air quality management in Delhi, Gurugram’s predicted AQI for December 8 is 296, which would be in the “poor” level.“As we have been seeing throughout the past few weeks, Gurugram is benefitting from the direction of the wind, which originates in the west and transports pollutants eastward. If you look at Manesar, which lies even further west of Delhi than Gurugram, the air quality there is slightly better. Whereas Ghaziabad and Noida, which lie to the east, are seeing worse air quality,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist. While Manesar recorded an AQI of 318 on Monday, Ghaziabad and Noida recorded AQIs of 438 and 422, respectively. Gurugram’s minimum temperature settled at 13.7 degrees Celsius on Monday, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Palam observatory, which, according to the MeT department officials, gives a fairly accurate reading of the city’s weather. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 24 degrees Celsius, four degrees below the normal. The IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) did not record the city’s minimum temperature on Tuesday. As per the weekly IMD forecast, dense fog is expected to prevail on Tuesday while the temperature will hover in a similar range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-very-poor-fog-to-persist/story-lIpe92Z6hqL7k0ip13hEwI.html

07-12-2020||Gurugram||Govt says it followed rules in seeking Aadhaar details from parents||As the Haryana government continued to face flak from citizens over making Aadhaar details mandatory for the Family ID scheme, a Delhi-based organisation on data privacy wrote to the government stating that the move was against the Supreme Court (SC) judgment on privacy and the Aadhar Act. The Haryana government defended itself by saying that it had followed all rules while requesting the data. The Family ID scheme or Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP) scheme, first introduced last year, is a massive data collection exercise for efficient delivery of various services, such as title deeds and driving licences, and devising public policy based on the demography and other data points. At the time, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had said Aadhaar details would only be voluntary. It was made mandatory in April this year.Last week, HT had reported that the state government had issued circulars to parents requesting the data. The scheme will include services like title deeds, driving license among others under one umbrella. However, the parents said they were apprehensive of sharing such personal information. “The step by the Haryana government to make Aadhaar mandatory for PPP registration is not valid. It violates the apex court judgement (Puttaswamy case of 2017). Instead, they should accept other government verification documents,” said Prasanth Sugathan, legal director, Software Freedom Law Centre, who wrote to the state government on December 3 opposing the move. In the Puttuswamy case, the Supreme Court held that privacy was a fundamental right and in the Aadhar case, it allowed the unique ID to be made mandatory only for filing income tax returns and government subsidies. Sugathan said the move comes at a time when there is no law for data protection yet. “The PPP violates the SC judgement that clearly stated there must be a law to justify encroachment on privacy. In case of PPP, there is no legislation governing data collection and processing. Linking every scheme and service to the scheme will lead to de-facto imposition of the scheme and collection of Aadhaar details ,” said Sugathan.The PPP scheme is expected to cover almost 6 million people.Currently, three schemes – disability pension, old age allowance and widow pension – are already linked with the scheme. Sofia Dahiya, secretary of the Citizen Resources Information Department (CRID) and also the finance secretary, the state was not violating any Supreme Court ruling. “Under section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, the state can ask for Aadhaar as a proof of authentication so long as the state issues a notification, which we have done,” said Dahiya. In the last nine months, the state government issued two notifications linking government schemes with PPP, as well as industries and its labour under it. “Within six months to one year, Family ID will be linked with every government service and scheme. It has been made mandatory for marriage registration recently,” said Dahiya.She said that information is collected only after people’s consent. “Many a times, people submit wrong details, therefore the data is being electronically verified to be sure whether the data is correct or not. Once all the collected data is verified, it will freeze,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/govt-says-it-followed-rules-in-seeking-aadhaar-details-from-parents/story-7vxtCCH5OFYlgZlDn0to6O.html

07-12-2020||Noida||Dense fog likely to engulf open areas, expressways||Noida: Dense to moderate fog engulfed open areas in Noida and its neighbouring areas, including expressways, during the morning hours on Monday.According to experts, due to the three major favourable conditions responsible for this phenomenon – low wind, high humidity and low temperatures – foggy conditions will continue for the next three days and subdue by around December 15. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), visibility at several parts across the National Capital Region came down to less than 10 metres – a condition seen under very dense fog, and will continue for the next two days. “Humidity in the morning hours is quite high, and on Monday it touched 100%, leading to dense fog in the morning, especially between 5am to 8am. The dense fog condition will continue for another two days which will sharply reduce visibility,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. On Monday morning, one person died while 30 others were injured in three separate road accidents at Yamuna Expressway, Eastern Peripheral Expressway and Salarpur underpass, all within Dankaur in Greater Noida, due to dense fog. All the three incidents took place between 2am and 7am. According to weather analysts, while dense city areas will not see much fog, open areas especially roads near a water body or open fields, highways and expressways will see heavy fog. “Currently the city is seeing variable winds, which are sometimes easterly and sometimes north-westerly. The humidity is high, the temperatures are low, around 10 degrees, and the wind speed at the morning and night hours is almost nil. This makes for a perfect recipe for fog,” said Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecasting centre Skymet. He added that the conditions for very-dense fog will continue till December 8 or 9. On December 10, he said fog could be moderate, but another western disturbance will lead to light rains on December 11, which will further increase humidity and lead to very dense fog on December 12 and 13. On Monday, the minimum temperature for Noida city was recorded at 14.2 degrees Celsius, against 15 degrees a day earlier. The humidity for the city areas – Sector 62 where the automatic weather station is located – was found oscillating between 97 and 68%, while in most parts of NCR, the humidity oscillated between 100 and 79%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/dense-fog-likely-to-engulf-open-areas-expressways/story-ZSufP7mczW25MalF39GExI.html
07-12-2020||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad most polluted cities in country, remain ‘severe’ for fourth day||Noida: The air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad worsened on Monday due to high humidity that trapped pollutants. While Ghaziabad remained the most polluted city in the country, Noida and Greater Noida tied for the second position. Noida and Ghaziabad’s air remained ‘severe’ for the fourth day, while Greater Noida that showed some improvement on Sunday and slipped into ‘very poor’ category entered the ‘severe’ zone again on Monday. The pollution monitoring agencies stated that though intrusion of smoke from stubble burning in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana is negligible, the humidity levels soared to 100% making air heavier and trapping the pollutants. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, on Monday, out of 108 cities across the nation, only five cities – Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Bulandshahr and Kanpur – were under ‘severe’ category. The air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Monday was 422 against 402 a day earlier, both ‘severe’, as per the CPCB data. Similarly, Ghaziabad continued being top most polluted city of country for the fourth day in row with an AQI of 438 against 428 a day earlier. Greater Noida’s air quality worsened from ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ again with Monday seeing an AQI of 422 against 396 a day earlier. AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the wind speed increased on Monday and will continue to increase slightly on Tuesday as well. However, the directions are variable and humidity will be high as well, IMD said. “The wind speed on Monday was 10kmph, against 8kmph a day earlier. The direction was north-westerly but it will variable and keep changing for next two days. The humidity will also remain high due to which ventilation may remain low,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. The fine particles or PM2.5 levels also remained five to six times the safe standards, the CPCB data showed. PM2.5 for past 24 hours in Noida was recorded at 293.76 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³) against 259.43 µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 298.70 µg/m³ against 255.12 a day earlier, while for Ghaziabad it was 289.68 µg/m³ against 309.43 a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 µg/m³. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), AQI is likely to recover slightly on Tuesday. “Surface winds are forecasted to increase and air quality is likely to improve during the day but within the very poor category. Due to marginally better ventilation conditions, AQI is likely to further improve tomorrow. AQI is likely to stay in the middle-end of the very poor category on 9th and 10th December,” said the SAFAR statement on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-ghaziabad-most-polluted-cities-in-country-remain-severe-for-fourth-day/story-P1iNAuIY77h8UMRGE1EKyL.html
07-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Gangster Kumar Pillai, other accused acquitted in 2013 extortion case||The special court under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) on Monday acquitted Kumar Pillai and other accused in connection with an extortion case registered in 2013 by a former member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) in Vikhroli. Pillai’s lawyer Mahesh Mule said that Pillai was acquitted for want of evidence. In all, the prosecution had examined 32 witnesses, but the court held that the prosecution failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubts. As per the prosecution case, Pillai, while he was abroad, had called the complainant, a builder from Vikroli and brother of a former MNS MLA on July 11, 2013. The prosecution alleged that Pillai had demanded a total of ₹75 lakhs extortion to continue the redevelopment project in Vikroli.A month later on August 18, 2013, the prosecution claimed that Pillai’s man, Kiran Dhanawade, approached the builder at his residence. Dhanawade, who was later arrested, threatened the builder to kill him if he failed to pay the ransom within 48 hours. The builder, however, approached Vikroli police. Pillai fled from the country in 1990 after jumping the bail granted to him. He was extradited from Singapore to India in June 2016.

07-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai coastal road construction will be completed by July 2023 as project delayed due court case, Covid-19||The coastal road project will be completed by July 2023 instead of October 2022, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The delay is due to a court-ordered stay in 2019 and the lockdown this year. Vijay Nighot, chief engineer of the coastal road project, said, “We lost eight months due to the court case that had stayed construction of the project in 2019, and we lost out on an additional six months due to the lockdown. However, during the lockdown, we did not completely stop construction work. So instead of October 2022, the work will be completed by July 2023.”The 10.58km coastal road will connect Nariman Point to Bandra Worli Sea Link. Twin tunnels of 2.07km will connect Girgaum chowpatty and Malabar Hill. Each underground tunnel will have three lanes at a depth of 70 metres. The cost of the project is ₹8,429 crore, of which ₹1,300 crore have been spent till date.At present, BMC has completed 20% of the construction, instead of the expected 30%. By December 2021, 55% of the work should be complete; and by December 2022, 85% of the work should be complete.BMC is presently assembling the tunnel boring machine (TBM) at Priyadarshini Park in Malabar Hill. Imported from China in May 2020 and assembled here, it is the country’s largest TBM, with a diameter of 12.9 metres. The cutter head (which digs through the ground) will be assembled in the coming week and boring work will start by the end of December.A senior civic official said associated with the project said the first 600 metres of the tunnel on the Malabar Hill side requires digging through basalt rock that is five to six times the density of rocks generally used in construction projects. “Then [after 600m] the rock gets weaker. So the TBM will be able to do six to eight metres of excavation per day,” said the officer. The tunnelling work will take approximately 18 months to complete. Once the coastal road is completed, Mumbai will have an addition of 7.7km of a seafront pedestrian promenade, between Priyadarshini Park and Haji Ali, and Haji Ali and Worli, which will be 20 metres wide and accessible by 14 pedestrian underpasses. Nighot said, “Pedestrians will have to walk a maximum of 40 to 45 metres to access this seafront promenade.” BMC will reclaim a total of 111 hectares (ha) for the project, of which 65ha have been reclaimed so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-coastal-road-construction-will-be-completed-by-july-2023-as-project-delayed-due-court-case-covid-19/story-7WbK3ko3RtxJpekW4cZWwI.html

A study regarding passenger traffic and movement on railway platforms and entry and exit gates was conducted by the Western Railway (WR) in October. The railway is now awaiting a final nod from its headquarters to install flap gates at Churchgate railway station as a pilot project. “It is in the initial phase of discussions. We are also planning to introduce the gates at Andheri railway station. Detailed study and inspection of passenger movement, along with an evaluation of passengers heading towards Metro stations will also be looked into,” said a senior WR official.Central Railway (CR) is planning to introduce the flap gates at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT).In order to streamline passenger traffic and avoid overcrowding outside railway stations and on platforms, the railways are looking into introducing a limited number of gates initially.Passenger associations believe that the concept of flap gates at suburban railway stations is likely to fail due to the number of commuters who travel daily, especially during the morning and evening peak hours. “The gates will be of no use at local train stations because 80 lakh passengers travel daily on the CR and WR lines. It will be impossible to inspect, open and close the flap gates as it can lead to overcrowding outside the railway stations. The only way to control crowd movement is to implement changes in office timings of private and government offices,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.Presently, the flap gates with quick-response (QR) codes have been set up at CSMT at the outstation entrance of the railway terminus. However, passengers can also enter through the P D’Mello entrance that does not have flap gates installed. Passengers have to display the QR code generated on their e-tickets at the entry points of the station for the validation of their tickets. The tickets will be generated through the Indian Rail Catering Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website. Those purchasing tickets from the booking windows will receive QR codes on their mobile phones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/railways-mulls-setting-up-flap-gates-at-mumbai-s-andheri-churchgate-ltt-stations/story-xDiJZ5ETpM2eFhH6MguRKI.html

07-12-2020||Chandigarh||For unstoppable Karandeep Kochhar, the next stop is Olympics||As professional golf in India resumed in the first week of November after seven-and-a-half months following the Covid-19 lockdown, there was no stopping Chandigarh’s Karandeep Kochhar. He started the season with a second place finish and then won back-to-back, triumphing again on Monday at the Rs 1.5 crore Jeev Milkha Singh Invitational 2020 at Chandigarh Golf Club.The win at the tournament presented by TAKE Sports made him richer by Rs 24.24 lakhs and placed him at the number one position in the PGTI (Professional Golf Tour of India) order of merit. His world ranking too improved from 442 to 355. The way Kochhar played proved his class, pointing to sterling performances ahead. On the way to the title he got the better of seasoned golfer and former Asian number one Anirban Lahiri in a playoff that stretched to the next day, a first in PGTI history. “There were lots of ups and downs during the tournament, especially the one stroke penalty that was imposed on me yesterday. But eventually, everything ended well and I am very happy that I won the tournament,” Kochhar said after the win.‘Upset because of penalty issue’“Yesterday, because of the penalty issue, I was really upset. I couldn’t sleep properly and even woke up early. It did affect me a lot and even now after I have won the tournament, it’s going through my mind. It got ugly and I didn’t want it to happen. But at the end of the day, it shows my mental strength. I am ready to face any adversities and give my best even in tough conditions,” he added.Kochhar began the tournament on a disappointing note with four-over-76 and was tied 76th after round one. But then he made a grand comeback with his next three rounds of 66, 67 and 68 to end up in a playoff with pre-tournament favourite Lahiri after both totalled 11-under-277 for the week.Both Kochhar (76-66-67-68) and Lahiri (70-68-70-69) were in a deadlock after being tied at the end of the first two playoff holes on Sunday. The match was then extended to Monday as light faded and Kochhar made a birdie on four-par hole to win the tournament.‘Jeev sir asked me to believe in myself’“Yesterday evening after the penalty issue I had a word with Jeev (Chiranjeev Milkha Singh) sir and he told me to believe in myself no matter what the situation. It means a great deal to me having made such a good comeback after starting with a 76. It adds to my confidence. Winning two events in a row is special and I feel I can continue this winning spree further at the next event at Jamshedpur as I’m playing the best golf of my life right now,” Kochhar added. “Now as per the latest world rankings, two Indians are ahead of me. I will try to improve my ranking in the next couple of months and making it to the Olympics is my next target. Hopefully, the way things are moving, I might be able to play at the world’s highest sporting arena.”Grandfather’s dreamKochhar took up golf early in life to quickly become the top ranked player in the age group categories in the amateur circuit. He also won the 116th All-India Amateur Championship in December 2016, before turning professional.His elated grandfather, Dr GS Kochhar, who was present at the golf course, said, “I got a US kid golf set from Australia for Karandeep when he was three and told him to hit the balls in our backyard. Since then he is into the sport. In the age group tournaments he did really well and was among the top ranked in the country. But when at the age of 17 years and four months he became the first amateur and the youngest Indian to win the PGTI title, we decided to choose golf over academies for him.” “Karandeep’s life revolves around golf and I want to see him playing and winning the world’s top professional tournaments,” beamed Dr Kochhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/for-unstoppable-karandeep-kochhar-the-next-stop-is-olympics/story-d8ouJ5ihKSibdwFf7JxBQI.html

That application was reviewed and I was approached and I have given my consent. However, I have not received an official order. Paperwork is awaited,” said advocate Shishir Hiray.With a belief that major players have been arrested; the police are now planning to go after the distributors of the massive quantity of drugs that have been sold. Of the 132kg drugs produced at Ranjangoan MIDC, and at least 15kg drugs produced at Karjat and Raigad, only 20kg was recovered by the police. The remaining is believed to have been sold throughout the lockdown months, according to commissioner Krishna Prakash of Pimpri Chinchwad police.“The burettes, pipettes, chemical flasks that have been seized from these factories have been sent for chemical analysis at the Forensic Science Laboratory. A forensic audit will be conducted in order to track the financial dealings of the drugs’ sale while cyber experts have also been roped in by the police for technical analysis in the case, according to commissioner Prakash.The police have also found that the men involved had found places in Gujarat to expand their operation. The sale of the produced drugs is believed to have reached into multiple states of the country.“After the initial bust, the arrests and recovery were done and dusted. Everything that followed was technical analysis of the case. The Nigerian man who, along with Afzal, was one of the top distributors, did not co-operate. Plus, much time had already passed so the people involved were aware and on the run. Our teams were working day and night. In Vadodara, where Arvind was arrested, our officials were dressed in a burqa to avoid detection,” said Sudhir Hiremath, deputy commissioner of police, crime, Pimpri-Chinchwad police. As the six men arrested last have been remanded to police custody until December 18, the police are expecting more updates from other districts in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/appointment-of-spp-likely-police-to-go-after-distributors-buyers-of-md-racket/story-Z80Dy3IFUzk4UpMJeBX9CM.html

The police lobbed tear gas shells and used water cannons to stop BJP workers and leaders from moving towards Uttar Kanya, the state secretariat in north Bengal, violating prohibitory orders under Section 144 Code of Criminal Procedure. The police also used a pink dye in the water to mark the agitators. The government accused them of resorting to violence and arson. The rally was part of the BJP’s ongoing agitation programmes against the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in the run-up to the assembly polls due early next year. BJP’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, national secretary Arvind Menon, state president Dilip Ghosh and several Lok Sabha members took part in the rally. Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) national president and Bangalore South Lok Sabha member Tejasvi Surya and state BJYM president Saumitra Khan fell ill after inhaling tear gas. The party said 40 workers, including six women, were injured.To mark its protest, the BJP will observe a 12-hour bandh on Tuesday in the north Bengal districts where it won seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Also read: Bharat Bandh - All you need to know about services that may be affectedBJP workers held agitations in Nadia, East Burdwan, Howrah, Kolkata and several other districts on Monday evening. Senior party leaders also met governor Jagdeep Dhankhar in Kolkata and demanded a judicial probe into the death of Ulen Rai, 50, a BJP worker from Gajoldoba in Jalpaiguri district. He died at a private hospital shortly after sustaining an injury in the chest. There was confusion over the cause of his death. While some BJP leaders claimed that he was hit by police batons, others said he was shot with a pellet gun. “Today in Siliguri, serious acts of violence were committed by the supporters of a political party during their protest program. They resorted to arson, brick-batting, firing and vandalism of govt property. Police showed restraint and didn’t do lathicharge or used firearms. Only water cannons and tear gas were used to disperse the violent crowd. However, death of a person has been reported. Body is being sent for PM (post mortem examination). The actual cause of death will be known only after the PM,” the West Bengal Police tweeted in the evening. Governor Dhankhar reacted sharply to the tweet of the state police.“Am stunned and shocked at this judgmental stance @WBPolice. With such a finding recorded and disseminated in public domain there can be no semblance of fair investigation @MamataOfficial ! Alarming scenario: Political neutrality being thrown to winds for political hatchet work,” the governor tweeted around 9 pm.Earlier in the evening, he tweeted, “Political violence @MamataOfficial is a cause of alarming concern as it poses threat to democracy. Administration and police @WBPolice must desist from partisan stance and act in political neutral manner. Level playing field to opposition can’t be left to mercy of police.”Also read: India speeding up review of Pfizer, Astra Covid-19 vaccines BJP and BYJM workers, who were leading two processions from opposite directions, were spotted pelting stones at the police when they were stopped from moving towards Uttar Kanya.The clashes took place in at least four places, including Tinbatti More and Phoolbari Bazar. Several women in the processions fell ill after inhaling the tear gas. “In no state will you see the government crushing a peaceful democratic movement in this manner. Constitutional experts need to take a note of this,” Surya said after the violence. “Most of our leaders and party workers were stopped by the police at different locations so that we could not join the processions. Barricades were set up at 52 locations,” said state BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu who accompanied Dilip Ghosh. “The incident was a public display of the violence the BJP believes in. Its workers provoked the police to open fire. I thank the police for handling the situation. The BJP will fail to create disturbance in the state,” said Saugata Roy, TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson.The BJYM workers vandalized two steel and bamboo barricades and a police outpost. They also set two bamboo barricades on fire. Journalists covering the rally were caught in the middle when BJYM workers showered stones at the Rapid Action Force of the district police. “Every party has the right to carry out agitations. However, I cannot say what prompted the police to fire tear gas shells,” said state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury. Tuesday’s violence was similar to the one witnessed in and around Kolkata on October 8 when as many as 24 BJP leaders, including Vijayvargiya and Menon, were booked by the Kolkata Police for violating Central guidelines on gatherings and political rallies during the Covid-19 pandemic and marching towards Nabanna, the secretariat in the adjoining Howrah district.The BJYM organised the ‘Nabanna Chalo’ (march to Nabanna) programme to raise voice on issues ranging from alleged lack of employment opportunities in Bengal to law and order problems. BJP and BJYM leaders claimed that around 1,500 workers were injured during the baton charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-worker-dies-as-bengal-police-goes-tough-to-stop-siliguri-rally-party-calls-bandh/story-h6KiC1CaxwiUIcSTCascKN.html

As the opposition parties and farmer unions have been asking the JJP to withdraw support to the BJP government, Chautala said there was no need to quit and that all the MLAs are supporting the farmers. “The resignation is not a solution to the issues raised by the farmers and such a step will only invite fresh elections, resulting in wastage of public money,” he said.Stating that the farmers and khaps are most important for the JJP, Chautala said not only the 90 Haryana MLAs and the Union government but also the khaps, 36 biradari (communities) and all sarv samaj in Haryana stand with the farmers and are praying for speedy solution of all issues. “We respect khap’s decision and accept it,” he said, pointing out that senior party leaders along with deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala have been consistently in touch with the Union ministers and advocating the case of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/all-party-mlas-stand-in-solidarity-with-farmers-jjp/story-njjBGmGgHdcrLHpV2qzM1N.html

The JJP and independent MLAs will have to choose between the farmers and the BJP government. In these exceptional circumstances, the governor should call a special session while discharging his constitutional responsibilities,” Hooda said.“ The demands of farmers are completely valid and the government should accept them without any delay. It is the responsibility of every government to ensure that the farmers get MSP for their crops,” he added.Hooda also extended his support to the ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by protesting farmers, appealing to the people to hold peaceful agitations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-protest-hooda-writes-to-haryana-governor-demands-special-assembly-session/story-rDWXaTc1UIwzofhj73vRLM.html

Right from the transportation, to vegetable and milk supply, banking and food grains at Market Yard are likely to be affected. The Federation of Traders Association of Pune (FTAP) has decided to support the strike but will keep the shops open. “For various demands of farmers several farmer organisations and political parties have called for a nationwide strike on Tuesday and we fully support it. At the same time, traders and shop owners have suffered financially during the lockdown period and so a majority of them don’t want to close the shops. All our traders and shop owners will support the strike tomorrow but keep shops open,” said Fatechand Ranka president of the association. Baba Shinde, president, goods and passenger transport association, said, “Our organisation is supporting the strike and so all the goods transport vehicles will be off the road. No transport will be done in the state by our trucks and trolleys and it will be a complete shut down.” On other hand, there is a mixed response to the strike from the Market Yard area - there are three different markets here – food grains market, fruits and flower market and vegetables. Of these, the food grain market will be completely shut to support the strike. While other two markets, fruits, and flowers, and vegetables, will remain open depending upon supply. Popatlal Oswal, president, Poona Merchants Chamber said, “We are going to participate in the nationwide strike on Tuesday and all the traders at the food- grain market will be closed for the day.” Public transportation will operate in the city as autorickshaw unions, private and app-based taxis, PMPML bus services and MSRTC buses will run as per their daily schedules. A protest march will be taken out by all the supporting political parties and organisations tomorrow from Alka Talkies chowk at 10.30 am. “We will be running our daily bus operations as per routine. If there is any untoward incident, then only on that particular route the bus service will be stopped, depending on the situation,” said Ramakant Gaikwad, MSRTC Pune divisional controller.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mixed-response-to-tuesday-s-bharat-bandh-in-pune/story-PkFEWCNUNDcdUnwulLbsaO.html

07-12-2020||Chandigarh||INLD extends support to farmers’ organisations for ‘Bharat Bandh’||The Indian National Lok Dal on Monday extended its support to the ‘Bharat Bandh’ on December 8 called by farmer unions which have been protesting at the Delhi borders against the new central agri-marketing laws.Abhay Singh Chautala said his party had announced its support to the protesting farmers the day the agitation started, adding that “each and every worker of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) will fight this battle shoulder-to-shoulder to strengthen this movement so that the Centre is forced to abolish the three black laws imposed on the peasants”.“Our party has decided to extend full support to the Bharat Bandh,” he said.Chautala, younger son of INLD president and former chief minister OP Chautala, said he will visit the Tikri border on December 9 and meet the farmers and leaders leading the stir.In a statement here, the INLD leader said no farmer organisation of the country had demanded the new agricultural laws, but the central government enacted the “black farm legislations to benefit the corporates”.He reiterated his demand that the Centre withdraw these laws and guarantee minimum support price (MSP) of crops to farmers, and also make provisions of punishment for whoever buys the crop below the MSP.Chautala also appealed to all political parties that they should rise above party politics and stand with farmers to lend strength to the agitation.At a press conference here last week, Chautala had asked the Centre to immediately accept farmers demand to repeal the three farm laws, and asserted that the party was “solidly behind the farmers fighting against the three laws”.Claiming that their agitation has spread across the nation, farmer leaders, who have maintained that their protest is apolitical, have welcomed the support and urged all to come forward to make Bharat Bandh a success.After five rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmer unions failed to end the impasse, the two sides are again set to meet on December 9, a day after the countrywide strike.The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre, however, has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/inld-extends-support-to-farmers-organisations-for-bharat-bandh/story-pwyxnzMUdShfGWjiZIgdcM.html
07-12-2020||Kolkata||Bengal will never bow its head before murderers of Mahatma: Mamata Banerjee||Accusing the BJP of practising “divisive politics for its personal gains”, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday said the state, where all communities have long lived in harmony, would “never bow its head before the murderers of Mahatma Gandhi”.Banerjee, while addressing a rally in West Midnapore, slammed the BJP government at the Centre for its “arrogance and indifference” towards the plight of farmers, who had been protesting against the newly enacted agriculture laws.She contended that the central government should immediately withdraw the “anti-people” farm laws or step down.The feisty TMC boss claimed that she would rather stay in jail than “remain silent or put up with BJP’s misrule”.“We don’t believe in Bengali-non-Bengali politics.Both are our brothers and sisters. We also don’t believe in Hindu-Muslim politics, like the BJP.“The state has a long history of all communities living in harmony. The people of the state would never bow their heads before those who murdered Mahatma Gandhi,” she said, without taking any name.Iterating that the BJP was a party of “outsiders”, Banerjee said she would never allow the saffron camp to take control of Bengal, and urged the people of the state to resist any such attempt.“If goons from outside come to our state and terrorise you, all of you should put up a united fight against them. We believe in peace. We won’t allow them to have a free run here. We will never allow outsiders to take control of the state,” the chief minister maintained.Pledging her government’s support to the farmers’ agitation over the new agriculture laws, she said the BJP-led government at the Centre “should no longer continue to remain in power after sacrificing the rights of the farmers”.She claimed that the saffron party was trying to malign her government and its welfare programmes.“No matter what developmental work we do, they (BJP) will always try to malign us. But what about the Rafale scam? What about the PM CARES fund? The Centre should publish a white paper on the amount of money the PM CARES Fund has received so far,” she said.Alleging that the saffron party “threatens its opposition leaders and sends them to prison”, Banerjee said, “I am not afraid of going to jail. I would prefer going to prison to compromising with the misrule of the BJP”.Taking potshots at the CPI(M), Banerjee said, “Earlier, the CPI(M)had unleashed a reign of terror in West Midnapore. Several people were killed and were rendered homeless by CPI(M) goons. People didn’t dare to come out of their homes then.” “Junglemahal is at peace now. The guns of Maoists have fallen silent. CPI(M) goons have switched over to the BJP.Only the colour has changed,” she said.Exuding confidence of returning to power for the third consecutive time with a bigger mandate, Banerjee said the saffron camp and the CPI(M) will suffer a severe drubbing in the next assembly polls.The CM announced that her government would continue to dole out free ration beyond June next year after her party returns to power for the third consecutive time.The BJP has made deep inroads into Junglemahal -- comprising parts of West Midnapore, Jhargram, Bankura and Purulia -- during the last Lok Sabha polls, bagging five of the six parliamentary seats in the area.Elections to the 294-member West Bengal Assembly are likely to be held in April-May next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-will-never-bow-its-head-before-murderers-of-mahatma-mamata-banerjee/story-vRk7Au2BEyLFYMlwYin3WO.html

Jumbo prawns are currently priced at Rs 1,400 per kg, as compared to Rs 1,200 last week; lobsters are selling at Rs 1,300 per kg, when they were priced at Rs 1,000 per kg last week.Shamim Shaikh, who works as school teacher in Wanowrie, said, “Fish prices have gone up and there is no authority to keep prices in check. Seafood is currently going beyond the reach of the common man.” Pratik Bhoyar, a member of the Fish Wholesale Association, said, “Seafood is in demand due to winter, Covid-19 and also shortage of stocks. However, we feel that after December prices will come down to normal and buyers will not have any reason to complain.”District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said that he would look into the issue and find if any action needs to be initiated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cold-front-shortage-of-stocks-pushes-seafood-prices-up-by-20-in-pune/story-ZrQnl0Bl903Oh31BSABZEL.html

07-12-2020||Pune||Maharashtra Medical Council suspends licence of MD doctor from Pune||The Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) has suspended the licence of Dr Sireesha Mohan, MD, from Pune for allegedly letting various pathology labs in Pune district use her electronic signature without she personally seeing the reports, which according to the Council is unethical.The order issued by the MMC on December 2, says these labs are at different locations and no doctor can visit all these locations in one day. The labs are located at Lohegaon, Chakan, Dighi, Alandi, Kalewadi, Khed, Rajgurnagar and other areas in Pune district.Moreover, the MMC has found that the scanned signature of the doctor was used for routine as well as insurance claims. HT has seen the copy of the order.The order issued by the MMC also states that the enquiry in this matter started from April 30, 2019. The online hearing of the matter held on October 23, 2020, in which she was not present. As per the order, she has not responded to the allegations during the proceedings over the last year.Dr Shivkumar Utture, president, MMC, said that despite many notifications, she did not show up for the proceedings and so we had to take action against the doctor.“We have time and again taken action against pathologists who are not physically present for signing the reports. As per the Medical Council of India’s (MCI) code of ethics, pathologists cannot sign a report given by a technician. The pathologists’ has to be present to ensure that the reports are correct,” said Utture.He further added that in such cases, patients can get a false report. “Any qualified doctor views the report first and then decides the treatment modality. If the report is written by a technician and is incorrect then the patient may be given a different treatment which can prove to be harmful. Hence awareness about reports supervised and signed by pathologists is important,” he said.Dr Prasad Kulkarni of Maharashtra Association of Practicing Pathologists and Microbiologists (MAPPM) said that the local health department should verify credentials of local pathology labs and assure legal practices. Maharashtra Association of Practising Pathologists and Microbiologists has filed the complaint against Dr Mohan with the MMC.“Some other doctors are doing similar malpractice so people must confirm the availability of pathologists and then submit the sample for tests. Awareness among patients is also important to check illegal practices,” said Dr Kulkarni.Dr Mohan has refuted all the allegations and said, “I am practising since 1990. This is propaganda against me. The allegations are not true.”She said that her licence is permanent. “There is no notice updated on the MMC website regarding the case. And my name is still on the MMC website,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/maharashtra-medical-council-suspends-licence-of-md-doctor-from-pune/story-NlOhftxiUB8rUobIBuh3AO.html

07-12-2020||Mumbai||Personal finance: Don’t slip on your credit score||One of the overlooked personal finance consequences of the coronavirus pandemic that has caused an immense disruption in the economy and left many out jobs is the effect it will have on the credit score of those struggling to pay off their liabilities — loans, bills, medical expenses. However, this doesn’t have to be a long-lasting worry. With a few smart financial decisions, it is possible to rebuild a good credit profile even during a pandemic. Credit scores between 580 and 669 are deemed fair. A poor credit score can lead to credit card rejection, loan availability at high interest rates, increased premiums on insurance policies, etc. It’s a question of pivoting your financial outlook, especially during times of distress, where we may be tempted to make different choices. Prioritise debt repaymentNon-payment or late repayment can have a damaging effect on your credit score. Naveen Kukreja, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of Paisabazaar.com, an online comparison portal for personal finance products said, “Non-payment of EMIs would not just impact one’s credit score, but also hurt his/her ability to borrow in the near to medium term.” What this means is that even after income levels are restored consumers may not be able to fulfill important life goals simply because they are ineligible to avail of a loan.Get rid of credit card debtUsing credit cards to shop or to get cash can trap you in a debt-like situation. What’s more, interest rates on credit cards are high — ranging from 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent every month on average — which could add to the burden of debt. To maintain a high credit score rating, always pay off your credit card debt in full. Rohit Garg, co-founder and CEO SmartCoin, an online personal loan application site said, “With current uncertain times, you never know when you might require cash urgently. High balances and/or late payments on credit card accounts can hurt your credit rating and you might face difficulties when you need to apply for a loan.” Using the credit card for cash involves withdrawing your money from the ATM using your credit card. However, you can withdraw cash up to your card’s credit limit. However, the interest charges are much higher than on a loan that begets interest charges not more than 10 per cent every year.Maintain a balance between secured and unsecured loansMany of us opt for personal loans and loans against credit card limits, which are unsecured loans. By contrast, secured loans include loans against property, car loans, etc. Secured loans are those that are backed by a collateral. You must ensure a balanced credit mix of secured and unsecured loans to maintain a healthy credit score. According to Vineet Patawari, CEO and Co-founder, StockEdge & Elearnmarkets, an online institution for stock training, unsecured loans must be repaid with urgency. “Unsecured loans like personal loans, credit card dues, etc. come with a higher interest rate and should be paid off as soon as possible. The government has announced EMI moratorium during the COVID period, but in a normal situation the schedule of secured loans like home loan and car loan should not be disturbed as it carries the risk of the backed asset being seized by the lender.”Avoid multiple loan inquiries during this periodThe urgent need for money prompts many people to inquire about loans and credit cards. While these may help secure the money, it is advisable to apply for a loan or credit card only when in utmost need. Raj Khosla, founder and managing director, MyMoneyMantra, an online comparison portal for loans and credit cards, says, “Multiple loans and credit card inquiries can hurt credit score. Thus, you should never initiate multiple simultaneous credit queries. For a good CIBIL score, always ensure optimal credit utilization, a right credit mix of secured and unsecured loans and repayment regularities.”Consolidation of debt helpsThe RBI on October 27, 2020 instructed all lending institutions to waive off interest on loans up to Rs. 2 crores for the six months’ moratorium period from March 01, 2020. Thus, there would be no effect on credit score if you are unable to repay the loan now and opt for the loan moratorium. While it is understood that you might miss out on a couple of repayments in the coming few months, it is the best time to consider consolidating your debt to avoid future delays. Consolidation of debt entails taking out a new loan to repay other debt and liabilities.

07-12-2020||Pune||A guide to explore the rich and rare flora of Vetal tekdi in Pune||A field guide, ‘Flora of Vetal Tekdi ’, depicting the rich flora of the hill through picturesque photographs and informative detail, penned by anaesthesiologist Dr Satish Phadke, was launched in Pune on Sunday. The book, which depicts a collection of the rare flower species growing on the hill, comes at a time when the Vetal tekdi is in the news after a stop-work notice was issued by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to the Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT), citing unauthorised work on the hill slope at survey number 123 in Kothrud. “I have been strolling on Vetal tekdi and its sister tekdis to see and observe the rare flora and document them. The stimulus was mainly after I did my field botany course in 2005,” said Dr Phadke. Dr Phadke addresses Vetal tekdi as a mini-Sahyadri, citing it is a representative of numerous plants observed on the Sahyadri range, though still lacking many due to human, cattle and industrial activities, to some extent. When quizzed over his penchant for the minutest detail while capturing the flowers on camera and documenting them in the book, he said, “People see but don’t observe. This book contains details of rare species of flowering plants which have not been recorded earlier.” The book states that there are many trees which are not natural, but have been planted since the British era, like the Dalbergia melanoxylon, Caesalpinia coriaria and the Tecoma and Cassia Surattensis. He also pointed out that some plants are uniquely endemic like Jatropha nana and chlorophytum bharuchae. “I was fortunate to discover some rare species around here which were probably not recorded earlier, like Garuga pinnata and Alangium salviifolium,” he said. “While contributing to websites like “Flowers of India” and “eflorafindia”, I found it necessary to develop an area-specific field guide,” he said. He has included most of the names of the trees in the Marathi language also. “The book is a labour of 15 years where I have photographed 240 species of flowering plants,” he said. “The efforts and passion displayed by Dr Phadke is commendable,” said Jayashree Shidore who compered the book launch. Dr Mandar N Datar of the Agharkar Research Institute, said, “Dr Phadke began to cultivate his love for plants at Vetal tekdi, which is often referred to as the lungs of Pune city. The book contains photographs and information on species found here which will extensively help in identification and confirmation. The book is a mix of art and science.” Pradnya Shidore, Green Earth Policy Consulting Public Policy Researcher, said, “The book is a product of passion and research and an important step towards protecting biodiversity. Studies like these contribute immensely in preserving local knowledge,” she said. Born in Pune, Dr Phadke did a course in ornithology and field botany which gave him a firm grounding. He is an anaesthesiologist by profession and has been practising in Pune since 1986.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/a-guide-to-explore-the-rich-and-rare-flora-of-vetal-tekdi-in-pune/story-Fh4KNxMlxaiG5ZZ7Kxtn8O.html

The towing charges for two-wheeler will now be Rs 460 and for four-wheeler Rs 720 respectively.The charges have been increased as per the contractual agreement between the government and the towing contractor which stipulates a ten per cent increase annually. The additional hike on the existing towing fees is Rs 20 for two-wheelers and Rs 40 for four-wheelers.Rahul Srirame, DCP traffic, said, “The hike has been initiated as per the agreement signed between the government and the private contractor. The contract stipulates an annual increase in the fine collection by 10 per cent as towing charges for two and four-wheelers.”According to the traffic branch, the break-up for the towing charges of two-wheelers comprises of Rs 220 for towing charges, Rs 200 as fine and Rs 40 as Goods and Services Tax (GST) fees which together translated to Rs 460. Similarly, for four-wheelers the violators will have to pay Rs 440 as towing charges, Rs 200 as fine and 80 as GST charges totalling Rs 720.The city traffic police are finding it challenging to deal with issues like parking beyond specified parking signage on both the sides of the public roads and also a violation of odd-even parking norms. Earlier the traffic police-hired tempos used to tow away the wrongly parked vehicle but the method had come in for sharp criticism after which the traffic branch initiated change and brought hydraulic based towing vans into action to prevent damage to the towed vehicles.The traffic department has replaced the old towing trucks with 25 hydraulic towing vans (for two-wheelers) and ten hydraulic towing vans (for four-wheelers) last year. Every hydraulic towing van is fitted with a camera, global positioning system (GPS), public announcement system, searchlight and a POS terminal. The camera clicks the exact location from where the vehicle was towed and the information is subsequently be uploaded to a central server.Currently, Vidharbha Infotech Company is engaged in towing away the vehicles parked in the no-parking zones in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/towing-charges-hiked-by-10-per-cent-in-pune-city/story-dZq8Ba4ycf5l8jHPOe3cGL.html

Several women in the processions fell ill after inhaling the tear gas. BJYM national president and Bangalore South Lok Sabha member Tejasvi Surya and state BJYM president Saumitra Khan also fell ill.“The violence was a public display of the violence the BJP believes in. Its workers provoked the police to open fire. I thank the police for handling the situation. The BJP will fail to create disturbance in the state,” said Saugata Roy, TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson.Also read: Suvendu Adhikari, family skip Mamata Banerjee’s mega rally, she accuses BJP of trying to break TMCBJP state president Dilip Ghosh alleged that a party worker died.“One of our workers, who was injured in the baton charge, died in hospital,” said Ghosh.Neither the police nor local TMC leaders confirmed this till 3.15pm.Prominent leaders such as BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, national secretary Arvind Menon, and several Lok Sabha members of the party were in the long procession that was moving towards the secretariat.The BJYM workers demolished two steel and bamboo barricades that were put up by the police to stop the procession. The angry BJYM workers set several bamboo barricades on fire. Journalists covering the rally were caught in the middle when BJYM workers showered stones at the Rapid Action Force of the district police. The police resorted to baton charge around 2.30pm.The violence was similar to the one witnessed in and around Kolkata on October 8 when as many as 24 BJP leaders, including Vijayvargiya and Menon, were booked by the Kolkata Police for violating Central guidelines on gatherings and political rallies during the pandemic and marching towards Nabanna, the secretariat in adjoining Howrah district.The BJYM organised the ‘Nabanna Chalo’ (march to Nabanna) programme to raise voice on issues ranging from alleged lack of employment opportunities in Bengal to law and order problems. BJP and BJYM leaders claimed that around 1,500 workers were injured during the baton charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-police-use-tear-gas-water-cannon-to-stop-bjp-rally-in-siliguri-chaos-prevails/story-JIzkuAz22DBSS6TZIzvW8O.html

It should not continue to remain in power after sacrificing the rights of the farmers,” she said.The West Bengal CM further called the BJP a party of “outsiders” and said that people of the state would not allow them to take control. “Will never allow outsiders to take control of Bengal, people will resist such attempts,” she said.The rally was Banerjee’s first in the district after party heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari resigned from the Cabinet in November-end. Though TMC leaders have said that the Adhikari issue is a closed chapter, the politician is still seen taking potshots at the leadership. Earlier, Banerjee had directed district and block level leaders from the adjacent district of East Midnapore, Adhikari’s hometown, to remain present in her West Midnapore rally. According to the people familiar with the developments, the CM had held meeting with some of the leaders in both the districts before addressing the rally.“Banerjee sent out a strong signal to party rebels last week in a virtual organisational meeting with party leaders. We are all looking forward to Monday’s rally and what she has to say,” said a senior party leader on Sunday.Adhikari was credited for the gains TMC made in the assembly constituencies of Kaliaganj in Uttar Dinajpur and Kharagpur in West Midnapore in the 2019 bypolls. Elections to the 294-member West Bengal Assembly are likely to be held in April-May next year and Banerjee is planning to hold rallies with booth level leaders and workers of North Bengal next week.(with PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-govt-should-withdraw-farm-laws-or-quit-mamata-banerjee-at-west-midnapore-rally/story-b72bwHjoPuh6wkfJr2etHO.html

The lovely red leaves bring cheer on faces as Xmas celebrations kick in. And this year, the demand of these plants has seen an unusual rise amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “December has just begun and the sale for poinsettias have picked up like anything,” says Dinesh from Monika Nursery, MG Road. And Vasim Khan, from Gurugram-based Bhawna Nursery adds, “The sale of poinsettias has been good at 100 pieces per day. Air-purifying plants ki itni nahin hai sale abhi jitni iski hai. Last year I would have sold about 70 of them per day. Par is baar Diwali ke kuch din baad sale ekdum badi, jaise abhi hi Christmas aa gaya ho... Is plant ko phool ki zaroorat nahi. Iska patta hi phool jaisa hai.”Since the demand is high, price is on the higher side, too. So be prepared to shell out more, if you are heading out to buy one for yourself. Aalam, from Gurugram’s New Friends Nursery, says, “Logon ka interest zyada rehta hai isme. So we have put on offer a two plant set priced at ₹900, with a planter,” he says. And denizens say that this is quite high! Shravani Chaudhary, an IT professional, says, “Poinsettias bring so much cheer. I just love them! Last year I bought 12 of them for ₹250 each, but this year since they are so expensive, I’ve bought only five of them this time.”Sunita Malhotra, a homemaker, who buys poinsettias every year in winter, says, “Every year I buy this plant in October and it lasts till May. Normally the nurseries would start selling them at ₹300, but soon come down to ₹250. But it’s certainly more expensive this time. The sellers are saying that the procurement price is higher because of pandemic, and hence the price rise. And almost everyone is adamant at nothing less than ₹300.”Unhappy with the increased price, Preeti Thakur, a Delhi-based flight cabin crew member and plant lover, says, “We didn’t buy plants throughout lockdown. So now when we went out to buy things to decorate our house, we picked up poinsettias like usual and then the sellers said nothing less than ₹300 per plant, and I left them right there. It’s too much a price. I would have bought had he negotiated the price.”“Iss saal peeche se hi paudha mehenga aa rah hai. Pune se aata hai yeh. Wahan bhi nahin hai maal. I bought around 50 plants thinking pata nahin mehenga hai itna to log ab khareedenge ya bhi nahi. Rate hai fixed hai,” says Israr, from Gurugram’s Evergreen Nursery, and Sohan Lal from Kusum Nursery in Delhi’s Vasant Kunj says, “Sale achchi hai is saal. Stock khatam ho raha hain, aur mangwana hai. This year it’s priced somewhere at ₹300-350 whereas last year it was ₹250 or even lesser owing to the bargaining skills. Iss saal Pune mein baarish bhi to hui hai. Paudhe kharab hue the isliye bhi rate bada hai.”  Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/wanna-usher-in-christmas-cheer-with-poinsettia-high-demand-and-price-might-change-your-plans/story-XvxV0ZJdnukr5ivjM2BGTM.html

Kejriwal made the comments at the Capital’s Singhu border, where he has gone to extend support and check arrangements for farmers who have been protesting for the past 12 days against three farm laws enacted by the central government in September.“We support all the demands of farmers. Their issues and demands are valid. My party and I have stood with them from the very beginning. At the beginning of their protests, Delhi Police had sought permission to convert nine stadiums into jails. I was pressurised but didn’t permit,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Follow latest updates on farmers protest hereHe was referring to the Delhi government denying police permission to convert nine stadiums in the city into temporary detention centres in light of the farmers’ agitation on November 27, a day after the ‘Dilli Chalo’ march began. “The farmers’ demands are valid. The central government should agree to their demands immediately. Detaining farmers is not the solution. Peaceful protest is the constitutional right of every Indian. They cannot be jailed for that. That’s why Delhi government is rejecting the permission sought by Delhi Police to convert stadiums into jails,” Delhi’s home minister Satyendar Jain had then said then in a letter to the Delhi Police.At the protest venue, Kejriwal said members of the AAP have been serving the farmers as ‘sevadars’ since the protests began. “I haven’t come here as a CM but as a ‘sevadar’. Farmers are in trouble today and we should stand with them. The AAP supports Dec 8 Bharat Bandh and party workers will participate in it across the nation,” he said.Several other political parties, including the Congress party, Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), Left parties, Trinamool Congress (TMC), and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), have also decided to stand in solidarity with the protesting farmers by supporting the general strike on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-demands-valid-will-back-bharat-bandh-kejriwal-at-delhi-singhu-border/story-xWaz5N8a8Ud5iovNVXeg9N.html

Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would be organising a protest march to the branch secretariat in north Bengal. Senior TMC leaders said the rally would help the party leadership test the waters in the district where Adhikari has a support base. In 2019 bypolls, the ruling TMC made impressive gains in the assembly constituencies of Kaliaganj in Uttar Dinajpur and Kharagpur in West Midnapore. Adhikari, who was the party’s in-charge of five of the state’s 23 districts, was credited for the success.

The TMC chief reached the district on Sunday and insiders said she has already held meeting with some of the leaders in both the districts. “Banerjee sent out a strong signal to party rebels last week in a virtual organisational meeting with party leaders. We are all looking forward to Monday’s rally and what she has to say,” said a senior party leader. Soon after Adhikari started distancing himself from the ruling party, the BJP have been flexing its muscles in East Midnapore district. On Saturday, Dilip Ghosh held a rally there. Next week, Banerjee is scheduled to visit north Bengal, where BJP had made inroads in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. She would be holding rallies with booth level leaders and workers. The party would be holding a protest march to Uttar Kanya, the branch state secretariat at Siliguri in north Bengal, on Monday, along the lines of its protest rally to the state secretariat in October. Some of the top leaders of the BJP, including state president Dilip Ghosh, national youth wing president Tejasvi Surya and national vice president Mukul Roy, would be leading the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/all-eyes-on-tmc-chief-mamata-banerjee-s-rally-in-west-midnapore-today/story-bjhyts92ihpKuscmGrA8NN.html

07-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: 7 borders connecting Delhi with Haryana, UP remain closed||As many as seven borders connecting Delhi with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh remained completely closed on Monday due to the ongoing farmers’ protest, causing traffic snarls and inconvenience to motorists in many parts of the city. The borders that are completely shut are Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Piao Maniyari, Mangesh, Jharoda and Chilla. While the first six borders connect Delhi with Haryana, the Chilla border is used by people travelling between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh’s Noida, Greater Noida, Jewar, Mathura, Agra and Lucknow. No new border was blocked by the protesting farmers who have been camping at the Haryana-Delhi and Uttar Pradesh-Delhi borders for the past 11 days.On Monday, the Delhi Traffic Police also issued alerts and advisories on social media, informing commuters about the closure of the borders and the alternate routes they should be taking to avoid traffic jams. Also read | Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal likely to visit Singhu border to inspect arrangements for protesting farmers“Singhu, Auchandi, Piao Maniyari, Mangesh borders are closed. NH 44 is closed on both sides. Take alternate routes via Lampur,Safiabad,Saboli borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba and GTK road. Avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK road, NH44,” the traffic police tweeted.The traffic police also updated that Tikri, Jharoda borders are closed for any traffic movement. It said that Badusarai border is open only for cars and two wheelers while Jhatikara border is open only for two wheeler traffic.“Available open borders to Haryana are Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders,” the traffic police tweeted. About the two borders in east Delhi, the traffic police said that the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border on Delhi-Meerut expressway is closed for traffic coming to Delhi from Ghaziabad. The service road of NH-24 connecting Delhi from Ghaziabad has also been closed since the protest started. Those coming to Delhi from Ghaziabad side have been advised to avoid the expressway and NH-24 service lane. The traffic police have asked them to take Anand Vihar, Apsara, Bhopra borders for entering Delhi. As far as the Chilla border on Delhi-Noida link road is concerned, the traffic police alert on Twitter seemed confusing. While the vehicular movement on both the carriageways (between Delhi and Noida) is shut due the farmers’ protest, the traffic police is only updating about the carriageway connecting Delhi from Noida. “The Chilla border on Noida link road is closed for traffic from Noida to Delhi due to farmers protests near Gautam Budh Dwar. People are advised to avoid Noida link road for coming to Delhi and use DND,” the traffic police tweeted.Since the Chilla border is completely blocked, the motorists are taking alternate borders such as Kalindi Kunj, DND, New Ashok Nagar, Kondli and Dallupura to travel between Delhi and Noida. Since these borders are narrow, bottlenecks have been reported with many office-goers stuck in the jams for several minutes. A senior Delhi Traffic Police officer said, “We have increased the presence of traffic personnel at the congestion points, mostly on the borders to regulate the traffic movement manually.” The officer said that the traffic chaos would get over by noon but it is expected to worsen during the evening peak hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-protest-7-borders-connecting-delhi-with-up-haryana-completely-closed/story-DhM3qc6QH5YoPTc6Gt6PVO.html

He is feeling better than yesterday and doesn’t have fever now.”With questions being raised on the efficacy of Covaxin, an indigenous vaccine for coronavirus developed by Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer had issued a statement on Saturday stating that “the third phase trial is a double-blind study where the volunteers have a 50% chance of receiving either a vaccine or placebo”.Medical camps at Haryana borders for farmersVij on Sunday said the health department will set up health camps at the farmers’ protesting sites. “The Haryana health department will set up medical camps everywhere in Haryana where the farmers are agitating. Doctors, ambulances and medicines will be available at the camps,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/was-told-that-antibodies-will-develop-after-42-days-of-vaccination-vij/story-tJmwFwsmDZfdQj4gVqSgTP.html
07-12-2020||Chandigarh||Manesar land scam: CBI court opens window for arraigning more persons as accused||CBI special judge Jagdeep Singh, who had last week held that a prima facie case for framing charges is made out against former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and 32 other accused chargesheeted by the probing agency in the Manesar land scam, also opened a window for arraigning more persons in the case.In his December 1 order, the special judge said that the complainant or the accused may move such application as permissible under the law during the course of trial if evidence suggested involvement of persons or officials in the hierarchy to make out commission of offences on their part as well. Accordingly trial court may take decision as per the law, the court said. Hooda and others have been accused of deliberately allowing land acquisition proceedings to lapse by not ensuring passing of award within statutorily prescribed period, forcing land owners to sell their holdings in panic on the threat of acquisition and issuance of various licences after abandonment of the acquisition proceedings. This, as per the CBI, caused huge loss to the state exchequer and land owners and wrongful gain to private builders, entities and accused.The judge had on December 1 also summoned five additional accused who served in HSIIDC, industries and TCP departments. Hooda had said the framing of charges was a part of the process. “I have got full faith in judiciary. As far as this case is concerned, it is politically motivated,” Hooda had said. Referring to the state government’s decision of January 29, 2010 to close the acquisition proceedings in view of the recommendations of an interdepartmental committee of March 26, 2008, the special judge said so far as the argument on behalf of accused that passing of impugned orders, especially January 29, 2010 order, were collective decisions but various persons/public servants, including the then industries minister in the hierarchy, have not been arraigned as accused by the CBI, is concerned.“The entitled party to move appropriate application that is complainant, accused may move such application as permissible under the law during the course of trial if evidence suggested involvement of such persons/officials in the hierarchy, so as to make out commission of offence(s) on their part as well and accordingly trial court may take decision as per law.”‘Anti-graft law provisions applicable to the accused’Dismissing the plea of the accused that no case for framing of any charge under section 13(1) (d) of the Act is made out in light of a 2018 amendment pertaining to section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, the CBI judge quoted a Supreme Court order. “Whether any offence has been committed or not has to be examined in the light of the provisions of the statute as it existed prior to the amendment made effective with effect from July 26, 2018. In the instant case, it is a matter of record that challan had already been filed by the investigating agency prior to coming into effect the amended provisions of the PC Act, and the allegations pertained to the period prior to the amendment of the Act. Therefore, at this stage, it cannot be conclusively held that no case for framing of charge under section 13 (1)(d) is made out,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/manesar-land-scam-cbi-court-opens-window-for-arraigning-more-persons-as-accused/story-PSyCSSF9Ii35Nhpd2GzrQN.html
07-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The most extraordinary bag||Shoulder bags come with zips. But his has dozens of safety pins, for both the compartments.“This has my sone ka saamaan (sleeping stuff),” says Maan Singh, walking down a central Delhi road, idly. “I have no job.” In his 40s, he was a dish washer in wedding banquets “but I haven’t been getting any work for months.” He sleeps in a raen basera, the night shelter for the homeless.Mr Singh picked up the bag recently from a roadside. Since its zips were missing (or broken, he doesn’t clearly remember), he got those substituted by the many safety pins he was lucky to get for free from a bazaar tailor. “This way, nobody can steal my belongings.” Belongings comprise of a bed sheet and two sets of pants and shirts. There’s also a mask in the water bottle pocket.The bag shows some stains of yellow curry. “They were already there when I found it. I’ve cleaned the bag many times since then.”Every evening in the homeless shelter, Mr Singh unhooks the pins on his bag to take out the bed sheet after which he painstakingly hooks them back—takes about half an hour to finish the task one way. Only then he sleeps. “You cannot always trust the people sleeping in the shelter... some of them try to steal things.” If his bag was served by a zip, stealing stuff from it would be far easier, he notes. “A thief cannot have so much time to deal with so many pins without getting noticed.”Scared to lose his bag, Mr Singh keeps it under his head as pillow at night. He admits that sometimes he pricks his fingers while trying to work his way through these pins.Though without a home in Delhi, Mr Singh has one in Bundi, Rajasthan, which he left more than a decade ago. “I have my parents, my brothers...” but he doesn’t wish to talk of them. He now walks away, as the only backpacker — and a unique one at that — in this street, at this moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-most-extraordinary-bag/story-LUY35ssjYE0gWbSkrwieYJ.html

The number of RT-PCR tests, considered by experts to be the gold standard of Covid-19 testing, however, continued dropping from 35,352 on Saturday to 32,023 on Sunday – a reduction of 9.41%. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, tests are significantly better than rapid antigen tests at detecting positive cases – the latter has a higher tendency to give false negative. As a result, the higher the share of RT-PCR tests in overall testing, the more accurate the positivity rate is.On Sunday, 69 new deaths were recorded, with which the toll touched 9,643.Commenting on the trend, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted: “I am glad that the third wave of Covid-19 also seems to be getting weak. Delhi fought a very difficult war against Covid-19.”Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayFor a working day, 2,706 cases in 24 hours is the lowest since September 2..

07-12-2020||Mumbai||Terminating contracts of counsellors to bus providers, Mumbai schools start cutting cost||Days after Maharashtra went under a lockdown in March, 35-year-old Farhan Ahmed (name changed on request), a music instructor at a Mumbai school, was made to go on leave without pay. Citing delay in fee payments from parents, the school had said it could not pay nearly 150 teachers and instructors associated with it for the next few months. While the school gradually got those teaching key subjects on board in the coming months, Ahmed is yet to hear from the authorities. With schools continuing to teach online owing to Covid-19 pandemic, several professionals like Ahmed, whose jobs are quite different to teach in the online mode, are staring at an uncertain future. “Over the past several months, schools, citing poor financial condition, have sacked several staff members and terminated the services of all those whose jobs are seen as ‘redundant’ in the online mode. Even as parents have started paying fees after the delay in the initial few months, schools are using the pandemic as an excuse to maximise profits and cut costs,” said Ahmed, who now relies on his private classes to make ends meet. The others who have been affected by such decision of the schools are instructors for extracurricular activities like sports, school bus operators, counsellors, the administrative staff etc. Raheen Jummani, a psychologist who has been working with a Mumbai school as a counsellor and supports the mental health-related initiatives of many others, said several institutes have terminated the contracts of counsellors altogether. “A private school that I was working for terminated my contract and did not offer any explanation. Many other counsellors had similar experiences,” said Jumani. She said the larger concern was that schools were willing to do away with something as important as the mental health of students. “They are doing this during a pandemic, when students are already stressed and anxious with all that is happening around them and need emotional support. Schools are willing to compromise on such a crucial part of the children’s wellbeing altogether,” she added. Anil Garg, president of the School Bus Owners’ Association (SBOA), said that while school buses continue to remain off the roads as physical schools are closed, private schools have gone a step ahead and terminated their contracts with bus owners. “Schools have just ended the contracts and have even gone to the extent of saying that they would change the contractor if need be in future. While the support staff which worked on buses like bus drivers, cleaners and female attendants are out of work for all this while, schools have not even shown the dignity to pay them some allowance to meet their basic needs. The worst hit by this move are the female attendants, many of whom run their homes on the salaries they get from their work. With no job, they are struggling to make ends meet,” said Garg. There are nearly 50,000 school buses and around 1.5 lakh bus staffers in Mumbai. Several schools in the city also terminated the contracts of sports instructors and physical education teachers. Sunny Singh, who works as a sports coach for a city-based international school said the school terminated his contract in the month of May and gave him no reason. “Some officials said that parents were not willing to pay the added cost for sports considering schools were shut. But I was coaching students over online platforms and it was working well. Schools need to realise that children also need to stay fit and active even if it means some basic activity in their homes and neighbourhood,” said Singh. The principal of a leading school in the suburbs said that schools are finding it difficult to retain the services of professionals whose roles are not clearly defined in the online mode due to fund crunch. “In the initial few months after the lockdown, schools had to struggle to get even tuition fees from parents as many cited financial constraints. While the situation has improved over the last few months, parents are still not willing to pay fees for extracurricular activities. Buses are not plying so they are not paying transport fees. Hence, we are not able to retain the services of these people anymore,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/terminating-contracts-of-counsellors-to-bus-providers-mumbai-schools-start-cutting-cost/story-7FtYHNTHAWigftD0eegIMO.html
07-12-2020||City||Low turnout at Mumbai’s Dadar as most watch tribute ceremony to Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar live on social media||Amid fears of the spread of coronavirus, Chaityabhoomi in Dadar, the cremation site of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, witnessed a low turnout of his followers on his death anniversary on Sunday. However, many key political leaders, including Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, his deputy Ajit Pawar, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and some state ministers, visited Chaityabhoomi on Sunday to pay their tribute.Each year, more than 10 lakh followers of the architect of Indian Constitution throng Chaityabhoomi on December 6 to pay their respects, at the site which many consider holy. However, this year, the state government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) appealed to citizens to avoid visiting the site owing to the pandemic.“The roads around Shivaji Park and Chaityabhoomi were literally empty. The last time we saw a low turnout on this date was in 2008, owing to the 26/11 terror attacks. Even then, there were around five lakh citizens who had arrived at the holy site. This year, however, not even 10% of that crowd was witnessed. This means citizens cooperated with authorities and did not go to the holy site,” a BMC official said.No arrangements, such as temporary sheds, drinking water facility, mobile toilets, for visitors were made this year. The BMC had also prohibited around 500 stalls that are set up each year at the site to sell books, lamps, calendars, decorations, posters, T-shirts, watches and many other such items that bear an image of Dr Ambedkar. BMC had facilitated a live broadcast of the tribute ceremony on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. According to the civic body, more than 7 lakh citizens from across the country watched the ceremony live on Facebook alone on Sunday morning. The civic body had also directed the closure of the Global Vipassana Pagoda at Gorai between December 5 and 7 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The pagoda is a meditation centre and also has a monument built as a tribute to Lord Gautama Buddha. Hundreds of followers of Dr Ambedkar, who visit Chaityabhoomi on his death anniversary, also visit the pagoda.Meanwhile, Koshyari, who had visited the site said that while many countries of the world had high fatality rate owing to the pandemic, India managed to keep the maintain a low death count because of the spirit of compassion (karuna) shown by the people. “Compassion to fellow beings was preached by Bhagwan (Lord) Buddha and the same was propagated by Dr Ambedkar,” the Governor said.CM Thackeray said Dr Ambedkar gave the nation the Constitution of India and brought about a social revolution in the country and gave a framework of discipline to his followers. “I would like to thank the people for observing discipline and not crowding at the Chaityabhoomi amid the Covid-19 pandemic,” he added.His deputy Ajit Pawar said that the state government is committed to complete the construction of the grand memorial of Dr Ambedkar at Indu Mills within the stipulated time. Later, Thackeray also inaugurated the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Research Centre for Social Justice at Mumbai University.“We should not forget the contribution of Dr Ambedkar. To pay homage to his greatness, we are raising the height of his statue at Indu Mill. However, we cannot reach the height of his personality,” the CM said after the inauguration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/low-turnout-at-mumbai-s-dadar-as-most-watch-tribute-ceremony-to-dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-live-on-social-media/story-bZVTvxvsgMfHunrm4vJLsN.html

07-12-2020||Education||NEET-UG: 5 medical colleges to allot seats to kin of deceased Covid warriors||Five medical colleges across India have been identified to allot one seat each this year, for children of Covid-19 warriors who died in the line of work. In November, Union minister for health and family welfare Dr Harsh Vardhan announced the Centre’s decision to reserve five medical seats under the ‘Children of Covid Warriors (deceased)’ category. In a December-5 notification by the Directorate General of Health Sciences (DGHS), the five institutes include MGIMS Wardha in Maharashtra, Lady Hardinge Medical College in New Delhi, NSCB Medical College, Jabalpur, in Madhya Pradesh, JLN Medical College, Ajmer, in Rajasthan and Government Medical College, Haldwani, in Uttarakhand. The five seats will be available to candidates who cleared the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) exam held in September. Students can apply for these seats through the respective Directorate of Medical Education (DME) or Directorate of Health Services (DHS) of their domicile states. The ministry of health and family welfare defines Covid warriors as “public healthcare providers including community health workers, who may be in direct contact and care of Covid-19 patients and who may be at risk of being impacted by the same”. This special quota has been created for children of Covid warriors who lost their lives from the coronavirus or died while on Covid-related duty. “Nominations/applications have to be routed through the DME or DHS of the concerned state after scrutiny about their eligibility. The authorities will then forward such applications to Medical Council Committee (MCC) for allotment as per the NEET merit,” states the notification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/neet-ug-5-medical-colleges-to-allot-seats-to-kin-of-deceased-covid-warriors/story-LM4EVwXUsuF4Q42xnsPjnI.html
07-12-2020||Chandigarh||MC names Congress, socio-religious bodies in latest list of property tax defaulters||Socio-religious, central government offices and political organisations, including the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC), owe the municipal corporation more than Rs 1.81 crore as property tax dues. Issuing notices for tax not paid for 2019-2020, the civic body has directed Mother Teresa Home in Sector 23, which is the top defaulter, to clear dues of Rs 69 lakh and PPCC to pay around Rs 10 lakh. The latest list of organisations with property tax dues also includes the ministry of corporate affairs’ Corporate Bhawan in Sector 27 with arrears amounting to around Rs 29 lakh. The other socio-religious organisations on the list include the Jai Jai Charitable Trust, Sector 44-C (Rs 30 lakh), Kalgi Dhar Niwas, Sector 27-B (Rs 23 lakh), Munni Ji Sabha, Sector 24 (Rs 66,000), Sanatan Dharam Mandir, Sector 28-B (Rs 51,000) and Sivanda Ashram, Sector 29 ( Rs 43,000). When contacted, an official of the Mother Teresa Home refused to comment on the issue. An official of the Kalgi Dhar Niwas, who didn’t want to be named, said, “We have received the notice and raised objections with the MC commissioner. We have requested for exemption, as we are a non-profit organisation. A case on similar lines is also pending before the Punjab and Haryana high court.” Commenting on the non-payment of property tax by several socio-religious organisations, an MC official said, “Most of these bodies have submitted the plea that they are non-profit religious organisations and should be exempted from paying property tax. While some have approached the high court, others have submitted objections to the MC commissioner. Meanwhile, the unpaid tax for successive years keeps on accumulating with penalties.” MC commissioner rejects Congress plea Rejecting the plea of Congress, MC commissioner KK Yadav has directed it to pay the outstanding dues of around Rs 10 lakh. PPCC, which has an office in Sector 15, had approached the high court against the penalty imposed for non-payment of property tax. HC had set aside the notice and directed MC to pass an appropriately reasoned order as per law. The commissioner, in compliance of the court order, examined PPCC’s representation wherein it contended that the penalty imposed on it was not tenable under the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation Bylaws. Despite repeated calls, PPCC president Sunil Jakhar couldn’t be contacted.Besides the defaulters on the latest list, the Chandigarh administration also owes the civic body around Rs 54 crore, for which notices were served in the recent past. Recently, the administration had shared payment receipts of Rs 2.4 crore with MC. The cash-strapped MC has so far recovered Rs 49 crore against a revised target of Rs 51 crore for the financial year 2020-2021. There are 1.4 lakh properties under the jurisdiction of the corporation, of which 95,000 are liable to pay tax. Properties with no tax pending are automatically issued no-dues certificates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-names-congress-socio-religious-bodies-in-latest-list-of-property-tax-defaulters/story-z4GvQx4vuMp7RNAXNnK1wM.html
07-12-2020||Mumbai||Active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai’s western suburbs remain high||Although the positivity rate for Covid-19 cases in the city has witnessed a dip and number of cases is stagnant despite a projected rise in after Diwali, the western suburbs continue to record a high number of active cases. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data, 48% of Mumbai’s active cases are from the western suburbs, with the highest count in Borivli, followed by Andheri, Kandivli, Malad, Goregaon, Dahisar and Bandra.On Sunday, the city reported 786 new Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 286,053. There were 13 deaths reported, taking the toll to 10,896. Further, 260,285 patients have been discharged post Covid-19 treatment in Mumbai and the city’s discharge rate stands at 90.99%. There are 14,051 active cases in Mumbai and the fatality rate is 3.80%.For the last seven months, the western suburbs contributed a significant number of the city’s active cases. The BMC attributes this to unlocking and increased testing in the westerns suburbs.According to the civic body, the city’s daily positivity rate has gone down to around 5%, with increased testing post-Diwali.According to the BMC data, R-Central ward, that covers Borivli, has the highest case count and number of active cases in any ward. R-Central registered 18,087 cases as of December 4, of which 1,176 are active.Further, the top contributors to active cases remain other areas in the western suburbs, including K-West ward (Jogeshwari West, Oshiwara and Andheri West) with 1,088 active cases; R-South ward covering Kandivli, with 1,000 active cases; K-East ward (Jogeshwari East, Andheri East and Vile Parle East) having 963 active cases.Further, other wards in the western suburbs, including P-North, which covers Malad, has 918 active cases and P-South (Goregaon) has 777 active cases. R-North, covering Dahisar, recorded 525 active cases; H-West (Dahisar, Bandra West, Santacruz West and Khar West) recorded 627 cases and H-East, covering areas like Bandra (East), Bandra Kurla Complex and Santacruz (East), has 472 active cases.“Majority of the floating population in the city is from the western suburbs, and due to the unlocking by the government, movement of this population has increased. Due to this, the spread has remained constantly high in pockets of western suburbs,” said a ward officer.Vishwas Shankarwar, deputy civic commissioner, said, “In the western suburbs, testing and medical facilities are in abundance, and we also have many citizens getting tested voluntarily. It is due to more testing in the western suburbs, as compared to other areas in the city that we are seeing more cases here.”Wards covering areas like Charni Road, Marine Lines, Kalbadevi, Colaba and Churchgate have the lowest number of active cases.One hot spot that has shown signs of drastic improvement – Dharavi – recorded only nine new Covid-19 cases on Monday. Dharavi’s tally is 3,692 cases, of which 3,361 have been discharged. “The spread of infection may be greater in the western suburbs as large trading communities reside there, with many locals travelling daily since the unlocking,” said city-based Dr Siddarth Paliwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/active-covid-19-cases-in-mumbai-s-western-suburbs-remain-high/story-DevoaNk2jlcM1QrwdEUqHP.html
07-12-2020||Mumbai||71% active Covid cases in Mumbai asymptomatic||Of the 12,926 active Covid-19 patients in Mumbai, 9,155 (71%) are asymptomatic, displaying no symptoms before undergoing tests for the presence of Sars-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes the disease, data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows. A total of 835 patients are in critical condition. While doctors call it a good sign, as chances of transmission and spread of infection from asymptomatic patients are lower, they stress the need to conduct more reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests – considered the gold standard in detection of the novel coronavirus – and warn against overdependence on the quick-result rapid antigen tests (RAT). Every day, the civic body conducts around 15,000 Covid-19 tests, of which a majority – almost 50-55% – are antigen tests. Similar to RT-PCR, rapid antigen kits detect the presence of molecular pathogens of the novel coronavirus. But RT-PCR test results takes almost eight hours as compared to within 30 minutes via RAT. Asymptomatic transmission refers to transmission of the virus from a person who does not develop Covid-19 symptoms. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), there are few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases, who are truly asymptomatic, and there is no documented asymptomatic transmission till date. “The infectious period of the virus that causes Covid-19 in symptomatic individuals may begin within two days. It persists for more than 10 days after symptoms show,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. “In asymptomatic patients, however, the chances of transmitting the virus are lower, as these individuals don’t sneeze or cough. Hence, having more asymptomatic patients helps break the chain of infection.” Most asymptomatic patients are identified through contact-tracing. In Mumbai, more than 40 lakh close contacts of infected patients have been traced by the civic body since the outbreak of the virus in March. “Asymptomatic patients don’t know they are infected because they do not have symptoms. Contact-tracing becomes important to identify this set,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC. “Many asymptomatic patients get detected when they are admitted to hospitals for other ailments.” However, a section of medical experts call asymptomatic patients “silent spreaders”, suggesting that more Covid-19 tests via RT-PCR be undertaken across the city that will help in early diagnosis. Since the outbreak of the infection in March till December 5, the civic body has conducted 19,71,736 Covid-19 tests, of which 5,25,143 tests were done through rapid antigen kits. “We get less than 2% false positive reports using rapid antigen tests. Also, people get results within 30 minutes, which helps reduce the burden on labs,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. However, doctors have highlighted a loophole in the system. As per rules of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), every positive report through RAT is treated as true positive, while those with negative report have to be mandatorily re-tested through RT-PCR only if they display symptoms. “Asymptomatic patients don’t show symptoms and as per ICMR, the sensitivity of rapid antigen kits is only 50%. So, thousands of asymptomatic patients are slipping through the loophole in diagnosis, as the civic body is relying more on rapid antigen tests,” said a senior epidemiologist. “While there is no scientific evidence that asymptomatic patients can’t infect others and the spread of infection rate may be less, they could still transmit,” added the doctor. “Post Diwali, many migrants who had gone back to their hometowns are returning to the city, and many will be asymptomatic. So, it is essential to run tests to find silent carriers. Considering they live in densely populated slums, they can contribute further to the spread of the virus,” said Dr Om Srivastava, epidemiologist and member of the state’s Covid-19 taskforce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/71-active-covid-cases-in-mumbai-asymptomatic/story-r5x39rSpDHRBpYjazpUnDK.html
07-12-2020||Chandigarh||Godowns full to the brims, Punjab to build 11 lakh tonne covered plinth storage as stop-gap measure||In the wake of piling up of foodgrains in warehouses, the Punjab government will build covered area plinth storage of 11 lakh tonne capacity. This will be a stop-gap arrangement till covered godowns and silos in the pipeline are built, it is learnt. Pungrain will float tenders for the covered area plinth storage after getting a green signal from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on whose behalf the state procurement agencies procure paddy and wheat. “The tenders will be floated this month, or it will be too late as the wheat crop would start arriving in the market in April. We need at least two months for construction,” said a senior officer of the state food and civil supplies department. These plinths will come up in 15 of Punjab districts, with more than half of the total capacity to be in Moga (1.75 lakh tonne), Sangrur (1.55 lakh tonne) Jalandhar (1.35 lakh tonne) and Patiala (1.15 lakh tonne). Admitting that it’s a crisis-like situation in the state as far as grain storage is concerned, the food and civil supplies department last year asked the Centre to allow a storage of 35 lakh tonne by way of covered area plinths (CAP).The department will rent open spaces on which wheat will be stored on raised platforms covered with tarpaulin. Amritsar, Ferozepur, Tarn Taran, Muktsar, Gurdaspur, SBS Nagar, Hoshiarpur, Rupnagar, Mohali and Patiala districts need more storage space whereas it is near negligible in Faridkot, Mansa, and Bathinda, it was found. The storage space for 7.69 lakh tonne was built last year. Godowns full Currently, there is 155 lakh tonne storage capacity in covered godowns in which the state agencies store more 10% more than the capacity. The covered area plinth storage capacity is 100 lakh tonne while that of silos it is 5.75 lakh tonnes. Of the total 260 lakh tonne available storage, 195 lakh tonne is already occupied while 135 lakh tonne more wheat is expected in four to five months. At least 140 lakh tonne wheat of the previous two seasons is stored in the state’s godowns, most of which is stored in covered area plinths, exposed to the vagaries of weather. Nearly 55 lakh tonne rice of the two seasons is also stored in the godowns. Renting a storage space of 11 lakh tonne for three years will cost Rs 200 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/godowns-stocked-to-the-brims-punjab-to-build-11-lakh-tonne-covered-plinth-storage-as-stop-gap-measure/story-HFYLrkY8ihz4rKEmqmWuyL.html

While Lal was one of the five main executors of the crime, his wife Mandeep, had helped hide the child in her house for four hours, police said. A namesake, Lal Singh, the sarpanch of village Maluwal of Moga, has also been booked for helping the accused.The police have already arrested former Sarpanch Rachpal Singh of Zira, the main accused Harjinderpal Kumar of Ludhiana who was the victim’s driver and Sukhdev Singh Sukha of Kheowali of Fazilka. Sukhdev Singh of Arniwal, Fazilka, is still absconding.The accused admitted that they had planned to invest the ₹4 crore ransom money in the drug trade.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP city 2) Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said Lal had made the ransom call to the victim’s mother demanding ₹4 crore for the release of the boy and the driver. Rachapal and sarpanch Lal Singh had exchanged cars with Harjinderpal, Sukhdev Singh Sukha and Lal to throw off the police from their trail in Moga. Lal had handed over the child to Rachapal Singh. Sarpanch Lal Singh and Rachpal had handed the toddler over to Mandeep, who was aware that the boy had been abducted.“At midnight on December 1, the accused had taken the boy to Lal’s cousin Manjit Kaur’s house for a while. It is not certain whether Manjit knew the child had been kidnapped.

07-12-2020||Mumbai||A first in India: Gram sabha at Palghar passes resolution to declare heritage lake a wetland; Maharashtra govt to consider demand||The gram sabha of the Jamsar hamlet in Palghar’s Jawhar taluka, located around 134km from Mumbai, had recently passed a unanimous resolution to declare a 6.16-hectare (ha) heritage lake as a wetland. Archaeological surveys of the lake have showed the presence of an ancient temple and artefacts dating back to the early medieval period (6th century AD). This is the first in India where a governing body of a village has expressed its interest to declare a natural site a wetland, a member of the Centre’s National Wetland Committee (NWC) said. “Along with flora-fauna, cultural and historical factors also play a major role in declaring a site a wetland. This has been highlighted by a village themselves, a first for India. The gram panchayat’s resolution should be studied, followed by on-field assessment by state authorities to declare Jamsar a wetland as a top priority. This approach should be adopted by more village bodies to protect natural areas,” said Afroz Ahmad, member, NWC. While Jamsar has a population of around 1,300 people, the closest town Jawhar (around 8km away) has more than 1.7 lakh citizens. To achieve the wetland status, the village panchayat kept several meetings over the past one year and appointed a committee of experts to help them draft the resolution. “Jamsar is included in the National Wetland Inventory Atlas (NWIA), Maharashtra, prepared by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). We have also highlighted Article 51A of the constitution, which has stated that it is a fundamental duty to protect the environment. Accordingly, we have requested the district collector to take an appropriate action in accordance with the resolution passed,” said Vitthal Thetale, sarpanch (village head), Jamsar. Jawahar resident Rajesh Tendulkar, who helped put together the resolution, said, “This lake is at least 600-700 years old, and there is a need to create a conservation model for the artefacts and lake-wetland ecology.” When HT shared the details with the Maharashtra government, officials said they would consider declaring it a wetland. “The state is focused towards protecting all natural areas that contribute to ecological benefits to achieve our intention of Majhi Vasundhara (climate change mitigation and adaptation). We will initiate the necessary proceedings to ensure the site is declared a wetland if the area has all the ecological characteristics of being a wetland, and also has cultural and heritage value,” said Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary, state environment department. “We hope more such gram sabhas and villages having these natural areas come forward with similar representations for protection,” she added. According to the survey of wetlands (brief documentation) by Palghar district last year, Jamsar was identified among 86 potential wetlands. The document was submitted before the Bombay high court (HC) last year. However, only six sites were proposed by the district before the state environment department for final notification. “We have asked the Palghar collector to re-verify all wetland sites in the district, and include areas with slightest wetland features or those included in the NWIA,” said Annasaheb Misal, Konkan commissioner. Palghar collector Manik Gursal said, “We are already assessing features of potential wetlands. We will look into Jamsar, study the resolution, and do the needful.” During the wetland survey at Palghar last year, the district had appointed Sindhudurg-based Syamantak organisation following which a team of experts (Saba Purkar and Samarth Parab) conducted an anthropological exploration of the lake, locally called Pazar Talao, where they found a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva and several carved stones. The study has also revealed that the area had artefacts dating from 6th century AD to 13th century AD, with several artefacts being comparatively recent – from 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. In all, 114 artefacts were found across two clusters including stones and fragments. “A small hamlet in Palghar has set an example that sustainable and environment-friendly development is needed for an hour,” said Sachin Desai from Syamantak, adding that Jamsar should be proposed as a Ramsar site (wetland of international importance). “The Ramsar Convention has been addressing the issue of the cultural aspects of wetlands for over 10 years. Jamsar is a perfect example.” Syamantak has called for the development of a village herbarium, a Museumotel (a village museum-cum-home stay), guide programme for village youth and documentaries of the site to promote tourism and protection of the wetland in its brief documentation. Jamsar: A hidden archaeological, wetland treasure The 6.16 ha Jamsar lake has a shallow water body with marsh plants such as typha reeds and aquatic grass making it an ideal habitat for aquatic migratory birds during winter, amphibians, and odonates. According to the wetland brief documentation, there are 59 species of flora at Jamsar, of which 10 are rare species, two are endangered ones, while one is a vulnerable species. Traditional fishing with catch, including fish of the carp family – rohu, catla, mrigal, maral and prawns – is carried out. Stone idols found in wetlands indicate distinct anthropological imprints. Such remains are said to be dating back to the early medieval period. Among the threats, the spread of invasive species such as water hyacinths (Eichhornia crassipes), present in large amounts in the water body, affects the water flow and blocks sunlight from reaching native aquatic plants. It decreases concentration of dissolved oxygen in water, which often causes death of species.

07-12-2020||City||In Punjab, women take charge of their farms as menfolk take part in protests at Delhi border||Malkeet Kaur (62) of Deon village in Bathinda district has taken charge of her family’s 10-acre farmland after her husband and three sons are taking part in the ongoing farmers’ protest in Delhi. On Sunday afternoon, she was being assisted by her daughter-in-law Charanjit Kaur (38) in putting fertilisers on the recently sown wheat crop. “Earlier our task was mainly to chop fodder and milk three cattle heads. As the adult male members of the family are attending the agitation, we have now taken responsibility of the farms as well,” said Malkeet. Charanjit said last week she irrigated the wheat fields. “We have a few farm labourers whose work I am supervising in the fields. Wheat was sown about three weeks ago and the only work is now to irrigate the farms with a tubewell after regular intervals. I will be taking care of the fields till harvesting as our family members are fighting a collective battle against the contentious farm laws,” said a resolute Charanjit. Located near the Bathinda-Jalalabad highway, Deon village, which has an estimated population of 5,500, has a support base of the Sidhupur and Ugrahan factions of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU).The farmer union leaders said the activists are volunteering to help the families with their daily chores.“The villagers are taking turns to visit the agitation sites at Tikri and Singhu borders. As a jatha of about 25 volunteers will leave Deon for Delhi on Monday, a group of protesters will come back to the village and then another batch will proceed to attend the agitation,” said Ram Singh, who has been coordinating the participation of farmers at the protest sites.For 65-year-old Amarjit Kaur of Namol village in Sangrur district, taking control of her cattle and wheat crop is now her prime duty. Her husband Ram Singh has been camping at Tikri border for the past 11 days to oppose the agriculture laws. Kaur along with her daughter-in-law and a 10-year-old grandson visits the fields to collect fodder on a bullock cart.However, she is now worried about the irrigation of the wheat crop. “My activist husband is at the Delhi border and my son is recovering from an arm fracture. My daughter-in-law is assisting me in taking care of our four-acre land besides other domestic responsibilities. I want my husband to contribute to the farmers’ fight against the draconian laws while the womenfolk will take care of cultivation,” she said.But for Jaswinder Kaur (65) residing alone at home at Bathinda’s Gill Patti village is an emotional challenge. Nonetheless, the elderly Kaur wants her husband Bhola Singh to come back with pride after laws are repealed.“I feel lonely as our four daughters are now married and my husband left for Delhi on November 24 with fellow villagers. Sometimes I do feel upset about staying alone but I decided to overcome it. I will go with my younger brother-in-law on Monday to irrigate the wheat fields for the first time this season,” she said.Octogenarian Dalip Kaur of the same village asked her family members and other neighbours to arrange for consumables for the farmers in Delhi.“Today there was an announcement from the local gurdwara that farmers need various things. Hundreds of villagers are braving chilling weather for a social cause and assisting their families in every possible way is our social obligation,” she added.Baldev Kaur, an activist from Barnala’s Harigarh village, and the fellow villagers have extended all support for farm works. “It is the need of the hour that at least one person of a family joins the protest in Delhi. Women are managing domestic chores as well as protests at the Badbar toll plaza here,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-punjab-women-take-charge-of-farms-as-menfolk-take-part-in-protests-at-delhi-border/story-nPFLTQPiBNpEYgeNQFNiPJ.html

All the names are being processed and formal announcements will be made soon. As of now, we are preparing for the inauguration for our district party office in the city this week,” he said.On being asked about the alliance, he said, “The high-command will take a call on this and we shall follow the same.”A party insider on Saturday had said that the declaration of candidate names could begin on December 9 and continue till the first date of filing of nominations i.e. December 11.“We are expecting that the candidates will be declared in three slots beginning Wednesday, till Friday.

Eleven injured are undergoing treatment at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital of whom five are in critical condition, while the condition of six others is stable. Four others who are injured are admitted to Masina Hospital and they are all in a critical state, the civic body’s disaster control room said. All the four critical patients at Masina Hospital sustained 70% to 95% burns. The 62-year-old victim, Sushila Bangre, was declared dead by KEM Hospital around 7.45pm, said the control room. According to Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB), four houses were impacted due to the blast and electrical wiring and installations, clothes and other household items caught fire. The impact of the blast was so strong that a wall between the two houses also collapsed, said MFB officials. The fire due to the blast was extinguished by 7.50am.Kailash Hiwrale, chief fire officer of MFB, said, “We are currently investigating all aspects from the fire safety point of view for the building. It is said that there was a wedding in one of the houses where the cylinder blast took place, but we are yet to take statements of the victims. Currently, they are admitted in the hospital, and we will take their statements after the family is in the correct frame of mind to give it.”Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar visited the site of the accident and directed the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) to undertake repair works for all the houses. Till the repair works are done, people from nearby houses will stay at a nearby hotel. MFB officials said they have informed officials concerned to ensure that the structural stability audit of the building is done to ascertain whether the building is habitable or not.“Ten patients had sustained 50-80% burns, of whom one died. Two have got minor burns. All might have inhaled smoke during the fire. The patients are being attended by a group of doctors including general and plastic surgeons including orthopaedics, chest specialists, ophthalmologists among others. All emergency preparations have been taken,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of the hospital.Four patients, who belong to the same family, have been taken to Masina Hospital and have been admitted to the hospital’s specialised burns unit.The burns are 94.5% burns for the father, 92% for the son and 60% for the mother and daughter. All four are critical, but at present haemodynamically-stable as per the hospital.“The patients are under the care of our burn specialist doctors and the best of treatment is being offered to them. The hospital has ensured that all safety protocols relating to Covid-19 and burns are being followed strictly and effectively,” as per a spokesperson from the hospital.This was the second such incident in the past two weeks. Earlier, on November 24, two people died and three injured after a fire broke out due to cylinder blast at a chawl in Sakinaka.Pednekar had, at that time, told HT, “Frequent cylinder blasts and citizens losing lives due to it is one of the main reasons why we should aim at having piped gas for all households. I know it is a process and will not happen overnight, but piped gas is much safer than cylinder gas supply. We can start by making it compulsory in new constructions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lpg-cylinder-blast-in-mumbai-s-lalbag-62-year-old-dead-9-critical/story-biBpjcYwfXRW8kZp1BGenK.html

Moreover, no effective drive has been conducted to remove the illegal hoardings erected along the highway in the past two years.Though the civic council’s executive officer, Sandeep Tiwari, had assured in September this year that the tenders would be floated by October 29, nothing has been done yet.The contract of the Chandigarh-based agency was allotted the tender in 2016 for a period of three years at a cost of ₹2.06 crore, which expired in September 2019. The council had, however, extended it till June 30, 2020, and again by four weeks.Punjab local bodies director Puneet Goyal said he would look into the matter on Monday.However, executive officer Tiwari did not respond despite repeated attempts.As per the new Punjab Outdoor Policy, 2018, every corporation and council has been directed to publish new tenders to generate revenue from advertisements. There are several illegal hoardings erected on the highway, but no effective drive has been conducted for the last two years. In 1995, the Punjab and Haryana high court had issued directions to all deputy commissioners to have illegal hoardings on national as well as state highways removed, saying that not only were they eyesores, they also diverted the attention of motorists leading to fatal accidents. Since then, the court has issued several reminders in this regard, but no action has been taken by the authorities concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/year-on-zirakpur-municipal-council-fails-to-float-tenders-for-advertisements/story-zinZWH4ccTtv1p68j48VwI.html
07-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Congress’s ward-level leaders asked to record their choice of city unit chief||In an unprecedented method adopted to pick city unit chief of the party, Congress’s central leadership asked its 227 district presidents to record their choice for the Mumbai president’s post over a recorded call. The central leadership has announced that it will select the president of its Mumbai city by December-end. Mumbai Congress has 227 block presidents representing the municipal wards in the city. The block presidents received a message from HK Patil, Maharashtra in-charge for the party, in the afternoon instructing them to receive subsequent calls and follow the instructions. During the recorded calls, they were asked to record their choice for the post. Patil has already held rounds of meetings with key leaders from the city over past two months as part of the process of appointment of the new city chief and to understand the problems the unit facing. “This is happening for the first time that the workers in the last layer of leadership chain were asked for their opinion. Though the selection would not be fully dependent on the exercise, it will certainly be given a weightage besides the opinion given by other rank of leadership during earlier meetings,” said a senior leader from Mumbai Congress. The exercise, however, led to unexpected goof ups as some of the calls went to former block presidents who have already quit the party. “The block presidents were appointed five years ago. Some of them have died while some defected to other parties and a few shifted to other cities/districts. Some of the district presidents did not even know how to deal with an online poll and missed the opportunity to record the name of their choice. Some of them have also given names that are not even in the zone of consideration for the post,” said another senior leader. Patil on Thursday said that the new Mumbai president will be elected by month-end and the city unit will be in election mode by January. With the elections to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, one of the richest civic bodies in the country, just 13 months away, the Mumbai Congress does not have a full-time president for more than a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-congress-s-ward-level-leaders-asked-to-record-their-choice-of-city-unit-chief/story-TeNNMbNaS6X8NN88StZpgJ.html

Pawar, who is also former Union agriculture minister, said, “When the farmers are protesting on streets, it should be taken seriously. But, unfortunately, that is not happening.”He added, “I hope wisdom dawns on the government and it takes cognisance to resolve the issue. If this stalemate continues, the protest will not be limited to Delhi, but people from nooks and corners of the country will stand by the protesting farmers.”Pawar is expected to request the president to intervene in the ongoing protest by the farmers. He said that farmers from these states not only fill the stomachs of the citizens but are major contributors to India’s supply of food grains, especially rice and wheat, to more than a dozen countries. The NCP had staged a walk-out in the Rajya Sabha when the three farm bills were introduced in September during the parliament’s monsoon session.The situation on ground remains that thousands of farmers are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a week against the new farm laws.

Someone had set up a free Wi-Fi hot spot and written the login ID and password on several cardboard pieces, hung from strings.Farmers HT spoke to appeared unaware of the identity of the Good Samaritan. “We call the service of such Good Samaritans as ‘gupt sewa’ (anonymous service). There are people who do good, but don’t want to be identified,” said Sukwinder Singh, a resident of Sabhra village in Tarn Taran and joint secretary of Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan Committee (Punjab).The cardboard pieces announcing the free Wi-Fi wasn’t exactly without a name. While some carried the login ID and password, all mentioned the donor as “Aapka Abhishek” (your Abhishek). But they didn’t carry a full name, name of any organisation or a contact number.Also Read: At Singhu border, 2,000 personnel maintaining peace at farmers’ protestFarmers said the free Wi-Fi service appeared at a time when they had been struggling due to poor internet connectivity for days. “Due to a large gathering here, the phone network has been a problem. We were facing call drops and were hardly able to use the internet,” said Ramandeep Singh, a farmer from Rampura in Bhatinda.Jasveer Singh Piddi, vice president of Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Committee (Punjab), said the Wi-Fi has allowed farmers here to make video calls to their families back home. “The internet now is much better than before. Farmers are using this internet to even make voice calls. It has also helped the younger men to share content on social media,” said Piddi. There were also a couple of individuals, who are mainly into broadcasting the protests, who got Wi-Fi installed by paying an exorbitant price. Also Read: Weekend traffic calm, but brace for snarls today, say traffic police“Network has been a problem here and I wasn’t able to broadcast from here. So, someone offered to install Wi-Fi for a single user and charged me R25,000 for installation and a month’s usage. Since the protests are likely to continue for long, I decided to pay,” said Jitender Singh, a resident of Amritsar who runs a religious TV channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/free-wi-fi-for-farmers-at-singhu-border-they-don-t-know-who-to-thank/story-NB8iHaDCvR3Qbx4YHdQ4eI.html
07-12-2020||Delhi||Prosecution for mask violations dropped by 62% after increase in fine: Data||Prosecutions for not wearing face masks in public or workplaces in the national Capital have decreased by 62% ever since the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA) increased its fine from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 on November 19, an analysis of data provided by the city administration showed.The district-wise data also revealed that prosecutions for violating social-distancing norms in Delhi also came down by almost 54% between November 19 and November 30 — compared to the period from November 1 to November 18. But, the number of police cases or FIRs registered for not wearing masks and not maintaining social distance increased from 64 to 146 during the same period. Other than these two offences aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19, challans are also imposed for spitting in public places, consumption of liquor, pan or tobacco in public places and organising large public gatherings or congregations. It is to be noted that figures in this story is based on the actions taken by the district administrations of the Delhi government and is separate from the data which is maintained by the Delhi Police. In Delhi, not wearing masks attracts the highest fine and also constitutes the biggest share of revenue collection across all five categories.While between November 1-18, as many as 70,955 people were fined for not wearing masks, the same decreased to 26,845 in the latter half of the month after the penalty amount was increased by four times. Despite the penalty being increased from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000, the total revenue collection between November 19-30 was Rs 287,74,500, which is lower than Rs 359,29,800 — the amount collected between November 1 and November 18.“The expected collection from the violation of not wearing mask alone should be around Rs 5.36 crore post the increase in fine. But the city administration is yet to receive most of the money. This is because we prosecute people but let them pay the fine later by visiting the SDM office or the district courts. This provision was introduced last month when the penalty was hiked because it was found that most people do not carry that much cash on them,” said a senior officer in the chief minister’s office..A senior official of the north district administration, which fined the maximum number of people (12,782) last month for not wearing masks, said there are two reasons for the decline in the challans issued after an increase in penalty amount. “People just refuse to pay. They will fight tooth and nail, and argue for as long as two hours but not pay. Secondly, we have observed that the general level of people abiding by Covid-19 appropriate behaviour has improved quite a lot,” said the official, on condition of anonymity. An SDM of New Delhi district, which prosecuted the highest number of people across all categories in November, said the refusal of people wanting to pay the challan has increased because of which the number of FIRs registered in their district has also spiked. “The New Delhi district issued 15,235 challans in November for not following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Besides, our district has also registered the maximum number of FIRs (202) for the same as violators refused to pay the penalty,” said the SDM, who did not wish to be named. An enforcement inspector from the west district said the most common excuses include “selfie ke liye utara tha” (removed the mask to click a selfie), “ab saans bhi na le kya” (now can we not even take a breath?) and “bas do minute ke liye utara tha” (removed it just for two hours). Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayBS Vohra, president of East Delhi RWAs joint front said the government should also think of non-monetary penalties “to straighten people” who can afford to pay fines.“Most of the people in Delhi can pay the fine and get away. There should be an out of the box campaign to make a violator feel guilty, like in other states. Also, more personnel should be deployed to ensure social distancing because the rule is not being followed in the market and other crowded places,” he said.Lalit Kant, a scientist and former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said apart from merely levying a penalty, the administration should also train their enforcement teams including the police on the correct way of wearing a mask. “Even those who have their masks in their chins or keep it hanging from one ear should be prosecuted. In addition to prosecution, each violator should also be taught by the enforcement officer the proper way of wearing the mask. Also, it should be known that a face mask scores over a face shield, which many people now wear as if it’s a fashion. Wearing a mask is much better because it prevents droplets from going out to infect others. So, ultimately preventing the spread of the virus comes down to only wearing masks and wearing it right,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/prosecution-for-mask-violations-dropped-by-62-after-increase-in-fine-shows-data/story-fuOjoZouJ54HXbOEWVsKyL.html
07-12-2020||Delhi||At Singhu border, 2,000 personnel maintaining peace at farmers’ protest||Led by 10 deputy commissioners of police (DCsP), 20 assistant commissioners (ACsP) and 30 inspectors, 2,000 Delhi Police personnel have been working 12-hour shifts everyday for the last 10 days at the Singhu Border -- the protest side with the biggest gathering of farmers.They are supplemented by about 600 personnel of the paramilitary forces such as the Rapid Action Force, the Central Reserve Police Force and the Central Industrial Security Force. Every day, 20 buses have been making four to-and-fro rounds to pick and drop these police personnel between a common gathering point and the Singhu Border for 8am to 8pm and then 8pm to 8am shifts, said a senior police officer about how the police have been managing it’s staff as protesters continue to camp at this border point.These police personnel include about 25% women and they are from the local north-west district as well as adjoining districts. “There are also teams from special cell, crime branch, battalions and the traffic unit,” said the officer, requesting anonymity since he was not authorised to speak to the media. Also Read: Free Wi-Fi for farmers at Singhu Border, they don’t know who to thank“Each and every one of these personnel has been equipped with body protection gear, helmets and canes. If someone arrives without his or her gears, we have set up a temporary store room here to equip them on arrival,” the officer said, adding that about 2,000 tear gas shells stored there to deal with any eventuality. BASIC, BUT TIMELY MEALSWhile a few police personnel bring their own food, most rely on meals prepared at the protest site. “We have hired local chefs to cook lunch, dinner and tea every day. They have been cooking lunch for 1,200 police personnel, dinner for 600 personnel and about 4,000 cups of tea every day. Apart from the police, even some paramilitary personnel have these meals,” said Gaurav Sharma, DCP (outer-north), under whose jurisdiction the border area comes. The other police officer said the meals may be very basic, but they are cooked fresh and packed meals are a complete no-no for the police. The meals usually consists of rice-rajma, rice-chhole or poori-curry. On Sunday, kadhi-rice was on offer for lunch as about eight men and women went about cooking in an empty plot of land, about 50 metres from the barricades.DROP IN HOSTILITIES Initially, after a violent clash between farmers and police at Singhu Border, there was much hostility between the two sides. “Policemen would come with complaints that they were being taunted at the barricades. We would urge them not to respond,” said the first officer. The situation is quite different now.“The farmers often have been visiting us to offer their food. Some of us politely refuse, but I accept it as the farmers are our own people,” said a constable who belongs to a Haryana. A head constable, who too isn’t authorised to speak to the media, said farmers on the other side of the barricades include people from his village in Haryana. “My family is also into farming, but I have asked them to keep away because I know how quickly the situation can escalate,” the head constable said.MAKESHIFT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICEDCP Sharma said the police have now even begun to provide medical aid, ambulances and other help to the farmers. “The farmers who are on the Delhi side of the border sometimes come to us for help. Humanity matters more than anything else and we have set up a help desk where even farmers are welcome,” said the DCP. The help desk is operational from a neat, 10×25 feet metallic cabin. This is the police’s administrative room for the time being since November 29.Half-a-dozen policemen, led by an ACP, work on four computers in this cabin that is also equipped with two small and a large printer. “Every issue related to the police deployment, ranging from making rosters to holding meetings are done here,” said the DCP.Also Read| AAP to support Bharat Bandh called by farmers: Delhi CM KejriwalThis hurriedly set up cabin turned out to be an “opportunity in a crisis”. “The police booth at the border is set to be dismantled when a flyover scheduled to be constructed at this border point begins. This cabin will be turned into a police booth once the protests wind up,” said the first officer. For basic facilities like toilets and water, the police had sought help from civic agencies. “The Delhi Jal Board provides us with water tankers. We have 25 portable toilets deployed here. Two ambulances are on standby at any time and sanitation workers arrive every morning to clean the area,” said the officer.For the cold nights, the police have arranged 12 braziers (angeethis) for the personnel. “So far, about seven-eight police personnel have fallen sick at the border duty. They have been replaced,” said the officer. While camping at the borders for a prolonged period has been tough, the police had something to cheer on Saturday. “Since the protests have continued for longer than the police had anticipated, from Saturday we have decided to give a day off to every personnel by turn,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-singhu-border-2-000-personnel-maintaining-peace-at-farmers-protest/story-FzPkugbaRbnftwHWQYXN3N.html
07-12-2020||Delhi||Weekend traffic calm, but brace for snarls today, say traffic police||With the farmer protests intensifying at the border points of the national capital, the Delhi traffic police on Sunday advised commuters moving in and out of the city to use alternative routes to avoid snarls. While the traffic situation was under control over the weekend, the traffic police as warned that on Monday, motorists are likely to get caught in long snarls. “Those commuting to Delhi could take the Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway instead of the Delhi-Noida Link road. Chilla border on the Delhi-Noida Link Road is closed to traffic (Noida to Delhi side) due to the farmers’ protest near the Gautam Budh Dwar,” the traffic police said. It added, “The Ghazipur border on NH-24 is also closed to traffic from Ghaziabad to Delhi due to farmers’ protests. People are advised to avoid NH-24 for coming to Delhi.They may instead use Apsara, Bhopra and DND Flyway to reach Delhi.” The border points that are completely shut are Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Jharoda, Piao Maniyari, and Mangesh in outer and south-western parts of the city and Chilla border, connecting Delhi and Noida, in east Delhi. Also Read: As border agitations continue, vegetables and fruits may become costlierApart from the seven, the Delhi-Meerut Expressway at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border is also closed to vehicles coming to Delhi from Ghaziabad, while the opposite carriageway is open. The service road of NH-24 at the UP Gate is also closed as protesting farmers have occupied it for the past 11 days. The Chilla border remained closed on Sunday as well. Many motorists going to Noida were confused as the carriageway was closed with barricades at the start of the flyover near Mayur Vihar Phase-1 extension. “I had travelled to Noida via this road on Friday and then the road was open. Today (Sunday), the road is closed and I am stuck here near the border. No policeman was present at the flyover, from where the road was closed, to guide motorists on the alternative routes. I had to ask other commuters for options to reach Noida,” said Akash Kumar, a commuter. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic, east) G Ram Gopal Naik said the traffic police has been issuing alerts and advisories on social media regarding the closure of borders and the alternative routes to travel between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. “Since the Delhi-Meerut Expressway carriageway from Ghaziabad to Delhi is also blocked, the vehicles are entering the national capital through Bhopra, Apsara and Anand Vihar border points,” he said. About the possibility of a traffic chaos on Monday, DCP Naik said the presence of traffic personnel would be increased during the morning and evening hours on routes that have a high volume of traffic. Also Read: At Ghazipur border, farmers read up on Gandhi, Bhagat Singh and Che Guevara“We will deploy 12-15 traffic personnel at the main congestion points at the borders. The first three-four traffic signals from the congestion points are important and we will increase our presence to regulate the traffic manually. Regular updates are posted on social media and we use the platform to communicate with people. The traffic helpline is also functional 24x7,” Naik said. To make matters worse, a repair work near NH-24 by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) may also lead to further jams on the stretch. The DJB said a pipeline, which was around 25 feet below the highway, had burst and the work might go on for a few days. “Our team is in place and is tracking the point of leakage,” a DJB spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/weekend-traffic-calm-but-brace-for-snarls-today-says-traffic-police/story-pVdLkwUfvFsYPLI2ZQckAL.html
07-12-2020||Delhi||As border agitations continue, vegetables and fruits may become costlier||With agitating farmers continuing to block most border points in Delhi, traders and agriculture produce market committees on Sunday said prices of fruits and vegetables are likely to shoot up in the capital city this week, unless the central government succeeds in resolving the standoff with farmers who are protesting against three contentious laws passed by Parliament around three months ago.In Delhi’s Azadpur agriculture market – which accounts for more than 80% of fruits and vegetables supplied across Delhi-NCR – average arrivals have dropped to about 5,500 metric tonnes a day, against the supply of around 11,500 metric tonnes daily during the same time last year, said Adil Khan, chairperson of Azadpur agriculture produce market committee (APMC).Also Read: At Ghazipur border, farmers read up on Gandhi, Bhagat Singh and Che GuevaraKhan said, “The central government should listen to the demands of farmers and resolve the issue at the earliest. So far, price of fruits and vegetables have not shot up significantly as traders are catering to local supply only for the past one week and not dispatching produce out of state. But now, they are almost out of stock -- the drop in supply is too steep.”Haji Yamin, a trader based in the Okhla agriculture produce market, said, “Even kitchen staples such as onions, which can be stored for some time, will be out of stock in another two or three days. Supply has been badly hit and soon we will not be able to cater to the local demand either. The government must resolve issues with farmers at the earliest.”Nandgopal Ravi, a trader based in Ghazipur agriculture produce market, said some produce such as green peas and certain varieties of oranges have already started witnessing an increase in wholesale rates. “In no time, people will see prices going up in their neighbourhood shops and local retail markets.”Also Read| AAP to support Bharat Bandh called by farmers: Delhi CM KejriwalCurrently, farmer groups camping at around seven different border points in Delhi.

07-12-2020||Delhi||At Ghazipur border, farmers read up on Gandhi, Bhagat Singh and Che Guevara||The space beneath the Ghazipur flyover on Sunday got a makeshift library and reading area, complete with a wide array of books and chairs for perusers to sit and read at their comfort, while alongside the hundreds of farmers continued with their blockade of the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh (UP) border in protest against the new farm laws passed by Parliament. The library was set up by a group of youngsters, mostly children of farmers, and books on social issues and freedom fighters such as Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh and Kartar Singh Sarabha occupy the pride of place. Also on display are the Hindi translation of writings by Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara and Russian author Maxim Gorky. Shalu Panwar, 22, a daughter of a farmer from Shamli district in Uttar Pradesh, said she and her friends and members of a youth group ‘Vikalp Manch’ together set up the library. “We wanted to create a space to engage protesting farmers into something productive. Under the banner of the Vikalp Manch, we also publish some literature on farmers and social issues. So, we thought we should come here and set up a library for our farmer brethren. We have also got a detailed booklet published on these three new black laws in order to make farmers aware about them thoroughly,” she said.

None can fight a war without having a proper knowledge about the cause. Our farmers should also know about social revolutions that took place in countries such as Russia and Cuba.”Many farmers were seen visiting the library throughout the day on Sunday. Some of them also purchased the books which are being offered at minimal prices -- between ₹5 and ₹50. Gurvinder Singh, 54, a farmer from a village in Amroha district bought a booklet titled “Anti-people, anti-farmers, three new farm laws”. “Although I know about the three new laws, I want to read this book cover to cover so that no politician can mislead me and other like me by making false claims about the laws.” Inderpal, 38, a farmer from Hapur, picked up a book on “farming and capitalism”. “I want to read more on the historical evidence of how big companies took advantage of poor farmers like us.The three new farm laws will provide more opportunity to them to do so.”The youth group has decided to put up the library every day from morning to evening till the protest continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-ghazipur-border-farmers-read-up-on-gandhi-bhagat-singh-and-che-guevara/story-v2MHIPjTMiYbhm2rZ9Z3oK.html
07-12-2020||Delhi||AAP to support Bharat Bandh called by farmers: Delhi CM Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday said that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would support the Bharat Bandh announced by the farmer groups on Tuesday to protest against the three contentious farm laws.“The AAP would support the Bharat Bandh called by farmer groups on December 8. AAP volunteers too would join hands with farmers in peaceful protests across the country on that day. It’s an appeal to citizens of India to support the farmers,” said Kejriwal, who is also the national convener of the AAP, in a tweet.Kejriwal’s declaration of support to the agitation comes on a day when Union minister of state for agriculture Kailash Choudhary reiterated that the three laws were in favour of the farmers and were unlikely to be repealed as has been the demand by the farmers. He added that if necessary, the government will make some amendments to the laws to take into account the wishes of the agitating farmers.Farmers are protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, enacted by the Parliament in September.

India is an agricultural country and if farmers are unhappy then the country is affected. I appeal to all to join the protest,” said Rai.AAP Lok Sabha MP from Punjab, Bhagwant Mann said, “We will do our best to support farmers in the nationwide strike on December 8. This strike is not political. It is about farmers, their land, and their livelihood. It concerns the entire nation. I urge everyone to support farmers.

07-12-2020||Delhi||Police claim to arrest founding member of SIMI from Delhi||The Delhi Police’s special cell on Sunday said they had arrested one of the founding members of the banned Students’ Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), who had been evading his arrest for 19 years in a sedition and unlawful activity case registered in Delhi in 2001.Abdullah Danish, the 58-year-old suspected member of the banned organisation, was declared a proclaimed offender by a Delhi court in the case in 2002. He was caught from Delhi’s Zakir Nagar on Saturday, said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah. Special cell officials said that Danish had allegedly indoctrinated many Muslim men, including the former chiefs of SIMI, Safdar Hussain Nagori and Abdul Subhan Qureshi alias Taukeer. Qureshi, who had earned the nickname of “India’s Osama bin Laden”, was involved in the 2008 Gujarat serial blasts. He was also the co-founder of terrorist organisation, Indian Muhajideen (IM), which carried out a series of blasts in Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Delhi between May and September 2008, they said.DCP Kushwah said that for the past one year, the special cell sleuths were receiving inputs regarding Danish’s movements in various cities of Uttar Pradesh and in Delhi-NCR.“As per information, Danish was indulging in radicalising Muslim youths to mobilise against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) and propagating hardcore radical ideology to create disharmony among religious groups. By using fake videos, he was falsely propagating atrocities being committed upon Muslims by the government of India,” the DCP said.The special cell team collected requisite intelligence about Danish and mounted surveillance on him and other former SIMI members. The team learnt that Danish would be coming to Delhi’s Zakir Nagar to meet some of the members. Accordingly, a trap was laid and he was caught on Saturday.About the sedition and unlawful activity case in which Danish was wanted, DCP Kushwah said that after the government banned SIMI in September 2001, its office bearers were addressing a press conference near their headquarters in Jamia Nagar, Delhi, when the police conducted a raid and arrested many SIMI activists. Danish and a few others managed to escape from there.After the escape, Danish went to Aligarh and thereafter to Azamgarh. He kept on changing his locations to evade arrest in the case.Danish completed his Masters in Arabic from Aligarh Muslim University in 1985 and joined SIMI. For the next four years, he edited the Hindi edition of the magazine published by SIMI, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-claim-to-arrest-founding-member-of-simi-from-delhi/story-7KxCIAvlqumpuCQ5gFuKVJ.html

07-12-2020||Pune||PMC begins cold storage hunt to ensure vaccine distribution||Since the announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, that a Covid-19 vaccine would be made available in the coming weeks, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has now expedited the process to identify cold storage facilities for the vaccine to be stored. The corporation is also exploring the possibilities of the Serum Institute’s vaccine being approved with the civic body only managing the supply chain. The PMC is now planning to identify cold storage units for the Covid-19 vaccine. Additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “This is at a very preliminary stage as the vaccine is not yet finalised. However, we have started talking to agencies who existing storage facilities, as building a new one will be too expensive. We have also spoken to consultants who have informed us that the maintenance cost of such cold storage facilities is also high. We have spoken to three such agencies which have cold storage facilities. Renting the space would be an easier option for us. The rentals are based on per square foot and so the number of doses and the packaging size would also be a factor in deciding the cost.”Further Agarwal said, “It also depends on which vaccine is being approved. If the vaccine comes from Pune then we might not even need a storage facility we will just have to manage the cold chain supply. If it is a UK or the Hyderabad vaccine then we will have to find a cold storage facility. However, these are very preliminary discussions and we are yet to make any decision.” Pune will also be the central point for Pune division which includes the districts of Solapur, Satara, Kolhapur and also Ahmednagar. Divisional Commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “We will have about 34 storage facilities, the only for the city will be managed by PMC while for the rest of the district and also for the division storage units would be at Pune.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-begins-cold-storage-hunt-to-ensure-vaccine-distribution/story-FWfary0ElmyHuXlI8ScC7J.html

These eager bicyclists had chosen to leave their motorised vehicles at home and chose instead to spend the Sunday riding their cycles instead.It is all part of a pledge initiated by the Bavdhan Citizens’ Forum, a group of residents, who started the novel idea “No Vehicle Sunday”, on the first Sunday of every month.At least 180 residents from Bavdhan and the adjoining areas joined in to pledge to keep their roads free of motorised vehicles on this Sunday.The group had organized their first “no-vehicle Sunday” on November 1 with 30 residents, but by their second drive, held on December 6, saw 180 people including, the four corporators, show up to support this initiative.“The idea is to give people a chance to live life breathing fresh air instead of the daily pollution caused by heavy traffic on this road, which is a crucial road connecting Kothrud and Pashan,” said Dushyant Bhatia, resident and member of the Bavdhan Citizens’ Forum.“We appeal to people to avoid the use of vehicles using social media,” he added.Rudra Khandelwal is an eager bicyclist living in Kothrud. He brought his friends along with their bicycles to join this initiative. “I got to know from my friends in Bavdhan about this idea and thought this could be a great way to remain fit and also bring friends together,” said Khandelwal.Jyoti Loharkar and her little daughter Smruti, residents of Bavdhan, walked 2.6km while the cyclists cycled for 5km through the lanes of Bavdhan.“I like walking and so does my daughter but I am afraid of the traffic on the roads, but this idea is very good. When we stop using our vehicles, we are helping keep space for pedestrians and also enjoying fresh air,” said Loharkar.Corporators Dilip Vedepatil, Kiran Dagade Patil, Alpana Varpe and Shradha Prabhune too joined in walk and showed their support for the residents’ initiative.Vedepatil said, “This is a good initiative and will help reduce pollution caused by large number of vehicles on this road, especially on Sunday, when families drive to the shops for groceries.”“The aim is to make Bavdhan clean and one of best suburbs in the city, that is our motto and we will keep going on until we convince people to leave their vehicles at home on Sunday,” said C S Krishnan, resident of Bavdhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-vehicle-sunday-gives-bavdhan-residents-a-fresh-breath-of-life/story-VVCXs1O4d60pEs9OQAkUzO.html

07-12-2020||Chandigarh||Two JJP MLAs come out in support of agitating farmers||Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) MLAs Ram Kumar Gautam from Narnaund and Amarjeet Singh from Julana, on Sunday, extended support to the farmers’ agitation across the country and urged the Union government to withdraw the three controversial farm laws .Talking to HT over the phone, Gautam said he understood the farmers’ pain and added that Haryana governor Satyadeo Narain Arya should call an assembly session to discuss the farmers’ issues.“ All the MLAs should pass a resolution unanimously to reject these three laws. If the government considers that these laws are good, it should bring in new legislation in a few months after consultations with farmers. In the present situation, however, the government should repeal these laws,” he added.Slamming politicians for saying that the farmers were “Khalistanis backed with support of China and Pakistan” he said they (farmers) were being “insulted by a few people linking the agitation with other issues. The protesters are farmers who belong to all sections of the society. It is very painful that those who provide us food are out on the roads giving voice to their legitimate demands. The government’s image will take a hit if it delays taking a decision,” he added.When asked if he would resign as MLA if the government did not repeal the laws, Gautam said he would take a call on the matters after assessing the situation.Calling himself “a farmer first and then an MLA,” Amarjeet Singh said, “The elderly farmers are sitting out in the cold for their demands. These farmers are producing food for us and they are protesting for valid reasons.”With this, four out of 10 JJP MLAs, including Jogi Ram Sihag from Barwala, Ram Karan from Shahbad and Ram Gautam are supporting the farmers’ agitation.Earlier, Dadri MLA Sombir Sangwan withdrew his support from the government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and JJP.The BJP-JJP coalition government (40 BJP MLAs, 10 JJP MLAs) has the support of a few independent MLAs, including independent MLA Ranjit Singh (Rania segment) who is a Cabinet rank minister in the government. Meanwhile, three zila parishad members from Jind, Hisar and Bhiwani also resigned from their posts in support to the farmers.Narendra Raj Gagarwas from ward 27 in Bhiwani, Amit Nidani from Jind’s zone 16 and Jassi Petwad from Hisar quit nearly two months before the end of their tenure.Narendra said he had decided to resign from his post to express his solidarity with farmers. “I urge others to join the list by resigning from various political posts to support farmers. The government should repeal these laws,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/call-assembly-session-to-discuss-farmers-crisis-says-jjp-rebel-mla-ram-kumar-gautam/story-V1OrlMIrKJdSIhLom1kI1L.html
07-12-2020||Delhi||Farmer langars treat the poor, homeless on Delhi border points to a full plate||Ten-year-old Rubiyal and his sister Masuma, 8, have not gone to make-shift school since Wednesday. They live with their parents, both of them scrap collectors, in a shanty close to Singhu border (Delhi-Haryana border), where hundreds of farmers have been camping since the past 10 days to protest against the Centre’s farm laws. The children say if they go to school, they’ll miss out on the food from the farmers’ langar ( community kitchen).The langars are not just feeding the farmers camped at the border-- they have also come as a boon to several underprivileged people in the vicinity of the blockade as well as countless homeless people who otherwise would have struggled for even one square meal a day. The langars now treat them to three square meals daily and tea -- served three times a day -- fruits, kheer and sweet rice as prasad (offering) and snacks. Most of the beneficiaries of the farmers’ goodwill are scrap collectors and the used paper plates and plastic items from the langars also ensure them their daily livelihood, without them having to go scouting for discarded items. “We come here around 9am. Today, there was tea, mattri (snack), biscuits and oranges for breakfast, followed by a sumptuous lunch of chapattis and vegetable rice. In the evening, they gave us sugarcane and bananas,” said Rubiyal, who attended the langar with Masuma and their toddler brother.He studies in class three informal school set-up by activists and NGOs but has been skipping classes since Wednesday to enjoy the meals. “Mostly, we have dinner at home, cooked by my mother, as my parents do not allow us to venture out after dark,” he said. Both his parents are scrap collectors and Rubiyal helps them when he is not at school.Sheikh Rahim, 14, who is also a regular at the langars, said he daily carries away sacks full of used paper plates, thermocol tumblers and plastic spoons to further sell them as scrap and earn a living. His father died a few years ago and he lives with his mother in a shanty nearby.“I do not go to school. I work with my mother. For the past one week, we have collected enough waste from the protest site and the famers take care of our daily meals,” the teenager said.With the protest against the Centre’s farm laws entering its 10th day at the SInghu border and other border points, several langars are being organised throughout the day by farmers camped at these places. The farmers have come prepared for a long standoff -- they have with them kilos of vegetables, rations, spices and other items; enough to last them for at least four to five months. Lakho, 13, who works at a small roadside shop run by her family, was among those who received fruits, food packets, and a cup of tea on Saturday at the Ghazipur border. “The food is tastier than what we regularly eat. During the Covid-19 lockdown, we did not have enough food for our family. The farmers are giving us a one-time meal which is quite helpful,” she said.Jasveer Singh, senior pradhan, Bhartiya Kaisan Ekta, who has come from Sidhupur, Punjab, said many people apart from farmers eat at their langars and some even take food home. “All are welcome and we are here to do sewa (social service). We have trolleys full of rations and vegetables to survive for at least six months. We hold langars several times a day to ensure that no one is left without food,” said Singh, who is camping at Singhu border.He added that on Saturday he and the other farmer leaders have advised their langar in-charges to go to other borders areas where farmers from Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand are camped and to offer them food as a token of their solidarity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmer-langars-treat-the-poor-homeless-in-border-points-to-a-full-plate/story-3ucDRAcskAhC4fryOOGmXN.html

In 2004, Housefed had floated the scheme for construction of 632 flats in five categories at Sector 79.The allottees were promised possession in 2006 and payment for 140 flats in Category 3 was collected from them. But, the draw of only 88 flats was conducted in 2014. The remaining 52 allottees were informed that they will be provided flats at a later stage, as Punjab Housefed did not have enough land to build them. Ravinder Dogra, one of the allottees, said, despite several assurances, construction was never started in the past 16 years, forcing us to live in rented accommodations. Another allottee, wishing not to be named, said a consent letter was sent to the 52 allottees that either they can avail of refund, along with 10% interest, or they will have to bear the price increase in future. “All allottees agreed to bear the price hike, if any. In 2004 when the scheme was launched, the Category-3 flats were priced at Rs 9 lakh. In 2014, when the draw was conducted for 88 flats, the rate was fixed between Rs 19 lakh and Rs 21.25 lakh,” he said, adding that till date neither the possession of the remaining 52 flats had been handed over nor had any interest been given to the allottees. “The agreement to build the flats has already been signed with Markfed and they are completing formalities to begin construction within a month,” said Amarjit Singh, managing director, Housefed.The Punjab State Federation of Cooperative House Building Societies Ltd, commonly known as Housefed, was set up on November 17, 1970, to tackle housing problems in the state, by providing financial assistance to individuals for construction of houses in rural and urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-16-year-delay-markfed-to-construct-52-flats-in-mohali-s-sector-79-in-january/story-lReEoupjseyvGzahtlXVZJ.html
