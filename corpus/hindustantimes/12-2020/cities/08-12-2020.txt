In response to the authority’s notices sent to recover the advertising rights’ fee, the businessmen sought exemption for the lockdown period.In view of demands, the authority has decided not to collect the fees applicable for the period between March 22 and June 30, 2020 out of their total licence fees, officials said. The Noida authority was able to rake in ₹14 crore and ₹18 crore through outdoor advertising during 2017-18 and 2019-20.“₹1 crore was the licence fees that had to be collected and the remaining ₹40 lakh was the accrual interest amount due to non-payment. But now complete waiver will be offered to the advertisers for the lockdown period. We will revise our books to take haircut of about ₹1.40 crore due to this decision,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty, Noida authority.But the waiver will be given only if the advertisers settle their dues by January 31, 2021.A spokesperson from Vani Advertising said, “We are happy with the move of the authority because the pandemic has shattered our business.”The city has a total of 133 licensed unipole operators at present. Among them, 115 have been installed at public toilets while the other 18 digital hoardings and wraps have been put up over 18 foot over bridges across the city. The 133 unipoles were given out as per build-operate-transfer model in the past and the license fees was revised last time in April 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-waives-off-1-4-cr-advertising-fee-of-businessmen/story-luHqfOgqZj9nf1LLuYBeLM.html
08-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Over 120 health workers get Covid-19 infection during treatment of positive patients||NOIDA: As many as 122 health workers, including doctors and paramedics, in Gautam Budh Nagar have tested positive for Covid-19 since March 8 when the first positive case was detected in the district. Also, one of them succumbed to the viral infection, according to the data provided by district health department. Officials said that these health workers got the viral infection while working in the isolation wards of different Covid-dedicated facilities in the district. On Tuesday, with death of a Covid-19 patient, the overall death toll in GB Nagar district has gone to 85. However, with 114 new cases and 139 others cured, the active cases on Tuesday in the district have come down to 965. The district has so far recorded over 23,500 positive cases. District chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that all the health workers (except one), who got the viral infection during the treatment of positive patients, have been tested negative now. “Most of them have resumed their duties and they have no post-Covid complications right now. However, their follow-up is regularly being taken by the staff of their hospitals concerned,” he said. He further said that after the Covid-19 outbreak, the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) was made the first Covid facility. “Later, many government and private hospitals were included in this list, to accommodate the rising number of positive cases in the district. Ever since the state government allowed home isolation facilities for asymptomatic patients on July 25, the number of patients in these facilities has come down significantly,” he said. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the health officials have been asked to ramp up effective and qualitative contact tracing, to check the further spread of infection. “We have ensured effective mapping of those areas, from where more cases are being detected. Based on this mapping, focussed surveillance in those areas has also been ramped up. The health officials have been asked to ensure maximum number of RT-PCR tests in those high-risk areas,” he said. Suhas further said that apart from increasing the testing, stress is being laid on proper contact tracing. “In the present situation, early and timely tracking and providing adequate treatment are the main goals before the administration. Our main focus is on reducing the number of deaths and curing the maximum possible number of infected patients on time. For that, the health workers have been told to ensure maximum contact tracing – precisely finding out 25 contacts of one infected patient. While recovery rate in GB Nagar is still over 90%, the current case fatality rate (CFR) is around 0.36%, which is much better than the state’s overall CFR of 1.42%,” the DM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-over-120-health-workers-get-covid-19-infection-during-treatment-of-positive-patients/story-jZG0jkJRQiFAsCuPB3oFHK.html

08-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Garbage burning continues even as city suffers ‘severe’ air quality||Noida: Even as Noida has been suffering ‘sever’ air quality for the past five days, garbage burning continues unabated in the city. On Tuesday, residents of Bahlolpur village in Sector 63 complained of a huge waste fire allegedly lit by some miscreants. Stating that scrap dealers often dump garbage in their area, especially near the Bahlolpur underpass in Sector 63 along the FNG road, the residents complained that garbage is often set afire there.“Garbage is dumped along the roadsides or in open areas and set afire at least twice a week. Though waste is picked regularly, the dumping is random, especially by rag pickers and scrap dealers who get it from neighbouring factories and dump it here. We are used to feeling uneasy due to the smoke. We have been complaining about the same over Twitter and WhatsApp group, but the incidents persist,” said Sonu Yadav, vice-president of Bahlolpur RWA, Sector 63. The residents said that the underpass, which connects Sector 63 with the FNG road, is under construction and leads to a lot of dust due to heavy traffic, and incidents of garbage burning only add to the pollution. “On Tuesday, some people set a huge pile of garbage on fire near Radha Krishna Temple in Sector 63. We complained a few officers and later doused the fire by soiling it. This has become a common phenomenon,” said Sundar Yadav, a resident of Bahlolpur. “The issue needs to be resolved as the area is not a dump yard. But it has become a common practice to dump and burn garbage here,” said Naresh Singh, another resident. Garbage dumping and setting it afire had been an issue often reported by residents from other parts of the city too. In the past, complaints of waste burning have been reported from different residential areas, including sectors 123, 77, 51 and 54. Officials at the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said they will look into the matter.“We will look into it and act accordingly. Garbage should not be dumped openly, and we have several times asked the authorities concerned to ensure that garbage or dry waste is regularly picked up from such open areas. Earlier as well, such cases of open burning had been reported and we had rushed fire tenders to douse them off,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida. Officials of the Noida authority could not be contacted despite several attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-garbage-burning-continues-even-as-city-suffers-severe-air-quality/story-9sR4Nx678FezgwQx3LyqcP.html
08-12-2020||Noida||Noida: People using residential properties for commercial activities to face heavy penalty||NOIDA: The Noida authority has decided to impose a heavy penalty if commercial activities are operated from residential premises. The penalty will be 1% of total cost of the property, said officials. This means that if the value of a property is Rs1 crore as per prevailing circle rate, then the property owner will have to pay Rs1 lakh as penalty. The penalty will only be acceptable with the rider that the concerned project engineer submits their report that the property owner has shut down the commercial activity. In addition, the defaulting property owner will have to submit an affidavit stating that he or she will not restart the commercial activity.The authority has also decided to cancel the allotment of a property if the owner is found violating the land usage, even after submitting an affidavit stating that no commercial activity will be restarted.The authority started the move following residents’ complaints of unauthorised activities running from residential premises.Officials said the move will benefit the city.“The Noida authority will act as per law against commercial activities in residential premises. These not only create civic mess but also affect the objectives of planned development adversely,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.The Uttar Pradesh government had on April 17, 1976 established Noida a well-planned city where residential, commercial, institutional and mixed-land use, among plots of other usage, were allotted to property owners. As per rules, if an owner of a residential plot or flat is found running an office or a commercial activity from the property then it is in violation of building bylaws. Commercial plots are allotted for commercial activities keeping in mind the requirement of parking, waste disposal and other requirements.“If the property owner starts commercial activities in a property meant for residential usage then it leads to parking mess, violation of building bylaws and other civic issues in a locality. Therefore, the authority has brought in a policy to act tough against all kinds of properties, which are doing activities not permitted on that land,” said a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to the media.Residents’ groups also supported the authority’s move, saying that unauthorised activities near people’s homes are a nuisance which give rise to unauthorised parking and traffic in small lanes.“The authority must act promptly and tough against whosoever is found using residential premises for activities which are not permitted there, because commercial activities trouble all those living near such a premise,” said PS Jain, president of confederation of National Capital Region residents’ welfare associations (CONRWA), a residents’ group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-people-using-residential-properties-for-commercial-activities-to-face-heavy-penalty/story-z3az1dBSNelYputSdSMBUI.html

Also, over 100 district-level leaders of major political parties, including Congress, were put on preventive detention, which resulted in thin gathering at the Chilla Border and Dalit Prerna Sthal, the police said. Besides, the police also used drone cameras to keep aerial surveillance across the district. Some local farmer leaders were also put on preventive detention, the police said.However, a group of 50 farmers protested at the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and halted traffic for one hour in Greater Noida. The police said they had to divert the traffic. About 20 supporters of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lok Shakti) tried to march from Dalit Prerna Sthal to DND Flyway, but were stopped by the police near DND Flyway loop and returned. The protest at Chilla border also remained mild, the police said. “We wanted to take DND Flyway and go to the Rashtrapati Bhawan to submit a memorandum. But the Noida police stopped us on the way. We have submitted the memorandum here and returned to the protest venue at 2.30pm,” said Thakur Swaraj Singh Bhati, national president of BKU (Lok Shakti). About 30 workers of BKU-Bhanu protested peacefully at Chilla border. Yogesh Pratap Singh, UP president of BKU-Bhanu, said that the government had engaged its entire machinery to fail the nationwide strike. “They have arrested some farmer leaders to ensure they do not come here for protest. But we will continue our protest till the demands are met,” he said. There was no major impact on businesses as most of the markets remained open. The bus, auto and truck services were functional in the district. Chaudhury Vedpal Singh, president of Noida Transport Sanyukt Morcha, said, “We have not joined the strike as it is purely a farmers’ call. There are over 6,000 trucks in our association. But we are not sending trucks in sensitive areas where protests are happening due to safety reasons,” he said. Om Prakash Gurjar, president of Noida auto union, said that there are 20,000 autos in the district. “We did not join the strike on Tuesday. Autos were running as usual in Noida,” he said. A visit to Sector 18 market found that most of the shops, food joints, etc. were open. SK Jain, president of Sector 18 Market Association, said that local traders have not joined the protest. “There is no enforcement of closure of shops. There was no significant impact of strike on traders. Since today is Tuesday, some individual shops may be closed due to weekly off,” he said.C B Jha, president of Atta Market Association, said that the market remained open. “There are 700 shops in the market and most of them were open. We are with the farmers, but we feel the issue has been politicised,” he said. Jha said that a police team had met him on Monday evening and assured of safety and security. However, at Sharma Market in Sector 27, several shops of garment and electronic gadgets were closed. Several local political leaders were taken into preventive detention. Manoj Chaudhury, district president of GB Nagar Congress, said that he had returned home on Monday night from a marriage ceremony. “A team from Beta II police station reached my home and detained me. They brought me to the police station and said I have to stay here till Tuesday afternoon. They released me at 3pm,” he said. Bhupendra Jadaun, GB Nagar AAP president, said that Noida police detained him for 18 hours to ensure he does not attend the protest on Tuesday. “On Monday 11pm, a police team had come to my home. They asked if I had any plan of protest on Tuesday. I said I will attend a peaceful protest in support of farmers. The police brought me to police station at night and released me at 5pm on Tuesday,” he said.Ashray Gupta, former president of Samajwadi Party youth brigade in Noida, said that the local police had also called him and asked about his plan. “I did not reveal my plan. In the morning, we protested at Shaheed Smarak Noida Sector 37 and then reached the Chilla border to extend support to farmers,” he said.Police officials said that the protests remained peaceful in the district. “We had made a coordinated effort and identified 110 persons belonging to different political parties and associations. The police put them under preventive detention till Tuesday evening and later released on personal bond. We also flew drone cameras but did not find any suspicious activity in the district,” said Love Kumar, additional commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar. The officials said that GB Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh also inspected DND Flyway and other areas on Tuesday. The traffic was smooth at Kalindi Kunj and DND Flyway as the police did not allow protesters reach there, they said, adding that the Chilla border remained closed on both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-protests-remain-peaceful-in-noida-amid-tight-security-over-100-political-leaders-put-under-preventive-detention/story-NAS4fwfGIXr6QE3H6UzvFM.html
08-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC plans to hand over waste processing plant to private contractor||The municipal corporation is once again considering plans to hand over the waste processing plant in Sector 25 to a private contractor.It is likely to invite expression of interest from various agencies to run and upgrade the plant.The MC had taken over the plant around six months back from the Jaypee Group after a bitter dispute over its management.The plant is currently working at around 10% of its capacity, adding to the challenges of processing solid waste in a city that produces nearly 470 metric tonnes of waste daily. Like Jaypee, MC too has been disposing of unprocessed waste at the Dadumajra dumping ground.“For better utilisation of the plant, MC is planning to invite expression of interest from agencies. They will upgrade or replace the existing machinery and manage the plant,” said a senior MC official on condition of anonymity.The plant was built in 2008 according to Municipal Solid Waste 2000 (MSW) guidelines. “All machines are already 12 years old, at the end of their life. Primary and secondary shredders are not in working condition,” the official said.Notably, the National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research here, in a report earlier this year had said that “complete replacement of the machinery to process municipal solid waste with new technology” was required.The civil engineering department of the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (IIT-R), in its Status report of 500 TPD (tonnes per day) solid waste processing plant, Chandigarh, had something else to say. The machinery required immediate repairs and maintenance and after that the could “be run at 40% of its capacity”.IIT-R had advocated setting up “a new modern 500 TPD plant for dry and wet waste treatment in the given plot. For the wet waste stream – biological treatment will be required to meet Solid Waste Management Rules (SWM), 2016,” the report said.NGT PANEL VISITS PLANTMeanwhile, the National Green Tribunal (NGT)-formed panel led by justice Pritam Pal on Monday visited the processing plant, three waste recovery centres and other sites. The panel directed the MC official to run the plant at its optimum capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-plans-to-hand-over-waste-processing-plant-to-private-contractor/story-bd31XivkI58VvVVmgzKIiM.html
08-12-2020||Noida||Covid protocols openly flouted with large gathering at UP Gate||Ghaziabad: The farmers’ protest at the UP Gate on National Highway 9 have been continuing since November 28, with farmers who have come in from different areas of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, and other neighbouring states, but adhering to coronavirus (Covid-19) protocols is hardly observed at the site and the administrative officers seem to have given the least priority to the issue.The attendance at the UP Gate, below the flyover and also on NH 9, swelled to an estimated 3,000 people, besides heavy deployment of police and security personnel. The farmers, since the past 11 days have been camping at the site in their tractor-trolleys, with dozens sleeping in shared spaces and others huddled together in meetings and smoking common “hookahs” (smoking pipes). While those wearing masks were also seen among the crowd, many were without any face masks and social distancing was largely flouted in large gatherings. The farmers, however, said that if the pandemic doesn’t kill them, the farm bills surely will.“We are sleeping below tractor-trolleys in the winter chill and still there is no decision made by the government. We saw how much gathering was there during the Bihar assembly elections and also during the recent elections in Hyderabad. None of these politicians adhered to Covid-19 protocols. We feel that even if we escape Covid-19 somehow, these new farm bills will be our death knell. We are trying to adhere to protocols but it becomes very difficult in such large gatherings,” said Harpal Singh, a farmer from Bareilly district who has been camping at site. “We farmers have strong immunity and we will not get affected by Covid-19. We work in fields and in adverse conditions, so Covid-19 will not affect us. We eat eight-10 rotis (chapati) without any ghee, and sweat in fields. So, it draws out diseases and boosts our immunity. Many farmers have brought face masks with them but they are not using it as they have to often speak and raise slogans during the protest,” said Hari Bhagwan, a farmer from Lakhimpur Kheri in UP.Others said that focussing on their demands was more vital for farmers than focussing on Covid-19 and adhering to norms. “If there is strict adherence, our protests will suffer. Instead, we are focussing our energies towards the government so that they listen to our demands. They brought the bills in a hurry during the pandemic. If farmers are not happy then other like traders, shop-owners, etc., will also face difficulties,” said Jagandeep Singh, a farmer from Gurdaspur in Punjab, adding that he is camping at UP Gate for past two-three days and had also visited other protest sites at Singhu-border and Tikri-border.The district administration officials, however, offered a limited response over the issue and said that they are trying their level best to pursue farmers to adhere to Covid-19 protocols. “We have held meetings with them and appraised them about Covid-19 protocols and requested them to take precautions. We are also taking up regular sanitisation of the UP Gate area where protests are being held,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad.The district health department officials said that they have no testing camp at the protest site at present.“We have not setup any testing camp here as these are protesting farmers and may not pay heed to our requests. So, a camp at the site may not be feasible. The entire focus of the police and the administration is on ensuring that protests remain peaceful,” said an officer from the health department, who asked to remain anonymous. The UP Gate area is adjacent to Indirapuram locality, which has had the highest number of Covid-19 cases – 2,819 – in the Ghaziabad district till November 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-protocols-openly-flouted-with-large-gathering-at-up-gate/story-bs4fhxqmqe9A2sIIK1QiOI.html
08-12-2020||Noida||Bandh call reduces traffic on Ghaziabad roads by 40%||Ghaziabad: The Bharat bandh call given by protesting farmers on Tuesday saw a substantial reduction in traffic on major city roads, as compared to normal days. The officials of the Ghaziabad traffic police said that traffic on roads was estimated to have gone down by about 40%.The majority the protest was concentrated at UP Gate, where the farmers lay seize of the Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway. They vacated the area around 3pm; when the duration of the nationwide strike, which began at 11am, ended.“As a result of the bandh call, people preferred not to move out and this considerably reduced traffic. We estimate that there was a reduction of about 40% of traffic on Tuesday, as compared to any normal day. The majority of our traffic personnel, about 70-80%, were deployed at UP Gate and other nearby borders with Delhi,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic), Ghaziabad. Traffic officials said that the diversions, which were announced earlier in the wake of the blockade of Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway, will continue and that people were advised to make use of Kaushambi-Anand Vihar border instead.“I had to take an off from office and did not take any risk of getting stuck in protests or jams on the day of Bharat bandh. Even on regular days, there are long traffic snarls at Kaushambi-Anand Vihar border due to diversions. The traffic police should also consider opening the Hindon elevated road from Raj Nagar Extension to Indirapuram so that commuters can at least travel up to Indirapuram to get to trans-Hindon areas,” said Kuldeep Saxena, a resident of Shakti Khand in Indirapuram. The 10.3-km Hindon elevated road has been shut for vehicles by the traffic officials from the Raj Nagar Extension side, as it takes commuters to UP Gate where farmers are holding protests. The other side of the elevated road – from UP Gate to Raj Nagar Extension – is, however, open. “I had gone to Ghazipur (East Delhi) in morning and had to walk afoot as there were no autos since the Ghaziabad-Delhi side of highway is blocked. Since the other side also got blocked, I again had to travel afoot in the afternoon,” said Sushila Devi, a resident of Khoda. On the other hand, the bandh call had no major impact on city markets as Tuesday is a regular weekly off day. “About 40% of the shops were open in Indirapuram, even though it was a Tuesday – a weekly off for major markets in Ghaziabad. However, many shopkeepers had decided to open shop to make up for losses suffered during the lockdown. We are, however, sympathetic towards farmers and the government must continue to talk to them and some resolution must come through. Otherwise, continuing protests will hamper our businesses too,” said Pradeep Gupta convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti – Indirapuram, a trader’ association. “We had our weekly off day on Tuesday and a majority of markets, like Turab Nagar, Chopla, Gandhi Nagar, Maliwara and Ramte Ram Road, among others, were shut. But it was due to weekly off and not in support of farmers,” said Rajneesh Bansal, chairman of Turab Nagar Vyapar Mandal. In Modinagar, members of several political parties staged protests on the Delhi-Meerut Road and tried to block the road. “They were prevented from doing so and normal traffic was restored. There were no other disruptions on roads on Tuesday,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bandh-call-reduces-traffic-on-ghaziabad-roads-by-40/story-JIyjnyxIpUbc6DBNbUtIcK.html

As a result, vehicular movement remained suspended on NH-9 till about 3pm when the farmers’ leaders gave a call to the protesters to vacate the carriageway. Farmers, congregated at UP Gate in Ghaziabad, have stayed put since November 28 and have occupied the blocked side going from Ghaziabad to Delhi since December 3. This side was still blocked on Tuesday; farmers said the blockade will continue till their demands are met.Around 11am, hundreds of farmers at the UP Gate protest site jumped to the other side of NH 9 and blocked incoming traffic from Delhi. Officials of the Ghaziabad district administration said the Delhi Police, on the other side, made diversions for vehicles, as a result. Around 2.40pm, Rakesh Tikait - Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader and spokesperson – made an announcement to the protesters to vacate the carriageway.“The time set for 3pm is over and it is good news for farmers that they have been successful in giving a message to the government by way of Bharat bandh. There has been no incident of violence reported from across the country and protests have remained peaceful. We will continue talks with the government and our agitation will continue till our demands are met,” Tikait said at the protest site.“We will also be going to meet the Union home minister on Tuesday evening and a bigger delegation will hold talks with the government on Wednesday in Delhi. So, we opened up the highway when the government received the message,” he added. The entire UP Gate area on Tuesday was filled up with thousands of protesters who had come in tractor-trolleys, while others have camped there since November 28. Many had come from Punjab, Uttarakhand and western Uttar Pradesh, as well as from the Terai belt of the state. Kushal Vir Singh, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar district, was holding a poster of farmers’ demands and had tied himself up with iron chains.“I want to send a message that farmers are basically reduced to ‘ghulam’ (servants) and have no power to decide the cost of their produce. We are sleeping in our fields or on roads here to press for our demands. Still, there is no resolution,” he said. Several farmers gave speeches from the protest site and also recited poems to portray their conditions. “It (the blocking of the highway) was just a small trailer and not the full picture. If they still wish to, we can make them see another trailer at any point of time,” one of the protesters said at the venue. According to Ajay Shankar Pandey, the district magistrate of Ghaziabad, “The Delhi police had diverted the traffic after the Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway was blocked by farmers on Tuesday. The farmers, however, vacated the carriageway around 3pm and traffic from Delhi was restored to normal.”Shailendra Singh, additional district magistrate (city), said that the farmers’ leaders had assured the administration that their protest on the highway will go on from 11am to 3pm. The UP police, meanwhile, took no action when farmers occupied the Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway on Tuesday morning but they were severe and resorted to lathicharge on protesters of a political outfit, who arrived and tried to join the farmers’ protest at UP Gate. “Seven people were detained and taken into preventive custody, and were shifted from the protest site,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bharat-bandh-protesting-farmers-shut-nh-9-for-four-hours-at-delhi-ghaziabad-border/story-1Y6FuVtqzTo4WCgDJIMvBL.html

For this, a bill shall be tabled in the state assembly’s winter session beginning December 28, an official communique stated.The BJP, on coming to power in March this year, decided to scrap the decision taken by the then Kamal Nath government to restore indirect elections to the post of mayors in 16 municipal corporations in the state whereby councillors elected were supposed to elect the mayors.Chouhan’s announcement on the direct election came during the state cabinet meeting held virtually on Tuesday.“It was decided in the cabinet that the speaker and mayor will now be elected through a direct system. The ordinance for this has come. Now, the bill will be introduced in the legislative assembly. The wards will also be fixed accordingly. Chief minister Chouhan said that voters will be now able to cast their votes directly for the speaker and mayor,” the official communique stated.The CM, as per the official information, said innovative ideas were needed for the development of the state, welfare of the people and making Madhya Pradesh self-reliant.Also read: ‘Should I go or stay?’ Tripura CM asks people if he should remain in power“Every department should come up with some innovative ideas and implement them under the leadership of ministers. Work is going on in Madhya Pradesh on the “Buffer mein Safar”, “Global Skill Park” and “Gas Tragedy Memorial” on the lines of Hiroshima-Nagasaki Memorial.“The chief minister said that the ministers should review the progress of the departments in departmental meetings every Monday. Cabinet meeting will be held every Tuesday,” said the statement.CM Chouhan said that Covid-19 had resulted in a financial crisis in the state. Therefore, all departments must pay special attention to the arrangement of “out of budget” amount for all construction works. Ministers must make efforts to ensure that Madhya Pradesh got the maximum amount in various schemes of the Centre, he saidAs per the official statement, the cabinet also approved land acquisition to Bhopal and Indore Metro Rail projects. After Bhopal and Indore metro areas were declared metropolitan areas, now the land for it would be acquired under “Metro Act 1978”. The CM said this would ensure better compensation to landholders.

08-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s Covid numbers drop second week running||The number of Covid-19 cases in the city have dipped for the second week running with positivity rates stabilising after a rise in November.With less infections, the number of active cases gradually dropped too and recoveries were four times more than the fresh cases recorded in a week.However, though active cases dropped to below 1,000 from 1,150, the rate of fatalities as compared to recoveries and new cases is not declining, health experts say.“The dip in number of infections is significant even as the testing levels are not seeing any major fluctuation. This could have been possible due to control of the infection spread in the city which is reflected in the decreased positivity rate. The active cases are seeing a decline again and a high number of recoveries is also an encouraging sign,” said Arun Kumar Gupta, UT health secretary.Testing levels and positivity rates have dropped slightly this week after 10,000 tests last week, the lowest level in over a month when it comes to positivity rates.“We are trying to maintain this momentum in the testing levels by encouraging the teams involved. The number of tests right after the festivals was ramped up as the requirement was to isolate the infected individuals as early as possible, which probably has helped keep infection numbers low,” said a senior health department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-covid-numbers-drop-second-week-running/story-N4cDdSNDptW6LkVzFO9zwN.html

08-12-2020||Chandigarh||Zirakpur MC detects violations in 100 buildings, but does nothing||A day after a commercial building collapsed in Balaji Enclave here because of digging work in an adjacent plot, it is now understood that the Zirakpur municipal council had failed to take action against violations in 100 commercial buildings.In a 2019 survey, MC had found violations in 100 buildings in areas under its jurisdiction. Even though cases were filed before the Dera Bassi magistrate, MC officials did not pursue the matter, resulting in dismissal of some cases. In other cases , MC failed to provide evidence to the court because of which the other parties were not summoned. The violations include building shops in parking areas on highways, more floors built despite less floor area ratio and in some cases basements were built without permission.In 2019, despite MC deciding that no objection certificates will be issued to builders, who had violated rules for power, water and sewer collections, the approvals were given later. Jyoti Sadana, who was booked on Monday after a building next to his plot collapsed, did not have permission to build a basement. Interestingly, even though his drawings of a residential unit were approved, he was constructing a commercial building.When asked to comment on the matter, director, local bodies, Puneet Goyal said he was not aware of the issue and will look into the matter.Sukhdev Chaudhary, chairman of the Joint Action Committee in Zirakpur said, “Due to negligence of civic body officials, Zirakpur is considered to be an urban slum. The officials are hand in glove with the owners of buildings and do not take any action.” He alleged that the officials had political patronage.Harish Gupta, president of the Builder Association of Zirakpur, said due to “so called builders involved in unauthorised and illegal construction, the entire builder fraternity was getting a bad name, MC should take strict action against them.”In May this year, the Punjab local bodies department had suspended Zirakpur municipal council executive officer (EO) Manvir Singh Gill for misusing powers to issue completion certificates for eight major residential-cum-commercial projects.According to sources, Zirakpur MC officials did not even carry out physical verification of the projects for issuing fire safety no objection certificates or giving permissions for sewerage and water connections and setting up of sewage treatment plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/zirakpur-mc-detects-violations-in-100-buildings-but-does-nothing/story-lCDB8XjUvkeJYWl0H2IKEO.html

We demand rollback of such orders,” said Dr Ramneek Bedi, IMA coordination committee chairman.The association in a release said, “It is strange that allopathic MBBS doctors are not allowed to do an ultrasound. A gynae surgery cannot be done by another discipline’s surgeon. Ayurveda doctors have been allowed to do surgery, though there is no provision of giving anaesthesia in Ayurveda. It amounts to endangering the lives of gullible people, especially from rural areas. Instead of putting a ban on illegal practice of allopathy by AYUSH doctors, the government is legalising quackery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ima-chandigarh-protests-over-centre-allowing-ayush-doctors-to-perform-surgery/story-DRqm2xvZWoOKb0E1Kgr2TJ.html

Till Tuesday, almost 190 volunteers have taken the first dose of the vaccine.The government-run JJ hospital started the trial on November 30 and, so far, 180 people have already participated in the trial. Sion hospital, after receiving the vaccine from the central government on Sunday, started the trial from Monday. Till Tuesday, the hospital has given the vaccine to around 10 volunteers.“Initially, we are giving the vaccine to 5-6 people, but we will soon increase the number of daily dosage to fasten the process,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of the Sion hospital.Covaxin is developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). The vaccine received Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approval and the trials commenced across India from July.Also read: Amit Shah meets farmer leaders ahead of crucial talks on Dec 9Recently, the pharmaceutical firm applied to the central drug regulator seeking emergency use authorisation.

08-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi health minister says deaths due to Covid-19 are on the decline||With a high number of tests being conducted and fewer new cases reported, the average positivity rate—the proportion of samples that test positive for Covid-19—has reduced to 4.28% over the last seven days. Delhi’s average positivity rate was 7.8% last week. Delhi has increased the number of tests from an average 61,600 tests daily to 74,600, shows the data from the government’s health bulletin. The number of tests, however, remained lower than the peak number of 85,000 tests that were reported in December 4’s bulletin. The government plans to scale up the number of tests to 100,000 or 120,000 a day. On Tuesday, Delhi reported 3,188 new cases, taking the total tally of the infection in the city to 597,000 so far. There were 57 deaths recorded on the day, with the total death toll of Covid-19 reaching 9,763. The cumulative case fatality ratio (CFR)—the proportion of people who died of the disease compared to those who were tested positive for it—stood at 1.64%. The cumulative CFR has consistently reduced since recording a high 4.11% on June 16 to 1.56% in mid-November, when it started increasing during the third wave of cases in Delhi. The highest number of deaths recorded in a day during the third wave was 131 deaths on November 18. “Number of deaths in Delhi are on a decline. Lowest deaths since 5th Nov. Our frontline warriors like doctors and nurses are working round the clock to save each and every life. I Request you all to observe all precautions for this trend to decline further,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a tweet. The number of new cases reported had peaked at 8,593 on November 10 and the positivity rate at 15.33% on November 15. Experts say that the number of deaths usually peaks a little after the number of cases do because patients are admitted to hospitals for some time before succumbing to the infection. Jain had earlier said that most deaths in Delhi hospitals took place ten days after admission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-health-minister-says-deaths-due-to-covid-19-are-on-the-decline/story-PTH4SXyBhWJCVgb4avtR6M.html
08-12-2020||Gurugram||Man shoots relative dead in heated argument||A 58-year-old man was shot dead by a cab driver in Sector 39 on Monday night after a dispute over some old issue. The deceased was on his way to the community centre of Sector 39 for a social event, when he was shot at by the suspect, who then called the police himself. He was rushed to a private hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival, said the police. The victim, Virender Singh (58), a resident of Jharsa village, was involved in farming and had no personal enmity in the area, the police said. The suspect, Kaushal alias Kosu (38), is a cab driver and is a relative of the victim. On Sunday, Singh was at home when a scuffle broke out between him and Kaushal, following which the latter allegedly threatened Singh with dire consequences and left his house. The police said Kaushal is a cab driver and often visited the deceased for financial help. The police said, on Monday, Virender informed his family members about the scuffle and told them that he was being threatened. Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said that Singh’s son who works in a private company in Manesar informed the suspect’s family and asked them to resolve the issue. “On Monday night, there was a wedding at the community centre in the area and Singh was on his way to join the celebration. Kaushal intercepted his way and started abusing him. When Singh raised an alarm, he took out a countrymade pistol and shot at him, leaving him injured,” he said. Hearing a gunshot, people from the community centre rushed to the spot and found Singh lying in a pool of blood. He was taken to a hospital in Sector 38 for treatment, while Kaushal informed the police control room. The police said the suspect waited for the police team to reach and he confessed to the killing. He said he got agitated and he shot at his uncle.Yadav said they registered a case against Kaushal under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and sections of the Arms Act at the Sadar police station. Amit Kumar, the son of the victim, said, “My father had told me about the incident wherein Kaushal had threatened to kill him. I have no idea why he took this extreme step to kill him and what was the motive behind the murder,” he said. The police have recovered the weapon used in the crime and a probe is underway. The body was handed over to the family members after the post-mortem examination on Tuesday afternoon, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-shoots-relative-dead-in-heated-argument/story-lIomAAvCXVYCCC69YVResL.html
08-12-2020||Gurugram||District to prepare list of front-line workers for Covid-19 vaccine||After preparing a database of 50,000 healthcare workers in government and private hospitals for Covid-19 vaccination, the district health department will now be focussing on preparing a similar list for front-line workers from the police department, armed forces, home guard, civil defence, disaster management department, and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG).Front-line workers are second in the list of prioritised population groups, who will be vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 virus once the vaccine is rolled out. On Tuesday, in a meeting held with the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), the state and district health department were directed to collate the data of front-line workers. Government departments like the police, urban local bodies, and armed forces will share the details with the health department, said senior officials who attended the meeting. “Further directives on the process and date line for data collection of front-line workers are awaited from state government,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. “The department has almost finished finalising the health staff of 732 private health care units, under which over 50,000 employees have been identified.” Overall, in Haryana, 6.7 million people are to be vaccinated, which includes almost 2,50,000 health care workers, 4,50,000 front-line workers, 5.8 million people above the age of 50, and 2,20,000 people with comorbidities, aged below 50, as per the state health department document on Covid-19 vaccination.Other preparatory activities such as strengthening the cold-chain infrastructure, deployment of additional vaccinators, strategy on vaccine safety and effectiveness and the development of Co-WIN — a digital platform for Covid-19 vaccination delivery — were also discussed. Cold-Chain InfrastructureThe union health ministry is already in consultation with the state to assess the additional requirement for cold-chain storage like walk-in coolers, walk-in freezers, deep freezers and ice-lined refrigerators. They keep the vaccine at a recommended temperature from the point of manufacture until it reaches the target beneficiaries. Singh said, “It is likely the vaccine will require a temperature of 2 degrees Celsius to eight degrees Celsius and -15 to -25 degrees Celsius. For this, the cold-chain system has to be made robust. Currently, the district has 36 cold chain points where vaccines for routine immunisation are stored.” Across the state there are 686 cold-chain points. Also, a real time digital platform for Covid-19 vaccination storage and delivery, called Co-WIN, has also been created by the Centre. It will also help in tracing the beneficiaries of the vaccine.Vaccination sites and vaccinators“Vaccination session sites for Covid-19 are yet to be finalised,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO).For the routine immunisation, the district has 1,275 session sites. It includes primary health care centres and community health centres, along with some outreach areas which are far from cold-chain points. For the vaccinators, the health department, which is following the NEGVAC guidelines, will have Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) as Covid-19 vaccinators. They are already vaccinators under Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP). “There are almost 550 vaccinators in the government set-up and over 3,500 in the private sector. The department has to work on the co-ordination plan for vaccinators. We have been directed in the meeting that due to Covid-19 vaccination drive, the routine immunisation should not be impacted,” said Singh. Even the document shared by the state health department shows that vaccinators from the private sector are to be included to minimise the disruption of routine immunisation service. At the session sites, there will be a five-member team for 100 beneficiaries, according to the state document. It will have one vaccinator, two support staff,a security personnel and one person to verify documents. The sessions site will have three rooms — one for verification, the second for vaccination and the third for observation, where after the immunisation, the person will be observed to check the health status. The training material for the health staff and vaccinators is, however, yet to be finalised at the national level, along with the standard operating procedures (SOPs), which are in the final stages. However, Singh said that since vaccines will require two to three doses, with each dose to be given after three to four weeks, they will have to give vaccine dosage from the same manufacturer. “A detailed record will have to be maintained,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-to-prepare-list-of-front-line-workers-for-covid-19-vaccine/story-pW8PhaMnEd3Fj2MNDnPsxK.html

This project, news of which first came to light in October 2018, had elicited concern from environmentalists as it would have subsumed at least a third of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Nathupur. However, GMDA officials on Tuesday clarified that these concerns, which were once again raised by its resident advisory council in November, are under consideration, and that the project will be “re-examined” to mitigate environmental harm to the park. In a release issued to the press following Tuesday’s meeting, the GMDA stated that it was “exploring the possibility of taking out an underground road without damaging the greenery and environment.” With these concerns taken into cognisance, Khattar on Tuesday approved the revised draft of the Comprehensive Mobility Management Plan (CMMP) for Gururgam, which was opened to public consultation in October this year. The draft plan, which has been steered by the Delhi School of Planning and Architecture, includes proposals for augmenting road networks, mass transit facilities and pedestrian infrastructure in Gurugram — in the form of walkways and cycle tracks — keeping in mind projected population growth till the year 2041. “Now that CMPs for both Gurugram and Faridabad are in place, we can submit our detailed project report (DPR) for the metro expansion in the region to the Centre,” said VS Kundu, CEO, GMDA, speaking to HT after the meeting. Meanwhile, a draft DPR of the metro connectivity from Rezangla Chowk to Sector-21, Dwarka is also pending with the Haryana Mass Rapid Transport Corporation Limited (HMRTC), he clarified. While Kundu did not directly address the issue of building roads through the biodiversity park, the relevant section in the GMDA meeting’s agenda (a copy of which is with Hindustan Times), states, “The revised CMMP was again presented to the GMDA’s resident advisory council on November 5. The RAC (residents’ advisory council) has agreed with the proposed CMMP. However, RAC has recommended to re-examine the need for the proposed Outer Ring Road from NH 48 to Gurugram-Mehrauli Road passing through the Aravali Biodiversity Park due to its environmental impact. This link is a part of the proposed Outer Ring Road in the CMMP. However environmental impact assessment of the proposal including mitigation measures will have to be undertaken before execution.”Hospital and medical college in Kherki Majra villageIn another significant development, the chief minister also approved a revised detailed project report (DPR) for an upcoming hospital and medical college in Kherki Majra village, Gurugram. With the district’s only other publicly funded hospital, Civil Hospital in Sector 10, stretched to capacity, officials said the district is in dire need of augmenting public health facilities — a situation that has only become more pronounced amid the ongoing outbreak of Covid-19. Earlier limited to a capacity of 650 hospital beds, 30 trauma beds and 150 teaching seats, the upcoming Sheetla Mata Hospital and Medical College will now house 950 beds, 100 trauma beds and 250 teaching seats, officials confirmed.VS Kundu, CEO, GMDA, said, “Though the DPR had been prepared earlier this year, an expert committee comprising officials from PGIMS Rohtak, ministry of health, and representatives from the private sector have reviewed it and suggested some upgrades to the hospital infrastructure. As such, the earlier budget of ₹679 crore has been augmented to ₹981 crore.” Of this, 50 percent will be provided by the GMDA while the rest if to be borne by the MCG and the Sheetla Mata Shrine Board. A draft of the detailed notice inviting tender (DNIT) for this project, Kundu confirmed, has been prepared. “The DNIT will be floated soon so that construction work can proceed,” he said.Four new bus routes in FaridabadIn a third significant development, it was also decided on Tuesday that the Gururgam Metropolitan City Bus Ltd. will, starting next year, operate four intra-city routes in Faridabad with 40 new low-floor buses. A senior official in the GMDA’s mobility department, seeking anonymity, said, “About 46 new buses had been procured for the GMCBL in March, prior to lockdown, while Faridabad was supposed to get its own city bus service under the Smart City mission this year. However, due to post-Covid constraints expansion of the bus network in Gururgam is not an immediate requirement. These buses will be deployed on four routes within Faridabad itself, which are being identified and rationalised by DIMTS.”It was also revealed during Tuesday’s meeting that the GMDA has so far earned ₹202 crore through its own revenue raising capacity, while its expenditure on public works so far amounts to ₹223 crore, resulting in a net loss of ₹21 crore. At the meeting, principal secretary of the state town and country planning department, AK Singh, said that an amount of ₹100 crore (raised through EDC funds) will be transferred to GMDA. The additional chief Secretary of the finance department, TVSN Prasad, provided assurance that an amount of ₹300 crore will be released to the Town and Country Planning Department early next year. Of this, AK Singh said that ₹150 crore would be made available to the GMDA to continue development works in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-to-re-examine-link-road-project-to-minimise-environmental-impact-on-bio-park/story-nLrLq2hSxRER3lHldArJKI.html
08-12-2020||Gurugram||Despite bandh, transport services remain unhindered in Gurugram||Despite some transport unions in Delhi joining in the Bharat Bandh on Tuesday, in a show of solidarity with the ongoing farmer protests at the Capital’s borders, public transport in the city continued operations as per usual. Spokespersons from multiple transport unions in Gurugram said that they did not want to halt any services as it would inconvenience not just the passengers but also the service providers. While union leaders in the city extended their support to farmers, they clarified that they did not, at any point, consider halting operations. Yogesh Sharma, head of the Haryana Auto Chalak Sangathan in Gurugram, said, “We did not make any calls to stop operations. We are associated with the Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh, which has opposed any bandh in relation to the protests. At a personal level, while we sympathise with the farmers and hope for a quick resolution, it would not be right to inconvenience the larger public. Some drivers may have chosen not to ply their autos, but that decision was left to their individual discretion.” Similar sentiments were espoused by Sandeep Dalal, a union leader with the Haryana Roadways Karmachari Sangh in Gurugram. “We have issued a statement in solidarity with the farmers cause, but did not participate in the bandh. All operations have run today as per usual.” Cab aggregator services remained normal throughout the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/despite-bandh-transport-services-remain-unhindered-in-gurugram/story-v988gK6SzMBMF1MGVbPWxK.html
08-12-2020||Gurugram||Social groups, workers unions back farmers’ demands||Multiple social groups, political outfits and workers’ unions took to the streets on Tuesday to extend support to farmers protesting against the recently passed farm laws on Tuesday, in view of the Bharat Bandh called by farmers’ organisations.At Bilaspur Chowk, around 350 farmers and trade union activists gathered to support the farmers’ agitation. Rajya Sabha member of Parliament, KK Ragesh, of the CPI (M), along with other leaders was detained by the police.“We were peacefully demonstrating in support of the Bharat Bandh but the Haryana Police forcefully arrested us and took us into custody. We were taken to a school nearby, where we continued with our demonstrations against the farm laws,” said Ragesh.In a separate demonstration, around 200 people including farmers, khap leaders and civil society members gathered at Jharsa Chowk in Sector 32 to voice their support for farmers. The gathering lasted for three hours, during which members from different walks of life demanded that the government repeal the three farm laws.Expressing solidarity with farmers, Mahender Singh Thakran, president of Jharsa 360 khap, said that keeping farmers’ interests is crucial since India is largely an agrarian country. “Our country will not be able to progress if farmers are unhappy. These laws are against farmers and if we stay silent today, our future generations will curse us for not having raised our voice at the correct time,” said Thakran.He said that the government needed to assuage the concerns of farmers and ensure that the minimum support prices (MSP) for crops is written into the law.“The government is saying that it has no intention of doing away with MSP for crops. What’s stopping them from giving this in writing? People will be satisfied only if MSP system is put in writing,” said Thakran.He added that the khaps would continue with their peaceful agitation till the time the government relented to the demands of farmers. “Lakhs of people are out on the streets. We will continue to support them and amplify our agitation if the next rounds do no yield results,” he said.RS Rathee, president of the Gurugram Citizen Council and municipal councillor for Ward 34, said that the gathering was aimed at lending support to farmers, who are fighting for their livelihoods. “Corporates and industrialists will benefit from these new laws that threaten the survival of farmers. The country is seeing one of the biggest farmers’ movement and if the government doesn’t relent, citizens of Gurugram will have to step forward and join the agitation,” said Rathee.He also criticised the state government for using water cannons and tear gas on farmers who were exercising their democratic right to protest.Towards the evening, around 300 workers took out a march from Hero Honda Chowk to Rajeev Chowk in support of the farmers’ agitation, on a call given by the Maruti Suzuki Mazdoor Sangh.In Nuh too, farmers’ groups and social organisations extended their support to the Bharat Bandh and gathered at Bhadas, amid heavy police presence. Salamudeen Meo, Mewat Vikas Sabha president, said that the farmers and youngsters gathered at Bhadas Chowk to extend support to farmers.“Youngsters and farmers tried to block the road in Bhadas village today to support the nationwide strike. Police tried to block us but we continued with our demonstrations,” said Meo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/social-groups-workers-unions-back-farmers-demands/story-l4GvxDH5atzN1EDCR27AiJ.html
08-12-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram largely unaffected by Bharat Bandh||The Bharat Bandh call given by protesting farmers on Tuesday had minimal impact on life in the city. Traffic on key stretches leading to Delhi and public services remained largely unaffected, amid heavy police presence, even as 120 protesters who had gathered at Bilaspur Chowk were taken into preventive custody and released in the evening.Despite heavy barricading, traffic on arterial roads was thin as most residents, anticipating trouble, stayed indoors. The police said that the situation in Gurugram was better than other parts of NCR as not many local farmers had joined the protest and the police did not let protesters from other districts move on the arterial roads.Around 200 people, including farmers, khap leaders and civil society members had gathered at Jharsa Chowk in Sector 32 to voice their support for farmers. The demonstration lasted for three hours and was peaceful.The police had deployed 2,500 personnel and set up 123 checkpoints at the district borders with Nuh, Rewari and Faridabad to ensure better law and order situation. All major markets, including Sadar Bazar, remained open and the supply of essentials was not disrupted, according to the police and officials of the administration.Astha Modi, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said, “The volume of traffic was low since morning and despite checking and barricading, no congestion was reported from any of the borders. Our teams had checked over 200 vehicles throughout the day. Commuters faced no inconvenience on any stretch, including all 13 borders,” she said.Special teams formed by the district administration and police were deployed from 7am to keep a check on supply points. “We had deployed force at vegetable and fruit mandis to ensure shops are not forced to shut,” she said.The police, however, detained 120 people, including opposition leaders and Rajya Sabha MP, KK Ragesh, of CPI(M), for protesting at Bilaspur Chowk, 20 kilometres from Kherki Daula toll plaza, under the Preventive Detention Act. They were released in the evening, the police said.Around 350 people from opposition parties, anganwadi workers, accredited social health activists (ASHA workers) and farmers from Punjab had gathered on the expressway and started raising slogans. The police said they had started marching towards the Bilaspur toll, due to which traffic movement was disrupted but was immediately resolved by the teams.Satvir Singh, the vice-president of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) Haryana, said that they were detained by the police and released on Tuesday evening, due to which they could not join the protest in Delhi. “We are supporting the farmers and had gathered at Bilaspur Chowk. Farmers from Punjab and leaders from CPI(M) had joined us on Tuesday morning and we had planned to march towards Delhi. We were expecting more people to join us, but the police caught hold of us, took us to a school and held hostage,” he said.Nikita Gehlot, the deputy commissioner of police (Manesar), said that around 100 police personnel were deployed in the Bilaspur area, where the protestors had started gathering. “We did not let anyone cross the border and they were detained before they reached the border. The leaders were delivering speeches even during detention at a government school near Bilaspur Chowk. The situation was under control and commuters did not face any inconvenience,” she said.On Tuesday, all major markets, such as Sadar Bazar, Galleria Market, Vyapar Kendra and Arcadia, operated as usual, with shopkeepers and associations distancing themselves from the farmers’ protests. In addition, operations at wholesale vegetable and fruit markets also remained normal.Bablu Gupta, the president, Sadar Bazar market association, said that the market was open as no farmers of this belt were taking part in the ongoing protests. “The shopkeepers have already suffered huge losses during the lockdown and every day is important for all of us. Footfall was less as compared to other days, but people visited the market and did their shopping,” he said.Regular vehicular movement continued on major arterial roads. Local transport and cab services were uninterrupted throughout the day. Commuters travelling in the city said that traffic volume was lower than usual and compared the situation on roads to those during the initial stages of the coronavirus outbreak.“I had to drop my mother at New Delhi Railway station. The (ticket) booking was made last month so I did not cancel the travel plan. There was hardly any traffic on the stretch and I reached station within 25 minutes after crossing the border,” said Sandeep Singh, a resident of Sohna Road.Further, personnel in 50 police control room vans and 150 bikes were stationed at strategic points of the National Highway 48, between Panchgaon and Sirhaul toll, to ensure smooth traffic flow and check gatherings on the main carriageway.“Even though Gurugram district does not have a sizeable farmer’s presence, we realised that a possibility of protesters passing through the city to the national capital remained high and, as such, there could be situations of unrest. Hence, directions were issued in advance to all government bodies concerned, to stay on alert and undertake requisite measures to keep the situation under control. By taking necessary advance measures and executing strategic deployment, the situation of law and order in Gurugram largely remained as usual,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner.Thousands of farmers have gathered at Delhi’s borders to protest against the three farm laws that were enacted in September and had given a call for a nationwide bandh on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-largely-unaffected-by-bharat-bandh/story-hKwHVHRHQJkt9SQ9VLjSmL.html
08-12-2020||Gurugram||Daily commuters take advance measures to avoid roads||Although the effect of the Bharat Bandh in the city was minimal on Tuesday, commuters had made preparations in advance to ensure they were not caught off guard.Residents of other NCR cities who work in Gurugram said that they opted to stay at their friends’ or family’s residences on Monday night to avoid intercity travel.“Last year in December, I was stuck on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway for more than four hours due to a protest being held in Delhi. I did not want a repeat of a similar incident and stayed back at my friend’s house in DLF-5 after finishing work on Monday evening,” said Uday Shankar, a resident of GK-1 in Delhi.A few city residents also opted to use the Delhi Metro for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak, instead of their private vehicles, to avoid any snarls or roadblocks.“Fearing that there would be roadblocks and traffic snarls due to the protest, I opted to use the Delhi Metro instead of my private vehicle. I wanted to avoid getting stuck on roads and figured using the metro would be the best possible option,” said Abhishek Dayal, a resident of Nirvana Country, who works at Lajpat Nagar in New Delhi.Professionals, who have resumed working from offices, were also allowed by their companies to work from home, in view of the Bharat Bandh.“Our company sent an email to all the employees leaving the option of working from home upon their discretion. I did not want to get caught in any untoward incident and as a safer option, opted to work from home. I also directed all my employees at the office, barring those living within a two-kilometre radius, to also work from home while for the latter, it was left optional,” said Saurabh Kumar, who works with a housing insurance company on Mall Mile.Deepak Maini, the general secretary, Federation of Indian Industry, Haryana chapter, said that almost all factories were open on Tuesday and barring a few supply issues, their functioning was largely unaffected.“Almost all factories remained opened in the city and business was as usual. We had anticipated issues in regards to the supply of goods due to the nationwide protest. However, barring one or two factories, which faced minor difficulties in this regard, factories and industries operated at their optimum capacity,” said Maini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/daily-commuters-take-advance-measures-to-avoid-roads/story-rBPez1yhufd6AZTGdvahMJ.html

08-12-2020||Pune||54-yr-old Yemini national with hemifacial spasm treated successfully at city hospital||Doctors from a city-based hospital treated a 54-year-old Yemini national with a rare brain nerve adhesion. The condition, hemifacial spasm, resulted in a twisted face and involuntary twitching since the past 17 years. While treating her, doctors feared that a surgery around the brainstem was risky as any damage could have caused paralysis. However, the surgery was a success giving the patient a new hope at life. Speaking about the patient, Dr Pravin Survashe, consultant neurosurgeon with Columbia Asia Hospital, where the patient was treated, said that the patient was suffering from facial spasm. “The facial muscles became stiff over time and so, the patient had a twisted face. For the last two years, the patient had been visiting London to take Botox treatment which did not give her any result even after three to four sessions,” said Dr Survashe. Dr Bhushan Joshi, the neurologist who diagnosed the patient said that the MRI scan showed a swollen blood vessel on her face which was attached to the artery which was the reason for her condition.“We took a chance on the basis of clinical judgement and decided to operate. A three-cm size hole was drilled in the skull to perform the surgery which was very high-risk as it takes place around the brainstem and any damage can lead to paralysis or other complications. During the surgery, Dr Survashe separated the nerve from the blood vessel and put a small piece of sponge like material in between so that the blood vessel did not irritate the nerve. This drastically improved her condition. The patient still needs medication, but her condition has improved,” said Dr Joshi.Dr Survashe added that as a part of the diagnosis, an MRI of her brain was done. Earlier brain MRIs were done, but none showed a loop of blood vessels.“There was a blood vessel adhesion to the facial nerve in the brain which stimulates the nerve with every pulsation. Medically, such phenomena are known as arachnoid adhesions. That led to sudden twisting of the face. We performed a five-hour-long minimally invasive surgery on her to free the adhesion between the artery and facial nerve. By evening same day, she was able to smile normally,” said Dr Survashe.Dr Sandeep Borse, neurophysician from Pimple Saudagar said that the surgery is a major one and requires a highly trained surgeon. “The overall complication for this surgery is similar to other neurosurgeries. The frequency of such cases is around nine persons per 1,00,000 population. Such cases are difficult to diagnose by regular doctors however, neurologists may get such patients frequently,” said Dr Borse.What is Hemifacial spasm?*Hemifacial spasm is a condition in which one side of the face gets twisted and has involuntary twitching. *It is a rare nervous system disorder that affects nine people per 1,00,000 in India.*The treatment is considered difficult as the surgical intervention involves opening the skull.Though it affects both men and women, hemifacial spasm is more common in women over the age of 40.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/54-yr-old-yemini-national-with-hemifacial-spasm-treated-successfully-at-city-hospital/story-1F23DrBJD2EcUrgl4MfL0L.html

08-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Police head constable suspended on extortion charges||Probing into a liquor contractor’s allegations of extortion by two cops posted in its crime branch, the Chandigarh Police on Tuesday suspended one of the two head constables. Pawan was suspended after a preliminary investigation report termed his behaviour “suspicious”. He has been sent to the police lines, while the probe continues and will be summoned for questioning.The action came nine days after a liquor contractor submitted a video clip, accusing two cops of extorting Rs 96,000 per month for the past few months for the eight liquor vends he operated in the city. Following his complaint, a case under Section 383 (extortion) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13 (1) the Prevention of Corruption Act was registered at the Sector 39 police station against unidentified persons on November 29. Later, the clip helped the police identify the police personnel as head constables Pawan and Anil. However, it did not show any money being exchanged. “Pawan was suspended after we received a communication from the investigation officer that his behaviour appeared suspicious. His role is being probed further,” said superintendent of police (SP) Manoj Kumar Meena. SIT formedMeanwhile, police have constituted a special investigation team, comprising two station house officers and two sub-inspectors, who will be working under the supervision of assistant superintendent of police (ASP, South) Shruti Arora. “So far, the role of head constable Pawan has emerged with regards to the complaint and further investigation is on to establish Anil’s involvement,” said ASP Arora.Apart from this case, police say four more liquor contractors had also approached them alleging extortion. However, they had not provided any evidence and their complaints were being verified. One December 2, a ghee supplier from Haryana’s Barwala had alleged extortion by crime branch cops. He had accused the police of taking Rs 18,000 from his pocket and asking for another Rs 3.7 lakh to get his ghee samples passed. Before this, on November 26, inspector Ranjit Singh, of the operations wing of Chandigarh Police, was transferred to police lines after an inquiry began against him into a complaint by a liquor contractor of Rs 2.5-lakh extortion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-police-head-constable-suspended-on-extortion-charges/story-duSIvtslXGhpMdPYvsV9AO.html

08-12-2020||Pune||Mohammadwadi residents demand public amenity plots converted into garden and public library||Pune: The residents of Mohammadwadi, NIBM (National Institute of Bank Management) and Undri are seeking the open spaces in the neighbourhood to be converted into public park and public library. Citizens living at the neighbourhood of an underutilised one acre plot are requesting the administration to convert the open space into a public garden. Another plot located in the area and turned into a garbage dump, residents seek it to be converted into a library. At least 2,000 residents led by Ganga Kingston Society in Mohammadwadi have petitioned prime minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking direct intervention of their office into sanctioning of playground, public garden and community library for the area.The citizen group has demanded setting up of a playground-cum-garden at survey number 39 plot located near the society’s building. Also, setting up of a public library at survey number 36 located in front of Gemini Housing Society. The petition states “the amenity spaces are to be utilised for playground, garden, park, yoga meditation parks, forest gardens and community libraries. The citizens require amenities like urban forests, groundwater recharge parks, dug wells, animal shelters, community agri produce gardens, sports academies. The non-availability of amenity space for the above stated objectives means those essential services, amenities do not get rendered effectively to the public as quite evident in the case”. Ganga Kingston Society secretary Daljeet Goraya said, “We demand immediate scrapping of plans to either lease or sell the public amenity plots. Currently, Mohammadwadi is reeling under sever water crisis due to destruction of environment by land mafia and other criminal syndicates. We have been pursuing our case with the PMC since 2018. PMC had denied us even our legally sanctioned road for which we fought for ten years and won our right through legal cases against the civic body and seeking help from PMO. This time too, we are keeping all our legal options open if our legitimate demands are not met with ,” he said.PMC mayor Muralidhar Mohol said, “We will recommend the requests made by civic groups to the PMC and ensure that their requests are dealt with positively.” Another resident Rutuja Pawar said, “PMC must not go against the wishes of the people and immediately issue orders for playground-cum- garden and community library in our area. Citizens expect things which will increase their standard of living and PMC must come up to the aspirations of the people,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/mohammadwadi-residents-demand-public-amenity-plots-converted-into-garden-and-public-library/story-z7GkfP7sFzTdJCd3TpLUnI.html

As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the day temperature in the city was at 31.4 degrees Celsius and night temperature was 11.8 degrees Celsius.Dr SD Sanap, Scientist C with the weather forecasting department of IMD, Pune, said that in the coming days, the temperature is expected to gradually increase.“The day and night temperature may witness a gradual increase making the day and night pleasant. As of now, the models do not forecast any immediate drop in temperature. The day temperature in the coming days may remain around 32 degrees Celsius,” said Dr Sanap.The day temperature reported in Pune was 2.6 degrees more than the normal and the night temperature was 0.4 degrees more than the normal temperature. The normal day temperature was expected to be 28.8 degrees Celsius and night temperature was expected to be 11.4 degrees Celsius.Speaking about why the day temperature has not seen any drastic fall over the last few days, Dr Sanap noted that there was a chill in the air because of the cooler north easterly winds. “However, the city had clear skies because of which the warmer radiations of the sun could penetrate better giving a warm day as compared to the night. The cooler winds from the north further aided the drop in night temperature,” said Dr Sanap.Many parts of the state continue to witness the chilling nights. On Tuesday, the lowest minimum temperature in the state was recorded at Parbhani, Marathwada, at 10.8 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-sees-slight-rise-in-temperature/story-XIxsDQgFvBvdbppjiHDaGP.html

The decision was taken following a reluctance of some citizens to previous vaccination drives. A senior officer who was part of the first meeting to constitute the task force said, “We had faced a resistance from people during the earlier polio vaccination drive. To fight the crises we had included some religious leaders to clear rumours and encourage people to get their kids vaccinated. It had helped last time. This time too we are planning to include influential people from various religions. Although they were not present at the first meeting, they were informed via email that we might need their cooperation in future.” The officer, who asked to remain anonymous, said, “During the beginning of the pandemic we saw many rumours floating around which led to panic and fear mongering among people, which is possible during the vaccination drive too.” District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “They were not part of the meeting, but this would be a long and continuous vaccination drive and so we might include them in future if need be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dist-admin-brings-in-religious-leaders-to-ensure-smooth-covid-vaccination-drive/story-DWD1KiAQnvHKqtvQK8MpEO.html
08-12-2020||Kolkata||BJP worker shot in Siliguri rally would’ve lived had he listened to wife||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker Ulen Roy, who died of gunshot injuries under mysterious circumstances during a pitched battle between his fellow workers and the police at Siliguri town in north Bengal on Monday, might have lived had he listened to his wife. As the BJP demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and dismissed claims by the state police that Roy was shot by someone in the rally, his family said that he went to attend the event ignoring requests from his wife. A resident of Main Ghora village in the Bhaktinagar police station area of Jalpaiguri district, Roy left home early on Monday morning to participate in the BJP rally, the purpose of which was to march to Uttar Kanya, the state secretariat in north Bengal, in protest against policies of the government. Roy’s wife, Malati, wanted him to take their daughter to a local school in Jalpaiguri for admission in class 5. Roy, the only bread earner in the family, did not listen to her. As the family waited for his return, the news of his death arrived. The couple has two teenage sons as well. Also read: No midway, just ‘yes’ or ‘no’ from Amit Shah at today’s meeting, says farmers’ leader“I asked my husband not to go to the rally as it was more important to get Chintamani, our daughter, admitted in class 5 at Lalitabari High School. He said he would be back by 3 pm. Our life has been shattered,” said Malati Roy. “We are BJP supporters, like many more in this village” she added.Roy’s elder son Buddhadeb is in class 9 and the younger one, Sagar, is a student of class 6. Roy’s father, who is now 90, had once contested the local gram panchayat election for the Congress. The family lives in a wooden house in Baikantapur forest and elephants regularly raid the village. The family owns a small tea garden spread over three bighas of land. Ulen Roy used to work as a daily wage labourer as well to sustain the family.Atul Singha, a resident, said, “The BJP is rapidly expanding its base in this area. In the 2018 gram panchayat polls, the BJP candidate lost by a margin of only 11 votes.” On Monday, the BJP workers clashed with police when they were stopped on their way. As tear gas and water cannons were used to disperse the crowd, Roy collapsed. On Tuesday, four BJP Lok Sabha MPs visited the bereaved family and assured that they will bear the expense of the education of the three children. The MPs, Raju Bista from Darjeeling, Nisith Pramanik from Cooch Behar, Sukanta Majumdar from Jalpaiguri and Jayanta Kumar Roy from Jalpaiguri, also demanded a CBI probe into the death. Tapan Roy, a local BJP leader and member of local Sikharpur gram panchayat, alleged that two BJP supporters from the village were picked up by the police who asked them to sign on a piece of paper before the post-mortem examination was conducted. “The Police wanted to hand over the body to them at 2 am. They managed to flee,” said Roy.The BJP moved the local court demanding a second post mortem examination. The court granted permission on Tuesday evening. Dr Kausik Samajdar, superintendent of North Bengal Medical College and Hospital said, “The post mortem was conducted as per the district administration’s order. The body is kept at the morgue. The postmodern can be conducted for the second time once the magisterial order comes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-worker-who-died-in-siliguri-rally-chaos-would-ve-lived-had-he-listened-to-wife/story-PtVMP2uljF7ztFh1jJUGVJ.html

08-12-2020||Bhopal||4 arrested for trying to shield rape-accused police constable in Ujjain||Police in Ujjain arrested a Class IV employee of the health department on Monday for allegedly shielding the accused in a rape case. According to the police, the health department employee allegedly gave the idea to the rape accused and three others, including two constables, of giving another person’s sample for DNA testing. All four accused were arrested for impersonation, fabricating false evidence and hatching criminal conspiracy to change the sample of sperm and blood of the main accused Ajay Astey for DNA test, said Satyendra Shukla, superintendent of police, Ujjain. Ajay was posted as a constable in Police Line. The accused include Class IV employee Jagdish Kumar, two constables - Tabrez Khan, posted at Women police station, and Ghanshyam, posted at Neelganga police station - and the main accused’s cousin Balram Suryawanshi. Also read: No midway, just ‘yes’ or ‘no’ from Amit Shah at today’s meeting, says farmers’ leader“After Neelganga police arrested Ajay Astey on December 5, Jagdish Kumar contacted him and made the plan of impersonation. Jagdish asked him to arrange a person who can impersonate as Astey in the hospital while giving the sample. Astey, with the help of constable Ghanshyam, contacted his cousin Balram Suryawanshi and his friend constable Tabrez,” said the SP. The SP added, “A sub-inspector Hemlata and constable Ghanshyam took Astey to district hospital on Sunday for DNA test. Tabrez and Balram also reached the hospital. When on-duty doctor H Diwakar called Astey for the sample, Jagdish facilitated the entry of Balram with constable Ghanshyam into the room to give his sample for DNA test.” When the doctors asked for details, Balram got nervous. When the police interrogated Balram, he confessed his crime and took the names of Tabrez, Ghanshyam and Jagdish. All four were produced before the court and were subsequently sent on judicial remand on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/4-arrested-for-trying-to-shield-rape-accused-police-constable-in-ujjain/story-RK5pqpQpRUZfO7dShDVT2O.html
08-12-2020||Lucknow||Bharat Bandh invokes mixed response in UP, SP workers protest||The Bharat Bandh called by farmer unions, protesting the three Central agri laws, drew a mixed response in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday with shops and offices remaining largely open, while the Samajwadi Party held protests in a number of districts and even holding up a train in Allahabad.Samajwadi Party leaders sat on a silent protest near the statue of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh at the Vidhan Bhavan in Lucknow in support of the bandh. SP MLCs Rajpal Kashyap, Sunil Singh Sajan, Anand Bhadauria and Ashu Malik were part of it.However, life in state capital remained mostly unaffected with District Magistrate Abhishek Prakash saying that attendances in offices were absolutely normal.“The impact (of the Bharat Bandh) was zero in Lucknow as all the markets were open. The mandis were also open,” he said.Ashish Tripathi, a lawyer, said it was a normal day for him and his colleagues, and it took them almost the same time their office as on any other day.“Banking activity in the state was also by and large normal and there was no impact of Bharat Bandh,” Dilip Chauhan, the UP General Secretary of All India Bank Officers’ Confederation told PTI on Tuesday.Regional Manager of UPSRTC PK Bose said, “Passenger flow was less on Tuesday as compared to other days. However, operation-wise it was a normal day for us.” Samajwadi Party workers came out on the streets of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, raising slogans in support of the ‘Bharat Bandh’, leading to clashes with police at many places. They stopped the Bundelkhand Express at Prayagraj station, and raised slogans while sitting on the railway track.Allahabad Superintendent of Police (city) Dinesh Kumar Singh said, “Those who tried to hold up the Bundelkhand Express were taken into custody and the train later departed. Our teams are patrolling railway and bus stations and important places. So far, there has been no blockade of traffic and all markets are open.” Abhilash Basak, who runs a tour and travel agency in Allahabad, said, “Almost all the shops in the Civil Lines area are open and it is a normal day for us. Heavy police force has been deployed in the area.” Around 14 Samajwadi Party leaders in Banda were put under house arrest, while in Chitrakoot district, some SP workers who tried to stage a protest were arrested, police said. Some SP leaders in Mahoba were under house arrest from Monday itself. The call for bandh did not evoke any response in Amethi and Kaushambi as shops were open and business activities were normal. Shops remained open in Hamirpur, Jalaun and Lalitpur as well. In Bundelkhand the response to the call for bandh was partial and in Mau shops remained closed.In Mainpuri, lawyers abstained from work and the business at the wholesale grain market was affected, while for other establishments in the district it was a normal day.In Aligarh, hundreds of farmers squatted on a road leading to the Yamuna Expressway and blocked traffic for several hours. Samajwadi Party leader and former Lok Sabha MP from Aligarh Brijendra Singh and a group of party workers were arrested when they squatted a the crossing on the Exhibition Road in solidarity with the protesting farmers, police said.Despite some protests by SP and Congress workers in Gorakhpur, shops were open and traffic was as usual, while there was normal attendance in private and government offices. Police said that some political leaders and workers were detained for maintaining law and order.City Magistrate Abhinav Ranjan Srivastav said, “All markets were open and police and administrative officials were vigilant. Some people who violated section 144 of CrPC (which prevents assembly of five or more people at one spot), were detained to maintain law and order.” SP leader and former minister Arvind Singh Gope told PTI that he has been put under house arrest in Barabanki. Senior Congress leader Pradeep Mathur also claimed that he has been arrested along with many party workers in Mathura.There were also reports of Congress leaders and workers being put under house arrest or getting arrested in Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Chitrakoot, Saharanpur and Kanpur. A senior state government official, however, asserted that the situation was peaceful in the state.Rashtriya Kisan Manch president Shekhar Dixit alleged that instead of resolving problems faced by the farmers, attempts were being made to blame them.“This will prove costly,” he warned.Dixit alleged that the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government never reached the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.“The government has to revamp its style of working, otherwise the issue of doubling the income of the farmers will only remain a day dream,” he said.Agitating farmer unions have given a call for a nationwide strike on Tuesday to press for the repeal of the Centre’s agri laws with almost all opposition parties and several trade unions backing the it and many announcing parallel protests in support of the farmers.The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/bharat-bandh-invokes-mixed-response-in-up-sp-workers-protest/story-btBK7Nsdp4yOuC70IMFxmI.html

The plot holders below 1,500 square feet can erect the construction without submitting the plan to local bodies. They will have to pay the development fees and maps to the municipal corporation,” he said.According to the new rules citizens will now also be able to enjoy the benefit of various amenities like gardens, gyms, clubhouse and swimming pool on any floor of a residential building as the Maharashtra government had approved the Singapore model for erecting amenities which will not be part of the floor space index (FSI).Earlier all amenities were allowed only on the ground floor.Ujwal Keskar, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, said, “There are few small plot holders in the city. We object to the unified DC rules which are against the basic thumb rule of the constitution. It is the interference of the state government in the municipal corporation.”“Three main things of the Pune city are not mentioned in the development rules. There is no mention of the transit-oriented zone, hill top and hill slope and cluster policy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/devp-rules-allow-construction-on-plots-up-to-1-500-sqft-without-permission/story-xO6TUnODwD9zc5u6eqncPP.html

They have given an application, but PMC will not be giving any permission for any kind of work on a hill slope or hill top following environment norms,” said Prashant Waghmare, city engineer, PMC.A stop-work notice was issued to MIT citing unauthorised work on the hill slope at survey number 123 in Kothrud, and on Friday the PMC had dug up the road being constructed and ordered the institute to clear the debris within two days.The residents, meanwhile, have also written to the municipal commissioner stating that “MIT has illegally started construction for a road without any permission from the Building Department. This section of Vetal tekdi, though under MIT ownership is an hill-top-hill-slopes (HTHS) zone and as per PMC’s DC rules, very limited construction activity is allowed, and Vetal tekdi is on the list of heritage sites identified in the Maharashtra Govt notice dated 27th September 2000, which has 46 sites listed under Natural Heritage.”“Any construction activity on this hill will cause tremendous ecological damage to one of the few remaining natural green spaces in the heart of the city. It will bring unwanted traffic to the top of the hill which is an ecologically sensitive Reserved Forest and will eventually lead to encroachments in the form of hawkers, food stalls, hutments and others. Most importantly, it will disrupt one of the largest aquifer systems in Pune and affect groundwater recharge capacity,” stated the letter further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-instructs-mit-to-stop-work-on-hill-slope-road-remove-debris/story-dgOsH9zAJ4LgQv74LfdLtJ.html
08-12-2020||Pune||18-member task force formed for vaccination programme in Pune district||PUNE In the first meeting to formulate a strategy to conduct the first of its kind massive Covid-19 vaccination programme, the district administration has begun by forming a district task force. An 18-member team has been formed to look into this massive vaccination programme.The team will be headed by district collector and representatives from Indian Medical Association (IMA), among others.Although the Covid-19 vaccine is not finalised yet, there would be two doses of 0.5 ml which would be given in an interval of 28 days, said civic officials.All the healthcare workers who were earlier asked to be registered under the vaccine beneficiary programme would be prioritised, reiterated district collector. The number of such healthcare workers is also huge and so the task force would strategise the vaccination drive which would also include help from police forces.Healthcare workers from 98,38 health facilities would be registered under the central government out of which all the government hospital staff has been registered, however, staff from about 1,720 private hospitals in the PMC area have not yet shared the required data, said, officials.Rajesh Deshmukh, district collector, said, “We are still filling in the database for the healthcare workers who would be finalised for the first dose of the vaccine. This would include MBBS doctors and also the nursing staff who will later vaccinate the general public.”“Today (on Monday) we had representatives from all the three cantonment boards, police, education officers, WHO and also the district health officers present for the meeting. We do not know which vaccine would be finalised but this meeting was to form the task force and finalise the tasks for all of the members who would ensure that this massive vaccination drive is completed smoothly,” he said.Another health official on condition of anonymity said, “We would prioritise vaccination for healthcare workers as decided earlier. We have the existing facilities from our polio or measles-rubella vaccination including the required ice boxes, ice lined refrigerator, deep freezer, cold boxes and also vaccine carriers.”“We have schools where the vaccination can be carried out. We would need three rooms one for pre-vaccination isolation, the vaccination room and then the post-vaccination room wherein those administered the vaccine would be examined for 30-45 minutes,” he said.“We would need the help of private hospitals too since this would be a mammoth task to vaccinate the entire district. We do not know the exact number of doses that the city would get and whether or not all residents will be eligible for it, but the number of those to be vaccinated would be in lakhs which needs to be done in the shortest possible time and so we are roping in all possible agencies to ensure that the task is completed smoothly. Even the police are in the loop to avoid overcrowding at the vaccination centres,” said the official.The front line workers who would be prioritised include nursing staff, MBBS doctors, allopathy doctors, medical college and research centre staff, sanitisation workers, ambulance drivers and clerical staff from both government and private hospital. Those health staff who will later vaccinate general public will also undergo training for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/18-member-task-force-formed-for-vaccination-programme-in-pune-district/story-BmeDjIcnwnIGtfCz2pIcaN.html

The policy would collaborate the existing health schemes too like the PMC urban poor scheme.”“We have also discussed on trauma care centres for each zones, however, this is not yet confirmed but will be discussed over the coming meetings,” he said.“The new policy would also prioritize the population which needs first health attention and also manpower and building up new healthcare facilities. This would also make Pune the first city to have a dedicated health policy if the policy is set in place,” he said. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, who would also be the consultant for the policy, said, “It is in the preliminary stage right now but the policy would also streamline the expenditure of PMC’s health budget.”“The ultimate aim of the policy would be to achieve zero maternal mortality, lower infant mortality and based on universal health care. The policy would integrate the work of other related departments including solid waste management, sewage management and also water sanitization. It would also include the partnership of private hospitals. Eventually, the quality of life of the city will improve,” he said.Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said, “This was the first meeting. The PMC first needs to finalize what it wants through this policy after which we would be able to give our suggestions. It is a good step indeed.”“Pune is a non-capital metro and so it does not get the required limelight when it comes to healthcare facilities. There have to be more hospitals and medical colleges in the city given its history with epidemic diseases and also the population,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-to-draft-dedicated-health-policy-for-pune-city/story-dEgeyGNiGNCbQ3HDmPSArI.html

The “regular” deployment outside CM Kejriwal’s residence was for his safety, police added. “The deployment which is being seen outside the residence of CM Kejriwal is the regular deployment for the security of the Hon’ CM.

Now, public is not being allowed to meet him. Does this mean he is under house arrest? Why are all these security personnel posted here?,” Sisodia said.Earlier in the day, AAP had claimed chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was put under house arrest after his visit to the farmers protesting the three central farm laws at the national capital’s Singhu border.“BJP’s Delhi Police has put Hon’ble CM Shri @ArvindKejriwal under house arrest ever since he visited farmers at Singhu Border yesterday.

08-12-2020||Ranchi||Bharat Bandh: Inter-state traffic, private businesses affected in Jharkhand||The nationwide shutdown over the Centre’s new farm laws evoked a mixed response in Jharkhand on Tuesday with government offices functioning as usual, private institutions and shops closed in some areas, while local traffic was near normal but long-distance vehicles remained off the roads.Protests and demonstrations were held in Ranchi, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh, Jamshedpur, Palamu, Dumka, Bokaro, Sahibganj and Pakur but no untoward incident was reported from anywhere, officials said.Director-General of Police MV Rao said that the situation in all the districts was peaceful.All the central government and state government offices were functioning normally in Ranchi, but the ‘Bharat Bandh’ had an impact on private offices and business establishments.Some private establishments were shut, while more than half were open.Left supporters along with workers of the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal held demonstrations and protests in several cities and towns across the state.There was no significant impact of the shutdown on local traffic in all districts, while inter-state bus services and movement of long-distance vehicles came to a standstill.In Pattabari in Dumka, JMM supporters blocked the road, stopping vehicular movement for some time.In Palamu’s Medininagar, Kisan Sabha state executive president KD Singh led a demonstration along with dozens of activists, protesting against the farm laws.Protesting farmers blocked the Kolkata-Delhi national highway at Kishan Chowk in Dhanbad in the morning for an hour, disrupting traffic.Besides, supporters of the Congress, JMM and CPI(M) blocked the National Highway-32 at Randhir Verma Chowk. They burnt tyres to block the traffic but police removed them swiftly.However, operations were normal in the coalfields in the state. Though the trade unions supported the shutdown, Bharat Coming Coal Limited (BCCL) officials said coal mining and dispatch remained unaffected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/bharat-bandh-inter-state-traffic-private-businesses-affected-in-jharkhand/story-zBdiFLQ7l2A1hPMupoYJtJ.html
08-12-2020||Mumbai||Humanity most important: Bombay high court on Gautam Navlakha being denied spectacles in Taloja jail||It’s high time that workshops are conducted for jail officials, the Bombay high court said on Tuesday while reacting to Taloja jail officials’ refusal to accept new spectacles sent by the family of 70-year-old Gautam Navlakha, a civil liberties and human rights activist arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case and in judicial custody. Navlakha has been in Taloja jail since his arrest on October 1, 2018. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has alleged that till August 2018, he was a member of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). On Monday, Navlakha’s partner Sahba Hussain had said, “He is allowed to speak to me only once a week. On November 30, he told me that his spectacles were stolen and that he was under stress. My question is how can spectacles be stolen inside the jail? Particularly, because he removes them only when he goes to sleep.” In a media release, Sahba said that Navlakha’s spectacles were stolen on November 27 and that “It was an emergency, for he is close to being blind without his glasses. Yet, he was not permitted to call home for a replacement until three days later, but even that call proved futile.” A senior jail official, requesting anonymity, said, “When Navlakha informed us about his spectacles being stolen, we told him that he has to look after his belongings. But we told him to give us his prescription...and we also asked him to inform his family to deliver it. We did not receive any response from him after that. Later, we received a courier which we do not accept because of security reasons.” “We gather from news reports that Navlakha has lost his spectacles in jail and when his family took him a new pair, the jail authorities refused to accept them,” said the bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik. “Can this (spectacles) be denied,” the bench asked. “These are human considerations. Humanity is most important, everything else will follow subsequently,” the judges added. The court was hearing separate petitions filed by Ramesh Gaichor and Sagar Gorkhe, both arrested in Bhima Koregaon case, questioning their arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/humanity-most-important-bombay-high-court-on-gautam-navlakha-being-denied-spectacles-in-taloja-jail/story-XRdQXgysFF3szdUM4ZonFO.html

As per the sitting notice issued to the two commissioners on December 7, they have been asked to appear before the committee on December 9. Senior AAP leader and committee chairperson Atishi on Tuesday said the two landfill sites have been major contributors to air pollution in Delhi. “The two commissioners have been summoned to ensure that such fire incidents do not occur in the future,” Atishi said in a statement. She added that the meeting has been called to know the reason behind poor waste management of the municipal corporations, which is leading to frequent incidents of garbage burning and a considerable increase in the height of the landfill sites in Delhi. On November 25, a fire at the Ghazipur landfill that raged for over 12 hours had led to a spike in the pollution levels in Delhi with the air quality reaching the severe zone. Three days later, another fire was reported from the Bhalaswa landfill site. “These fire incidents are making all the efforts of the Delhi government redundant and strict action must be taken against the authorities responsible for the fires,” said Atishi. HT has reached out to the commissioners of the North and East corporations for comment. The report will be updated with their responses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/landfill-fires-delhi-assembly-panel-summons-commissioners-of-east-north-delhi-municipal-corporations/story-VkbsWbLBLHMSMiOL65YUsM.html

Everyone has a reason to escape challan||As much as a mask is an absolute necessity in the Covid-19 times, it is advised by one and all to not to flout the safety protocols, no matter what! But, quite often, and still Delhi-NCR residents are being caught not wearing a mask. To top it, the bahanas (excuses) that thus follow are hard to ignore for the imagination at play here is stupendous! Here are all the reasons that denizens have been enlisting, when caught without a mask. Read, and laugh out, but don’t follow suit.‘Paani pene ke liye utara tha’A Gurugram-based young professional says, “I was alone with absolutely no one in the car. And I had pulled my mask down to hand around my neck for only a few minutes. Just then a cop approached me and said, ‘Fine nikalo!’. I got flustered and said, ‘Sir maine to sirf pani peene ke liye utara tha bas pehenne hi laga tha’. Yet I was challaned ₹500.”‘Hard to breathe when masked’“I have tried to make an excuse and escape being challaned, but it didn’t work. Cops just don’t listen! I told them I have breathing issues, and that the mask makes it hard for me to breathe. It isn’t exactly a lie though, but yeah I know it’s important to wear it all the time,” says a college student who wishes to stay anonymous. ‘Had to throw the gum’Delhi-based Chim Sharma, an engineering student, shares an interesting incident. “I was at Lajpat Nagar at around 2 one afternoon. While standing by the roadside with my friend, I was casually chewing gum and talking. The moment I pulled down my mask to get some fresh air, a Police jeep appeared out of nowhere, halted next to me, and asked me to pay the fine. To save myself the trouble, I said ‘I was about to throw the chewing gum away and was looking for a bin so that I don’t spit in public, and hence took the mask down. I tried to con them into believing me, but alas, no use! I had to pay the fine.”‘Fine only one of the twins, please’“My twin brother and I were in car and had come out to pick up something from the grocery store nearby. In the hurry to leave, we forgot to wear our masks and just a short distance from our house a policeman caught us without it. When he asked to pay challan, we told him our situation and convinced him to fine only one of us instead of both since we’re twins,” says a resident of Greater Kailash II. ‘Just going nearby’A Gurugram-based college student says, “I’m mostly careful all the time, but this once I missed wearing a mask while stepping out, and my God... the cops caught me! My go-to excuse was that I forgot to wear it; which was also a fact. I insisted that I’m going nearby, it will just take five minutes to come back, and even apologised to them for this miss. I told them that I won’t repeat it ever again. I think they saw my genuineness, and that’s why I got saved from shelling out money for the fine.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unmasked-in-delhi-everyone-has-a-reason-to-escape-challan/story-J8ghA2o0aoowDxvFoxwQgP.html
08-12-2020||Mumbai||Weight of paper can’t be counted while quantifying LSD, says Bombay high court||The weight of the paper used to carry LSD drops cannot be counted while determining the quantity of the contraband material -- if it is small, intermediate or commercial as contemplated under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, the Bombay high court said on Monday while granting bail to a Thane resident who was allegedly found in possession of LSD doses and charas.Justice Sandeep Shinde said the paper, which releases the drug on swallowing, only carries the drug and facilitates its consumption. “The paper with LSD drops, as a whole, is neither “preparation” nor a “mixture” within the meaning of the NDPS Act,” said the judge.The court said that Thane sessions court refused bail to the accused, Hitesh Malhotra, by wrongly including weight of the papers used to carry the LSD drops in total quantity of the contraband material.Malhotra was arrested by Vartaknagar police in Thane on June 8, 2019, after he was allegedly found in possession of 10 pieces of papers laced with LSD drops. His house search purportedly yielded 13 more pieces of LSD-laced papers and 970 gm charas.He moved high court for bail after Thane sessions court refused him bail on the ground that the quantity of the contraband material recovered from him was commercial. Commercial quantity in case of LSD is 0.1 gm and 1kg in case of charas.His counsel, advocate Suhas Oak, pointed out that total weight of the 10 pieces recovered from Malhotra was 140 milligram, but the weight of the other 13 papers was mentioned nowhere. However, on the basis of chemical analyser’s report, he claimed that the actual quantity of LSD recovered from the 39-year-old was 0.4128 milligram, much smaller than the commercial quantity (0.1 gm).Oak added that the recovered charas too was below the commercial quantity and therefore, there was no legal impediment in releasing the accused on bail.Malhotra was granted bail on furnishing personal bond of Rs1 lakh with one or two sureties in the same amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/weight-of-paper-can-t-be-counted-while-quantifying-lsd-says-bombay-high-court/story-XBRQsWYQHjztqasyNgSsSK.html

How police are prepping||As the four-hour Bharat Bandh or the nationwide strike on Tuesday called by farmers protesting against three farm laws is taking shape, the crowd at Delhi’s borders is swelling by the minute as more farmers have joined the demonstration since Monday night and many more are yet to arrive. Security at the borders where the farmer groups are camping has been stepped up in view of the strike.At the Singhu border, police personnel have taken positions along the barricades and at several other points.

The protesters, last week on Thursday, had shut down the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway and with Tuesday’s development, National Highway-9 is now completely blocked. Hundreds of protesters who had been staging protest at the blocked Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway on Tuesday morning proceeded to the Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway as soon as the bandh started from 11am. “The traffic is blocked by protesters on the other side as well and they said that it will be for a few hours. The Delhi Police has stopped traffic from their side and have made diversions,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, superintendent of police, Ghaziabad. Ghaziabad district administration and police had made elaborate arrangements for the bandh but were unable to prevent protesters from blocking the other side of the highway even though it was imminent. They had said they were fully prepared and will not allow blockade of the second carriageway of the highway. Catch LIVE Updates of Bharat Bandh here“We were prepared but did not take any stern action. The protesters have told us that they will remain on Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway till 3pm when their bandh ends. In the meanwhile, the Delhi Police have also diverted traffic on their side and no vehicle is coming to UP-Gate from Delhi. The other side is already closed,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The UP-Gate border is part of Delhi-Meerut Expressway project and caters to estimated 120,000 passenger car units on a daily basis. It caters to commuters from Ghaziabad, Noida and Delhi and also to the long-distance commuters who travel to Moradabad, Bareilly and Lucknow among other cities in the state. As both carriageways at the UP-Gate remained blocked on Tuesday morning, commuters used the nearby Kaushambi-Anand Vihar border (Maharajpur border) to move between Delhi and Ghaziabad. Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic), said there was no disruption at other borders with Delhi. “The traffic is plying normally between Delhi and Ghaziabad at other borders except on NH-9 where it is completely blocked at UP-Gate. However, the volume of traffic at other borders is low considering the Bharat Bandh call,” he added. VK Mittal, president of Kushambi Apartments resident welfare association, said that ever since the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway was blocked, majority of commuters were using the Kaushambi border to move to Delhi. “The movement of commuters continued even on Tuesday but there were fewer vehicles though they continued to move to Delhi through the inner lanes of our locality as well,” Mittal, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bharat-bandh-nh-9-completely-blocked-as-protesters-block-delhi-ghaziabad-carriageway-at-up-gate/story-3VjGL0DthA4TkMEGuuu1FL.html

But, this year, the Grinch has come in the avatar of Covid-19, which is proving to be an obstacle to be choir groups in Delhi-NCR, not letting them congregate in large numbers for Christmas carol rehearsals. That, however, doesn’t mean that this could take away the Xmas cheer! Musicians and choirs have decided to share season’s greetings virtually. So, put on your winter finery and log in to watch and revel in these online Xmas delights. Virtual video practice replaces live sessionsCommunity music groups from across the city are prepping to deliver a digital Christmas, and have been preparing for the same both online and offline. Figuring out the intricacies of conducting a live virtual concert, Mukul Singh from choir group of Youth For Christ, says, “We have been meeting in small groups, and practice on video calls as well. The musicians receive their notations via email. For Christmas, we are hoping to incorporate both new and old carols and even a skit, in the video session we’ve planned. We’ve prepared a few songs, in both Hindi and English, which we will soon release on our social media handles.”Keeping tradition alive with safety in mind For 26 years, the choir group The Capital City Minstrels (CCM) has been enthralling people with their performances. Reem Khokhar, a group member, tells us how virtual collaboration is a deviation from their tradition of meeting every Wednesday to practice. “We have been doing that for many years now. But this year, since we have people of all ages in the choir, who need to be safe amid rising cases in the Capital, we haven’t met since March,” she says. The choir members are however keeping alive the tradition of celebrating Christmas season, and training under their conductor Amy Camp. “We are currently rehearsing popular Christmas songs like ‘Christmas is coming’, ‘Need a little Christmas’ and ‘Silent Night’ among others,” adds Khokhar.E-carolling all the way to Christmas!“The biggest challenge is not knowing when we will be able to perform in front of a live audience again, but we’re trying to move forward,” says Aubrey Aloysius, from Gurugram-based Lorraine Music Academy, which used to perform flash mobs across Delhi-NCR in pre-Covid Christmas seasons. “In the pandemic, we have tried to keep students engaged with music, to help them cope with changing circumstances, and we have decided to organise a concert in our virtual auditorium that will glitter and vibrate with the Yuletide spirit and song,” adds Aloysius. As part of this e-concert, more than a 100 youngsters from across the country will sing carols such as Joy To The World, We Wish You A Merry Christmas, Carol of the Bells, O Holy Night, and Jingle Bell Rock, in both traditional and modern styles. “Christmas isn’t complete without engaging with the community, and with e-carolling, we will ensure that the spirit of Christmas stays alive, even as we fight the pandemic, and hope for better days,” he adds.

If the Narendra Modi government fails to address our issues, we are ready for a long protest,” he said.Shops, malls and business activities remained suspended in Rohtak and other towns.

08-12-2020||Delhi||Bharat Bandh: AAP alleges Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest; Delhi Police deny claim||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday alleged that the Delhi Police, on the directions of the Central government, “has almost“ put chief minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest ever since he returned from Singhu border after meeting the protesting farmers. The Delhi Police, however, categorically denied the allegations and said it is “general deployment” and that the CM’s movement has not been barred in any way.Addressing a press conference, AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj on Tuesday morning said no one, not even domestic helper, is being allowed to leave or enter the CM’s official residence since Monday. The CM had to cancel all his scheduled meetings on Tuesday, he said.“On a day when the entire country is supporting the farmers in the Bharat Bandh, the Central government’s home ministry has asked the Delhi Police to not allow Kejriwal to leave his residence. Yesterday, when Kejriwal, along with all his Cabinet colleagues, went to Singhu border to meet the protesting farmers as a sewadar, the BJP-led Central government got scared. It is the same way as they got upset when Kejriwal did not allow the Delhi Police to convert nine stadiums into temporary jails for the farmers,” he said.Watch l ‘Kejriwal under house arrest; orders from MHA’: AAP MLA slams Centre Catch LIVE Updates of Bharat Bandh hereThe AAP leader said the “so-called” protest of the BJP mayors and other BJP leaders in front of the CM’s residence since Tuesday morning is “a ploy“ to keep Kejriwal under house arrest.By afternoon, more than hundred AAP workers including several party MLAs and other leaders like MP Bhagwant Mann congregated near the cordoned off area outside Kejriwal’s residence at 6, Flagstaff Road, Civil Lines. They continue to sit on dharna on the road and are demanding removal of the barricades from the area. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also arrived at the spot at around 3.30pm and attempted to enter the CM’s residence. “Everyday I visit the CM’s home at least thrice for different meetings. But, today, the police did not allow me as well. The police said they will decide who can go inside and who can’t. If this is not house arrest then what is? CM Kejriwal denied stadiums to be turned into jails for farmers, that is why the Central government now has turned his house into a jail,” said Sisodia from outside the Chief Minister’s residence which has now turned into a dharna site. After talking to reporters, the deputy CM joined the sit-in being staged by Bhagwant Mann and other AAP leaders on the road leading to Kejriwal’s residence. Meanwhile, the Delhi Police said the AAP’s claim of the chief minister being put under house arrest is “incorrect”. “He (Kejriwal) exercises his right to free movement within the law of the land. A picture of the house entrance says it all,” Anto Alphonse, DCP, North Delhi, said in a tweet which also included a picture from outside Kejriwal’s residence.Later, Alphonse added that it is a general deployment to avoid any clash between AAP and any other party.State home minister Satyendar Jain also took to Twitter and said the actions of the BJP government reminded him of the Emergency in the country. He, along with AAP social media cell, soon started tweeting multiple posts with the hashtag #BJPHouseArrestsKejriwal.AAP leader Raghav Chadha said that it is “absolutely shocking” that the Delhi CM has been put under house arrest upon his return from Singhu Border. “Brute power of the state used to prevent Delhi CM from lending support to the farmers’ andolan and #BharatBandh, apart from violating his right to free movement,” Chadha said in a tweet.Bhardwaj also alleged that the Delhi Police beat up some of the AAP MLAs who wanted to enter the CM’s residence for a meeting on Monday, and denied them entry. Refuting AAP’s allegation, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “The mayors and councillors are peacefully protesting outside the CM’s residence. The CM attended three events yesterday and today also, he is free to go wherever he wants to. We just want the government to clear the dues as the corporations are unable to pay salaries to its employees. We will continue our protest till we get the funds.”On Tuesday morning, Gupta along with West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma joined the councillors in their protest outside Delhi CM’s residence. The three mayors had sat on a protest outside the CM’s residence in November. BJP leaders say that last month the government had assured the dues will be cleared. Verma said, “The least the CM can do is call all of them inside and talk to them. The government should clear the dues. But no one from the CM’s office or the government has met the mayors who have been sitting outside since yesterday.” Other BJP MPs are likely to join the protest.

08-12-2020||Delhi||Bharat Bandh: Delhi’s mandi associations join protest; fruit, vegetable trade likely to be hit||Trade of fruits and vegetables in Delhi is likely to be hit on Tuesday as several associations in the city’s mandis have decided to join the Bharat Bandh call given by farmers protesting against the Centre’s farm laws.On Tuesday morning, the Azadpur Mandi and Ghazipur Mandi wore a deserted look with only a few traders setting up their stalls to trade fruits and vegetables. The Ghazipur Mandi is also affected because of its proximity to the NH-24, Delhi’s border with UP’s Ghaziabad, which is completely shut because of the protesting farmers. Adil Ahmed Khan, chairman of Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi which trades fruits and vegetables in wholesale, said several traders’ associations of the market along with those in Ghazipur and Okhla have decided not to operate on Tuesday. Catch LIVE Updates of Bharat Bandh Here“Almost all associations within Azadpur Mandi have said they will not engage in any trade of fruit and vegetables on Tuesday in support of the farmers’ protest. Traders have even put banners at all gates of Azadpur Mandi in solidarity with the one-day strike. This is a historic decision because if there are no farmers, there will be no traders in our mandis. But, there is nothing to panic. Delhi won’t face any crisis due to shortage of supplies,” said Khan.However, not all traders appeared to agree with Khan as they said it would be business as usual for them. “It is preposterous to say that mandis like those in Azadpur, Ghazipur, Okhla or Narela will be completely shut on Tuesday. All these markets will remain open and many of us will also engage in usual business. Trucks with the daily supply of fruits and vegetables have already started coming from Monday evening, an indication that it is business as usual. It is only a section of traders who may opt join the strike and keep their shops shut,” said Anil Malhotra, a wholesale trader and member of the Azadpur Agriculture Produce Marketing Company (APMC). Several traders from three prominent APMCs in Delhi – Azadpur, Ghazipur and Okhla – said supplies in the national Capital have already been hit because of the road closures along the borders as the farmers continued their protest for the eleventh consecutive day. “A large number of traders have stopped sending fruits and vegetables to other states temporarily and are focusing only on local supplies to keep prices stable in Delhi. Arrival of fruits and vegetables in Azadpur has dropped significantly from around 11,500 trucks per day on an average for this time of the year to around 6,000 trucks a day,” said Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bharat-bandh-delhi-s-mandi-associations-join-protest-fruit-vegetable-trade-likely-to-be-hit/story-vjCVfP2HTyUvZO7ZP6EtnL.html

08-12-2020||Kolkata||Rally turns violent, BJP worker killed in Bengal||A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker died and several other people were injured in pitched battles between political workers and policemen during a planned rally in Siliguri town in north Bengal on Monday.The police lobbed tear gas shells and used water cannons to stop BJP workers and leaders from moving towards Uttar Kanya, the state secretariat in north Bengal, violating prohibitory orders under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The police also used a pink dye in the water to mark the agitators. In response, workers from the BJP and its young wing physically clashed with police and pelted stones at them in at least four places in north Bengal’s largest city. The rally was part of the BJP’s ongoing protests against the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in the run-up to assembly polls early next year.The BJP alleged that a party worker identified as Ulen Rai from Gajoldoba in Jalpaiguri district was beaten to death by the police during lathi charge. However, police claimed there was no lathicharge and the cause of death was being ascertained.“Today in Siliguri, serious acts of violence were committed by the supporters of a political party during their protest program. They resorted to arson, brick-batting, firing and vandalism of govt property. Police showed restraint and didn’t do lathi charge or used firearms. Only water cannons and tear gas were used to disperse the violent crowd. However, death of a person has been reported. Body is being sent for PM (postmortem examination),” the West Bengal Police tweeted in the evening. To mark its protest, the BJP will observe a 12-hour bandh on Tuesday in north Bengal districts where it won seven of eight Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections. BJP workers held agitations in Nadia, East Burdwan, Howrah, Kolkata and other districts on Monday evening. “In no state will you see the government crushing a peaceful democratic movement in this manner. Constitutional experts need to take a note of this,” Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) president Tejasvi Surya said. BJP’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, national secretary Arvind Menon, state president Dilip Ghosh and several Lok Sabha members took part in the rally. The party said 40 workers, including six women, were injured. Senior party leaders met governor Jagdeep Dhankhar in Kolkata and demanded a judicial probe into the death of Rai, 50. He died at a private hospital shortly after sustaining an injury in the chest. In the evening, Dhankhar reacted sharply to the state police’s response. “Am stunned and shocked at this judgmental stance @WBPolice. With such a finding recorded and disseminated in public domain there can be no semblance of fair investigation @MamataOfficial!” the governor tweeted. The clashes took place in at least four places, including Tinbatti More and Phoolbari Bazar. Several women in the processions fell ill after inhaling the tear gas. BJP and BYJM workers, who were leading two processions from opposite directions, were spotted pelting stones at the police when they were stopped from moving towards Uttar Kanya.The ruling Trinamool Congress condemned the BJP . “The incident was a public display of the violence the BJP believes in. Its workers provoked the police to open fire. I thank the police for handling the situation. The BJP will fail to create disturbance in the state,” said Saugata Roy, TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/rally-turns-violent-bjp-worker-killed-in-bengal/story-dvHmn6CMURl4gYQSuniBIJ.html
08-12-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers’ agitation: Parkash Singh Badal seeks PM Modi’s intervention||Attributing the ongoing farmers’ campaign against the three agricultural laws to the abandonment of a federal approach, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) stalwart Parkash Singh Badal on Monday sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal intervention to break the stalemate by repealing the contentious laws. “The ongoing crisis needs your immediate and undivided attention. I strongly urge you to show magnanimity,” the former Union minister and five-time Punjab chief minister wrote in a letter to Modi on the eve of the Bharat Bandh called by farmers to protest against the laws. “As a first step, the three Acts in question that have pushed the country into deep turmoil must be withdrawn without making the farmers and their families endure any more suffering in this biting cold,” said Badal. This is the first time that the Akali supremo, who turns 93 on Tuesday, has written to Modi since the SAD walked out of the NDA and ended its 24-year association with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the farm laws that have pitched farmers’ bodies against the Centre. The issue, Badal said, does not concern farmers alone but affects the entire economic fabric of the country because traders, businessmen, shopkeepers and workers are directly affected by it. In a scathing critique of the Modi government, Badal said the roots of the ongoing crisis lie in the abdication of a commitment to the federal approach. “The farmers’ crisis is not the only instance where this inclusive approach to nation building has been ignored or abandoned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-agitation-parkash-singh-badal-seeks-pm-modi-s-intervention/story-POsHXaAomWQWSnxx5hhxbN.html
08-12-2020||Lucknow||SP chief Akhilesh Yadav detained outside Lucknow residence||The Uttar Pradesh police detained Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday after he led a brief sit-in protest in Lucknow even as the administration sealed the road leading to his residence ahead of his rally against the new farm laws.Earlier in the day, Yadav, accompanied by party workers, broke through police barricades placed near his residence in Lucknow. As police resisted, the leader squatted in the middle of the road as SP workers raised slogans against the government. Yadav was later detained, triggering protests by supporters.The SP chief was scheduled to go to Kannauj to lead a farmers’ protest after the party gave a call for a statewide “kisan yatra’’ against the laws on Monday, but he was not allowed to leave his residence.Joint commissioner of police, Lucknow, Naveen Arora said, “The police were deployed to prevent any law and order trouble. The Kannauj district magistrate had sent a notice to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav not to visit Kannauj as protests, demonstrations are prohibited in the district. The same message was conveyed to the Lucknow police following which we have acted.”Soon after his detention, Akhilesh wrote a letter to Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla. “I am a Lok Sabha MP and national president of the Samajwadi Party... This undemocratic behaviour of the state government is not only an infringement of my rights as a citizen but also of special privileges as a Lok Sabha member. Kindly intervene, so that my right to my democratic duties is restored,” he wrote.Lucknow police have registered a case under the Epidemic Act and few other sections against Akhilesh Yadav and 28 others over the party’s Kisan Yatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/sp-chief-akhilesh-yadav-detained-outside-lucknow-residence/story-DRzN40nmhJu4KKuI8uZoLK.html
08-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Living a life without fear||Nathu Ram hasn’t been in touch with relatives and friends for a long time. He wonders if his parents are still alive.Even so, “I feel no anxiety,” he says.This morning Nathu Ram is walking through a central Delhi bazaar. The shops are still shuttered. The market arcades are empty except for stray dogs sleeping around here and there. Which is fine: Nathu Ram says he is detached from the world.Indeed, he’s partly dressed in the attire of a mystic—he has a saffron turban. He spends his day wandering around city lanes, singing devotionals and playing music in his ektara (which he’s holding in his hand, but not playing for the moment); and receiving tributes of money and sometimes fruit from people who appreciate his rendition of popular bhajans. Not wishing to disclose where he sleeps at night, Nathu Ram admits that he isn’t completely cut off from “duniyadari (worldliness). “I depend on people to give me money and food... I still have one moh (attraction) left in the world, my ektara.”A native of Alwar, Nathu Ram acquired the stringed instrument “many, many years ago” in a Rajasthan town whose name he can’t remember. The instrument is patched up with cello tape at various places. The street musician refuses to share his age but says “I left my home to be a baba when I was very young.” Never feeling the urge to meet his family again, Nathu Ram says that “when a man becomes a baba, he grow apart from his parents, his brothers, his sisters, his wife if he has any.” Indeed, during the course of his wanderings Nathu Ram has passed through Alwar many times but he never thought of “taking up the street that goes to my home.”As the talk veers towards the ongoing coronavirus pandemic—Nathu Ram himself is wearing a mask—he says that “for me the world itself has been a mahamari (pandemic) but I don’t try to run from it.” He explains—“I have no hope, so no fear... I’m in no hurry to die or to live... I look after my health but not worried for the day when I’ll be ill.”He now walks away, still not playing his ektara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-living-a-life-without-fear/story-HAfffFbfbuow0ELpaBc06N.html

She claimed while they had reached a compromise in 2014, which she alleged she was forced into, the security officer concerned was threatening her again after she sought a copy of the compromise.Following her fresh complaint, PUCASH is investigating the matter and has held several meetings already. A PUCASH member, requesting anonymity, said, “The matter was settled between them in 2014 and no fresh incident, which can amount to sexual harassment, has taken place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-s-female-security-guard-files-sexual-harassment-complaint/story-vfgzqVwL8sZdmyp6odQ7mN.html
08-12-2020||City||Bharat bandh: All trade, arhtiya unions in Punjab announce to keep commercial establishments shut||Nearly all trade unions in Punjab have announced to shut their commercial establishments on Tuesday to extend their support to the Bharat bandh call given by the farmers who have been protesting at the Delhi border for the last 11 days against the Centre’s three agriculture laws. The trade unions have been helping the farmer organisations garner support for the complete shutdown. The Punjab Arhtiya Association has also directed its members across the state to shut down their businesses for a day. Also, truck unions, petrol pump associations and labour unions extended their support to the call. Besides, all major political parties in the state — the ruling Congress, opposition Shiromani Akali Dal (AAP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) — have asked their workers to make the bandh a success. Punjab Pradesh Vyapar Mandal state president Seth Pyare Lal said it is the moral responsibility of the traders to stand with the farmers in such a crisis. “Though the traders will face financial losses due to a shutdown but since the whole economy of cities and towns is based on farmers, we are with the fraternity. The association has directed its district units to support the farmers,” he said. The Centre must resolve the issue at the earliest as the protests are affecting businesses on the whole, he added. Jaswinder Singh Rana, general secretary of the Punjab Arhtiya Association, said they are also asking the commission agents to visit Delhi before December 9 to stage dharnas with farmers against the laws. “These laws are not only anti-farmer but also against the arhatiyas. Our livelihood is completely dependent upon the farmers. If they lose their land, how will we survive? These laws will gradually make the minimum support price (MSP) redundant and thus decimate Punjab agriculture economy” he asked. Rakesh Gupta, an office-bearer of the Punjab Beopar Mandal, said they coordinated with sister associations and then decided to support the farmers. “The farmers are our backbone as our trade and commerce completely depends on the rural economy. Earlier, it was demonetisation and GST and now these farm laws. Our businesses are going to suffer a lot as nobody from rural areas will come to markets if the farmers are not paid assured amount for their produce,” he said.Patiala-based trader Abhishek Gupta said there has been a sharp drop in the number of customers from rural areas since the farmers’ agitation started. Satnam Singh Bheru, president of the Consortium of Indian Farmers’ Association, said they are receiving a huge response from the traders. “It is a do-and-die battle for the farmers. We are not going to relent and will take this fight to its logical conclusion,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bharat-bandh-all-trade-arhtiya-unions-in-punjab-announce-to-keep-commercial-establishments-shut/story-ZDmcHvIgSmnmfIFGJT6VtM.html
08-12-2020||City||Shaurya Chakra awardee killing: Delhi cops link 2 arrested shooters with ISI module, Punjab Police rule out terror angle||The Punjab Police on Monday ruled out any terror or radical angle in the high-profile killing of Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu even as their Delhi counterparts linked Sandhu’s two alleged shooters with a terror module allegedly operated by Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI after the duo’s arrest in the national capital. Sandhu, who was conferred with the bravery award for fighting terrorism in Punjab, was gunned down by two motorcycle-borne assailants at his house in Bhikhiwind village of Tarn Taran district on October 16. The alleged shooters — Gurjeet Singh, alias Bha and Sukhdeep Singh of Gurdaspur district — were arrested on Monday along with Kashmir residents Shabbir Ahmed, Ayub Pathan and Riyaz from Shakarpur area of the national capital, the Delhi Police claimed. Gurjeet and Sukhdeep killed Sandhu at the behest of notorious gangster Sukhmeet Singh, alias Sukh Bhikhariwal, who is also accused of killing an aide of a Hindu leader in Gurdaspur, the Punjab Police had said. The Delhi cops on Monday said Pakistan is using Punjab-based gangsters for targeted killings as many are inclined towards the Khalistan movement. A senior Punjab Police official investigating Sandhu’s killing, said, “We have thoroughly investigated the case. So far, we have not found any evidence to prove that it was a case of terrorism. We believe that there is no terror or radical angle to it.”“Our probe so far has not found any Kashmir link in the case. We don’t know about the theory of Delhi Police. We have checked all the activities of the pro-Khalistani elements but nothing was found. Gurjeet is a drug addict. It is also possible that he had gone to the Kashmiri men for getting drugs. But, everything will become clear once we get details from the Delhi police,” he added.The Tarn Taran police had last month claimed to have solved the killing with the arrest of 11 persons, including jailed gangsters Ravinder Singh, alias Gian and Sukhdeep Singh, alias Sukh. The police had said Gian and Sukh hatched the conspiracy to kill Sandhu from the Patiala and Ferozepur jails. Gian and Sukh are close associates of Bhikariwal, who had given them the task, according to the police. Gian is a prime conspirator of the Nabha jailbreak episode.Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale said they were establishing contact with the Delhi Police for the further investigation into Sandhu’s murder. Gurjeet and Sukhdeep will be brought on production warrant soon, he said.Another senior police official said they have traced Bhikariwal’s location to Dubai. Their teams were working to bring him back to India, he said. The Delhi cops claimed on Monday that the gangster has links with the ISI.All-India Anti-Terrorist Front chairman Maninderjeet Bitta, said, “Had the police not withdrawn Sandhu’s security cover, his life could have been saved. A case of murder should be registered against those officers who ordered to withdraw his security. The Delhi’s special cell has made it clear that it was an act of terrorism.” The hearing of the petition filed by Sandhu’s family in the Punjab and Haryana High court seeking CBI probe in the case is schedule on Tuesday. Sandhu’s wife Jagdish Kaur, also a Shaurya Chakra awardee, has also sought a security cover of paramilitary force for her family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shaurya-chakra-awardee-killing-delhi-cops-link-2-arrested-shooters-with-isi-module-punjab-police-rule-out-terror-angle/story-rGH2H1t2a31AuFw3dF89uL.html
08-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn rolls out ambitious parking policy to decongest city||After years of debate and multiple drafts, the UT administration has finally notified the parking policy with the aim to decongest Chandigarh, a city with the highest density of privately owned vehicles in the country. Retaining some of the controversial proposals, such as imposition of congestion chares and linking availability of parking space with vehicle registration, the policy’s key focus is on maximising utilisation of existing parking spaces through community parking.At the same time, it pushes for creation of new parking avenues by allowing multi-level parking lots, even those under ground.Formulated by the urban planning department, the policy doesn’t have any mandatory clauses, with the onus of its implementation being on various government agencies – particularly, the municipal corporation and the UT transport department. The policy recommends community parking in each sector by using neighbourhood commercial and institutional parking lots on rental basis. These parking lots are to be run by the registered Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs). It also proposes using the parking of educational institutions post their operational hours. The policy categorically states against converting green belts into parking areas, though it allows for construction beneath the parks. For creating more parking space in houses, it allows for two main gates in the front boundary. It also permits stilt parking on the ground floor of the house. In the group housing societies, commercial and institutional buildings it allows for three-level basement parking. CONGESTION CHARGES Even though earlier drafts of parking policy proposing congestion fee during peak hours came under severe criticism from different stakeholders, including councillors and business associations, the notified policy recommends that MC impose these charges to restrict vehicular volume. The policy, drafted on the lines of the Chandigarh Master Plan 2031, has also recommended that the Registering and Licensing Authority (RLA) register new vehicles only if te applicant has parking available for the new vehicle.SEGREGATED OFFICE TIMINGS, BUS SERVICE FOR STAFFThe guidelines propose mandatory plying of staff buses by various institutions, such as hospitals, public offices, industrial units and IT firms, to discourage use of personal vehicles.“Differential timings for schools/offices among Punjab/Haryana/UT, especially those of Chandigarh administration, will be adopted to reduce the demand for parking,” the policy states. Improving the public transport system with first- and last-point connectivity has been recommended for reducing use of private vehicles. ADOPTING TECHNOLOGYThe policy recommends introduction of mobile apps, which will provide citizens travel advice on non-motorised transport and public transport, which will be integrated with public bike sharing. Use of technology will also allow them to assess parking demand and availability of parking lots in a particular area.Smart parking systems, like parking fee payment through e-wallet and other digital modes, has also been proposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-rolls-out-ambitious-parking-policy-to-decongest-city/story-5yXlZs4nImFrruPAS07YEL.html
08-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Junior colleges await education department nod for online classes for new students||Following the second merit list for first-year junior college (FYJC) released on Saturday, colleges in the city are gearing up to start online classes for students in the coming weeks. As per admission norms set by the education department, colleges can start their classes after allotting 75% of their total seats. While most colleges reopen after meeting this requirement every year, this time they are awaiting a nod from the education department as the admission process has been delayed due to the pandemic and classes will take place only online. Admissions under the second round will complete on December 9. “We are prepared to start classes as and when the department gives us a green signal. This year, due to the Covid-19 situation and the resultant lockdown, there has already been a delay of about four months in the admissions. We hope that online classes begin soon,” said Satram Verhani, vice-principal of CHM College, Ulhasnagar. After the first two lists, most prominent colleges in the city have been able to fill more than 80% of their total seats. Principals said the earlier the department gives them the nod, the better they can plan their teaching plans for FYJC. “The department also needs to clarify as to what the academic calendar for these students should look like. It is not possible to squeeze in all the exams and the syllabus within the months that are left. Colleges so far have zero clarity in the issue,” said the principal of a suburban college. A senior official from the state education department said, “Colleges can start their classes once they complete the required number of admissions.” From November 2, the department began online classes for FYJC students after a delay in starting colleges owing to the interim stay on the Maratha quota in jobs and education. So far, the department’s YouTube channel has got over 1.42 lakh subscribers from across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-junior-colleges-await-education-department-nod-for-online-classes-for-new-students/story-pYzEINVj9AKrluT82rSF8H.html
08-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s public transport, bank services won’t be hit by Bharat Bandh; APMCs in state to be shut||Several farmers’ organisations, agricultural markets across Maharashtra and in Mumbai will be shut on Tuesday for the one-day Bharat Bandh. However, the daily life of people will not be disrupted as public transport — including autos and taxis — banking services will remain unaffected. Shops, malls and petrol pumps, too, will remain open.Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Vashi, Nashik, Solapur, Lasalgaon, Dhule, Sakri, and Pimpalner will stay shut. “All operations at the APMC in Vashi, including supplies of perishable commodities, will remain closed in support of the Bharat Bandh,” said, Rajendra Shelke, director, Navi Mumbai APMC.Sanjay Pansare, the chairperson of fruits and vegetables traders’ association, said, “Operations will be shut tomorrow. Most traders are also farmers so they understand the cause. The market committee association has asked all APMCs to remain shut. All the markets in Nashik district are going to extend support and remain shut. Pune APMC will remain operational because they had a bandh earlier.” Nashik APMC and Vashi APMC provide a substantial quantity of fruits and vegetables for retailers in Mumbai. However, Pansare said the stock and supply will not be affected in a one-day bandh. The Mathadi workers body led by Narendra Patil has extended support to the bandh.Meanwhile, autorickshaw and taxi unions in the city have not called for a bandh and they will continue to ply. Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking has readied its fleet with grills to protect the window and windscreen, as a precautionary measure, and will continue to provide services on Tuesday. Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) may suspend bus services on a few “sensitive” routes.Banking is also expected to remain unaffected as nationalised and private banks and ATM services will remain open. Devidas Tuljapurkar, general secretary of Maharashtra State Bank Employees Federation said, “We will stage protests but banking operations remain open on Tuesday.”The ruling coalition in Maharashtra —Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congres Party (NCP) and Congress — have backed the farmer’s call for bandh. However, Sena said that people can voluntarily participate in the bandh .“This is not a political bandh called to get some demands met, but supporting thousands of farmers at the Delhi border for the past 12 days is the duty of all citizens of the country. Therefore, Shiv Sena has appealed to all that people should voluntarily participate in this bandh,” said Sanjay Raut, Sena leader and chief spokespersonMeanwhile, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis took on NCP chief Sharad Pawar over the former union agricultural minister’s stance on the “monopoly” of APMC markets. Fadnavis said the Congress-NCP had earlier backed provisions similar to ones in the Centre’s farm laws and accused them of being “two-faced” by opposing the Acts now.Congress minister Ashok Chavan said the three agri-marketing laws by the Centre must be repealed as it will destroy the farmers and only benefit corporates. “The Congress has opposed this black law in the Parliament and outside. Rahul Gandhi has carried out a tractor yatra in Haryana. The bandh on December 8 is essential to wake up the Central government,” he said in a statement||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/banks-public-transport-will-function-in-city/story-nppuTVZKCRVmbb7sNXkpjK.html
08-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mercury fluctuates from season’s lowest 17.8° to 35.5°C within 9 hrs||The city witnessed cool and pleasant weather during early hours of Monday as Mumbai recorded its lowest minimum temperature so far this season. However, as the day progressed, warm conditions prevailed indicating a large variation in minimum and maximum temperature.The temperature variation has been continuing since last week with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) stating that it could affect the health of citizens.At 8.30am, Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded a minimum temperature of 17.8 degrees Celsius, a degree Celsius below normal, which was the lowest minimum temperature so far this season. At 5.30pm, the maximum temperature was recorded at 35.5 degrees Celsius, almost 3 degrees Celsius above normal. The lowest minimum temperature prior to Monday was recorded on Saturday at 18.4 degrees Celsius.Doctors said there are two kinds of diseases that can get exaggerated due to large temperature fluctuations. “The first is for people who have asthma or underlying asthma, as asthma flare-ups can happen. Second and most important is that immune system can get weakened when there is such temperature variation. The risks of catching viral infection also increases,” said Dr Sundeep Salvi, director, Chest Research Foundation, Pune.Similarly, Colaba weather observatory, representative of south Mumbai, recorded minimum temperature at 22.4 degrees Celsius, 1.1 degree Celsius above normal while the maximum was recorded at 34.8 degrees Celsius, 2.1 degree Celsius above normal.“The change in weather pattern through the day is allowing variation in temperature. During the day there is cool northeasterly winds, but through the day the pattern changes to low-level easterly winds and a clear sky that allows temperature to rise,” said an IMD official.KS Hosalikar, deputy director general (western region), IMD, said, “The large diurnal variation between maximum and minimum temperatures was predicted by us and has been continuing since last week. This temperature fluctuation could affect health.”Meanwhile, the air quality index (AQI) fell under moderate category at 149 for PM2.5 pollutant. Bandra-Kurla Complex (280), Malad (215), and Mazagaon (204) had poor air quality while Bhandup (63) and Worli (66) had satisfactory air. An AQI of 139 (moderate) has been predicted for Tuesday, the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/at-17-8-c-temperature-at-season-s-lowest-in-mumbai/story-3xsy1qablHe1YXfHEt8DUP.html
08-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees fewer than 5,000 Covid-19 cases for third straight day||Maharashtra on Monday recorded 3,075 Covid-19 cases, pushing the state’s tally to 1,855,341, as active cases further reduced to 75,767(4.08% of the total). The toll reached 47,774 as 40 fatalities were reported in the past 24 hours, officials said.Maharashtra has been reporting fewer than 5,000 Covid-19 cases for the past three consecutive days, which is being seen as a positive sign as the state was wary of a surge in infections after Diwali. However, officials believe that they cannot be complacent as the concern of a surge still persists. The state had already directed local authorities to be vigilant and prepared for a possible second wave outbreak.“The situation in the state has largely remained the same since last month, except for the last week of November, when there was a slight rise in fresh infections. In the first week of this month, the state is again getting comparatively fewer cases. Still there is no scope to be negligent as the danger has not passed yet. We will have to wait for another month to see if there is any change in the scenario before reaching any conclusion,” said a senior official from the state health department.A comparison of cases over two weeks showed that the state has recorded 33,695 cases in the first week of this month (December 1-7), whereas in the last week of November, the cases reported were 39,535.The average per day cases in the first week of both the months — November and December — are also close at 4,860 and 4,813, respectively. Meanwhile, Mumbai continued to record the highest daily caseload with 544 cases reported on Monday, taking the count to 286,597, of which active cases are 12,477. There were 11 deaths reported and the toll in the city has reached 10,907.Nagpur city contributed the second-highest infections in the daily caseload as it has recorded 219 cases, taking their tally to 89,398.Pune city recorded 186 cases, third-highest number of infections, pushing its count to 182,722State’s case fatality rate (CFR) has also started declining gradually. On Monday, it was recorded at 2.57%, but it is still at second position after Punjab in the country, where CFR was 3.15% (with 4,916 deaths) on Sunday, according to information shared by the state medical education departmentThe fewer cases can be attributed to fewer tests as 45,016 tests were conducted on Monday. The total number of tests conducted in the state till date are 113,18,721. The positivity rate for the day was recorded at 6.83%, against the overall positivity rate of the state that stood at 16.39%.The number of recovered patients reached 1,730,715 with 7,345 recoveries recorded in the past 24 hours.

08-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in wait-and-watch mode over Centre’s farm laws||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is yet to take a decision on the Centre’s farm laws, although the state’s three ruling parties – the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress – have supported the call for Bharat Bandh on Tuesday. The MVA government, two months ago, decided to form a cabinet sub-committee to deliberate clauses of the farm laws and look into concerns raised by farmer groups, but it is yet to decide whether to make changes in the existing laws or bring in a fresh legislation along the lines of Punjab. The cabinet sub-committee has held just one meeting so far. Congress minister Sunil Kedar, a member of the sub-committee, said they are working on draft legislation. “We held a meeting of the cabinet sub-committee recently. The marketing department is in the process of drafting a law, which will come before us for deliberations. We want to resolve the issue and don’t want to create another controversy and thus we are taking all aspects into consideration before going ahead,” said Kedar, who holds the state’s animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries portfolio.State cooperation and marketing minister Balasaheb Patil, from the NCP, too, said “they are working on the issue”. “We have taken views of all farmers’ bodies by bringing them for a meeting and are now working on it... There are two opinions in the government, one is to make changes in the existing laws and another is to bring a new law. The committee needs some time to submit its recommendations to the chief minister [Uddhav Thackeray],” Patil said.The three farm laws passed by the Centre have turned contentious as several farmers’ organisations and political parties, including state’s ruling allies — the Congress and NCP — have opposed their implementation. The MVA government, on September 30, stayed its notification (issued on August 10) for implementation of the laws. A 10-member cabinet sub-committee headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was formed on November 4 to deliberate upon the drawbacks and shortcomings of the laws, which were described as “anti-farmer”. The committee was supposed to look into the contentious issues and suggest changes in the existing laws, but little progress has happened.State government officials, who did not wish to be named, said it would be premature to take any decision now as the situation is unclear owing to the stalemate between the farmers’ organisations and Centre. “We don’t know what stand the Centre will take on the issue. It will make no sense to decide now as the Central Act will prevail if there is any contradiction between the state’s and Centre’s legislations,” said one of the officials.The same officials quoted above admit the laws, in their present form, are “a bit harmful for the agrarian community as they don’t protect farmers’ interests in fullest”, but also said they may not take a decision as there is uncertainty with the Centre itself indicating changes in the laws after agitation by farmers. “We don’t know if we will have to make changes in the existing laws or will have to bring in a fresh legislation. Earlier, we were working on the changes to be made in the current legislations, but there is also a demand to bring in new law,” said a senior official from the state marketing department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-government-in-wait-and-watch-mode-over-centre-s-farm-laws/story-3iSedGDxoC3XGdXmC4ZRDK.html
08-12-2020||Chandigarh||SAD not to mark 100th anniversary over farmers’ ongoing stir||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has cancelled a three-day programme proposed for the party’s 100the anniversary celebrations to ensure that the ongoing farmers’ agitation does not suffer.A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the party’s core committee held on Sunday night which was presided over by party president Sukhbir Singh Badal.SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said that a large number of party workers were participating in the ongoing protest near the Delhi border.“It was felt that the ongoing kisan agitation may suffer if the proposed three-day event was held at Anandpur Sahib. So the event was cancelled altogether and instead a commemorative Akhand Path will be held at Akal Takht from December 12 to 14. It will be attended by the top party leadership including the SAD president,” said Cheema.The core panel also gave its support to the Bharat Bandh call given by farmer organisations on December 8. It appealed to Punjabis as well as people across the country to show solidarity with the farmers on the occasion.The party’s top decision-making body also announced that the central government should repeal the three agricultural marketing laws and guarantee assured government procurement at minimum support price (MSP) as a statutory right.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-not-to-mark-100th-anniversary-over-farmers-ongoing-stir/story-Z5ZA1YqYJgjmtKDUwgoWNN.html

His partner Sahba Hussain said, “Navlakha is allowed to speak to me only once a week. On November 30, he told me that his spectacles were stolen and that he was under stress. My question is how can spectacles be stolen within the jail, particularly because he removes it only when he goes to sleep?” In a media release, Hussain said that on November 27, Navlakha’s spectacles were stolen and that. “It was an emergency, for he is close to being blind without his glasses. Yet, he was not permitted to call home for a replacement until three days later. But even that call proved futile. Navlakha is in acute distress, is unable to see things around him and his blood pressure has shot up consequently,” read the release. After Navlakha’s call, Hussain sent a new pair of spectacles to the jail on December 3. “I was tracking the package, and I received a message stating that it was returned. Previously, I had couriered a pair of slippers and cloths. That parcel too, was returned. Those were things which a person can manage without having, but spectacles are basic necessity. How can that be denied?” questioned Hussain. A senior prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said they had offered to arrange a new pair of spectacles for the activist. “When Navlakha informed us about the theft, we told him that he has to look after his belongings. We also asked him to give his prescription for the glasses so that we could arrange for a new pair. And we informed him to tell his family members to personally deliver the spectacles. We did not receive any response from him after that. Later, we received a courier which we do not accept because of security reasons,” said the officer. However, Hussain denied the claims. “We were never informed that a parcel will not be accepted,” said Hussain. Navlakha has been lodged in Taloja jail since his arrest on October 1, 2018. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has alleged that till August 2018, he was a member of the banned outfit Communist Party of India (Maoist).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhima-koregaon-case-accused-gautam-navlakha-denied-specs-sent-via-courier-say-kin-navi-mumbai-jail-authorities-cite-security-concerns/story-x2jtJnmNjw9AKv5EmwpScM.html

SCDRC’s request was prompted after the HC had directed the commission to start physical hearings from Wednesday. However, the state consumer affairs department informed the court that as there were fears of a second Covid-19 wave, it was of the opinion that the hybrid system of hearing consumer disputes through physical as well as videoconferencing mode should coexist, and sought time to work out the modalities to implement them. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Consumer Courts Advocates Association (CCAA), was informed that while the HC itself and various trial and magistrate courts had started physical hearings, the consumer courts were yet to start functioning after hearings were stopped owing to the lockdown. CCAA also complained that while virtual hearings were arranged in some courts, nothing on those lines had been done for consumer courts and their functioning had come to a complete standstill. In an earlier hearing on December 1, the court had sought a road map from the Maharashtra government and the registrar of the commission on resuming the functioning of consumer courts and had directed immediate reopening from December 9 of such courts that were in non-containment zones. In its response to the HC court’s directions, the commission, through its registrar, filed an affidavit in which it stated, “Judicial and non-judicial members of the state consumer dispute redressal commission (six) and presidents and members of district commissions (25) are senior citizens ….To start physical hearing before the state commission, its benches and district commissions, we, on December 3, have requested the state government for allocation of funds for making safety arrangements in the premises of commissions. Making safety measures require an additional five -day time from December 9 to start physical hearing of matters before SCDRC and its benches, except those which are in containment zones.” It also sought an 11-day extension from December 9 for starting physical hearing before district commissions. The state consumer protection department, in its affidavit filed through the joint secretary, also stated that the process for filling-up vacant posts in the consumer commissions was being initiated and it would take into consideration the concerns raised by the petitioner. The affidavit stated, “The Maharashtra government would like to introduce e-hearings alongside physical filing, keeping in mind the interest of consumers. There is a talk or perception about the second wave of the pandemic. Vaccination programme is going to take substantial time. Therefore, the state government feels that the hybrid system of both physical hearing and virtual or e-hearing should co-exist for which modalities will be worked out as early as possible.” After CCAA sought time to respond to the affidavits, the court posted further hearing to Friday, December 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-consumer-redressal-panel-seeks-five-day-extension-from-bombay-high-court-to-start-physical-hearings/story-ZGXot57ifwJ00XWqB3lA9I.html

Besides discussing the Centre-state relations, the two parties also decided to support the ongoing farmers’ protests together.After having severed ties with its decades-old ally, the BJP, in September this year as a mark of protest against the new farm laws, the SAD has got stuck in political wilderness and to come out of that it has decided to meet all small parties who have a strong hold in their respective states.According to Chandumajra, who is also the vice-president of the Akali party, leaders from all the key parties in the opposition are expected to meet in Delhi in the next couple of weeks to discuss the further action course. “All regional parties have shown enthusiasm and they want a political front to coordinate, for which the Akali Dal has come forward,” said Chandumajra.“We have already held meetings with a few regional parties and are meeting leaders from DMK, TRS, TMC with the common intention of opposing the Centre’s intervention in the states’ rights,” the senior leader added.“The Centre has been suppressing the rights of the states over subjects including law and order, agriculture and finances. Federalism has taken a severe hit under the BJP regime,” said party’s spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema, adding that the fiscal condition of states has been bad after the GST was implemented and now the farm laws framed by the Centre are a direct interference into farmers’ rights.Badal senior to intervene if solution not out by Dec 9 The SAD has also decided to bring party’s stalwart Parkash Singh Badal to a political centre-stage if the Union government fails to reach a solution for the protesting farmers by December 9. Their protests at the borders of the national capital entered its 12th day on Monday.A meeting between farm bodies and the Centre is fixed on Wednesday (December 9).As farmer union have raised their stocks and have demanded to scrap off all three laws, the Centre has offered amendments. “We have decided to bring all regional parties on board for a joint meeting to be chaired by Badal Saab (Parkash Singh Badal) in case the deadlock between farmers and the Centre is not resolved. We will discuss farmers’ issues and other matters with these parties so as to find a way and take the matter forward. This will mount pressure on the Centre,” said Bhundar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/eyeing-new-political-front-sad-starts-touching-base-with-regional-parties/story-xLu7GaDPCK8yfEyrMhNMCI.html

The Mumbai Police has acknowledged the security requirement for which the road and footpath are required to be barricaded.According to BMC’s proposal for waiver that is set to be tabled in the upcoming standing committee on Wednesday, Hotel Taj Mahal Palace has occupied around 800 square metres (sqm) of public road and over 1,100 sqm of footpath for which over ₹10.18 crore is payable.Of the ₹10.18 crore, BMC has proposed to waive around ₹8.85 crore for occupation of footpath in complete as requested by Hotel Taj Mahal Palace citing that the exercise was being undertaken for security reasons and not for commercial purposes. For the remaining ₹1.33 crore, BMC has proposed to give 50% waiver to Taj Mahal Palace.But the Congress, which is in the Opposition, opposed the proposal. Congress corporator and Opposition leader Ravi Raja said, “BMC does not give any relief to the common man, and it should not give waiver to the five-star hotel. In the past, BMC denied giving concession or waiver to Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) for using bollards and blocking access on advice of security agencies. I will oppose it.”HT sent an email and tried calling the hotel’s spokesperson for a comment, but there was no response till the time of going to print.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-proposes-to-waive-9-crore-payable-by-hotel-taj-mahal-palace/story-9oOOZqRYLZSJiC4YkS8GxO.html

The suggestions were made while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) which had complained that while schools for other children had started classes through the online mode, the differently-abled students were left in the lurch owing to various reasons and are denied their right to education. The petition had sought directions to the state and Centre to make arrangements for providing virtual education to differently-abled students. On Monday when the PIL came up for hearing before the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, advocate Uday Warunjikar for the petitioner NGO Anamprem informed the bench that owing to problems such as non-availability of staff or mobile phones, students with disabilities are unable to pursue their education amid the pandemic. Warunjikar had suggested that the local television and radio channels owned by the government could be used to impart education to such students. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that the government could assign a slot of one or two hours on Doordarshan and telecast special educational programmes. The bench also said that it was the government’s duty to provide online education for differently-abled students. The court then directed the petitioner to give suggestions to the government to address the issue and asked the government to study them and consider what measures could be undertaken to provide special education. The state government has also been directed to submit its report by January 18. In the earlier hearings, the central government, which was asked to respond to the concerns raised in the NGO’s petition, had submitted that it was in the process of creating a system to provide education to differently-abled students during the pandemic, but it would take some time to ready the format.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/explore-dd-as-means-to-teach-students-with-disabilities-amid-covid-19-pandemic-bombay-hc-to-maharashtra-govt/story-bReNhKE41PSHPmpmU6IL7N.html
08-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal reviews arrangements at Singhu, calls himself sewadar||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited Singhu border on Monday where he briefly interacted with some of the protesting farmers and also inspected the arrangements made by the city administration.Even though Kejriwal did not visit the main protest site, he was surrounded by scores of agitating farmers as he reached Guru Teg Bahadur Memorial near Singhu border (Delhi-Haryana border).“I have not come here as a chief minister. I have come here as a sewadar (one who does service). We support all demands of the farmers. Their issue and demands are valid. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and I have stood in support of the farmers right from the start,” Kejriwal told reporters during his visit.The chief minister reiterated that the Central government was “very upset” with him for not allowing the Delhi Police to convert nine stadiums in the city into jails to detain the protesting farmers. He said that he was pressured into giving the approval, but he still did not.Also Read: AAP and Congress to hold protests in support of Bharat Bandh“Our MLA Jarnail Singh spent the whole night here yesterday in support of the farmers. Our party, MLAs and leaders have been serving farmers as sewadars ever since. Farmers are in trouble today, we should stand with them. AAP supports December 8 Bharat Bandh. Our party workers will participate in it across the nation,” he said.Talking about the arrangements made by the Delhi government, Kejriwal, who is the national convener of AAP, said at least 300 mobile toilets and 350 water tankers have been deployed at Singhu border.“I surveyed the arrangements here. The toilets are clean. But, water is not reaching all points so a motor and a pipeline will be placed soon. During my interaction with the farmers, they said they are satisfied with the arrangements. We will be in touch with them,” the chief minister said before leaving.Delhi govt on MSPDelhi agriculture minister Gopal Rai on Monday attended a meeting with ministers of state for agriculture Purushottam Rupala and Kailash Choudhary along with his counterparts from Punjab and Haryana to discuss ways to increase the income of farmers. “On behalf of the Delhi government, I presented three important suggestions in this meeting for the farmers. Firstly, the central government should implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission on the minimum support price (MSP). The current MSP causes loss for the farmers. At some states, the MSP is Rs 1,800 but the farmers are forced to sell their crops in Rs 800, 900 or 1,000,” Rai said, addressing a press conference after the meeting. Also Read: Farmers say they will block roads, seek supportThe protests by farmers against the farm laws along Delhi’s borders have entered the 12th day and the minister urged the Centre to arrive at a decision favourable to the farmers in a day or two. “Thirdly, I also presented the outcomes of the bio decomposer technique of Pusa Institute to avoid stubble burning. I have requested the central government to look into this matter very carefully and to implement this across the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cm-reviews-arrangements-at-singhu-calls-himself-sewadar/story-tNaK17fkkkiQ3chIaDNORI.html
08-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai sees rise in Covid-19 antibodies: Survey||Ten months after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the city, the number of people with presence of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, has risen to 46.8% in November from 27.9% in June, according to data from a Mumbai-based private laboratory, Suburban Diagnostics. The laboratory conducted blood tests on 37,646 people over six months to detect the presence of Immunoglobulins-G (IgM) antibodies that are produced by the body’s immune system on being exposed to a foreign particle such as a virus. It helps identify individuals who were previously infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus and have recovered. Of the 37,646 blood samples tested since June, 14,080 were found to have antibodies. Most individuals who undertook the tests at the laboratory comprised office-goers, business persons, hotel staffers, and health workers, including doctors. The cumulative antibody positivity rate was 37.40%. From 27.9% in June (190 total blood tests), the antibody positivity rate dropped to 21.8% (6,204) in July, but gradually increased to 30.6% (6,234), 36.7% (10,535) and 48% (9,238) in August, September and October, respectively. In November, the Covid-19 antibody positivity rate stood at 46.8% (5,245 blood tests). “A total of 63% of those who underwent the antibody tests were from working groups, including doctors,” said Dr Anupa Dixit, laboratory director, Suburban Diagnostics. A large number of recovered symptomatic patients also opted for the test to donate their blood plasma for treatment of other Covid-19 patients, said the laboratory. Medical experts, however, said the city is still far from attaining herd immunity – when a sufficient percentage of a population develops immunity against an infection either through vaccination or previous infections. “It is a good sign if antibodies are increasing among people, but we need more research to say that we are reaching herd immunity,” said Dr Sujata Baveja, head of microbiology at the Lokmanya Tilak General or Sion hospital. To check the presence of antibodies to fight Covid-19 infection, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in collaboration with NITI-Aayog and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) had conducted two serological surveys in June and August. Blood samples were collected from residents of slum and non-slum areas through random selection. As per the second report, 45% slum and 18% non-slum residents surveyed across three wards in the city were exposed to Sars-CoV-2 and had recovered due to the presence of antibodies. Suburban Diagnostics has only analysed blood samples collected from individuals who approached them to undergo antibody testing. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), BMC, said, “I won’t be able to comment on the findings of the private laboratory. But in fact, in our sero survey, we have seen a similar trend where the presence of antibodies among the general population is increasing gradually. The presence of antibodies is more in slums due to the higher population density.” 90% had antibodies even after six months As per the laboratory’s research on 83 patients with a known history of Covid-19, the maximum antibodies are produced between 60 and 90 days of getting exposed to the virus. Of the 83 patients, 64% (53 patients) were symptomatic. A subsequent follow-up showed that 88% recorded a rise in antibody percentage at 60-90 days, while 4% showed a dip and 8% were still non-reactive. At 90-120 days, 55% showed rising antibody values, 35% a dip in these values, while 2% showed a plateau in antibody values and 8% were still non-reactive. Even after 120-150 days of getting exposed to the virus, 92% had antibodies, while 8% were still non-reactive. “No patient got re-infected with the virus during the follow-up period. However, a longer study will be required for any firm conclusion,” said Dr Amar Dasgupta, director, medical services, Suburban Diagnostics. Covid positivity rate dipsThe positivity rate of the tests conducted by the civic body has dropped from 16% in September to 14.5% in December. Similarly, private labs are also witnessing a plunge in positivity rate. Data shared by Suburban Diagnostics shows that the lab in May witnessed a 29.3% positivity rate which dropped to 11.3% in November. “It is a sign of recovery that the cumulative positivity rate among people is decreasing, while the presence of antibodies against the virus is increasing. However, this percentage differs area-wise,” said Sushant Kinra, chief operating officer (COO) of the lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-rise-in-covid-19-antibodies-survey/story-b2nAjx5GjIZMpVFTGG2TlN.html

An illicit relationship is a perfect mix for disaster. Most times, it turns the family system into hell”, a Delhi court has said while convicting a woman and her brother-in-law for entering into a conspiracy and thereby murdering her own husband in order to save their illicit relationship in 2015 in Brahmapuri.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav convicted Shanti Sharma and her brother-in-law Satender Sharma under sections 302 (murder), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).According to the police, Dilip Sharma was found dead in his house on May 25, 2015 at Brahmpuri. The police had found him near the staircase, and had noticed injury marks and blood stains on his face and neck. The case has been filed on a complaint by Dilip’s brother and both the convicts had been arrested during the course of the investigation.The court has put up the matter for arguments on sentencing for December 10.“I am of the considered opinion that the deceased (Dilip) was found dead within the secured precincts of his house, which raises an irresistible inference that the deceased was murdered by the accused persons in a pre-planned conspiracy,” the judge said in his order passed on December 2.Further, during the course of the investigation, it came to the fore that his wife Shanti had an illicit relationship with her brother-in-law (husband of a sister), Satender, who at the relevant time was putting up at the first floor of the house belonging to the deceased.Satender was arrested on May 27, 2015 and made a disclosure that Shanti had killed her husband. Accordingly, she was arrested and a charge sheeted was filed for offences of murder, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and common intention.The court, while convicting the duo, said that the most important circumstance which has the capacity to nail the issue in the matter was that the deceased was found dead within the precincts of his secured house.“Admittedly the deceased was found dead within the secured boundary walls of his house. There was no evidence of theft or house-breaking in the said house, even no such defence has been pleaded by the accused persons. The suicide theory is also ruled out on account of the nature of injury marks found on the dead body of deceased...,” the court said.It further said that the testimony of the deceased’s sister-in-law Rekha Sharma made it clear that “illicit relations” existed between both the convicts.“It is clearly evident from the record that just prior to his unnatural, untimely and unexpected death, the deceased had been residing within the secured boundary walls of his house (at the ground floor) along with his wife (Shanti) and their three children.“...it is quite clear that Satender had been carrying out his business of manufacturing ‘plastic dibbi’ from the first floor residence of the deceased,” the court said.During the trial, Shanti and Satender claimed they had been falsely implicated in the matter and were innocent. They had claimed that Dilip had died by slipping and falling on the staircase of the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illicit-relationship-destroys-whole-family-says-delhi-court-while-sentencing-wife-brother-in-law-for-killing-husband/story-F3lykYk3T0Z1sBFY1LWupJ.html

This decision surpasses the varsity’s previous decision asking colleges to conduct all exams by December 2020. The decision comes days after the Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU) approached MU’s vice-chancellor seeking postponement of first-year degree college exams. Teachers highlighted that due to delay in admissions to first-year courses, most colleges have not managed to teach the mandatory 90 days before exams, making it impossible to hold exams in December. As per MU’s November 18 circular, affiliated colleges are supposed to hold online exams for the current batches of undergraduate courses by December while postgraduate exams should be conducted in January next year. “This is to inform all affiliated colleges to ensure that exams for the first-year batch of 2020-21 (winter session) should be completed by January 9, 2021,” states the MU circular dated December 7.Teacher groups, however, are not happy with this move by the varsity. BUCTU has decided to approach the vice-chancellor once again based on the latest circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/complete-first-year-exams-by-january-9-2021-university-of-mumbai-to-colleges/story-Jgzi6hvnhemi1POvkhMy2K.html

This is not a symbolic protest and we plan to stay here until the CM addresses our concerns. It is a serious matter that the civic bodies are in extreme financial crunch while the Delhi government, which has to release funds totalling ₹13,000 crore to the three corporations (as approved under the state finance commission) is not willing to give us our due,” said Prakash. South Corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh said, “If the government releases our due funds, it will help us pay off the employees and improve our work efficiency.”Meanwhile, to counter the BJP’s protest, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councilors also sat outside the CM’s house during the day. The AAP councilors sat on dharna raising counter slogans till late evening.The AAP, in a statement, said that it is “unfortunate” that the home ministry is using BJP to pressure Delhi Police to target the elected government in Delhi.“It is unfortunate that the MHA is initiating a rebellion in Delhi through the medium of Delhi Police. The MLAs who came to meet Delhi CM during the day were beaten up and sent away, as the BJP protest was going on. All the CM’s appointments were cancelled, nobody was allowed to meet him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mayors-sit-on-dharna-outside-delhi-cm-s-house/story-B4q0oyDfiy2Y2LfWIac8yN.html
08-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MVA considers census, new schemes for OBC||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is considering sops for Other Backward Classes (OBC) community, which is politically influential after Marathas in Maharashtra. Separate census, funds for development and new welfare schemes for the community are some of the sops under consideration.The move comes at a time when Maratha community outfits are angry with the MVA government, holding it responsible for the stay on the Maratha reservation ordered by the Supreme Court. A cabinet sub-committee on OBC community headed by state minister Chhagan Bhujbal submitted its report to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday seeking a separate census for OBC community. The committee also sought more funds for its institutions, OBC development corporation, as well as additional schemes for the community. So far, the government has not taken a decision on it, but is considering the demands.The community has been demanding a separate census for some time now. Community leaders said it is to ascertain their population and what they get in “return”.The demand for a separate census is viewed as a counter to the demand by Maratha outfits to provide quota within the OBC category, which sparked a clash between the two communities. However, Congress minister Vijay Wadettiwar, who was present in the meeting, denied it saying the demand for the separate census is an old one.“There is no connection between the demand for a separate census for OBC and Maratha reservation. What they [some Maratha outfit] said about getting reservation from OBC is not connected to this demand. We need to know what the population is and what benefits they are getting as per their size. [Chhatrapati] Sambhaji Raje himself has declared that the community does not seek share from OBC quota, then that debate ends. There is no need to create a divide between the two communities,” Wadettiwar told TV channels.Elaborating on the demand, the minister said. “When the reservation was given to OBC community in the Constitution, it was on the basis that the OBC population is 54%. But there were several claims made by other communities and OBCs over the population. Therefore, there is a need for a separate counting of the OBC community.”Sachin Rajurkar, convenor of the OBC Kriti Samiti, welcomed the committee’s recommendation and said, “We are happy that the committee has recommended census for the community. If we consider the Mandal Commission report, OBC constituted 52% of the population, which will now increase to 60% easily. There is a need to quantify our strength and what [benefits] are we getting”.The committee has also sought ₹150 crore funds for Mahajyoti training institute, ₹200 crore for OBC development corporation, and ₹400 crore for various schemes for the community. It also sought an increase in the yearly foreign scholarship given to students from 10 to 50. Additionally, the committee has also sought ₹100 crore for housing projects for the community.Wadettiwar confirmed the demands. “There was a demand for funds for Mahajyoti which is a huge institution. Bara Balutedar community should be given more funds and a separate company for an institute under OBC development corporation should be created for them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mva-considers-census-new-schemes-for-obc/story-1yvtIPIua885vPxINr9maJ.html

08-12-2020||Delhi||SDMC proposes to hike property tax, but councillors oppose move||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Monday proposed to hike property tax while planning to change the categories as per which the levy is charged. Presenting the budget proposals for 2021-22, SDMC additional commissioner Ramesh Verma said property tax rates have not been raised in the last 10 years. “Residential, commercial and business plots of up to 150 square metres are divided into three categories in the city. Since, there had been no hike in property tax in the last 10 years, I propose that in the financial year 2021-22, the number of categories should be reduced to two and 14% tax shall be levied on residential properties of A&B category and 12% on those falling in C-H category,” Verma said, who tabled the proposals on behalf of SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti -- currently recovering from Covid-19. In the national capital, properties are divided into three categories – A&B, which attracts 12% tax; C,D,E, which attracts 11% tax, and F,G, H, which attracts 7% tax.According to new tax proposal, these properties will be divided into two categories A & B and C to H. Residents of A & B category colonies will have to pay annual tax of 14% instead of 12% and those residing in areas falling under C-H category will be paying 12% tax instead of 11% and 7%. A senior SDMC official said that A&B category colonies include upscale neighbourhoods such as Vasant Kunj, Safdarjung Enclave, Defence Colony while C-H category include middle class neighbourhoods such as Bhogal, Amar Colony, Gautam Nagar etc and unauthorised colonies such as Madanpur Khadar, Sangam Vihar, Badarpur among others.However, the budget proposals are subject to approval from the House, which had previously shot down suggestions to introduce new taxes and hikes.Civic officials said the executive wing of the civic body had been proposing hike in property tax for last three to four years but these proposals were declined by the deliberative wing (elected representatives) of the corporation.“Property tax revision is necessary to make the the civic body financially secure, so such moves are required. Under these proposals, those living in posh colonies (A&B category) will have to pay 2% more property tax while the property tax increment for middle class neighbourhoods will be only 1%.Those living in F,G,H category colonies majority of which are unauthorised colonies will have to pay 5% extra tax. “However, the SDMC hardly gets any property tax from those residing in unauthorised colonies,” a senior SDMC official said.The SDMC also proposed to levy 1% education cess on annual property tax and also proposed to hike transfer duty tax by 1% to meet the revenue targets. The proposal of increasing transfer duty by 1% was already passed by the civic body in August this year and is now awaiting Delhi government nod.The budget proposals also demanded to increase tax on commercial properties such as guest houses, lodges, inns, paying guest houses and restaurants without bar to 20% from 15%.However, the impact of coronavirus pandemic was visible on the budget proposals as no new project was announced by the SDMC in its budget.SDMC officials said that the revenue collection target for the SDMC from property tax is Rs 1400 crore for 2021-22 financial year. “Due to coronavirus pandemic our property tax collection has gone down this year. We could collect only Rs 670 crore from property tax against our revised target of Rs 1,240 crore. To increase our revenue we must cut our rebates and increase property tax,” the official said.The budget proposals also recommended to cut down rebate on one-time payment of property tax before June 30 every year to 10% from existing 15%. The proposal also recommended to do away with the 20% rebate given to group housing societies on timely submission of taxes.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules the three civic bodies in the city, said it would ensure that the public do not suffer due to the budget proposals.Anamika Mithilesh, SDMC mayor, said these are the budget proposals presented by the commissioner and it is not final. “These proposals will now be discussed in the standing committee and the House meetings of the SDMC. We will amend these proposals regarding tax hike so that there is no burden on the public. We will ensure that the people do not suffer,” she said.The Opposition, however, objected to the proposals to increase the levy amid the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.Prem Kumar, leader of opposition in SDMC, said that it was an “anti-people” budget and that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was against the move. “Instead of increasing their revenue targets from parking and advertisement heads, the civic body is planning to tax the people more. We will not let this pass in the House,” Kumar said.Abhishek Dutt, leader of the Congress in the SDMC, said, “Due to political issues between the BJP and the AAP, funds which are earmarked for the MCD are not being released properly. This is resulting in additional tax burden on the public. There should be no hike in property tax especially amid such a global pandemic. We will strongly oppose this move in the House.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sdmc-proposes-to-hike-property-tax-but-councillors-oppose-move/story-3WqVXvUKNn2EHsBwjlDW8K.html
08-12-2020||Delhi||Traders, shopkeepers at protest sites worried over mounting losses, say govt should intervene to resolve impasse||As thousands of farmers continued to camp on Delhi’s borders demanding withdrawal of the Centre’s new farm laws, several traders and shopkeepers around the protest sites expressed concern over the mounting losses and said the government should intervene to resolve the impasse at the earliest.Rampal, a motor mechanic whose workshop is located right next to the protest site at the Singhu border, said he has been working on machines he got before the protests began and his new customers are only the farmers. “I have decided not to take any money from them. In fact, I leave my shop open through the night and go home so that if any farmer needs to use the tools, they don’t have to return disappointed,” he said.Ajeet, who sells snacks and soft drinks at the Singhu border, said his daily business has shrunk to Rs 2,000-3,000 from Rs 10-15,000. “If this continues for long, how will we pay the rent this month? The farmers are protesting for their cause and we should not bear the brunt. The government should immediately break this deadlock,” he said.Most businesses around Rampal’s workshop and Ajeet’s shop have remained closed for the last six days. These include banks, alcohol shops, offices of property dealers, restaurants and outlets that do not cater to the farmers.Shyam Singh, the chief caretaker of Cost To Cost -- an outlet selling branded clothes and electronic goods -- said that most employees have been sent on leave. The outlet has placed a large hoarding outside its gates to ensure outsiders do not get a view of the premises. “We live in the constant fear of the protests turning violent, but fortunately nothing has happened after the first day,” he said. Among businesses that have remained open are primarily small eateries and those catering to farmers’ needs.The scene is quite similar at the Tikri border. There are six fuel stations around the protest site and though they have remained open, there is hardly any sales. Neeraj Verma, an employee at a petrol pump in Tikri, said the only customers he receives are farmers themselves or local motorcyclists managing to find their way to the station.A Nexa outlet -- a showroom of Maruti Suzuki -- has remained closed since day one of the protests. “Cars have been promised to customers but they are not able to take delivery,” said Bhupender Negi, a cashier at the store. Along the Tikri protest site is the busy Hira Market. Shops on one row are in Delhi and those on the opposite row are in Haryana. Businesses on both sides have suffered. Tarun Gupta, who is into wholesale trade of grocery items, said he had just begun recovering from the losses incurred during the lockdown when his business was jolted again. “We hear that farmers intend to stay here for months. We’ll be destroyed. My business is just 10% of what it was before the protests,” said Gupta. Right across his shop, however, a garments store is getting customers -- mostly farmers. “Earlier we would get customers travelling on the main highway. Now, only those on motorcycles or on foot are able to access our shop. People are worried about venturing into this market,” said Rahul Mishra, an employee at a garment store.“When we fell short of essential items, these shopkeepers stood for us. We wished our protest didn’t harm these businesses, but the government won’t agree to our demands otherwise,” said Hardeep Singh, a farmer. He said he would take back some clothes home as “mementoes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/traders-shopkeepers-at-protest-sites-worried-over-mounting-losses-say-govt-should-intervene-to-resolve-impasse/story-fiwiJB2eBx0uVPPruMaIzK.html
08-12-2020||Delhi||Govt must ‘scrupulously follow’ CPCB guidelines for handling and disposal of Covid-19 waste: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Monday asked the government to “scrupulously follow” the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for the handling and disposal of waste generated during diagnosis and treatment of Covid-19 patients.A bench comprising chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan said that it expects the Delhi government to follow rules while hearing a plea by a lawyer alleging the improper disposal of used swabs from rapid antigen tests for Covid-19 at the office of the southeast Delhi district magistrate at Lajpat Nagar.It disposed of the plea by Pankaj Mehta, who had alleged that used swabs were being “thrown out in public” and “tests were being carried out over a pile of used swabs for Covid-19” at the district magistrate’s office.“Upon complaining about the risk of widespread infection and the irregularity behind disposing of the swabs in this manner, the doctor concerned at the counter said the swabs are of negative patients and thus it is safe to stand over them and get yourself tested,” the plea read.During the last hearing, the court had sought to know from the Delhi government as to what norms were in place for disposal of the waste. On Monday, advocate Sanjoy Ghose, the additional standing counsel of the government, told the court that there are several protocols in place for the handling and disposal of Covid-19 test kits and swabs and action would be taken against those not following the same.He also placed on record the “Guidelines for Handling, Treatment, and Disposal of Waste Generated during Treatment/Diagnosis/Quarantine of Covid-19 Patients” issued by the CPCB in July.Following this, the court said, “We expect the respondents (Delhi government) that the guidelines and protocols shall be scrupulously followed by them”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-must-scrupulously-follow-cpcb-guidelines-for-handling-and-disposal-of-covid-19-waste-delhi-hc/story-pVBnF2umrYHO4IB3de0FaN.html
08-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Tailor killed by adopted daughter’s friend for refusing to consent to their wedding||A 50-year-old tailor was stabbed to death with multiple kitchen knives and his head smashed with a pressure cooker for refusing to let his adopted daughter get married to her friend because of the difference in their castes, the Delhi Police said on Monday. The murder took place in northeast Delhi’s Sonia Vihar on Saturday morning and the alleged killer—the friend of the victim’s adopted daughter—was arrested from north Delhi on Sunday. The victim, Vijender Singh, lived with his wife and a 24-year-old woman he had adopted from his brother when she was a child.“Sometime last year, the daughter entered into a relationship with a local man, Suraj Kumar,” said Ved Prakash Surya, deputy commissioner of police (north-east). Kumar worked in the housekeeping department of the Delhi Metro at Palam Metro station, the DCP said. “The couple wanted to get married, but her adoptive parents were strongly against it, due to the difference in caste,” the officer said. Since the daughter insisted on getting married to Kumar, her adoptive parents sent her away to live with her biological parents in Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. “Kumar’s parents then visited the woman’s biological parents for their consent to the wedding, but Singh intervened and objected again,” the DCP said. The police said this angered Kumar and he held Singh responsible, the officer said. “For several days, he planned different ways to kill Singh, but failed to execute them,” said the officer. On the morning of November 28, while heading to office, he noticed Singh’s wife walking to a temple near her house. “For the next few days, he loitered around to observe her schedule. He got to know that she visited the temple every Saturday morning. He held a grudge only against Singh and not his wife, so he decided to strike when she wasn’t at home. He though that would also ensure he wasn’t identified as the killer,” said the DCP.On November 5, he reached the house around 8.30am and waited for Singh’s wife to leave for the temple. “As soon as she was gone, he entered Singh’s house and locked the door. He knew he had 20 minutes to carry out his plan,” said the DCP. Inside, Kumar allegedly first thrashed Singh with his bare fists. Then, he allegedly picked up three knives from the kitchen and stabbed Singh repeatedly. “Finally, he picked up a pressure cooker and smashed Singh’s head repeatedly with it,” said the DCP.By the end, Kumar’s clothes were soaked in the victim’s blood. “He removed his clothes, wore Singh’s fresh clothes and started to leave the crime scene,” said the DCP. But as he emerged from the house, Singh’s wife arrived and he got into a brief confrontation with her, but managed to escape.The personnel who registered a case at Khajuri Khas police station arrested Kumar from Civil Lines on Sunday. They said they have seized three kitchen knives, a wooden log and a pressure cooker which were allegedly used in the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-tailor-killed-by-adopted-daughter-s-friend-for-refusing-to-consent-to-their-wedding/story-nEh9eI6QOdSD1xdsyn3EyI.html

Santosh Meena, the deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka), said that the carcasses of a few cows were discovered in a drain by local residents after which the police were alerted. “We are in the process of registering an FIR and have suspended two constables for negligence,” said the DCP. The officer said that they are awaiting doctors’ report to conclude whether these was fresh or old carcasses. He said it was difficult to say at this stage how many cows had been killed. “There could be five or even ten carcasse, we can’t say right now. But it could possibly be a case of slaughter,” said Meena. The discovery also drew Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma, the member of Parliament from West Delhi constituency, to the spot. “The carcasses were found at an isolated stretch near a drain and it appears the slaughtering had been going on for a while. On Monday, a cow was found with its neck slit, which aroused the suspicion of the local residents. They searched the spot to find the carcasses of several cows,” said Verma. He said that the police are checking CCTV camera footage for clues about the suspects and have promised quick arrests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-two-cops-suspended-after-carcasses-of-cows-found-in-dwarka-drain/story-NPTyziRzg3y3K7cuWOWhdN.html
08-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board urges Haryana, UP to curb Yamuna pollution||A day after the country’s apex pollution watchdog raised concerns over frothing in the Yamuna river, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha on Monday urged neighbouring Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Haryana to take steps to ensure untreated sewage is not discharged into the drains, curbing pollution in the river. “While it appears that the governments of UP and Haryana are not bothered about releasing untreated wastewater into Yamuna, I’d like to put on record that the DJB has been constantly working to upgrade and augment the capacity of its sewage treatment plants (STPs) so that untreated effluents are not released into the Yamuna,” said Chadha in a statement.He added that the Okhla Barrage is under the jurisdiction of the UP irrigation department, and because of its “lackadaisical attitude, water hyacinths grow in abundance. When these hyacinths decompose, they release surfactants like phosphates. When this water falls into Kalindi Kunj from a height, it produces foam, which gradually accumulates and floats on the surface of the water,” said Chadha.Apart from this, he said, the paper and sugar industries operating in Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli and Saharanpur in UP also release untreated wastewater containing surfactants, which is then released into Yamuna through the Hindon Canal at Okhla Barrage. This causes foam to form and accumulate in the Yamuna.He further said that UP’s untreated waste water reaches Delhi through the Shahdara drain while that of Haryana’s is discharged into the Najafgarh drain. “Both the drains meet the Yamuna via the Okhla Barrage thereby polluting it. We have been working on treating sewage through state-of-the-art sewage treatment plants (STPs) as well as by upgrading the existing plants. However, it’s not Delhi’s problem alone, and we will need cooperation from UP and Haryana to keep the Yamuna clean.”Both UP and Haryana together release around 150 MGD (million gallons per day) of untreated wastewater into Yamuna, according to government data. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), on Sunday, had raised concerns on the pollution in the river and issued directions to the DJB to submit a timebound action plan to ensure compliance of norms by STPs and that no untreated sewage is discharged into these drains. Similar directions were also issued to the state pollution control boards of Haryana and UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-jal-board-urges-haryana-up-to-curb-yamuna-pollution/story-FVoUmBZdcLRUDSCv6Ej35O.html

The primary objective of these arrangements, he said, is to maintain public peace and order, prevent any kind of violence, maintain supply of essential items and to facilitate the functioning of traffic and public transport system. The instructions in force due to Covid-19 pandemic have also been kept in mind, he added. The ADGP said according to reports, it is expected that agitating groups may sit on dharna on various roads and highways within Haryana and block them for some time. There may also be disruptions on various toll plazas in the state. The main national highways Delhi-Ambala (NH-44), Delhi-Hisar (NH-9), Delhi-Palwal (NH-19) and Delhi to Rewari (NH-48) may also see some traffic disruptions for a short time. The peak time of impact is expected to be between 12:00pm to 3:00pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-protest-political-parties-trade-transport-unions-in-haryana-support-bharat-bandh-call/story-v3ZIMDpmHo34BSWJHaFy6O.html

The scientists are Dr Ajit Varma (ranked 916 in plant biology research stream), and Dr Dattatray Late, Dr Ajay Gupta, and Dr DK Awasthi, who have been ranked 1,135, 4,000 and 1,105, respectively, for their work in applied physics. Varma said that his area of research is Soil Sustainability. “I have discovered a novel biofertiliser which is named Serendipita indica. This web of fungi can shape the future of forest and agriculture and promote soil health,” he said.Varma further said that the fungus was discovered from desert soil of Rajasthan and works for crop improvement from Rajasthan to Laddakh. “Working in a temperature range of -30 degrees to 50 degrees, it benefits mostly crops, cereals, legumes and vegetables,” he said.After assessing scientists from across the world for their contributions in terms of citations and other indicators, the PLOS biology journal, a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal, ranked the scientists and published their research papers. Congratulating the scientists, Ashok K Chauhan, the president of the Amity education group, said their success is the result of their hard work, dedication and commitment. “These scientists worked to the cause of science, which has brought appreciation not only for them, but also to the university and the country,” he said. Echoing similar views, W Selvamurthy, the president of Amity Science Technology and Innovation Foundation, said this prestigious recognition is one of the great achievements in the lives of these scientists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/four-amity-university-faculty-members-get-place-in-top-2-of-global-research/story-Hn5dDLUseUXx5bSOmTFJCO.html
08-12-2020||Noida||Tally of symptomatic Covid-19 patients in Noida goes down over two weeks||NOIDA: If the ratio of coronavirus (Covid-19) disease patients on home isolation versus those in medical facilities is any indication, the number of critically symptomatic patients in Gautam Budh Nagar district has gone down significantly in the last two weeks.Out of 990 active cases in the district as of Monday, 513 asymptomatic patients are in home isolation and the remaining 477 patients are being treated in different Covid-dedicated facilities in the district. This is lower than two weeks ago, on November 23, when there were 740 patients in Covid facilities in the districts, while 562 asymptomatic patients in home isolation, out of a total of 1,302 active cases in the district, as per the records of state bulletin and the district health department.District additional chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Lalit Kumar, who is also the in-charge of home isolation of Covid-19 patients in the district, said that so far 4,123 asymptomatic positive patients – who have been permitted for their treatment in home isolation – have been cured since July 25 this year – when the state government allowed for the home isolation facility. “While 51 patients were discharged, 64 patients were allowed home isolation on Monday. Till date, none of the home isolated patients have lost their lives due to Covid-19,” he said. Even the number of critical patients has been reduced at different Covid-19 facilities. Dr Renu Agarwal, the chief medical superintendent of the district Covid hospital in Sector 39, said that the number of ICU patients at the facility on Monday was half of what it was nearly two weeks ago. “Two weeks ago, the number of ICU patients in our hospital was 24, which has now gone down to 10. This clearly indicates that the severity of the virus is on a receding trend,” she said. Echoing similar views, Dr Ajit Kumar, the joint registrar of Sharda Medical College, said that the number of ICU patients in the hospital is now 20 from 60 two weeks ago. “It is no more a panic situation for us now compared to earlier times, when we were foxed to make adequate arrangements of beds in our ICUs,” he said. District magistrate Suhas LY said that keeping the number of cases close to the arch of 1,000 is the result of our ‘track, test and treat’ method. “Our health workers are doing a commendable job in testing and surveillance. Our case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.36%, too, is much better than the state’s CFR of 1.42%. The health workers have been asked to intensify surveillance and testing in those areas which have been identified as critical hotspots,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/tally-of-symptomatic-covid-19-patients-in-noida-goes-down-over-two-weeks/story-ZuARnt9BcZLJUarrTWatgM.html

Yogesh Pratap Singh, UP president of BKU (Bhanu), said that his organisation extends support to the nationwide bandh on Tuesday. “We have called upon all our members and workers to participate in the protest and ensure Chakka Jam on Tuesday. We will protest with all our might and demand the government to withdraw the farm laws. We will ensure that emergency services and ambulance services are not disturbed in the strike,” he said. The farmers have also planned to march from Chilla border to Delhi at 5pm. The farmers said they will also try to halt traffic at DND Flyway and Kalindi Kunj. At present, the Chilla border remains locked on both sides with barricades, and Noida police and Delhi police personnel are deployed on both sides to stop the farmers’ march. The farmers said they have planned to organise a mahapanchayat at Chilla border on December 9 to deliberate on their move if the demands are not met. Dr SK Giri, general secretary and spokesperson of BKU (Lok Shakti) said that his organisation will ensure the protest is peaceful. “We will make this a historic protest. This is a farmers’ protest and the issue should not be politicised,” he said. Meanwhile, GB Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh held a meeting with senior police officials to take stock of the law and order situation. On Monday, a group of 43 Samajwadi Party workers organised a protest march from FNG Road in Sector 63 to Bahlolpur village in support of farmers’ demands. However, they were arrested and later released by the police.Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Zone 1, said that due to enforcement of Section 144 of CrPC, any protest or gathering is not allowed. “These protesting members were arrested and booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC. They were taken to Surajpur police line and later released on personal bond,” he said. Raghvendra Dubey, a Samajwadi Party worker, said, “The police tried to stop our march but we continued to move forward. Then they arrested us and brought to Surajpur police line. We had a peaceful protest. Is it a crime to support farmers?” Dubey said.The DCP said that the police are ready to deal with the situation on Tuesday. “We will ensure all establishments and organisations function normally. We will not let protesters block DND Flyway and Kalindi Kunj road,” Rajesh said. Love Kumar, additional commissioner of police, GB Nagar, said that the police teams and PAC constabulary have been deployed at all strategic points. “The police teams are alert to ensure peaceful protest. The police also conducted a flag march in the area.

08-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Car hits scooter at Janpath, one killed||A 53-year-old man was killed after an allegedly speeding car hit the scooter he was riding on Janpath Road near Connaught Place in central Delhi on Sunday night.The car was being driven by a 30-year-old man pursuing a Chartered Accountant (CA) course. He was arrested and later bailed out, as the sections of Indian Penal Code under which he was booked were bailable, the police said.Senior police officers said that the errant driver, identified as Ankit Gupta, did not flee the spot but rushed the injured man to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in another vehicle. However, the man identified as Vinod Kumar was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. Kumar was a resident of Yusuf Sarai in south Delhi and was unemployed. He had just visited his wife, a cancer patient undergoing treatment at Safdarjung Hospital, they said.According to a police officer, the accident took place around 10.30pm at the Tolstoy Road-Janpath Road crossing. Eyewitnesses told the police that Kumar was riding his scooter from Tolstoy Marg while the car was coming from the direction of Connaught Place, the officer said.“Prima facie, it appears that either the car driver or the scooter rider jumped the traffic signal. The car hit the scooter and its rider was flung into the air; he landed on the windshield of the car. The scooter rider’s body then hit another vehicle on the opposite carriageway. The accident took place at the Tolstoy Road-Janpath Road intersection,” said the officer requesting anonymity.Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said that the Connaught Place police station received a call about the accident at 10.31pm. A police team reached the spot and found the car and the scooter in damaged condition.Kumar had been taken to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital by Gupta, a resident of Vasant Vihar. He was declared dead at the hospital,” said DCP Singhal.A case of rash and negligent driving causing death was registered under sections 279 and 304 A of Indian Penal Code against Gupta. Both the vehicles were impounded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/car-hits-scooter-at-janpath-one-killed/story-N7pE4eq0FZPJKkRNeshy7H.html
08-12-2020||Delhi||Five with suspected terror links arrested from east Delhi||Five men, allegedly involved in anti-national activities and targeted killings, including that of Shaurya Chakra recipient Balwinder Singh Sandhu at his home in Punjab in October, were arrested after a shootout in east Delhi on Monday morning, the Delhi Police said. The police recovered two kilograms of heroin, three pistols, two cars and ₹1 lakh from the arrested persons. The men and sleuths from the special cell exchanged 13 rounds of fire, but nobody was hurt in the shootout, they said.The police added that the men belong to Punjab and Kashmir.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said that with the arrest and interrogation of the five men they have exposed the nexus of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan, pro-Khalistan radicals, and narco-terrorists who were working together to revive militancy in Punjab and planning a slew of killings, mostly of right-wing leaders in Punjab and Delhi. Narco-terrorism was being used to fund the revival of the militancy, he said. Of the three Kashmiri men, one Ayub Pathan is directly associated with terrorist organisation Hizbul Muzahideen, while the other two, identified as Shabir Ahmad Gojree and Riyaz Rather, are also linked to the outfit. All three of them are “over-ground workers (OGW)” of Hizbul Mujahideen, the DCP said. The two Punjab men, Gurjit Singh alias Bhaa and Sukhdeep Singh aka Bhura, are hitmen of gangster Sukhmeet Pal Singh alias Sukh Bikhariwal, who lives in a Gulf nation and has been instrumental in executing the targeted killings on the instructions of ISI and Pakistan-based Khalistan radicals, said DCP Kushwah.“On October 16, Gurjit and Sukhdeep murdered Shaurya Chakra recipient Balwinder Singh Sandhu on Bikhariwal’s instructions. Bikhariwal was also given the task to kill Honey Mahajan, a leader of a Hindu outfit. A near-fatal attack on Mahajan was executed by Bikhariwal’s hitmen on February 11 in Punjab. While Mahajan survived despite being seriously injured, another person was killed in that attack,” said Kushwah.According to the DCP, the special cell had been receiving inputs since January that ISI, through its K2 (Kashmir-Khalistan) desk, has been funding the targeted killings of right-wing leaders and opponents of terrorism through the spoils of drug trafficking. ISI operatives had been pushing narcotic drugs through the OGWs of Hizbul Mujahideen based in Kashmir and supplying them to their Khalistani counterparts in Punjab for further distribution, he said.“Our teams learnt that on ISI’s instructions, three men from Kashmir had come to Delhi to provide funds obtained through drug trafficking to the hitmen on Bikhariwal. The task was assigned to them by a Pakistan-based operative code-named Sadakat,” said Kushwah.On Monday, the teams laid a trap in the Shakarpur area following inputs that the suspects would meet there. Around 6.45am, two cars were spotted and the occupants were asked to surrender. The suspects fired at the police party in a bid to flee. The police fired in self-defence and caught all five of them, the DCP said.After killing Sandhu at his home in October, Gurjit and Sukhdeep had been lying low at hideouts arranged by Bikhariwal. Recently, the two were asked to execute the killing of an important person in Delhi. The two, however, were not given the name of their target. Bikhariwal had asked them to receive money from their Kashmir associates for arranging logistics, he said.“The ISI is trying to emulate the model of 2016-17 in Punjab wherein they executed eight murders of right-wing leaders through a similar modus operandi,” added Kushwah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/five-with-suspected-terror-links-arrested-from-east-delhi/story-ZXijW38Dx6hWA07mZCR8CL.html
08-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi enveloped in season’s first fog, visibility affected||The national capital was enveloped in a thick layer of fog on Monday morning, with the visibility reducing to zero at the Palam weather station. This was the season’s first heavy fog, said officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). It also contributed to the deterioration in Delhi’s air quality, which almost touched the “severe” mark.According to IMD officials, ‘there was “very dense fog” at Palam, disrupting flight operations and road traffic during the early hours of Monday.RK Jenamani, head of the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport’s MeT department said, “For around three hours—between 6.30am and 9am—the visibility was zero. It was only after 9am that it improved to 50 metres here. When visibility is zero, flight operations have to be suspended. The runway visibility was 75-125 metres. There was a sudden change in atmospheric conditions because of easterly winds that resulted in a thick fog cover. We expect ‘dense’ to ‘very dense’ fog on Tuesday as well; however, the intensity will be on the lower side.”At the Safdarjung Observatory, representative of Delhi’s weather, “moderate” fog was observed with the visibility reduced to 300 metres at 8.30am. “The season of fog has started. Easterly winds that were blowing over Delhi till Sunday noon brought moisture. High moisture content combined with low wind speed resulted in heavy fog. On Tuesday, we are expecting ‘dense’ fog at Safdarjung while ‘very dense fog’ at Palam,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.Also Read: Morning fog causes delays at Delhi airportHe added that at Safdarjung, the visibility may reduce to less than 200 metres on Tuesday morning. Also, air quality is likely to remain in the higher end of “very poor” because of the impact of fog, which makes the air heavier allowing higher concentration of pollutants. “Though moisture content will start reducing from Tuesday, its impact will be felt only later in the day. Also, wind speed will pick up to 10-12kmph, which may result in an improvement in air quality on December 9-10,” said Srivastava.Also, Delhi may see “very light rain” or drizzle on December 11 on account of a western disturbance that will affect the whole of northwest India, including Delhi. “Till at least December 12, there will be no significant change in the morning and night temperatures. Only after the passing of the WD, there could be a drop in temperature,” he said.On Monday, the minimum temperature was 12 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal. The maximum settled at 26.3 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal.As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the average air quality index (AQI) reading was 400, in the “very poor” zone, just one notch away from “severe” (401). It was 389 on Sunday. On Saturday, Delhi’s air quality was in the “severe” zone with an AQI reading of 404.At least 12 of the 35 monitoring stations, including those in major hot spots, already recording air quality which breached the “severe” category. On a scale of 0-500, an AQI value between 301-400 is considered “very poor” while 401-500 is “severe”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-enveloped-in-season-s-first-fog-visibility-affected/story-tz5qmjcsPNqB07k4z3y6eM.html

08-12-2020||Delhi||Morning fog causes delays at Delhi airport||Several flights were delayed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport on Monday due to the season’s first fog. Airport officials said as many as 50-60 departures were delayed while arrivals continued normally. However, one international flight from Doha had to be diverted. At the airport, adequate arrangements were made to minimise inconvenience to the passengers, officials said.On Monday morning, fog caused visibility at the airport to drop drastically, forcing the airport operator to shut one of the three runways for close to three hours. Officials said this affected departures, while arrivals continued normally. “Around 50-60 departures were delayed as runway 29 had to be closed between 7.05am and 9.56am due to low visibility. But because the other two runways were functional throughout, fewer flights were affected. The number also remained low as air traffic movement is yet to recover to its full strength post the Covid-19-induced lockdown. As arrivals can take place even in low visibility, there were not many diversions,” said an official from the Delhi airport, who wished not to be named. The official said the dense fog did not last long on Monday and did not cause a lot of inconvenience to the passengers. “Also because international flights are not operating on all sectors due to the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions, the number of affected flights remained low,” he added.Also Read: Delhi enveloped in season’s first fog, visibility affectedAnother airport official said they have made special arrangements to minimise inconvenience to passengers stranded due to the delays. “We have enhanced the seating capacity in waiting areas inside terminals, marshals have been deployed to manage traffic, additional counters have been set up at immigration, real-time flight updates are being made available inside terminals and airlines have been told to deploy sufficient staff to deal with passengers,” the officer said.Some airlines also took to social media to update their passengers about the delays. SpiceJet tweeted, “Due to bad weather (Poor Visibility) in Jalandhar (AIP) and Delhi (DEL), all departures/arrivals and their consequential flights might get affected. Passengers are requested to keep a check on their flight status.”IndiGo also said in a tweet, “Due to bad weather in #Delhi, flight departures and arrivals are impacted.

08-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Covid positivity rate recorded around 5% six days in a row||Delhi’s positivity rate—the proportion of samples that test positive—has remained at 5% or less for six days in a row, with the city testing over 74,000 samples for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on average every day.The positivity rate dropped to 3.10% on Monday as per the health bulletin released by the government. The city reported 1,647 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday when a lower than average 53,207 samples were tested.There were 63 deaths due to the viral infection, taking the total toll of the city so far to 9,706. The number of deaths has remained below 100 a day for seven days now, yet the seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR)—the proportion of deaths among those who test positive—continues to climb as fewer cases are reported.The seven-day average CFR in Delhi was 2.35% on Monday as compared to 1.93% a week ago, when 108 deaths and 3,726 cases were reported in a day.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“In a month positivity declined to 3.15% today from 15.26% on 7th Nov. During the same period RTPCR positivity reduced to 6.68% from 30.20%. Lowest positivity in last 6 months. Steadily corona cases and positivity coming down. Hope this will continue. Please observe all precautions,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain tweeted.Experts believe that the spread of the infection is under control when the positivity rate is 5% or less for two weeks.The data breakup of RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests shared by the minister on Twitter showed that on average, from November to December 6, RT-PCR tests detected 2.5 times the number of cases that rapid antigen tests detected, even though RT-PCR tests accounted for less than 40% of the total administered.“It is very encouraging to see that the positivity rate in Delhi has remained below 5% for almost a week, especially since the government has increased the number of the more accurate RT-PCR tests. However, this does not mean that the government can scale down the number of tests. If the current number of tests is maintained and the positivity rate continues to remain low, it will instil confidence in people that the number of infections has gone down,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Also Read: Bharat Biotech seeks emergency use authorization for Covid-19 vaccineThe RT-PCR tests constituted over 45% of the tests administered over the last fortnight as compared to around 37% the fortnight before.Molecular tests such as RT-PCR amplify the genetic material of the virus to detect its presence in a patient sample, making them more accurate than rapid antigen tests. Rapid antigen tests are cheaper, easy to deploy outside of labs and take only 15 minutes to give results, but they are known to throw up false negatives for nearly half the patients who might have the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-covid-positivity-rate-recorded-around-5-six-days-in-a-row/story-9yIeZYulbNRnwM13fEQhOM.html

Nobody will be allowed to take the law in his or her hands,” said Shrivastava.Thousands of farmers have gathered on Delhi’s borders to protest against the three farm laws enacted in September and have given a call for a nationwide bandh on Tuesday. In a statement issued on Monday, the city police have appealed to everyone not to disrupt the life of common citizens and residents of Delhi during the strike. Also Read| Bharat bandh: Major impact likely to be felt in PunjabAs the city police have been receiving inputs that the farmers protesting at various borders in outer and east Delhi may attempt to block more borders or would try to cross over into Delhi, a “contingency plan” has been prepared to avoid traffic chaos and inconvenience to commuters. Of the 4,000 traffic personnel, a majority of them will be deployed on the borders that are either closed or affected due to the farmers’ protest.On Monday evening, senior police officers held a briefing of all the traffic personnel who will be on duty Tuesday and explained the contingency plans. All the traffic circle inspectors were informed about their place of deployment and given a list of the alternative borders and routes through which the movement of vehicles between Delhi-Haryana and Delhi-Uttar Pradesh will be passed if the main borders are blocked by the protesting farmers of workers of the political parties and various unions that have extended support to the nationwide strike, said a senior traffic police officer.“Our traffic personnel will guide the motorists as per the situation. There will be alternative routes to regulate the movement of vehicles. As maximum traffic congestion is likely to be in the areas bordering Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, our deployment will mostly be in such areas. We will be regularly posting updates regarding the traffic situation on social media,” said special commissioner of police (traffic) Taj Hassan.Seven borders that are completely closed due to the farmers’ protest are Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Jharoda, Piao Maniyari, and Mangesh in outer and south-western parts of the city and Chilla border, connecting Delhi and Noida, in east Delhi. Apart from these points, the Delhi-Meerut expressway at Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border is closed for vehicles coming to Delhi from Ghaziabad side, while the opposite carriageway through which vehicles move towards Ghaziabad is open. The service road of NH-24 at the UP gate border is also closed as the protesting farmers have occupied it for the past 10 days.Traffic police officials said that due to the closure of the seven borders, the movement of vehicles between Delhi and Haryana is being managed through Lampur, Safiabad, Saboli, Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan, Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera.Also Read| Farmers’ protest: Political parties, trade, transport unions in Haryana support Bharat Bandh call“Similarly, motorists travelling between Delhi and UP are advised to take Apsara, Bhopra, Anand Vihar, Kalindi Kunj, DND, New Ashok Nagar, Kondli and Dallupra to avoid traffic chaos. In case, some of these open borders are also disrupted, there are many other points through which the vehicles can move from one city to another,” said another traffic police officer.Senior police officers said all patrol vehicles will be pressed into service. In New Delhi district, security has been beefed up at the residence of senior ministers, including the agriculture minister, and at important buildings such as Krishi Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan and the Parliament.Senior officials said drone cameras will be used to keep surveillance on the protesting farmers and those who will be participating in the strike. The offices of the various political parties that are supporting the strike are also being monitored.“We are having talks with the representatives of the political parties and various unions and telling them that no gathering or people or protest is allowed in the city as per the Covid-19 guidelines.

08-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers say they will block roads, seek support||The farmers protesting at different borders of the national capital against the three new farm laws on Monday said they have appealed to their supporters to observe ‘bharat bandh’, scheduled on Tuesday, only between 11 am to 3 pm in order to avoid any “inconvenience” to the general public. The farmers said that ambulances and other emergency services and those travelling to attend weddings will be allowed to ply during the chakka jam, which will be observed on the borders and highways during the same duration. The farmers have given a call for bandh as a part of their ongoing protest demanding revocation of three new farm laws. Kulwant Singh Sandhu, 65, general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha, said, “We do not want to cause any inconvenience to the general public and that’s why we have appealed our supporters to observe bharat bandh till 3pm. People will resume their businesses and work after it. The call for the Bharat Bandh has been given to prove the government wrong who thinks that only a handful of farmers are opposing the new farm laws.”Singh said the farmers have got support from several trade and transport unions and almost all the opposition parties. “Even the petrol pump associations of several states have extended the support and will remain closed till 3 pm,” he said.Balwinder Singh Raju, president of Majha Kisan Sangarsh Committee, Punjab, said their supporters will also block roads, highways and borders as a part of the Bharat Bandh. “It will also be observed till 3 pm. It won’t cause any inconvenience since vehicles will not be plying on the roads in that duration. All the major transport associations have already decided to support us,” he said.Also Read: AAP and Congress to hold protests in support of Bharat BandhFarmers at several protest sites were also seen discussing and planning for the bandh. The farmers were also seen appealing nearby shopkeepers and traders to support them.At Delhi-Uttar Pradesh (UP) border in Ghazipur, farmers are planning to block all the four lanes of the national highway 24. Currently, the agitating farmers are currently sitting in only one lane. Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)’s Tikait faction in UP, said, “The highway will naturally remain shut because no vehicles will be on the roads till 3pm. But our supporters will make ways for ambulances, weddings and other emergency services. We have appealed to everyone to observe the strike peacefully.”At Chilla border, connecting Delhi to Noida in UP, several farmers returned to their villages in Meerut, Agra, Etah and Firozabad to mobilise people in their hometowns for the bandh. Prem Singh Bhati, BKU coordinator in Gautam Budhh Nagar, said, “Some of us will sit here and block the border on Tuesday while others have returned to their villages to ensure proper implementation of bandh. They will return on Wednesday.”Farmers protesting at Singhu border said that several more farmers from Punjab and Haryana will join their ongoing blockade at the border on Tuesday. Sukhwinder Singh, joint secretary of Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan committee (Punjab), said, “They will be blocking the roads on their way to Singhu border to mark the bandh. But they have been asked to allow weddings and ambulances to pass through. We will continue our sit-in here as it is.”Also Read: Police warn strict action against disruptors, to use drones to keep an eye on protestersMeanwhile, several student groups, artists and academicians also extended their support to the bandh call.

08-12-2020||Delhi||Fruit and vegetable supplies in Delhi may be hit due to Bharat Bandh||The trade of fruits and vegetables in Delhi is likely to be hit on Tuesday as several associations in the city’s mandis have decided to join the one-day strike to support farmers who are protesting against the Centre’s farm laws.Adil Ahmed Khan, the chairman of Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi which trades fruits and vegetables in wholesale, said several traders’ associations of the market including those in Ghazipur and Okhla among others have decided not to operate on Tuesday. “Almost all associations within Azadpur Mandi have said they will not engage in any trade of fruit and vegetables on Tuesday in support of the farmers protest. Traders have even put up banners at all gates of Azadpur Mandi in solidarity with the one-day strike. This is a historic decision because if there are no farmers then there will be no traders in our mandis. But, there is nothing to panic. Delhi won’t face any crisis due to shortage of supplies,” said Khan.However, not all traders appeared to agree with Khan as they said it would be business as usual for them.“It is preposterous to say that mandis like those in Azadpur, Ghazipur, Okhla or Narela will be completely shut on Tuesday. All these markets will remain open and many of us will also engage in usual business. Trucks with the daily supply of fruits and vegetables have already started coming from Monday evening, an indication that it is business as usual. It is only a section of traders who may opt join the strike and keep their shops shut,” said Anil Malhotra, a wholesale trader and member of the Azadpur agriculture produce marketing company (APMC).Several traders from three prominent APMCs in Delhi—Azadpur, Ghazipur and Okhla—said supplies in the national Capital have already been hit because of the road closures along the borders as the farmers continued their protest for the twelfth consecutive day. “A large number of traders have stopped sending fruits and vegetables to other states temporarily and are focusing only on local supplies to keep prices stable in Delhi. The arrival of fruits and vegetables in Azadpur has dropped significantly from around 11,500 trucks per day on an average for this time of the year to around 6,000 trucks a day,” said Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bharat-bandh-fruit-and-vegetable-supplies-in-delhi-may-be-hit/story-Ffl6fLxWO5AQifxHvKdjfM.html

Several unions of taxi and auto-rickshaw operators have joined the strike call given by the farmers protesting against the three farm laws enacted in September that seek to open farm trade. However, almost all markets including Connaught Place, Lajpat Nagar, Sadar Bazar and Khan Market shall remain open, the concerned associations said on Monday.While there will not be a complete blackout of autos and cabs in the city on Tuesday, unions said their availability will be “considerably lower than usual”. The Delhi Metro said it will run operations as usual unless there are specific directions from the Delhi Police on Tuesday. Similarly, state-run DTC and cluster buses will also ply as usual. But, last mile connectivity is expected to be hit.

Cab aggregators Ola and Uber refused to comment on the matter.Apart from cabs and autos, Shyam Lal Gola, general secretary of STA Operators Ekta Manch, said around 8,000 other public service vehicles will also not operate on Tuesday. These include Gramin Sewas, RTVs, phat phat Sewa, eco-friendly cabs and maxi cabs. However, many other auto and taxi unions have decided to continue normal services despite their support to demands raised by the agitating farmers. The Aam Aadmi Party-affiliated auto-rickshaw union has decided to run all its autos during the strike, said Santosh Pandey, president of Aapka Apna Auto Taxi Union. Rajender Soni, general secretary of Delhi Auto Rickshaw Sangh, and Delhi Pradesh Taxi Union and Chandu Chaurasia, vice-president of Capital Driver Welfare Association, said the demands of farmers need to be met by the government, but it should not be achieved by causing inconvenience to ordinary people.MARKETS TO REMAIN OPENAfter several rounds of meetings with shopkeepers and other traders, associations of popular markets such as Connaught Place, Khan Market, Lajpat Nagar, Sarojini Nagar, Sadar Bazar, Chandni Chowk, Rajouri Garden, etc have decided to stay open for business on Tuesday. Traders of these markets have requested the Delhi police to provide adequate security to avoid any untoward incident.“Our business has already suffered a lot due to Covid-19. We will keep the market open as we can’t afford any further loss. Now that customers have started coming back to the market, closing the shops will hurt the customers’ confidence,” said Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders’ Association in Connaught Place.Also Read| Bharat bandh: Major impact likely to be felt in PunjabIn Sarojini Nagar, shop shopkeepers have decided to wear black badges as a mark of solidarity with the farmers, even as their shops will remain open.

We stand with them, but a majority of traders are not in favour of keeping the market closed. We will wear black badges to support their cause.”Traders say that business has already suffered in the past few days due farmers sitting at the borders. “Our goods from other states are stuck. Due to the protest, the business has suffered. How will we survive, if we close our shops? If this protest continues, we will suffer huge losses,” said Devraj Baweja, president of Sadar Bazaar traders association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bharat-bandh-fewer-autos-taxis-but-markets-to-stay-open-today/story-Xwhs2JsKPyrsZXsCEmMP3K.html
08-12-2020||Delhi||AAP and Congress to hold protests in support of Bharat Bandh||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)on Monday said it will hold a peaceful demonstration at the busy ITO intersection on Tuesday morning in support of the Bharat Bandh called by farmers against the Centre’s farm laws. The Congress also said it will organise sit-in protests in each of the capital’s 70 assembly consistencies in solidarity with the national strike, adding that their protests will also begin from the ITO intersection. Delhi’s AAP convenor and Cabinet minister Gopal Rai, on Monday, said, “Today, the farmers of our country are in distress. I want to appeal to all the citizens of India to support their demands and to extend their support to the Bharat Bandh called by the farmers tomorrow [Tuesday].”The AAP leader later tweeted, “AAP to hold a peaceful demonstration on December 8 in support of the Bharat Bandh called by the farmers at 11 AM at the ITO crossing of Delhi.”The Congress’ workers will hold up placards to appeal to the public to demand a rollback of the farm laws and participate in the bandh in large numbers. They said they plan to gherao the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) headquarters. Also Read| Bharat bandh: Major impact likely to be felt in PunjabDelhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said, “We have been supporting the farmers’ cause, as they are our ‘annadata’ (someone who provides food). We have urged people to participate in the Bharat Bandh either by staying home or by helping them in any way they can. Party workers will be present at major traffic junctions across the city’s 70 assembly constituencies urging people to create pressure on the Centre to roll back farm laws. I will reach ITO at 9.30am to support their cause.” He added that party functionaries have been visiting the various border points where kitchens have been set up to provide daily meals to the agitating farmers.BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in the Delhi Assembly, said, “The central government is holding discussions with them, then what’s the point of this bandh? The Prime Minister has assured them that minimum support prices (MSP) will stay. This protest is being used by political parties for their own advantage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-and-congress-to-hold-protests-in-support-of-bharat-bandh/story-99GEaMQKT1hYtXF4Yuqo8I.html
08-12-2020||Delhi||Drink of champions that is attracting onlookers, queues||The long and laborious ritualistic process of preparing the ‘Shaheedi Degh’ (a sacrament drink of the Sikhs) that involves grinding a host of dry items by using a mortar and an unusually long and heavy wooden pestle has been drawing curious onlookers and long queues at the farmers’ protest site in Singhu.While the making of this drink is traditionally done by the Nihang Sikhs (warrior Sikhs) twice a day -- and they are doing it ritualistically at the Singhu Border -- half-a-dozen other Sikhs too have been involved in its preparation throughout the day at the farmers’ protest camp on the Delhi side of the police barricades here. “This drink contains all necessary ingredients to keep the body strong. Every farmer here has this drink at least once everyday. This is what is keeping the Coronavirus away from the farmers’ protest,” said Sukwinder Singh, a resident of Sabhra village in Tarn Taran and joint secretary of Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan Committee (Punjab). There is no scientific evidence to prove that the drink provides protection from the coronavirus. Also, farmers are not undergoing any Covid-19 tests to establish if anyone at the protest site has been infected or not. Also Read: Farmers say they will block roads, seek supportThe grinding process, which has been drawing curious onlookers, goes on for anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the quantity of the ingredients.Two men join hands to go about grounding a dozen ingredients such as almonds, cardamom, melon seeds, black pepper and sugar in a medium-sized mortar made of stone, called sunara. A four-five feet tall wooden log made of either sandalwood or a neem tree trunk, weighing as much as 20 kilos, serves as the pestle which they call “salottar”. “It requires men with strong muscle strength to go about the grinding work. One chants the hymns (vaani) while the other grinds. When one gets tired, they exchange roles. Our belief is that the vaani adds spiritual strength to the drink,” said Das Gurmeet Singh, a Nihang Sikh from Nanded district in Maharashtra. The juice of the paste is finally squeezed using a white cloth and offered to the people in the queues after prayers.What also drew the attention of the onlookers was a ritualistic practice in which the left overs are rolled into small balls after which a Nihang Sikh hurls them in the air after a short run up. On Monday, one such ball landed right next to a family of rag pickers collecting plastic waste near a camp. “We believe that this process clears our hurdles in whatever we do. Right now, it is the farm law that is our hurdle,” said Satnam Singh, a Nihang Sikh from Chamkaur Sahib town of Rupnagar in Punjab.Apart from making this drink, a group of Nihang Sikhs accompanied by horses and a baaz (Northern goshawk) are guarding the farmers at this border since Friday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/the-drink-of-champions-that-is-keeping-farmer-protesters-going/story-X8txVYQI3MA1y3KEv033oJ.html
08-12-2020||Mumbai||In a first, Indian bison spotted at Maharashtra’s Dnyanganga Wildlife Sanctuary||The Maharashtra forest department has documented the presence of the gaur or Indian bison for the first time at the Dnyanganga Wildlife Sanctuary (DWS) in Buldhana district in Vidarbha region.No occurrence of this species was reported or documented from this sanctuary, prior to the animal being photographed by forest guards on Sunday. “While this animal is regularly spotted across other sanctuaries in Vidarbha, including Tadoba and Melghat, this is the first time we have a record of the gaur from Dnyanganga. It may have come from Melghat and found this area suitable as it seems to have settled here,” said MS Reddy, additional principal chief conservator of forest, and field director, Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) in Amravati. DWS is a part of MTR located near the Dnyanganga river, a tributary of the Tapti.Gaurs are the world’s largest and tallest wild bovines, with 85% of their current population in India. Male gaurs weigh 1,000-1,500kg while females weigh 700g-1,000kg. Their height ranges from 165-220cm (5-7ft). They are listed as Schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and are tagged as “vulnerable” in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List.The 205-sqkm DWS was notified as a sanctuary in 1997. It is known to have the highest number of sloth bears among sanctuaries in Vidarbha. Last year, a three-year-old male tiger (T1C1) walked a 3,020-km journey over 13 months from Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (tracked using his radio-collar), and established his new territory at DWS, making it the longest ever recorded movement of a tiger in India. “A proposal is being considered by the chief wildlife warden’s office about releasing a mate for T1C1 to increase tiger population at DWS,” said Reddy, adding that his arrival has boosted tourism. “By developing around 100 waterholes and stopping grazing, the habitat for wildlife has been improved significantly. From just 10 guides, we now have 30, making it one of the most visited small sanctuaries in Maharashtra,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-a-first-indian-bison-spotted-at-maharashtra-s-dnyanganga-wildlife-sanctuary/story-FbPANC1bnLMrU5kNKRFZhK.html
08-12-2020||Noida||Three arrested for illegally ferrying two camels in Greater Noida||Noida: The police on Sunday night arrested three persons allegedly transporting two camels in a small pickup truck in Gautam Budh Nagar, under the Animal Cruelty Act. According to a volunteer of an NGO, People For Animals (PFA) who informed the police and currently has temporary custody of the animals, the two young male camels were allegedly being taken for entertainment purposes in wedding ceremonies. Later, the police stopped the vehicle carrying the animals along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway and took them to the police station. “We have arrested the three under Section 2/11 of Animal Cruelty Act, as the camels were stuffed in a small pickup truck which was not meant for that. The people transporting them also did not have any permission or ownership documents of the animals. We have sent the three, who are residents of Delhi, Gautam Budh Nagar and Bulandshahr, to jail and are investigating the matter,” said A K Pandey, SHO, Dankaur, Greater Noida. According to the complainant, the animals were allegedly being carried without permission. “We saw the pickup truck stuffed with two camels near Galgotias University while returning from work. I immediately informed a PCR and they came and stopped the vehicle. Later, the police handed over the custody to us and they will remain with us temporarily,” said Pragati Khanna, volunteer, PFA, Gautam Budh Nagar. The animals were later sent to the shelter run by Smart Sanctuary in Greater Noida. According to the PFA, the alleged transportation of the camels without permission was also in violation of The Rajasthan Camel (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act 2015. “Camels under the act are state property of Rajasthan and cannot be transported even for grazing purposes without permission out of the state. It had become a common practice of using them for show in wedding functions and the owners often charge anything from Rs 25,000 or more,” said Kaveri Rana, president PFA Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/three-arrested-for-illegally-ferrying-two-camels-in-greater-noida/story-zZBs0vyHtmKy3gX6wYKPQL.html
08-12-2020||Noida||Injured Nilgai fawn rescued in Greater Noida||Noida: A Nilgai fawn was rescued on Monday morning by the divisional forest department and an animal welfare NGO in Greater Noida. The scared and distressed fawn, recognised as a six-month-old female, was likely hit by a speeding small vehicle in early morning hours, said officials. The rescue team from animal welfare NGO Smart Sanctuary and People for Animal (PFA) said that they received a call from locals near Omicron-3, Greater Noida after finding a wounded fawn squealing with pain at a service lane. Due to the Nilgai being classified as a wild animal, the NGO apprised the forest department, upon which officials reached the spot. “We received distressed calls from some morning walkers and a few NGOs from Delhi about the injured fawn. A team rushed there along with forest officials and the fawn was taken to the veterinary hospital. The fawn was highly distressed and scared and only hours later it was stabilised and shifted to a facility of Smart Sanctuary in Greater Noida,” said Kaveri Rana, president, PFA, Gautam Budh Nagar and head, Smart Sanctuary. According to officials, there is a good population of free ranging Nilgai or blue bull – an antelope species – in the district and it seemed that the fawn was separated from its herd.“The fawn had received multiple flesh wounds and a bone injury in one of the forelegs. It is now out of danger and kept under the care of Smart Sanctuary. There are several herds of Nilgai that move around the green patches, urban forests and agriculture fields of the city. It seems that this fawn was lost and later hit by a smaller vehicle; had it been a heavy vehicle the fawn would not have survived,” said Ram Avtar, range forest officer and head, Surajpur Wetland. According to the forest department’s 2019 census, there are a total of 1,094 Nilgais in Noida while in 2011, their numbers were 1,939. The largest antelopes in Asia, the Nilgais are protected under Schedule-3 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. “Once recovered, we have decided to rehabilitate the fawn in Surajpur wetland,” said Rana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/injured-nilgai-fawn-rescued-in-greater-noida/story-fDRR5tzapdKyQbJxOF8y8O.html

08-12-2020||City||Mumbai: Man, mother say not treated in time; Kalwa hospital denies all claims||A video of a 22-year-old man and his mother complaining of lack of proper service and care at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Kalwa went viral on Monday. Both, the mother and son, were allegedly assaulted by the father. They allege that despite having bruises the man was not treated immediately by the hospital staff and had to wait for hours. Although the hospital confirmed the incident, they also denied any lax on their part.Sumit Santosh went to Kalwa hospital on Sunday night after his father allegedly assaulted him and his mother after an argument. Santosh has bite marks on his fingers and back, while both mother and son have bruises. They claimed that for over three hours there was no hospital staff to attend them. “There was only one nurse present at the casualty ward. We were given dressing after an hour-long wait and were told that there are no tetanus injections were available at the hospital. We kept waiting for the injections,” said Santosh in the video that went viral on Monday.“Son had bruises and bite marks in different parts of his body, while the mother’s genital areas were injured. There could have been a slight delay as we have many patients in the casualty ward. However, it is not possible that the patient was kept waiting for hours. I checked with those on duty, our staff had attended the patient and suggested some tests. They had to wait to get the tests done and this is when they started showing disinterest. They were keen to leave the hospital soon,” said Bhimrao Jadhav, dean, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital, Kalwa.“Moreover, their claims that the hospital does not have enough supplies of injections is false. Our staff examined and provided basic medication. They were asked to wait for the injection, but they were in a hurry to leave,” added Jadhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-man-mother-say-not-treated-in-time-kalwa-hospital-denies-all-claims/story-HxRusHiadcQb4EqiDSLVdN.html
08-12-2020||Education||Delhi University may set up its third campus in east Delhi||The Delhi University (DU) is planning to set-up a new campus in the east district of the national capital, officials said, adding it will not only help reduce administrative burden on the north and south campuses but also spur higher education opportunities in the region. Delhi University has two campuses -- North and South, besides several affiliated colleges spread across the city. DU pro-vice-chancellor (VC) PC Joshi, who is also the acting vice-chancellor, told HT that the new campus will come up in Surajmal Vihar area of east Delhi. “We have land in east Delhi and we are trying to develop that into a campus, just like we have a North and a South campus. We want to have a campus in east Delhi also. The university’s high-powered committee has recently inspected the site and we are holding a meeting on Wednesday to discuss this. We will then take the matter to other statutory bodies of the university for their approval,” he said. The DU had tweeted that Joshi, along with other senior officials, had visited the site on December 5.The identified land is located near the Karkardooma district courts complex and is accessible by both Blue and Red lines of Delhi Metro. Joshi said the administration was planning to set up a law centre and departments for liberal arts courses at the new campus. “We have already made a plan but it’s still in a very preliminary stage. The project will cost around Rs 600 crore so we will also have to make provisions for the funds. These things take time but we have started moving in that direction,” he said.In DU, while colleges offer undergraduate courses, the departments and faculties for postgraduate courses are situated on the campuses. Both North and South campuses also divide the administrative work of the colleges falling in their vicinity. Whereas, the off-campus colleges, those located in east and west Delhi, have to do their daily administrative work in coordination with the North campus. Explaining the reason behind setting up a new campus, DU dean of College Balaram Pani said that it will not only provide more opportunities for higher education but also help manage the administrative work well. “Currently, the South campus is taking care of the administrative work of 24 colleges and the North campus is looking after the remaining 40-plus colleges. It would become easier for colleges located in east and north-east Delhi to work efficiently, if they will have their own campus.”Some principals of DU colleges located in east Delhi echoed the sentiment. Payal Mago, principal of Shaheed Rajguru College in Vasundhara Enclave, said, “We have to send someone to the North campus for some administrative work almost daily. Our students also have to travel all the way to the North campus for any grievance. It becomes even more difficult for us to coordinate during examination or admissions. Things will become really easier for us if we get a campus in Surajmal Vihar.”Several students said that the university should also deliberate over starting new colleges. Dinesh Kumar, member of Krantikari Yuva Sangathan (KYS) -- a students’ group active in DU -- said, “If the university is planning to have a new campus, they should also start new colleges in order to increase undergraduate seats. Every year, so many students, particularly from the marginalised sections, are forced to take admission in distance learning courses due to limited seats in DU colleges.”Deepak Pental, former vice-chancellor of DU, said the third campus should rather be utilised for new courses or for the School of Open Learning (SoL). “The university doesn’t need to have another campus repeating the same postgraduate courses it is already offering in the other two. The new campus should either offer very different courses or it should be dedicated to the SoL which is already battling poor infrastructure. Besides, the university can set-up as many administrative offices there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/du-may-set-up-its-third-campus-in-east-delhi/story-HIjVqVv1KIjztuHXPXPmAI.html
08-12-2020||Noida||Noida authority approves plot merger scheme; over to state for final nod||NOIDA: Bringing much cheer to residents, the Noida authority has approved a scheme which allows the merger of two residential plots. Earlier, two adjoining residential plots couldn’t be merged in the absence of a policy. The proposal will now be sent to the state government for a final nod.Earlier, the authority, on February 2, 2007 in its 142nd board meeting, had approved a proposal for the same but the same could not get approvals from the state government. Later on December 21, 2016, the authority had again approved a proposal in this regard without getting a success at the state level. On Friday, the authority again approved this proposal with the hope that it will get requisite approvals from the Uttar Pradesh government.If approved, plot owners will now have to deposit ₹10,000 as processing fee to merge two plots.“Earlier there was no policy to merge two plots, which are adjoining in any sector across the city. The board approved this proposal in the interest of the general public, particularly those whose plots are adjoining and they want to merge the same,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.If it is approved, then those who have two adjoining plots in any residential sector can merge them, said officials. The authority does not have data on the exact number of pending cases related to the merger of plots.“There are many residents who have two adjoining plots in the city but cannot merge them in the absence of a policy on this. But now, they can merge two plots and use them, if the policy is approved,” said Prempal Singh, a resident of Sector 135.As per rules, merger will be allowed only with certain riders, such as two plots will be merged only if both plots are owned by the same person; after merger, the ground coverage, floor area ratio and set back norms will be as per the applicable building bylaws-2010; after merger, the two plots will be considered as one plot and these will be sold in the future only as one plot; the plot owner will not be able to de-amalgamate these two plots in the future; if the plots are mortgaged then the owner will have to obtain a no-objection certificate from the bank or financial agency that has mortgaged the plots.“The Noida authority has taken a much-needed decision in the interest of residents who own two plots and are willing to merge them. It was a long-pending demand of residents and it will be in the interest of the real estate sector as well,” said Anchal Bohra, a real estate expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-approves-plot-merger-scheme-over-to-state-for-final-nod/story-3SYr2PaJTzewnZBKqOKfhI.html
08-12-2020||Mumbai||2008 Malegaon blast case: Forensic lab fails to return evidence sent for examination||The Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Kalina has failed to return articles seized from one of the accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, since 2016. The special court on Monday asked the prosecution to submit a report regarding the piece of evidence in the next hearing. Around 9.30pm on September 29, 2008, a bomb planted on a motorcycle exploded at Malegaon, killing six people and injuring 101. In April 2011, the investigation was transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) from the Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS). Four years after the investigation, NIA had, on May 13, 2016, filed a charge sheet in the case. On Monday, NIA was scheduled to examine a material witness in front whom a compact disc containing a voice sample of one of the accused, Ramesh Upadhyay, was seized. The disc had been sent to FSL at Kalina for examination. The examination report was submitted by the lab, however, the disc remained with them. Further, the same witness was present for the process of personal search of another accused, Sudhakar Chaturvedi. The articles seized from him were also sent to Kalina for forensic examination but were not returned to NIA. The witness was required to identify these articles before the court but was unable to do so since FSL had not returned them. In the absence of the articles, the court had to return the witness and directed the prosecution to bring him when the items were recovered. The court asked the prosecution to follow up with the lab and report on why the evidence was not returned sooner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2008-malegaon-blast-case-forensic-lab-fails-to-return-evidence-sent-for-examination/story-t77psMRnVq0MMdmOBaZv0L.html
08-12-2020||Gurugram||Red-breasted merganser duck sighted in NCR for first time||Birders in Haryana made a rare sighting, of a female red-breasted merganser duck, at a wetland in Mandothi village of Jhajjar district, located about 40 kilometres from Gurugram, on Sunday and Monday. The red-breasted merganser is a resident of Europe and North America that migrates to parts of the UK, China and Pakistan during winter. This marks the first-ever appearance of the avian species in Haryana and Delhi-NCR. A previous sighting of the bird in India, in December 2016, at a Mumbai wetland, had sent ripples among country’s birding community .It was first spotted in Mandothi on the afternoon of December 6 by birder Sonu Dalal, a resident of the area, who initially mistook it for a common merganser duck, which is a resident of India’s hilly tracts and sometimes ventures to the Indo-Gangetic plain during winter. However, Dighal-based birder Rakesh Ahlawat on Monday visited the site and confirmed that the bird was, in fact, a red-breasted merganser. “The bird is a vagrant which may have found its way to India while migrating. This species usually resides around freshwater lakes in Europe and North America and then winters in parts of the UK, China, and some coasts in south Pakistan. They travel in huge flocks, but this one was found on its own,” said Ahlawat. The red-breasted merganser spotted in Jhajjar is a female specimen and was seen wading amid a group of waterfowl, including common teals and shovellers. Birders were able to identify her from her thin bill and slighter build, as compared to the more hefty common merganser. Red-breasted merganser ducks are among the fastest ducks in flight, clocking speeds above 150 kilometres per hour. “It’s hard to say where exactly this bird’s migratory path has originated as their breeding range is very large,” said Sonu Dalal, who first spotted the duck on Sunday. The first photographic record of the red-breasted merganser in India dates back to December 21, 2016, when it was spotted at a wetland in Maharashtra’s Vasai taluka, in Rajavalli village. At the time, birders from across the Mumbai region flocked to Vasai to catch a glimpse of the bird. Coincidentally, the species was also spotted around the same time at the Gajoldoba wetland near Siliguri in West Bengal. “I remember the Mumbai sighting created quite a flutter. Even I had gone to Vasai to try and see the bird in January 2017, but wasn’t lucky enough,” said Pankaj Gupta of the Delhi Bird Foundation. “I suspect people will want to have a look at this specimen since it is the first sighting in Haryana and NCR. Common merganser ducks are sometimes seen in parts of Uttar Pradesh and Kashmir, but this one is not a resident of India. It is clearly a vagrant that has deviated from its migratory path,” Gupta said.Two earlier recordings of the red-breasted merganser also exist from West Bengal, in 1889 and 1961. However, these claims are not supported by photographic evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/red-breasted-merganser-duck-sighted-in-ncr-for-first-time/story-3Fd92sVaMVewcmmY4K24DI.html

By 4pm, much after fire brigade, disaster management and municipal corporation (MC) teams reached the spot, the structure collapsed. No casualties were reported as the building had been evacuated, even as the owner of the neighbouring plot was booked for not getting permissions to dig the land to build a basement. The building that collapsed had a chemist’s shop, lawyers’ offices and a second floor with no occupancy. Vineet Kamboj, owner of the chemist shop said medicines worth lakhs had been destroyed. “Digging started five days ago and on Monday morning it was dug to a depth of 10 feet beyond permissible limits, exposing the foundation of the building. The land started sinking and the walls started developing cracks,” said Gurpreet Singh, the owner of the collapsed building.The plot owner, Jyoti Sadana, was booked under Sections 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs 50) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 21 of the Mining Act for digging without permission. Report sought: DayalanMohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said a complete report had been sought on the incident. “We came to know on time that the earth had been dug up beyond permissible limits, endangering the adjoining building, which was evacuated on time, saving many lives. Legal action will be taken.” According to MC records, the owner of the plot had got the building plan for a residential unit sanctioned, but permissions had not been given for digging the land for a basement.In February this year, a commercial building collapsed on the Kharar-Landran road and a man operating an excavator machine was killed while digging the basement area.An inquiry is pending in the case with the sub-divisional magistrate, Kharar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/commercial-building-collapses-in-zirakpur-after-digging-starts-in-adjacent-plot/story-J2GaMd1dF9nN9DWPN7AhqL.html
08-12-2020||City||MC elections: Ambala city SDM is now returning officer||Three days after district election officer and deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma had appointed municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Parth Gupta as the returning officer (RO) for the elections, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Sachin Gupta has now been given the charge in fresh orders issued on Monday. The orders also stated that Gupta’s charge of the nodal officer for the polls will now be given to city magistrate Ashok Kumar.The reason behind this immediate change, however, couldn’t be cleared as the DC remained incommunicado despite several attempts. On this, Gupta said, “I can’t clear out the reason, but I’ve been given the charge. I’ve also appointed duty magistrates and sector officers for all 20 wards to keep a check on the election process. The officers have to be on duty otherwise disciplinary action will be taken.”Gupta has given two wards each to the duty magistrates and one ward each to the sector officers.Meanwhile, major parties like BJP and Congress have accelerated their candidate selection process. The saffron party is set to launch its new party office in the city on Wednesday that is expected to be a show of strength before the candidates are declared. Congress is still busy receiving the applications at the party office in the city.Regional parties like former state minister Nirmal Singh’s Haryana Democratic Front will soon present its party manifesto. Former Union minister Venod Sharma’s Haryana Janchetna Party is yet to declare it’s candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mc-elections-ambala-city-sdm-is-now-returning-officer/story-RsdfF2QFQfXKB9JnNCCmDP.html
08-12-2020||Pune||Chemist among 6 people arrested in MD drug bust; total arrested now 20||A post-graduate degree holder, who taught a group of criminals the procedure of making mephedrone narcotic, was among the six men who were arrested by Pimpri-Chinchwad police.The man has been identified as Arvindkumar Prakashchand Lohare (39), a resident of Oshiwara in Mumbai and a native of Mazaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh. Lohare was referred to as the “doctor” in their circle and was mentioned as such during the police custody of people arrested earlier in the case.“He was the one who trained everyone on how to make the drug. The teaching was done at three locations and 132kg MD was produced at a company in Ranjangaon MIDC. He took Rs 35 lakh for teaching the procedure. He has a history of another case against him,” said Krishna Prakash, commissioner of Pimpri-Chinchwad police.The five others arrested have been identified as Manoj Eknath Palande (40), a resident of Ganeshnagar Varse in Raigad; Afzal Hussain Abbas Sunsara (52), a resident of Jogeshwari West in Mumbai; Parshuram Bhalchandra Jogal (44), Wagle Estate in Thane and a native of Devgad in Sindhudurg; Mandar Baliram Bhosale (49), also a resident of Wagle Estate and Ram Manoharlal Gurbani (43), a resident of Mulund West in Mumbai, according to the police.Of the six people arrested recently, Jogal was arrested on November 24 from Thane, Bhosale and Gurbani were arrested on November 25, and the three others, including the chemist.According to the police, small quantities were made during the two-day teaching session at three locations - Bhosale’s Alkemi Industry and Palande’s Nimbus Pharma in Mahad MIDC, Raigad and a farmhouse owned by advocate M Joshi, where two kingpins, arrested earlier in the case, conducted trials. They have been identified as Tushar Kale and Rakesh alias Rocky Khaniwadekar.HOW 132kg of MD WAS PRODUCEDA team of workers led by Kale and Rocky produced 132kg of MD within 15 days before the lockdown and distributed it among people who sold it further. The workers had no idea what was being made in the factory, said senior police inspector Balkrushna Sawant.“During the training and trial period, they made some 4-5kg at three locations. However, at Ranjangaon MIDC, they produced 132kg. Generally, 400 grammes of pure substance can be extracted from 1kg of raw material. But Kale roped in a man named Hrushikesh Mishra (25) who is a gold medallist in chemistry from a university in Maharashtra. He helped them extract 800gm per kg of raw material,” said assistant police inspector Prerna Katte of the Pimpri-Chinchwad police crime branch.While Rocky and Kale produced the drug in batches, the three others are believed to have provided space, raw material, distribution channels and logistical support, according to the police.So far, it does not seem like there were any storage spaces involved as the drugs are believed to have been sent out as and when the batches were prepared and sold throughout the lockdown period, according to senior police inspector Shriram Paul.CASE, AS KNOWN, SO FARAlong with these six, the total number of arrests in the case have now reached 20. Among the 20 arrests, two men were found with cash that was collectively found to be worth Rs 85,00,000.The case first landed on the Pimpri-Chinchwad police radar when a truck carrying 20kg MD was seized in Chakan by senior PI Paul’s team on October 7.“This was the excess product that was kept under wraps by one of the players. They had first procured material to make 112kg of drugs. But their productivity increased (due to Mishra) and extra 20kg was produced. This truck was passing through Chakan when it was intercepted,” said senior PI Sawant.HISTORY OF CASES AGAINST ARRESTED PEOPLELohare, known as the “doctor” in his circle, has a previous case under NDPS registered against him in 2018 in Nashik. He was found with 12kg of produced MD in Igatpuri area of Nashik.Tushar Kale, suspected aide of underworld don Rajendra Nikalje aka Chhota Rajan and has at least five known cases against him.

08-12-2020||Pune||PMC’s cycle sharing scheme left orphaned under road dept||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) launched its public bicycle sharing scheme in 2007. Three years later the bicycle sharing scheme is all but defunct, with neither bicycles on the road, nor the civic body’s department overseeing the scheme functional. Initially, when the scheme received an enthusiastic response, PMC started a special bicycle department to execute, plan and coordinate between the four bicycle providers in the city. In 2018, the PMC assigned superintended engineer Narendra Salunke to oversee the bicycle scheme. Salunke retired in January 2020, and no official has been named as his replacement. In 2017, PMC prepared its comprehensive bicycle plan and launched its bicycle sharing programme in the city. Pune Smart City Development Company Limited (PSCDCL) started a cycle-share scheme in the University of Pune on December 5, 2017. After that, the PMC launched several schemes in different parts of the city. According to statistics provided by PMC officials, MOBIKE, Zooomcar and Yulu, all Bengaluru-based companies, provided a total of 5,800 bicycles on rentals for the share scheme. The firms later pulled out and Yulu is the only firm to have continued in major residential areas like Magarpatta. Srinwas Bonala, additional city engineer, Traffic planning department, said, “Right now, China based MOBIKE has withdrawn from the scheme. Zoomcar is not operational and Yulu is providing rental service in big societies like Magarpatta. They conveyed to the PMC about their withdrawal. Now, the department has handed the scheme over to the Road department.” V G Kulkarni, chief superintendent of the Road department, said, “There is no officer who has been given charge of the bicycle sharing scheme. Earlier, the scheme was handled by the traffic planning department.” Ranjit Gadgil of Parisar, an NGO and a member of the Bicycle Advisory committee of PMC’s comprehensive bicycle plan and non-motorised transport, said, “At present, only Yulu is providing rental cycle service in closed areas like big societies. He further added, “PMC should start a bicycle scheme as there is considerable awareness among the public. We should rectify the problems. The Central government is ready to provide funds. But, there is a lack of enthusiasm in PMC. There is no dedicated department for this scheme. Therefore, the scheme is not working at present.” Cycling infrastructure scenario According to The Energy and Resource Institute’s (Teri) report, “Pedaling towards a Greener India”, - a report on promoting cycling in the country, few cities in the country have constructed/planned cycle tracks. Only Pune and Chandigarh have a wider city-level network of cycle tracks. These networks, however, have problems related to bad design, maintenance, encroachment, lighting, and enforcement. Public Bicycle Sharing scheme (PBS) Cyclists can use a mobile application to unlock and ride the cycles from different locations in the city. The user checks out a bicycle from one location, rides to his or her destination and parks it at a nearby destination. The operator coordinates the redistribution of bicycles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-s-cycle-sharing-scheme-left-orphaned-under-road-dept/story-ncz8EmXAv3QS6YxDr163kL.html
08-12-2020||Chandigarh||Study abroad consultants pin hopes on next year’s student intake||Even as students’ plans to study abroad fell flat this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, education consultants are pinning hopes on next year’s student intake.Despite Covid-19 cases spiralling, application processes to foreign universities for the 2021 academic session have begun. At the forefront are youngsters from north India who make up a large chunk of international students in countries like Canada, the UK and Australia. With businesses hit by the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, consultants in the region are hopeful of getting a good number of applications for the May and September intake next year.‘Students anxious about studies’Navneet Singh, an immigration consultant and a representative of the Association of Overseas Education Consultants here confirmed that a large number of applications were coming in. “We are getting an overwhelming response from students for next year. I think they are also anxious about studies after a year of disruptions. Admissions for next year are in full swing now.“Students have also started to travel to Canada and the UK. Australia is also hinting at allowing students to travel,” he said.Admissions for May and September intakes have started in Canada. The UK and Australia are accepting applications for the January, March and July intakes.Immigration experts say over 1 lakh youngsters from Punjab and Chandigarh fly to Australia, Canada, the UK and other destinations for studies every year. Where safety measures are concerned, many educational institutes in Canada have prepared quarantine plans for students on the basis of which they are allowed to travel, experts say. Number of applicants falls“Canada has now started issuing visas to travel. We are receiving applications from students for next year but the number is comparatively lower, which is likely to increase in the coming months,” says Jatin Wadhwa, director of a Chandigarh based international education consultancy.Rakeshwar Walia, who runs an immigration and education consultancy based in Khanna, adds, “things are slowly coming back on track and we are hoping to get good response from students for the May and September intakes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/study-abroad-consultants-pin-hopes-on-next-year-s-student-intake/story-pVvk67yXBaOymGpCqiPMwK.html
08-12-2020||Delhi||City’s F&B industry on better grounds in the third wave of the pandemic. Here’s how||The year is coming to an end and with endings come new beginnings. This is evident in the NCR’s dine-in and food delivery scene, an industry which is rebuilding itself with renewed hope. A late evening stroll in Khan Market unfurls facts about how some restaurants are planning to host guests. At Townhall, we were stopped briefly for a thermal scan and were told that only 50% of the original capacity is allowed. Inside, tables are demarcated, but even that 50% is to its max capacity. Navneet Kalra, owner, says, “Footfall is still the same, and in fact, has gone up by 15% since October-November. After the pandemic, our delivery orders have gone up by 50%.”At Public Affair, after a quick thermal scan, we are lead upstairs where both the storeys are operational, but with tables marked. The staff is wearing gloves, masks and hair nets. The tables that are kept available have bottles of sanitisers. Chatterhouse, which earlier used to have dining open on both storeys, has now limited it to first floor. The second floor is only functional as a smoking area. Staff is equipped with face shield, masks and gloves. Read: The Taste With Vir: Nothing beats the restaurant experience even after the delivery boom amid Covid-19Umang Tewari founder of Local says that business that was already affected was further dented. “The third wave of pandemic has actually brought business down by 30 percent which was anyway on lower side. We are in wait-and-watch situation currently as there is surge in cases. However, with continuous decline in last week in cases, we are hopeful that we will cover up this 30 percent decline by the end of this month.”“The footfall does not match our pre-lockdown numbers especially our indoor mall outlets. The business is badly affected there unlike our outdoor outlets at Cyber Hub and Khan Market where the numbers are similar to before. Even though our revenues are down 40% from October, the number of people dining in has been reassuring for us and we have seen an increase in takeaway orders as well. Seating capacity remains at 50%, our safety measures are as strong as before from the option of disposable cutlery, abundant sanitisers to extremely strict hygiene and safety protocols for our staff and an open kitchen concept. We have gone the extra mile to make our guests feel safe about dining in, says Varun Tuli, MD, Yum Yum Cha.The third phase has coincided with the festive season, offering some respite. Vikrant Batra founder Café Delhi Heights says, “There was a promising rise in the business, but also occasional dips, so it’s been a journey of ups and downs.”Elaborating on how the dine-in and delivery systems are supporting each other in keeping overall sales intact, Amit Bagga, co-founder Daryaganj, says,“Our sales have remained the same — the only difference being that the contribution of home deliveries has gone up. The sales have remained the same. If earlier we had 80% from dine-in and 20% from deliveries, now its 65-35%.” Read: For star chefs, pandemic pared away unnecessary flabSeeing an upward graph in sales and the number of people willing to venture out, Akshay Anand, co-founder, Ophelia, says, “Business in the third wave is definitely better than business in the first phase. Approximately 45-50% of the revenue is back and is likely to go higher in month of December. Almost 50% of the population has experienced Covid directly or indirectly and have realised that the recovery rate is really high. Our restaurants are following complete SOPs given by the government and are really safe for the diners.”Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htlifeandstyle for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/city-s-f-b-industry-on-better-grounds-in-the-third-wave-of-the-pandemic-here-s-how/story-RwjVgPjWDgIiQrKyOZlDZP.html
