Farmers’ leaders said that some of their vehicles are still stuck at the Uttarakhand border, even as the protest at the UP Gate entered the 26th day on Thursday. As more vehicles came in, the tents and tractor-trolleys have lined up from the UP Gate up to Khoda Colony on the highway while more trolleys are getting parked on the road leading from Dabur Crossing to the protest site. “We still have some issues with vehicles which are getting stopped at borders of UP-Uttarakhand and also in Udham Singh Nagar. We will speak to officials about this. People are coming in rotation to the UP Gate to attend the protest,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand. Over the developments on Thursday in Delhi when senior Congress leaders met President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking his intervention to repeal the three laws, the protesters at UP Gate reiterated that the ongoing protests at Delhi borders were purely farmers’ agitation. “They are leaders of political parties and we cannot say anything about them. We know that the agitation is purely of farmers,” Bajwa added. The district police confirmed that more tractor-trolleys arrived at the UP Gate on Wednesday. “Some vehicles arrived to join the protest on Wednesday, while others were midway and reached UP Gate from different areas. However, we are ensuring that roads do not get blocked and there is no hindrance to normal traffic movement. We are already in touch with the farmers’ leaders to ensure that protests remain peaceful,” said Gyandendra Singh, superintendent of police (city 2).The protesting farmers are demanding rollback of the Centre’s three farm laws. At least six rounds of talks between government representatives and farmers’ leaders have failed to break the deadlock as the government has proposed amendments and not inclined to repeal the laws. “For decades, our incomes have not increased and we are still producing food and soldiers. I am from a farmer’s family and protesting here while my brother is serving the Indian Army,” said Vijay Hindustani, a second-year law student from Shamli in western UP who joined the protest two days ago. Vijay is roaming bare-chested in the winter chill and displaying names of martyrs which he has got tattooed on his back. “I started getting tattooed names of martyrs on the back after the Pulwama attack on security forces. I will continue to remain at the UP Gate site till the new farm laws are repealed,” he added, while showing a sticker with words scribbled, “I love Kisan” and pasted to his chest. The stickers, of late, have become popular at the UP Gate site. The farmers said that such stickers are distributed by volunteers at every protest site. “We have pasted the sticker on our T-shirts and many such stickers are also pasted on tents, tractor-trolleys and other vehicles at the UP Gate. The sticker shows that we all are farmers though we are from different farmer organisations. I am a volunteer of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, but have pasted the sticker on my T-shirt,” said Prashant Tyagi, a youngster from Muzaffarnagar. On Thursday, a group of Buddhists also arrived at the protest site and said that they will continue to stay at the UP Gate till farmers protest goes on. “We have been to Singhu Border protest site for the past two days and now come to the UP Gate. The farmers here are carrying on peaceful protests. This is very important that the protest has remained peaceful. So, we will stay here in their support. Once, one of our groups leaves, the other will join,” said Acharya Bhikkhu Sumit Ratna, who arrived from Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/more-join-as-protest-enters-26th-day-at-up-gate/story-us7QhppRleGC93hodGuiZK.html

Officials said that multiple teams of the health department have set out for tracing theses travellers and collection of their samples. The new variant, referred to as Sars-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 (Variant Under Investigation, year 2020, month 12, variant 01), was detected in the UK earlier this month and was reported to be more transmissible.The officials of the Ghaziabad health department said that till Thursday evening, they collected samples of 41 persons while at least five teams have been deployed to get in touch with others. The officials said that they have received a list of about 200-240 travellers from the UK. However, there were signs of concern as the officials said that houses of 8-10 travellers were found locked.“These are some people whose houses were found locked by our teams, and some have even gone out of station after their return from the UK. So, We have forwarded a list of these people to our Covid control room and they will be traced with the help of the police. We have received a list which indicates that there are about 200-240 travellers from UK so far. There are some duplicity of names, and we are figuring these out,” said chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta. The UP government has already laid down a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and have laid special emphasis on tracking of those travellers who have returned from UK on December 9 or thereafter. In the SOPs, such people will mandatorily get tests done through the RT-PCR method and will stay in home quarantine. Once their tests turn positive, they will be isolated in a facility and a part of their sample will also be sent for genome sequencing to figure out if they are infected with the latest variant of the virus, VUI-202012/01. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said, “The travellers whose houses were found locked will be traced immediately through the electronic surveillance by the police. We have already asked our two Covid hospitals to come up with separate isolation wards for travellers and similar directions have also been given to private hospitals in case the travellers wish to get admitted to private hospitals. If anyone is found infected with the new variant, they will not be allowed home isolation even if they are asymptomatic,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar, said that all the travellers have been identified in the district and teams were working on priority basis for their sample collection. District health officials said that they identified a list of 425 travellers till Thursday evening who have arrived from UK to the district since November 23. “The collection of sampling is taken up on priority basis. We have 12 teams which are out in field for sample collection. The sample collection work will continue till late night,” said Dr Sunil Dohre, district surveillance officer, GB Nagar. Even the state government officials said that they are focussing on testing of travellers who have returned from UK so that any spread of new variant is kept under control. “It is mandatory for those who returned from UK on or after December 9 to get their RT-PCR test done. They can take up tests at the nearest testing centre or can contact the control room or the chief medical officer. This variant is known to spread fast and we do not want it to spread in the state. In case the RT-PCR test is negative for such travellers, they will still need to remain home quarantine for at least one week,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health). “Even those who have returned from European countries and showing symptoms, should also take up RT-PCR test at the earliest,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/sample-collection-of-travellers-from-uk-initiated-on-priority-in-ghaziabad-and-noida/story-nJf1XbJS2e3Hifl6J7t5XI.html

The first such session was held on Thursday when Delhi Director Education Udit Prakash interacted with 60 students of classes 9th to 12th at a school in Kalkaji. The session was streamed live on YouTube where more than 5000 students watched it live.During the interaction, Prakash, an IAS officer, shared his experiences during the UPSC exam preparation and gave tips to the students. He said that he had decided to become an IAS officer after class 10. “People think that IAS/IPS officers are from different planets as they have cleared a very difficult exam. But, it’s not like that. I was a normal student like everyone else… Delhi government schools students are very hardworking and have the potential to excel in civil services exam. The program has been started to develop students’ understanding about the exam,” he said.Delhi education Minister Manish Sisodia also attended the session. “All the young UPSC aspirants should also dream about what they want to do after becoming an IAS/IPS officer. They should set a dream to serve a larger purpose, whether it’s about developing rural India or eradicating corruption or removing hatred and violence from the society.

24-12-2020||City||Ensure no panic over HSRPs: HC tells govt||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday asked the Delhi government to ensure that no panic is created among the people for obtaining the colour coded fuel stickers and high security registration plates (HSRP).A bench of justice Siddharth Mridul and justice Talwant Singh, while hearing a plea by the president of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, Anil Kumar, alleging that the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) were overcharging for the colour coded fuel stickers and HSRPs that have been made mandatory for vehicles in the national capital. The bench suggested that the Delhi government should give more time to people to get the stickers before imposing a fine of Rs 5,500 for violations.“We are concerned that it should not lead to any panic. We are only concerned about the fact that people should get adequate time and they should not be made to queue up for this,” the court said.The judges said even they were clueless about the requirement of the stickers and asked additional standing counsel Satyakam to come with “detailed instructions” regarding steps taken by the Delhi government to publicise the stickers and HSRP.The court asked them to clarify their stand on the fact that why were the vendors charging ten times the original price fixed by the Delhi government in 2012. The Delhi government had in August made it mandatory for the vehicle owners in Delhi to have a high-security registration plate (HSRP) and a colour coded sticker to determine its engine and fuel type. The court, on Thursday, sought to know from government’s counsel Satyakam as to who decided to outsource the sale of stickers and HSRP to OEMs and whether more time ought to be given to people to obtain the stickers and HSRP before starting to fine them for lack of the same.Satyakam, during the hearing, told the bench that the Delhi government has nothing to do with fixing the rate of the stickers and HSRP and it was only concerned with implementing the Supreme Court directions that all vehicles should have HSRP and the stickers. He said the Centre had fixed the rates and added that the concept of stickers was introduced only in 2018 by the apex court.However, advocate Sunil Fernandes, representing the petitioner, showed the court an April 2012 public notice issued by Delhi government indicating rates of the HSRP sets and individual stickers. He said the concept of stickers was already there and the only difference was the apex court direction in 2018 to make them colour coded according to the fuel used.Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Wednesday held a meeting with officials of the transport department, Society of Indian Automobile manufacturers (SIAM), HSRP manufacturers and suppliers, Federation of Automobile Dealers association and major OEMs. He asked all stakeholders to provide unique reference numbers to complaints related affixation of HSRPs. According to the plea, the manner in which the Delhi government was implementing Supreme Court orders for HSRP and colour coded fuel stickers would lead to a loss of around Rs 342 crore to the people of the national capital. It said that the notified fee for a colour coded sticker is Rs 12.15 and for a complete HSRP set, including the sticker, it is Rs 213.24.However, the OEMs were charging customers Rs 141.60 (tax not included) and Rs 991.20 for the sticker and the HSRP set, respectively, the petition has claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ensure-no-panic-over-hsrps-hc-tells-govt/story-I0WrZV84NP8PM2mFhygtbL.html

In September, a few villagers had stepped forward to sell their land, but the proposals were rejected due to the high rates quoted by them.Now, MC has again issued a public notice inviting villagers to sell their land situated near Sidhwan Canal, Sirhind Canal or Ludhiana-Ambala GT Road. Those interested can submit their quotations with MC joint commissioner Kulpreet Singh at MC’s Zone-D office till January 15, 2021.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “We are looking for suitable sites and meetings had also been conducted with villagers in the past.

24-12-2020||City||The year of the pandemic: The year lecture halls came home in Ludhiana||The year 2020 saw institutes of higher education take lecture halls to students’ homes in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, with authorities switching to zoom classes, holding virtual counselling and arranging for online exams. However, the journey was not without hiccups with a section of students facing trouble accessing online classes in the absence of smartphones and laptops and shaky internet connections. College authorities also received a poor response from students during the online registration process for undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Financial difficulties caused due to the pandemic sadly forced many students to drop out. June saw colleges reopen for staff. However, two lecturers tested positive in different institutions soon after, forcing one of the institutions to shut down as a precautionary measure. Hostels have also remained closed since the lockdown and the facility has not been offered to freshers. Regular classes were started for final year students in November, however, poor attendence was recorded in most government and private institutions. Teachers were seen taking physical and online class simultaneously with the help of laptops at government colleges. Many private colleges continued with online classes as Covid cases were surging in the district. As per directions from varsities, college authorities got their staff and students tested for Covid before reopening. Though it remains uncertain when students will start attending regular classes, the new building government college building in Ludhiana east will be completed by February. In July, authorities had decided to defer the Panjab University Youth and Heritage Festival amid surging Covid cases. The festival will now be held in November However, in November, it was decided the festival will be conducted in February 2021 after the final exams. Only solo performances and participation will be allowed in all contests be it music or fine arts. HIGHSStudents clinched top positions at PUFinal-year students from different Ludhiana-based colleges bagged the top positions in Panjab University (PU). Palak Dewan of Sri Aurbindo College of Commerce, a bachelor of commerce student, topped the varsity with 3,254 out of 3,700 marks. Another student of the same college, Nikita Jain, secured 2,925 out of 3,400, topping PU in the bachelor of business administration course. Anchal Bhardwaj of Arya College, girls section, secured the first position in humanities. She secured a near-perfect 2,101 out of 2,400.Girls extend a helping hand to Covid warriors In a bid to help those on the frontline in the battle against Covid, girls studying at Industrial Training Institutes stitched four-layered washable masks from their houses. The masks were distributed among workers of the district administration, healthcare workers, municipal corporation employees, police, asha and anganwadi workers, panchayats, farmers, migrant labourers.Virtual job fairWith shortage of workers almost bringing industries to a standstill, the Government Industrial Training Institute (ITI), Gill Road, organised a virtual fair to augment the manpower shortage. LowsFew enrolments in rural areasColleges affiliated to Panjab University (PU) report more vacant seats than any other year. Though the varsity extended the last date of admission to August 31 to give more time to students to enrol themselves in undergraduate courses, authorities said the situation hardly improved. Students desirous of studying in government colleges, which already have a low fee structure,have requested authorities to collect fee in instalments. Despite concessions, the seats remain vacant.Unfinished government college building Almost three years after laying the foundation stone of the new building at Government College, Ludhiana (East), around 20% construction work still remains pending. The building stands opposite Vardhman Mill on Chandigarh Road. Construction work had been delayed due to the pandemic. In June, work came to a halt due to paucity of funds. Work on a multi-purpose hall, canteen, and landscaping will be completed over the next three months. Colleges discontinue PG courses Five private colleges, affiliated to Panjab University, have stopped offering postgraduate courses for this academic session due to few takers. College principals said due to financial constraints amid the pandemic, many students have not applied for masters courses this year. Courses such as masters in Punjabi and Hindi and postgraduate diploma in computer applications seem to be losing their sheen. Students are opting to pursue masters in business administration, masters in commerce and other skill-based courses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/the-year-of-the-pandemic-the-year-lecture-halls-came-home-in-ludhiana/story-tGsppjLrfoz6ie7grZKlgI.html
24-12-2020||Gurugram||Regional transport authority to take measures to reduce road fatalities||The regional transport authority (RTA) has asked the police to share details of all accidents across the city to analyse the average response time in each case. Officials privy to the matter said they want to calculate the time taken by an ambulance to reach a spot or for an accident victim to get first-aid. In many cases, victims die due to excessive bleeding and not receiving timely medical help. As per the data, it takes 18 minutes on an average for a road accident victim to get medical aid. RTA officials say that this time should reduce to at least 12 minutes. Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA, Gurugram, said that they are trying to increase the chances of survival of road accident victims with the timely medical help. According to medical experts, the initial hour of the accident is considered as the “golden hour” and a delay of even a few minutes could prove to be fatal in some cases. In most of the accidents cases, people die due to excessive bleeding. Cutting down the time for ambulances to reach accident spot can help in reducing the number of fatalities. In case of an accident, an ambulance usually comes from Civil Hospital or the trauma centre after receiving a call on 108. “We have asked the health department to cut short the response time and bring it down to 10-12 minutes,” said Yadav, adding that she has also asked the health department to tie-up with the private hospitals in the city and work out some arrangement under which the nearest private hospital can send its ambulance. This will considerably cut shot the response time,” she said. Gurugram has a large number of private hospitals and these are located in almost every part of the district. Therefore, the nearest private hospital is in the best position to provide medical help to road accident victims, said RTA officials. Private hospitals, along with private ambulance operators, together own around 500 ambulances in the city. People usually call on 108 or 100 (police control room) to report accidents and these calls go to the Civil Hospital from where an ambulance leaves for the accident victim. Many times, victims are taken to the nearest trauma centres of multi-specialty hospitals “We will have to work out some system under which even a private hospital can get notification about an accident,” Yadav said. In some cases, the victims are taken to the nearest private hospital from the accident spot, but private hospitals do not keep record of it. “Private hospitals should alert the health officials after admitting any accident victim. At present, they are only informing the nearest police station,” said Yadav adding that she has asked the health officials to prepare records of time lapse between road accidents and death of victims and find out ways to reduce the response time. Dr MP Singh, deputy civil surgeon and head of the referral transport unit of Civil Hospital, said they have 24 ambulances out of which five are equipped with advanced life support system, 11 have basic life support, six are patient transport ambulances and two are for children. “We dispatch ambulance soon after receiving a call. The time to reach the accident spot depends on the traffic and distance. We will work towards improving the response time,” said Singh. With an aim to reduce road fatalities in year 2021, the Gurugram Police jointly with the local authorities will start several campaigns in the city, starting January. They have decided to start more road safety campaigns and involve all government agencies, including the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, the NHAI and the Haryana Sahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). They will start publicity campaigns highlighting the dangers of erratic lane changes and the need for stricter police enforcement, said the police. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that the police personnel are mostly the first who can utilise the golden hour and immediately give first aid to the victim.

The first aid training (among traffic police) is rudimentary as it does not train its personnel to provide emergency medical treatment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/regional-transport-authority-to-take-measures-to-reduce-road-fatalities/story-Ngtf9l7iGGMupEleAhZIjO.html

Since then, they have been protesting at Jaisinghpur Khera, located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district, at the Rajasthan-Haryana border, for the past 12 days. Due to the farmers’ protest, one carriageway of the Delhi-Jaipur national highway has remained closed since December 13.Addressing a press conference from the protest site on Thursday, farmers’ leaders said that they would start proceeding towards Delhi around 1pm on Friday. “Farmers have been protesting for many days and demanding that the new farm laws are repealed. They want the minimum support price (MSP) for crops guaranteed. Today, farmers’ groups announced that they will proceed towards Delhi from tomorrow afternoon. They will not return to their villages until their demands are met. In order to amplify their voices, they are prepared to surround Delhi,” said Sanjay Madhav, member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan.Santveer Singh Mohanpura, a farmer leader from Shri Ganganagar in Rajasthan, said that the goal of farmers was to proceed towards Delhi since Day One, but the Haryana police had been preventing them from doing so. “We want to go to Delhi. If the government prevents us from moving towards Delhi, the government will be responsible for its actions. If the government stops us, it will be accountable for any inconvenience that the public might face because of our movement,” said Mohanpura.He added that farmers are standing firm on their demands and would not back down till the three laws are repealed. “We will not talk about amendments. The government needs to roll back the laws,” said Mohanpura.Vijoo Krishnan, joint secretary of All India Kisan Sabha, the agricultural arm of the CPI(M), said that there had been multiple attempts to discredit the ongoing farmers’ agitation, but farmers will not back down. “Our demands need a solution. These bills are anti-farmer and will benefit corporations. Since November 26, when the Dilli Chalo movement was started, the Modi government has adopted an arrogant stance. The government will eventually bend to the farmers,” said Krishnan.Abhishek Jorwal, superintendent of police (Rewari), said that the police are keeping a vigil and wouldn’t allow farmers to cross the border. “There is heavy police deployment on the stretch. We will not let farmers cross the border,” said Jorwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-on-highway-to-march-to-delhi-will-not-allow-it-say-police/story-hEs4ZzlCTGytZN2m6HJPPI.html
24-12-2020||Gurugram||HSPCB issues order to shut down cement mixing plants in view of deteriorating air quality||The Haryana State Pollution Control Board’s (HSPCB) regional office issued orders on Thursday to shut down all hot mix plants in Gururgam until January 2, in view of the deteriorating air quality across Delhi-NCR. Commonly used in construction work and road laying, hot mix plants (also known as cement mixers or drum mixers) are used to mix construction material, such as concrete, sand, gravel and other aggregates. Following instructions issued a day earlier by the Central Pollution Control Board(CPCB), the HSPCB also called for departments concerned to step up frequency of road-sweeping and water sprinkling at locations that are prone to accumulation of dust.Shakti Singh, the HSPCB’s regional officer and nodal officer for Grap compliance in Gurugram, did not specify where these measures will be stepped up. However, he said, “We will be issuing directions to the MCG, department of town and country planning and so on and asking them to step up dust mitigation measures. We will also ask them to inspect construction sites for any violations of Grap rules.”Air quality in the city, however, remained in the “very poor” category of the AQI even as other major cities in Delhi-NCR veered into the “severe” category. Gurugram recorded 361 on the CPCB’s daily air quality bulletin, up from 340 the day prior. Meanwhile Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad and even Faridabad recorded a second consecutive day of “severe” air on Thursday, prompting the CPCB to issue directives to all major NCR towns.Experts said that Gurugram’s lower AQI is likely due to favourable wind speed and direction. “Northwesterly winds are blowing at a pace between eight to ten kilometres per hour, which may be causing eastward movement of pollutants away from Gurugram and into the capital city and beyond,” said Sachin Panwar, a city based air quality scientist.As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality is likely to remain in very poor category on 25.12.2020 and 26.12.2020. Surface winds are likely to remain light and ventilation will be poor resulting in deterioration in air quality... The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from Northwest direction of Delhi with wind speed 08-12 kmph, mainly clear sky and moderate to dense fog in the morning on 25.12.2020.”The city recorded a maximum temperature of 22.3 degrees Celsius on Thursday (same as the previous day), while the minimum temperature stood at 6 degrees Celsius — one degree less than the previous day. As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city, minimum temperature will drop to 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the week, while maximum will drop to 16 degrees Celsius. Generally cloudy skies are expected to prevail, while mornings will be dense with fog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hspcb-issues-order-to-shut-down-cement-mixing-plants-in-view-of-deteriorating-air-quality/story-luyXS8S06pAwlwd6ylhLVI.html
24-12-2020||Gurugram||Car parks, area increase will boost affordable housing, say experts||The decision to increase the area of affordable housing projects and allow car parks will boost affordable housing in the state, said realtors engaged in developing such housing. The government on Wednesday amended the affordable housing policy of 2013 to boost supply, create more commercial components, like shops, and make it attractive for buyers.As per the amendments, the maximum area has been increased from 10 acres to 30 acres while the minimum area has been reduced from five to four acres, with the caveat that the size of the community building will not be reduced. Under the amended policy, the commercial area, where shops and other facilities can be set up, has been increased from 4% to 8% of the net planned area.An important change that has been incorporated by the government, which has been a long-standing demand of developers, is that they will be allowed to provide one car park space for each unit and the rate would not be more than 5% of the cost of flat against such an allotment, a government official said.City-based real estate developers, consultants and experts said that the amendments will give a major boost to affordable housing, as bottlenecks in supply will be removed and a large majority of buyers who refrained from purchasing houses due to lack of parking would now be more enthused.Vinod Behl, a city-based real estate expert, said that the amended policy will ensure continuity in the recent uptick in demand after a lull due to Covid. A tripling of the project size limit and reduction in lower area limit will give supply a push, he said. “The provisions for car park space and additional commercial space for convenience shopping within the housing complex will boost demand side of affordable housing,” he said.Gurugram has the largest number of affordable housing projects in the state and around 80 projects are in various stages of development. Given the interest shown by homebuyers, the department of town and country planning has been taking several measures to increase the availability of such units and taking steps to streamline the process.Pankaj Bajaj, president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI), NCR, said that the existing affordable projects in Haryana would have faced parking shortage, just like DDA developments in Delhi during the 1970s and 1980s. “It was thought that the middle class uses only two-wheelers or public transport. This is not really true, especially in post-covid times,” he said.Pradeep Aggarwal, managing director, Signature Group, said that developers would be able to increase the area of a project and space for a car park would boost projects. “The reduction of area limit for from five acres to four acres will be benefitting many developers and will give a boost to affordable housing,” he said.Sanjiv Mann, the senior town planner, Gurugram, said that a notification for the changes would be issued soon. “These changes would give a boost to this segment and help buyers get more affordable houses,” he said.Rajat Goel, joint managing director, MRG World, said that this was the only segment that saw maximum sales and the maximum number of new launches in 2020, as 70% of the all the launches this year were in the affordable segment. “The margin for developers will also improve and supply will also get a boost,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/car-parks-area-increase-will-boost-affordable-housing-say-experts/story-v9HPKEVbWcmBNDcnpmJusI.html

Of these, at least 438 travellers — including 113 travellers as reported by HT on Thursday — arrived after December 9 and over 257 people arrived between November 25 and December 8.“Following the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the union ministry of health and family welfare, our teams have started following up with the people having recent travel history to the UK,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.“Some might have completed their 14 days of the infection cycle. Teams will be contacting them to self-monitor themselves for symptoms like fever, cough, cold and difficulty in breathing,” said Yadav. According to him, they will be followed up through calls or visits by the rapid response teams.Passengers who arrived before December 9 will also be contacted by the teams, said officials. “They will be tested too if they develop any influenza-like illness for 28 days from the date of their arrival from the UK. They will be tested through Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and their samples will be sent to CSIR – Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi,” said Yadav.People testing positive will be isolated at an institutional facility set up at a PG in Sector 22. “It will be the designated facility for travellers who test positive. They will have to stay at the facility until their genome sequence results are declared,” said the chief medical officer, adding that state government will issue further directives for the surveillance of UK returnees.As per the guideline, if the gene sequencing remains consistent with the current SARS-CoV-2 genome circulating, then the positive patient can be allowed home isolation. But if the genomic sequencing indicates the presence of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant, then the patient will continue to remain in a separate isolation unit. The person will be tested on the 14th day of infection. In case sample tests positive, isolation will continue until two consecutive samples taken within 24 hours test negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/around-700-uk-returnees-on-district-admin-radar/story-h0edvcrUP5yV75SOcbY5mL.html
24-12-2020||Gurugram||Antigen testing camps increased in key areas||Despite an ongoing slowdown in the number of daily Covid-19 cases emerging from the district, the health department has decided to increase the number of antigen testing camps in key areas, as a pre-emptive move to stay ahead of the spread of SARS-Cov-2. From 98 testing camps organised in the nine days leading to December 22, a total of 128 camps will be held in the subsequent nine days until December 31, according to data shared by the health department.Moreover, antigen tests will now be deployed across 31 healthcare blocks, as opposed to just 27 earlier. The new locations include Ghangola, Bhora Kalan, Kasan and Rajendra Park, where antigen camps were earlier put on hold in view of the decreasing positivity rate in these areas. The majority of upcoming antigen camps, meanwhile, have been organised in areas like Haily Mandi, Badshahpur, Mullahera and Sohna, from where a high number of Covid-19 infections are usually reported, due to dense population in these areas. While officials did not specify whether a higher positivity has been observed in these regions of late, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gururgam, said, “We decide the locations of antigen camps based on weekly analysis of testing data from PHCs and UPHCs. The reason we have increased the camps in certain places is to stay ahead of the spread of the illness. In our experience, it is not a good strategy to relax testing even if the growth rate is decreasing. If antigen positivity in a particular region shows an uptick, it will allow us to plan accordingly to prevent another surge of cases in that area.”A medical officer with the health department, requesting anonymity, said that this step is presently intended to serve as a surveillance tool. “While we are not facing any surge in cases at present, antigen camps have been useful in helping us identify where clusters of infections are present. It is important to keep testing up in these regions. Take Bhangrola for example. We have not conducted any camp there in the last few days because the situation improved. But we will now return there to see if the situation has changed. These are also areas where people are reliant on public healthcare,” the officer said. Meanwhile, officials said that they plan to continue conducting at least 4,000 RT-PCR tests in the district each day, along with about 600 antigen tests. “We were, until recently, conducting between 6,000 and 10,000 tests per day, but seeing the decline in positivity rate, 4,000 tests is now an optimum number,” said Dr Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/antigen-testing-camps-increased-in-key-areas/story-fv2sSVWBgJLmBuq5B6IqqN.html

The high court bench of justice Lisa Gill, said the state should respond by the next date of hearing, otherwise, it would consider issue of some relief to the petitioner driver, on the adjourned date of December 29. The petition was taken up on December 23 and adjourned for December 24 on state counsel’s request to get instructions. However, on Thursday the state failed to respond. The petitioner, Panna Lal, who is a driver with sub-division officer (civil), Hansi in Hisar, was terminated from services on December 15 for posting against the deputy chief minister. As per the plea, his services were terminated after the SDO (civil) received a Whatsapp message about the alleged post made by him on December 11. Lal, a contractual employee, had told the court that he was terminated without being given an opportunity of personal hearing and without following the principles of natural justice. He was appointed a driver on contract basis under outsourcing policy of the government in 2018 and his services were extended from time to time. His services were appreciated by the officer and awarded appreciation certificate on January 26, the plea says. He had told court that the posts in question against the deputy chief minister were made by someone else and not by him and that too in 2018-2019, when he was not even a deputy chief minister. He had sought from court that the termination order be set aside and till the time the petition is pending, it be stayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/driver-sacked-for-post-against-haryana-deputy-chief-minister-hc-puts-state-on-notice/story-lM740AqZ8fFD5T3AfY4lfN.html

In his presence, we recovered 20 bags of Doda chura weighing nearly 398.150 kg and a huge amount of onion on the other side of the truck. A joint team of CIA and police had recovered 414kg Doda chura from Jagroop, a resident of Jind’s Palwan and recovered the truck. The next day, police arrested his accomplice Rakesh Kumar of Karnal for the drug smuggling case,” the DSP added.The DSP said the cops had deposited only 414kg contraband in treasury amount and did not unload 398.150 kg contraband from the truck and not shown in the treasury.“This is a serious crime done by the cops and drug peddlers. We have booked both the assistant sub-inspectors posted at Jind CIA-1, both drug peddlers and few unknown policemen under section 15(3), section 25, 29, 59 of the NDPS Act. We have started an investigation into the matter to ascertain the role of other cops in the drug smuggling network. It is a matter of probe that the investigation officers did not deposit the entire contraband in the treasury and parked a truck with 398.150 kg Doda chura at Uchana police station. Prime facie it appears that the cops and drug peddlers were aiming to gain a huge amount from the remaining contraband,” the DSP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-cops-booked-for-drug-smuggling-in-jind/story-XHI0rsOVi52mx9UH7dKpsJ.html

Another group of farmers shouted slogans against Chautala at Karsindhu village and dared him not to visit Bangar belt (consisting Jind, some part of Kaithal, Hisar and few parts of Bhiwani) of Haryana as he failed to stand with them against the Centre’s three farm laws.As per district officials, Chautala was expected to visit Karsindhu village to participate in an informal function.Azad Palwan, a farmer leader, said they vandalised the helipad area as Chautala failed to extend his support to the farmers protest. “We had announced a boycott of BJP-JJP leaders supporting the Haryana government in our villages and will show them black flags if they try to enter. We had elected him so that he could protect farmers’ rights but he failed to do so. He is sitting in the BJP’s lap for his personal interest and has no sympathy with agitating farmers,” he added.Another farmer leader, Krishan Kumar, said Chautala is the ‘biggest liar’ and he used farmers’ votes to gain political benefit. “His great grandfather Devi Lal, who was former deputy prime minister had chosen farmers over ‘kursi’ (chair) but Dushyant has preferred ‘kursi’ over farmers. We had never expected he would use our vote to gain personal benefits. We will allow Chautala’s entry in our villages after he will quit the government to support us,” he added.Farmers boycott Naina Chautala, Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Farmers under the banner of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) and various organisations have announced social boycott of Dushyant’s mother and Badhra MLA Naina Chautala and Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh in villages of Dadri district. Ranbir Fouji, a panchayat representative, said they held a panchayat of farmers at Dadri and decided to ban the entry of Naina Chautala and BJP MP Dharambir Singh in their villages. “We will gherao their residences too,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dushyant-chautala-cancels-jind-event-after-farmers-dug-up-helipad-area/story-DLRBDHtSepnPWXCSTgLMkJ.html

The facility is away from the main Covid-19 wards in the hospital.As per reports, the two passengers from the UK landed in Delhi on Tuesday and further travelled to Punjab and Andhra Pradesh despite testing positive for the coronavirus disease.One of the passengers, Mary Winfred Ann Parrie, is a private school teacher from Rajahmundry city in Andhra Pradesh. She tested positive at the Delhi airport health centre and was further handed over to the Safdarjung Hospital. However, Ann Parie fled from the hospital and reached Rajahmundry via train in the wee hours on Thursday, reports said.According to news agency PTI, the passengers have been traced and “brought back” to Delhi.On being asked about these two incidents at a press briefing, the Delhi health minister said, “Flight operations and security is under the airport authorities... but, a person who has tested positive, should not have moved out. ”Jain had said on Wednesday that those arriving in Delhi from the UK in the last few weeks, were being rigorously traced, and tested if anyone is showing slightest of coronavirus-like symptoms.“The Delhi government is on alert in the wake of a mutated coronavirus strain detected in the UK. The situation is being closely monitored, as this strain is more transmissible,” he said.The national capital logged 871 fresh coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours which pushed the overall tally to nearly 620,000.

24-12-2020||Chandigarh||Private university in HP sold 45,000 fake degrees, reveals SIT probe||A special investigating team (SIT) comprising officials from the income tax department, enforcement directorate, Himachal Police and crime investigation department (CID) have unearthed evidence in an education scam of Solan- based private university, Manav Bharti (MBU), selling more than 45,000 fake degrees.“The number of fake degrees can vary. We presume it’s much higher. It’s a very well organised racket which was being run for the last one decade,” said additional director general (ADG) of police,” CID, N Venugopal, on Thursday.The probe revealed that each degree related to technical subjects was sold to students within and outside Himachal Pradesh (HP) for ₹1 lakh to ₹3 lakh, he added.The SIT team also rounded up a Jammu based agent of the university who struck deals locally for selling the fake degrees. The sleuths found that the manager of MBU sold degrees outside the state through ‘agents’ who in return got handsome commissions. In a majority of cases the buyers paid cash for degrees to these agents who provided details of the candidates to the university for making the fake degrees. SIT sent sleuths to seven different states, including Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. Visits were also made to Jammu, Delhi, Chandigarh and Kashmir to trace the whereabouts of the agents.MBU, the probe found, enrolled more than 95,000 students in different courses. Arrests madeThe SIT in June arrested MBU chairman Raj Kumar Rana after the HP high court refused to grant him anticipatory bail. ​​Rana was arrested on the court premises as soon as his bail plea was rejected. ​He was taken to Solan for interrogation. Earlier in that week,SIT had arrested a former registrar of the university, KK Singh. Two university officials, registrar Anupama Thakur and assistant registrar Munish Goel, were arrested in March. ​The fake degree scam was unearthed in February this year after the University Grants Commission (UGC) received an anonymous complaint about the alleged sale of more than five lakh degrees by two private universities in HP, MBU in Solan and APG in Shimla. ​The UGC then apprised the state government of the matter and sought appropriate action against the institutes.A case under sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the university officials for cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy on March 3. MBU was established in 2009 under the HP Private University (Establishment & Regulation) Act and is owned by the Manav Bharti Charitable Trust.​||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/private-university-in-hp-sold-45-000-fake-degrees-reveals-sit-probe/story-TxIjKVOAHfCnwz5BhqjmYP.html

24-12-2020||Dehradun||Four-year-old tigress translocated from Corbett National Park to Rajaji||A four-year-old tigress was on Thursday translocated from Corbett National Park as part of a project to repopulate Rajaji Tiger Reserve’s western part. The reserve that is home to two tigresses, who have not bred for almost a decade, is located around 150 km from the park in Uttarakhand.The Centre approved the tiger translocation to the reserve in 2016. Five tigers, including three females, will be translocated there from Corbett Tiger Reserve.Uttarakhand’s chief wildlife warden JS Suhag said the four-year-old tigress was tranquillised and radio-collared at Corbett on Wednesday and translocated in an ambulance overnight. “It was released in a temporary enclosure in the Motichur Range of Rajaji Tiger Reserve in the early morning hours of Thursday.”Also Read: Third elephant radio-collared in Uttarakhand“This is the first tigress to be translocated in Uttarakhand and has been released in an enclosure. We are monitoring its health. It takes time for an animal to get accustomed to the new environment or else it could suffer trauma... The translocated tigress is completely healthy.”He said two veterinary officers monitored the health of the tigress during the transportation process. “There was also provision for oxygen supply,” said Suhag. He added two other forest staff members were also present in the ambulance used for translocation.DK Singh, director of Rajaji Tiger Reserve, said, “We will be monitoring the health status of the tigress for a few days in the temporary enclosure before releasing it in the wild.” He added after its release, the tigress’ movements will be monitored. Singh said another tiger will be translocated within a few weeks.A National Tiger Conservation Authority team in September 2019 visited Rajaji to conduct reconnaissance for the translocation exercise and suggested a soft release of a pair of tigers in the reserve’s western side. A soft release means that tigers are released in a large enclosed area where they are kept for a few days to monitor their health before they are released in the wild.Rajaji Tiger Reserve has around 37 tigers and only two tigresses in its western part spread over 570 sq km. The reserve has a capacity for 83 tigers. The reserve’s eastern and the western part are divided by a busy traffic corridor, making it difficult for the tigers to move between the two parts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/tigress-translocated-from-corbett-to-rajaji/story-28DLyP9KUK4rSC44849JvK.html
24-12-2020||Pune||Pune Police do not give permission for Elgar Parishad to be held||The Pune Police have denied the Elgar Parishad conclave permission to be held.The conclave was scheduled to take place at the Ganesh Kala Krida Manch on December 31 from 2 pm to 7 pm. The police have rejected permission on the grounds of Covid-19 restrictions. “We have denied permission to the organisers to hold such event in view of Covid situation and law and order,” said Pune Commissioner of Police Amitabh Gupta. The Akhil Bharitya Brahman Mahsangh had requested the city police to be “extremely restrained” while considering at request, moved by retired high court judge Justice B G Kolse Patil, seeking permission for the Elgar Parishad. Besides Patil, several activists had also applied for permission for the conference. When contacted, Patil’s number was answered by an attendant who said that he was addressing a gathering. The former judge had claimed that the venue fees of Rs 40,000 had already been paid. He had said that he had already booked the hall, paid the charges and sought permission from the police for holding the meet. “If the police don’t give us permission, then we will go to the high court to seek permission,” Kolse Patil had said. Retired Supreme Court judge PB Sawant and retired justice Kolse Patil were the conveners of the Elgar Parishad held on December 31, 2017. The next day, violence broke out in the village of Bhima Koregaon on the occasion of the bicentenary of the 1818 Battle of Koregaon Bhima. According to the chargesheet, Maoist forces were behind organising the conclave and funded the meet. As many as 14 academics and activists have been arrested across the country for suspected Maoist links in connection with the case, which has been taken over by the NIA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-police-do-not-give-permission-for-elgar-parishad-to-be-held/story-foTcko6zmYYB1B0GDsq0dL.html
24-12-2020||Pune||‘In 3-to-5 years, fringe areas can be developed; PMC can generate ₹10 cr in 10 years’||PUNE Kunal Kumar is joint secretary and mission director (Smart Cities Mission), Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India, since May 2018. Earlier, he was municipal commissioner at the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), for close to four years. What do you think of the 23 villages being merged into the PMC? I don’t think there is a need for inclusion of areas in PMC. I think, Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA), PMC and Pimpri-chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) should decide whether to merge areas or not. If they are in need of merger, they (three agencies) should have to do a revenue analysis. PMRDA, PMC and PCMC should combine to take view of development in these areas. In fact, PMRDA already exists and is doing development work. Why should merge 23 areas in PMC? There should be a governing council of PMRDA, PCMC, and PMC, Pune Smart City development Corporation (PCDCL) and Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal (PMPML) for the development of the entire Pune region. How can PMC generate revenue for the development of these 23 areas? There are multiple options to generate revenue. First, PMC should identify lands in the 23 areas which have good potential to generate revenue. There is a chance of generation of revenue by joint ventures with private players. Land monetisation will not be done by selling land, but creating infrastructure involving private parties, which can pay back the private parties as well as the corporation. PMC can develop infrastructure by utilising existing taxpayer contributions. As the corporation will get revenue after one or two years from the inclusive areas, it should have to formulate the right capital investment plan. Parking charges, allowing four Floor Space Index (FSI) in transit oriented development (ToD) around metro stations area, and generate money by implementing river-front development projects and monetising open areas on the river side. What do you think about municipal bonds to generate revenue for development? Yes, it is a feasible option to raise money through municipal bonds. But, there should be appropriate tax revenue analysis so that repayment can be done. How much revenue can be generated? Under the parking policy which I had introduced during my tenure, it generated Rs 200 to Rs 250 crore. After implementing riverfront development projects, corporations can monetise land along the riverside. It will give Rs 2,000 crore to PMC. People are living in fringe areas because they don’t get affordable housing. If the city uses 4 FSI in TOD development along the metro corridor, high-rises will come up where the corporation can allow flat sizes varying from 300, to 500, and 1,000 square feet. PMC will get revenue as people buy affordable houses. Metro project has the capacity to generate Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 4,000 crore in 10 years. Corporation has the capacity to generate around Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 12,000 crore in a span of 10 years. How many years to develop the 23 fringe areas? Development can be done in three to five years. But time will depend on the administrative capacity and political will power. I think corporations should set priorities. PMC should provide water and sanitation in the first phase. After that, PMC should provide public transport. The corporation should develop drainage and underground work then start a road network. It should charge for collection and disposal of garbage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/in-3-to-5-years-fringe-areas-can-be-developed-pmc-can-generate-10-cr-in-10-years/story-n6OcPuxNM9HRaeBrFMRQoK.html

This move by PMC to recover the property tax proved effective as 81 defaulters paid dues after which their properties were released, according to PMC officials. There are still 126 sealed properties with dues remaining to be settled. These sealed properties are from the various parts of the city. In order to recover the property tax from defaulters, the PMC had launched an amnesty scheme from October 2 this year. The scheme has been extended until January 26, 2020 as the civic body received a good response with many taking benefit and paying their dues. When the scheme was launched it offered an 80 per cent discount on the penalty amount if the dues were paid by November 30. Now, in the extended duration of the scheme period, citizens who pay their dues by December 31 will get a benefit of a 75 per cent rebate on the penalty amount. Citizens who pay the tax between January 1 and January 26 will get a 70 per cent rebate on the penalty amount. The tax collection officials are positive about getting a response in the extended duration. The amnesty scheme received a good response so far from citizens. A total of 1,23,000 defaulters availed the benefit of the amnesty scheme until now. The PMC recovered 401 crore from property tax defaulters. A total of 81 properties have been released after the settlement of the property tax dues. “The defaulters still have an opportunity to get their property released. They should pay the dues as soon as possible. If the dues are not paid soon we will proceed for auction,” a PMC official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/after-pmc-seals-207-properties-81-defaulters-pay-dues/story-4uP0nDxEmZnondCSWBpNHP.html

24-12-2020||Pune||Man befriends group, shares room and dupes of Rs 5 lakh||A man was remanded to the custody of Pune police until Thursday by a local court for duping three men by posing as one of their roommates by befriending them while playing cricket. The arrested man was identified as Hrushikesh Mohan Bombale (28), a resident of Khed area of Manchar, Pune. He has two previous cases registered against him in Chandan nagar and Chikhali - both similar in nature. “He had disappeared with the phone. So, we traced him using technical analysis. We froze his account and told the manager to alert us once he comes to regain access to his account. He came there and the manager told us but he was gone by the time we could reach from Sinhagad to Hadapsar. We followed him for the next four to five days and when he switched on the stolen mobile phone, we nabbed him,” said senior police inspector Devidas Gheware of Sinhagad road police station. He was arrested on Tuesday and remanded to police custody by a local court until Thursday. The police have recovered a Honda CB Unicorn motorbike worth Rs 50,000 and a phone worth Rs 4,000 from the man. The chain worth Rs 4,50,000 weighing 150gram in gold was used by the arrested man to secure a gold loan from a private gold finance company. A complaint in the matter was lodged by Akshay Dhavade (24), a resident of Dangatnagar in Shivane who runs a garage. Dhavade told the police that he and two of his friends - Dhanba Navade and Dinesh Shalivahna - met the accused while playing cricket. The complainant’s friends had given a place to live to the accused who claimed that he was running around looking for a job and needed a place to live in June 2020. In the last six months, Bambale allegedly made the complainant and his friends trust him and help him. While Navade gave him his bike to use, Shalivahna gave him a phone to use. On December 14, the men were having tea in Shivajinagar when Bamble told the complainant that he wanted to flaunt a gold chain to his girlfriend on a video call and took his gold chain while he was already in possession of Navade’s bike and Shalivahna’s phone. He then tricked them and fled the spot after which his phone was not reachable. A case in the matter was registered on December 16.

24-12-2020||Kolkata||TMC leader questions PM’s ‘enthusiasm’ to link Tagore to Gujarat||Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Bratya Basu criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for linking Rabindranath Tagore to his home state Gujarat, saying “the great Bard” was a universal poet.“Rabindranath Tagore is a ‘viswakavi’ (universal poet). Then why is the Prime Minister so enthused on establishing his (Tagore’s) links with the state of Gujarat. It’s unfair to limit the great bard’s relevance to a particular region,” said Basu.His comments came hours after the Prime Minister addressed the centenary year celebration of Visva Bharati university in Shantiniketan, West Bengal. The university was founded by Tagore. The TMC leader also took a jibe at the Prime Minister when he said that despite talking of India’s acceptance, Modi could not practice the same, citing examples of cow vigilantism and asking if the PM could take responsibility for that.“PM claimed ‘visva’ means universal & is trying to apply that in context of acceptance in India. But can he practice this spirit of acceptance? What about cow vigilantees who beat people to death. Can he take responsibility for their actions as he preaches?” he said.Tensions between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the TMC are boiling over ahead of the crucial West Bengal assembly elections scheduled to be held during Apri-May next year. The BJP has been trying very hard to gain a strong foothold in the state’s politics. Many BJP leaders have claimed that the party will defeat TMC in next year’s Assembly election.The party won 19 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections and have even snatched one of TMC’s most prominent ex-leaders, Suvendu Adhikari. Union home minister and former BJP chief Amit Shah has scheduled several campaign rallies in the state in the months leading up to the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-leader-questions-pm-s-enthusiasm-to-link-tagore-to-gujarat/story-otluOrNSvQJHBP1Xw7b3LK.html
24-12-2020||Pune||Expanding Pune: Why merger of 23 villages pushes case for two civic corporations in Pune; cue PCMC||PUNE With the proposed merger of 23 areas – referred to as villages in the government records – into the Pune Municipal Corporation, the civic body is all set to become one of the largest municipal bodies in the state, in terms of area. According to a letter written to the urban development department by district collector Rajesh Deshmukh, the PMC area will now be responsible for 518.16 sqkm, once these 23 areas become part of Pune. With the city’s areas growing by around 187.16 sq.km from the existing 331 sq km and the addition of a population of five lakh, many believe the civic body will not be able to deal with the burden. Civic activists and senior government officials are in favour of formation of a new corporation to prevent the extra burden on the PMC. The existing Pune corporation came into being in 1950. Increasing urbanisation led to the formation of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation 32 years after that, in 1982. Mahesh Zagade, former municipal commissioner and ex-CEO of the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA), said, “A separate municipal corporation is the solution to cater to the development of the surrounding areas. There are four municipal corporations in Delhi. Here, we can also form another corporation like Pimpri-Chinchwad.” After 1982 when PCMC was formed, the city had seen rapid expansion in its population and area. From 145.92 sq km in 1985, the city’s limits grew to 243 sq km in 2001 and 331 sq km in 2017. Anita Gokhale Benninger, urban planner and executive director of the Centre for Development Studies and Activities, said there is a need for decentralisation.“Instead of a merger, the government should implement a decentralisation model for development,” Benninger said.She expressed a fear that merger may make the city like Mumbai – “haphazard”. There is an authority - PMRDA - to develop these areas. “PMRDA should carry out the development in these proposed 23 villages,” she said. With the extended area, PMC’s strength of corporators will also increase. AAs per the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, a municipal corporation with a population of over 24 lakh in its area needs to have a minimum of 145 elected corporators.Pune currently has 165 and this can now go up to 175. Vijay Kumbhar, a civic activist, said, “There is a need to form a new corporation. At present, PMC is not able to manage the villages already merged. We cannot provide facilities instantly to 23 merged villages. Under the 74th amendment of the constitution, local self -government becomes planning authority. They have the power to develop their areas. Merge means encroachment on the sovereignty of 23 areas. Merger is the centralisation of all services. Merger will help the government to create a land bank. There should be a regional plan which can reserve rights of all agencies like PMC, PCMC, and fringe villages.” According to Vivek Velankar, another civic activist, there is no problem with a merger as long as PMC makes a plan to provide basic facilities. “Water is the main problem in the existing city. What will happen if 23 villages are included in the PMC limit? How will we get extra water and from where?,” he asked. Sarang Yadwadkar, civic activist and architect, said, “Is the corporation able to mange the existing city? We are not able to develop infrastructure within the city limits. A huge area under the control of one authority is a concentration of power. Corporation should divide now. One corporation cannot take the burden of extra area.” Ramchandra Gohad, former senior official of town planning department, said, “Merger will not solve the purpose of development of 23 villages. Corporation is already under stress as 11 fringe villages merged in 2017. Corporation has a lack of manpower and revenue to provide basic facilities to the upcoming 23 villages. New corporation will help to solve or handle problems of 23 villages.” POLITICS Considering that the 23 villages are under control of NCP and Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party is not very keen in their inclusion in PMC, especially when civic polls are lined up in early 2022. To prepare the party for the polls, city BJP chief Jagdish Mulik has started meeting residents from these areas. People in the know, on how and how not toThere is a need to form a new corporation.

24-12-2020||Chandigarh||Forest official assault case: Ambala court points to police lapses, terms DFO’s arrest unjustified||An Ambala court has granted bail to Kurukshetra divisional forest officer (DFO) Virender Singh Gill, accused of manhandling chief conservator of forests (north circle) G Raman earlier this month, saying the reasons cited for his arrest are not sustainable and unjustified. Gill, accused by his senior Raman of attacking him at his office in Ambala City’s Company Bagh for refusing to sign tenders, was granted bail by the court of judicial magistrate first class Anita Rani on December 17. The order was made available on December 22. The court said that in such cases, the police have to be further satisfied that the arrest is necessary to prevent such a person from committing any further offence or tampering with evidence. The prosecution had asked for a judicial remand of the accused. “This court is of the view that reasons mentioned for the arrest of the accused are not tenable. Reasons and material have not been mentioned by the investigation officer on the basis of which the police officer reached the conclusion mentioned by him. The alleged occurrence is of December 7; medical examination was conducted on December 8, while the FIR was registered on December 9 and the accused has been produced today (December 17). After a lapse of six days, the accused, who is a public servant, was arrested. Documents produced on file reveal no efforts were made by the investigating officer to ensure the accused joined investigation by issuing him a notice,” the order read. The court also referred to the case of Arnesh Kumar Vs State of Bihar in the Supreme Court and said, “The guidelines prescribed in the case and provisions of Section 41 of the CrPC have also not been followed. Thus, the arrest made by the investigating officer is not justified.” On December 18, Hindustan Times reported how Ramit Khattar, a nephew of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, and a local BJP worker, Rajat Malik, were eyewitnesses and were present at Raman’s office when the alleged manhandling took place. Both admitted they were at his office on December 7 for the redressal of Malik’s complaint when the incident occurred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/forest-official-assault-case-ambala-court-points-to-police-lapses-terms-dfo-s-arrest-unjustified/story-3xf7oABGErepkaedRQ3vWN.html

Chadha, the vice chairman of the DJB, also claimed that the attackers wanted AAP to not speak in favour of farmers protesting against Centre’s laws.“The attackers from the BJP created mayhem at my office and threatened the staff. They openly threatened chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and asked him to stop speaking in favour of the farmers,” Chadha said while addressing a press conference after the incident.ALSO WATCH | Raghav Chadha alleges BJP workers vandalised his office; tweets videosThe attackers also said that such deadly attacks will be carried out against all AAP leaders if you don’t stop opposing Centre’s laws, Chadha further said.“The motive behind this attack was to silence us, but our party chief Kejriwal has told us not to stop supporting farmers. So, no matter what these BJP workers say, our support to farmers against the three black laws will continue,” said Chadha.Soon after Chadha’s comments, Kejriwal said on Twitter that this is a shameful incident. Kejriwal further said that he and his party will stand with the farmers “till our last breath”.Chadha had earlier tweeted a video clip purportedly showing broken doors, glass, pots, furniture and blood stains on the floor at the DJB’s headquarters at Jhandewalan in New Delhi.However, the BJP denied the allegations saying the attack was orchestrated by AAP. Delhi BJP spokesperson Virendra Babar alleged that the AAP had itself orchestrated the attack and was now blaming the saffron party.The police, meanwhile, said there was a protest call by the BJP where scuffle and manhandling were reported. Thirty protesters were also detained, the police said, adding that there are no reports of AAP members or other people getting injured.Delhi BJP media head Naveen Kumar said that the party workers had staged a “peaceful protest” against problems concerning water tanker and those who vandalised the office were not the supporters of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/office-attacked-by-bjp-workers-over-aap-s-stand-against-farm-laws-raghav-chadha/story-KhMRg1stnPmnZTGFfgEtbL.html

Negi had been ordered by the court on Wednesday to appear before it at 11am on Thursday to provide his sample for a DNA test to establish paternity.The court had also ordered the complainant woman, who has accused Negi of raping her repeatedly and fathering a child, to be present along with her daughter, whose samples had to be taken too, for DNA testing.Negi, while speaking over the phone on his inability to appear before the court, said, “I respect the court’s order but I am not well to appear before it. As soon as I recover, I will present myself before the court.” The court was informed of his absence by his counsel. The counsel of the complainant woman, SP Singh, said he had the information that Negi won’t appear before the court. “We had come to know that his counsel is going to move an application on it, hence the complainant didn’t appear before the court with her daughter. First Negi would give his samples then the medical staff would take the woman’s daughter’s samples,” said Singh. Also Read: Rare snow leopard, Himalayan brown bear, Tahr sighted in Gangotri National ParkHe said the court has set January 11 as the next date for DNA test sampling.Earlier in November, then inspector general of Garhwal range, Abhinav Kumar, had transferred the case from Dehradun police to the woman police station in Pauri Garhwal district to avoid allegations of a biased and unfair probe. Earlier, the Dehradun police had submitted a charge sheet against the 30-year-old woman in a case of extortion and blackmailing, filed by Negi’s wife, who had accused the woman of blackmailing and an attempt to extort ₹5cr from Negi, by threatening to frame him in a rape case.After she was accused of blackmailing and extortion, the woman filed a case, accusing Negi of raping her for several years and fathering her daughter, following which, Negi and his wife were booked for rape and criminal intimidation. The woman also demanded a DNA test of her child and Negi to prove her claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/rape-accused-uttarakhand-bjp-mla-fails-to-appear-for-dna-test-sampling/story-6oYfwpdLsrFGqDhXwDc2hN.html
24-12-2020||Pune||Taste of life: Why a city’s foodscape defines its very soul||31 May, 1881. A small advertisement appeared on the last page of ‘Kesari’, one of the most prominent newspapers of the time. It announced the opening of the first ‘Bhojangruha’, or eating house, in Pune. The Bhojangruha would cater to Brahmin students and travelers, and the rates would not be exorbitant, it added. The proprietor of this venture was one Mr. Narayan Ramchandra. The opening of ‘Pune Bhojangruha’ was part of a larger set of events which led to a renaissance in the city. Pune had been in a state of decline after Bajirao II left for Bithur. The British then ruled the city. The British then ruled the city. The moneylenders, admirals, soldiers and clerks had been left moneyless and jobless. There were ruins of old mansions and houses, and the inhabitants left the city to earn a living. The population of Pune in 1818 was 0.15 million. It was reduced to 70,000 in 1841, and in 1851 it was a mere 40,000. Amidst this huzun, a ray of hope was the inauguration of the railway line between Bombay and Pune. The British had started a couple of schools a few years earlier. The municipality had started functioning in 1858. With the collective effort of some brilliant and selfless social and political leaders like Lokhitawadi Gopal Hari Deshmukh, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Savitribai Phule, Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, Mahadeo Govind Ranade, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and Mahadeo Ballal Namjoshi, Pune soon changed its fortune. Students from all over Maharashtra started coming to the city to study and later, earn their living. It quickly became the epicenter of the nationalist movement in Maharashtra, and perhaps, India. The leaders, apart from establishing educational and academic institutions, newspapers, libraries, were also debating and discussing issues like caste, widow remarriage, women’s education and of course, independence with heated passion. But this was also accompanied by events which resulted in ostracisation of many. A teacher was made to apologise because he ate a candy offered by a British officer. A tea party held in a church in Guruwar Peth created a storm which refused to die down for a decade at least. Visiting a restaurant was frowned upon and considered a taboo, akin to visiting a brothel. Caste and religion played a dominant role in deciding who would eat with whom. The renaissance changed the fortune of the city, but also brought to the forefront several issues which made one see how deeply interconnected food, religion, caste, gender and history were. Food sheds light on people’s way of life, their cultural values and their perspectives on life. While food is one way to get to know a place, it also brings to the fore many lesser-known stories. We always tend to associate history with monuments and buildings. But, food also plays a dominant role in helping one understand the past. Food is a magical lens that allows you to see the landscape and certain events in a different way. One can take cities as palimpsests where environmental, economic and social contexts combine into buildings, streets, public spaces. There is, however, another shaping force: food. Despite being absent from today’s urban planning, historically food systems played a crucial role in shaping pre-industrial cities like Pune, defining foodscapes. Food has also played a major role in defining and directing socio-political events in almost every city and country in the world. Pune is no exception. Eating habits are considered a cultural element; therefore, they differ according to the culture of a society. Cultures are in constant interaction with each other. Although a country’s or a city’s food culture is a result of accumulation of years of knowledge transferred from generation to generation, some old habits, in complete or partial, have been exterminated through the recent years’ advances in technology. It is important to know what we have lost or forgotten to make sense of the present and the future. In the next few weeks, let us try and take a look at the foodscapes of Pune in the past and the present. Let us revive the memories of eateries and restaurants, of recipes, people, events, traditions, kitchens that made us what we are today. After all, we are what we eat – and so is a city.

The CPI(M) polit bureau had given its go-ahead to the move but had left the final decision to the central committee. In the 2016 elections, the central committee of the CPI(M) had rejected the West Bengal unit’s decision to have a tactical seat-sharing understanding with the Congress. In the subsequent elections, the Congress won 44 seats and the Left Front ended up with just 32.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-assembly-election-2021-congress-to-ally-with-left-parties/story-8PBKecg8nwHwaNGiGcciKN.html

24-12-2020||City||Parties woo Independents as they emerge key players for at least four J&K DDCs||Political parties in Jammu & Kashmir have begun seeking the support of Independent candidates, who have become crucial to the control of at least four out of 20 District Development Councils (DDC) including that of Srinagar for which election results were declared on Tuesday. Independents account for 18% of the total of 278 elected DDC members. Out of 14 DDC seats in Srinagar, independents have won seven. The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), the six-member grouping formed in October to fight for the restoration of the region’s special status, and Apni Party have bagged three seats each. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) won the remaining seat.Former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, whose National Conference (NC) and People’s Democratic Party are part of the PAGD that swept the polls in Kashmir Valley, have alleged that some Independents have been “abducted” and forced to support the BJP.Also Read: J&K Congress has a plan to checkmate BJP, deny it power in 15 district councils“The administration has now taken on the responsibility of trying to collect independent candidates for the BJP & it’s recently formed subsidiary. It seems the government doesn’t have enough to do & has branched out in to this line of work as well,” he tweeted. “An ex-MLC [member of legislative council] of @JKNC_ [NC] from South Kashmir has been taken away by the police to stop him contacting the independent DDC members elected in his district. At the same time the authorities are taking the trouble to transport some of these independents to Srinagar for ‘discussions’.”Mufti also blamed the BJP and “its proxies” for abducting independent candidates. “BJP & its proxies are sore losers & have resorted to abducting independents who won DDC elections. They are shamelessly using all means to increase their tally. This isn’t dance but death of democracy in J&K,” Mufti tweeted.PAGD leaders said they were in touch with Independent candidates and aim to control all the 10 district councils in the Kashmir Valley. “...some independents have joined us and more will join us in the coming days. We are in touch with many candidates who have a clean image,” said a PAGD leader on condition of anonymity.Apni Party President Syed Altaf Bukhari said he too has the support of some independents. “People across Jammu & Kashmir, especially in district Srinagar, deserve accolades for coming out in support of Apni Party and ensuring the win of its candidates...”BJP spokesman Altaf Thakur denied allegations that the Independents were being forced to join his party. “...every party is trying to seek the support of Independent candidates. So far, in Kashmir, nobody has joined us.”The eight-phase DDC elections were the first such exercise in Jammu & Kashmir since Constitution’s Article 370, which gave the region special status, was scrapped in August 2019.The PAGD won 110 seats of the total 280 across 20 districts. The BJP grabbed 75 seats and emerged as the single-largest party.

24-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt informs HC: Reservation of Covid beds being reduced to 60% from 80% in 33 pvt hospitals||The Delhi government has informed the Delhi high court on Thursday that it has decided to reduce the reservation of ICU beds in 33 private hospitals of Covid-19 patients from 80% to 60%, thereby increasing the number of ICU beds for non-Covid-19 patients. However, the number of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients in Delhi government hospitals will continue to remain the same.The information was given to the court as part of a plea by the Association of Healthcare Providers challenging the September 12 order of the Delhi government to reserve 80% ICU beds in 33 private hospitals for Covid-19 patients.In a meeting conducted on December 23 for the formulation of recommendations regarding the de-escalation of Covid-19 dedicated beds, it was found that there was a significant decline in the number of Covid-19 cases admitted in the hospital from 6,023 on December 7 to 2,866 on December 23, registering a fall of 52.4%.The minutes of the meeting stated that the Covid-19 bed occupancy on December 23 is 2,866 (total Covid-19 beds are 18,779), and Covid-19 ICU bed occupancy is 1,319 (total Covid-19 ICU beds are 5,100).“So it was decided that a de-escalation plan may be executed for ensuring the adequate provision of non-Covid-19 medical and tertiary care services in larger public interest as advised by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, (MoHFW), government of India,” the minutes stated.The expert committee of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) unanimously agreed that in the backdrop of the current declining trend of occupancy among all categories of beds (Oxygenated, ICU, Ventilator Covid-19 beds), the de-escalation may be carried out in a graded manner, both in Delhi government hospitals and private sector hospitals.The committee decided not to recommend any change in the status of the number of Covid-19 beds for the central government hospitals.It also said that since Lok Nayak Hospital and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital are the prominent hospitals in government sector catering to the medical need of a major portion of the population, including children from all parts of Delhi, in terms of emergency medical/other medical/tertiary care, it was agreed that the number of Covid-19 beds shall be de-escalated to 1,000 from the existing 2,010 in Lok Nayak Hospital.Similarly, in the GTB Hospital, the number was reduced to 500 from the existing 1,500.The committee also recommended that since private sector hospitals are important stakeholders for the provision of medical and tertiary care services, the reservation of Covid-19 beds in private hospitals should be de-escalated to 45%.“This will result in making 55% beds in private sector hospitals available for NON Covid-19 patients. It will increase the NON Covid-19 beds in private sector from existing 6760 to 8696(approx), an increase of more than 1930 beds. Covid-19 beds in private sector shall decrease from existing 9051 to 7115 (approx),” the minutes said.“….the committee was cognizant of the fact that the critical care for non-Covid-19 patient is also very important specially in the upcoming winter season. At present the occupancy of Covid-19 ICU beds is 1,319 out of total Covid-19 5,100 beds (approx 26%). Also the committee was aware of the evolving situation of the new strain of Covid-19 virus found in UK and need of critical care in Covid-19 pandemic,” it added.Taking into account the current Covid-19 scenario, committee members categorically decided that the de-escalation plan shall be reversible and the non-Covid-19 beds thus provisioned via this arrangement shall be converted to Covid-19 beds in case of any such need across the state.“The committee will re-visit the recommendations after 10 days to assess the impact/outcome and will strategise accordingly for on Covid-19 & non-Covid-19 medical services new recommendations, if required in light of the emerging situation,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/80-reservation-of-covid-19-icu-beds-to-reduce-to-60-delhi-govt-to-hc/story-GUZEt0yG6gVpSZpA9SnoyI.html

24-12-2020||Chandigarh||Bar Council of India’s 3-year moratorium on opening new colleges set aside||The Punjab and Haryana high court has quashed Bar Council of India’s (BCI) decision of not allowing the opening of new law colleges for three years.The high court bench of justice Rekha Mittal said the decision violated the fundamental right of a citizen to practice any profession, or to carry out any occupation, trade or business, under Article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution.The BCI, a statutory body that regulates legal practice in the country and grants approval for opening law colleges, had taken the decision in August 2019, citing non-adherence of guidelines/circulars by institutions imparting legal education by already approved institutes.The decision was challenged by the Chandigarh Educational Society, which wanted to open a law college at Jhanjheri in Mohali and had in December 2019 applied for permission for the academic session 2021-22. In May, it moved the high court claiming that all procedural requirements were fulfilled but the BCI was sitting over its application. It was also argued that under the Advocates Act, 1961, the BCI had no power to ban the establishment of new institutes for imparting legal education.The court found that the BCI had failed to point out any provision in favour of its decision. It also failed to point out how many institutes have been shut down till date for non-adherence to the prescribed standard of legal education or circulars issued by the council.“The BCI cannot justify its failure to ensure maintenance of standards of legal education by imposing a complete ban on setting up new law colleges,” the court said, adding the BCI can issue guidelines and circulars and press for their compliance either at the stage of grant of approval to a new college or for adherence to existing ones.The council was directed to process the Chandigarh Educational Society’s application within three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bar-council-of-india-s-3-year-moratorium-on-opening-new-colleges-set-aside/story-1ghgizlioOeOCzVPbWnoAI.html

The latest police complaint, lodged on Wednesday night by Bhagalpur welfare officer (DWO) Shyam Prasad Yadav, has accused the NGO, the then branch managers of Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Indian Bank and others of illegally withdrawing Rs 99.88 crore from the accounts of the district administration concerned. Police said that after the detection of alleged embezzlement of over Rs 100 crore, belonging to the SC/ST welfare department, from the bank accounts, the DWO has submitted an application with the Kotwali police station to lodge an FIR against Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti (SMVSS). The DWO has named the SMVSS managing committee members, former and present officials of a nationalized bank and others for committing financial irregularities that started way back in 2007. With this, the total number of FIRs lodged in the infamous Srijan scam has reached 25. The fresh siphoning off government money came to light after an accountant general conducted a special audit of the welfare department, Bhagalpur and found fraudulent transfers of Rs 99.88 crore between 2007 and 2017. The joint secretary of the welfare department, ordered Bhagalpur DM Pranav Kumar to lodge an FIR in this regard. Meanwhile, the latest FIR in connection with the Srijan scam is likely to be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Patna soon.Sources in the Bhagalpur administration informed that earlier two separate FIRs were lodged with the Kotwali police in connection with the scam of Rs 221.60 crore, related to the welfare department. The then DWOs, Ramiswar Sharma, Ramlala Singh, Lalan Kumar and Arun Kumar (currently in jail) and others were involved in the scam. Also Read: ED attaches over Rs 14 cr assets in Bihar’s Srijan scam caseThe Srijan scandal broke out when a few cheques issued by the Bhagalpur district administration were dishonoured citing ‘lack of funds’ in the government account. The Bhagalpur police lodged the first FIR in the Srijan fund transfer scam on August 7, 2017, after a cheque of Rs 17.70 crore of the urban development department bounced due to lack of funds in the account. The following day, two more cases involving over Rs 350 crore surfaced. It is estimated that more than Rs 2,400 crore was fraudulently transferred from district project accounts to the Srijan bank accounts with the help of bureaucrats, politicians, staff of the commissionerate, bankers, and Srijan staff led by its late founder Manorama Devi. Till date, Bihar police has lodged 25 FIRs at Bhagalpur, Saharsa and Banka districts, in which CBI took up 22 FIRs for investigation and filed 14 separate charge sheets against two former district magistrates of Bhagalpur—KP Ramaiah and Birendra Kumar Yadav-- former ADMs Jaishree Thakur and Rajiv Ranjan Singh besides officials of Bank of Baroda, Bank of India and the Indian Bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-s-srijan-scam-gets-even-bigger-another-fir-lodged-for-missing-rs-100-crore/story-iWbWIMZJ3gaIbjxzynSEOP.html

24-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra student body raises plight of non-permanent teachers during Covid-19||The Maharashtra Students’ Union (MASU) has approached the minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant, requesting him to resolve the predicament of non permanent faculty in colleges in the state, whose suffering has been prolonged due to Covid-19. These visiting faculties are battling loss of jobs and wages due to the lockdown and other restrictions during the pandemic.In a letter addressed to Samant, MASU has highlighted the plight of thousands of teachers whose recruitment or transfer to a permanent role has been stuck due to the situations created by the pandemic.“Many of these teachers have already cleared the state or the national teacher eligibility test and are qualified to take important roles in colleges but are struggling to make ends meet at the present,” said Siddharth Ingle, president of MASU. With higher education institutes shut since March this year, many non-permanent teachers have lost jobs as their contracts could not be renewed during the lockdown. At present, lectures are still being conducted virtually, but teachers without a renewed or a new contract, have been left out.MASU has further shared examples of states like West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Jammu & Kashmir, where visiting faculty are hired on 11-month long contracts to deal with issues including adhocism.Also Read: Maharashtra: SSC, HSC supplementary exam results declaredThe students groups have requested that until recruitment of teachers does not resume in the state, the government should appoint visiting faculty on an 11 month contract basis and pay them a monthly honorarium of at least Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000.“Permanent professors are paid anywhere between Rs 65,000- 1 lakh a month while the non-permanent faculty with equal education qualification have not been paid in months.

24-12-2020||Kolkata||After being branded a traitor by TMC, Suvendu Adhikari to hold rally in hometown||A day after the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) branded Suvendu Adhikari, a former TMC heavyweight and minister who defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a traitor and targeted his family at a rally at Contai, his hometown in Bengal’s East Midnapore district, he is set to hold a rally at the same place on Thursday. This would be his first rally in East Midnapore after he joined the BJP on December 19 at union home minister Amit Shah’s rally. On Tuesday, Adhikari addressed his first rally as a BJP leader in Burdwan district. BJP’s youth president in the state Saumitra Khan, who recently filed a divorce suit against his wife Sujata Mondol Khan after she switched over to the TMC, would also be present at Adhikari’s rally. Both the TMC and the BJP are desperately trying to show their strength in the district, which was considered to be the bastion of the TMC, more so of the Adhikari family.Also Read: After joining BJP, Suvendu Adhikari called ‘traitor’ in hometown by TMC TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee is expected to hold another rally at Nandigram in the same district on January 7, 2021. Adhikari and his family have played a key role in the growth of the TMC in East Midnapore. The Contai and Tamluk Lok Sabha seats, most of the assembly segments and many local bodies here have been controlled by 78-year-old Sisir Adhikari and his three sons since 2009. Sisir Adhikari, his father, is the sitting TMC MP from Contai. Dibyendu Adhikari, his brother, is the MP from Tamluk. His youngest brother Soumendu Adhikari is the chairman of Kanthi municipality. No member of the Adhikari family, however, attended the TMC rally in East Midnapore on Wednesday. “Akhil Giri (TMC lawmaker from Ramnagar and a known detractor of Adhikari) had sent invitation letters to everyone. If someone doesn’t attend then it is up to them,” said Saugata Roy, TMP MP. A two-time former Lok Sabha member with an impressive fan following among party workers, Suvendu Adhikari, 50, is acknowledged as one of the leaders who helped TMC chief Mamata Banerjee galvanise the anti-land acquisition movement at Nandigram in East Midnapore district during the Left Front rule. The two-year-long movement became a key factor in the CPI(M)’s ouster in 2011. On Wednesday, before the TMC rally, there was a clash between the BJP and the TMC workers in the district’s Ramnagar area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/after-being-branded-a-traitor-by-tmc-suvendu-adhikari-to-hold-rally-in-hometown/story-KWP3PVtbOugRYrMTgKJcfK.html

Block-wise decorations have been done and some shopkeepers have put up decorations.” He added that the shopkeepers didn’t want markets to get crowded.Meanwhile, at Elante Mall in Industrial Area, Phase 1, a 21-foot tall polar bear dressed as Santa had been installed to woo customers.The public relations officer of the Chandigarh traffic police, deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Charanjit Singh Virk, confirmed that the traffic police had issued specific instructions to personnel regarding management of traffic in the major markets of the city on Thursday and Friday.Markets covered include sectors 18, 19, 22, 34 and 35, along with Elante Mall. Virk said, “There will be at least four challaning officers present in each of these markets from 10am to 8pm to issue on the spot wrong parking challans. One towing vehicle per market will also be present.” Although dedicated nakas for drunken driving remain unlikely, anyone found to be drunk will be taken to the nearest hospital for a blood test and booked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-shadow-christmas-sales-fall-by-50-in-chandigarh/story-no1OoamNl4zKCZZYBZOlCI.html

She had only one thing on her mind, to perform as per people’s expectations. She had only one mission, to serve the residents of Panchkula who had given her a chance to serve them,” he said.Meanwhile, Haryana Congress Committee chief Kumari Selja has called upon Panchkula residents to teach the Bharatiya Janata Party a lesson for its “anti-people and anti-farmers” policies by defeating them in the municipality corporation (MC) polls.Selja addressed a public rally in support of Congress mayoral candidate Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia at Ramgarh on Wednesday.“It was BJP’s own anti-people policies that are now paying back to it. The government is not listening to those whom it claimed to be working for after coming to power. Farmers’ agitation is an eye-opener for the nation. BJP’s daily-dally approach to solve the agitation reflects its agenda to sell the country in the hands of a select few,” she said.Selja said that the Congress party didn’t believe in caste or community-based politics. “It’s the duty of voters to think rationally,” she pointed out.BJP’S Goyal appeals for support from lawyersPanchkula BJP’s mayoral candidate Kulbhushan Goyal met with the members of the District Bar Association, Panchkula, and assured the advocates their problems will be solved when he is voted to power.

24-12-2020||City||Sion hospital assistant dean held for duping PG aspirant from Pune of ₹50 lakh||Sion police have arrested Dr Rakesh Verma, assistant dean of Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital (Sion hospital), for allegedly taking ₹50 lakh from a Pune-based doctor to secure her a seat for a postgraduate (PG) medical course. The complainant alleged she had transferred ₹21 lakh to Dr Verma’s account, while the rest of the money was paid to him in cash by September. Doctor Mohan Joshi, dean of the hospital, said, “Dr Rakesh Verma is attached with Sion hospital as assistant dean. The police arrested him and are conducting an inquiry. So I cannot comment more in the matter”.The police had taken Dr Verma for a medical examination, where he had complained of hypertension. He is admitted to the hospital and will be produced in the court once he is discharged from the hospital, said inspector Dilip Ghuge of the Sion police station. According to the police, the 28-year-old complainant in her statement to the police claimed she had received a call from a man named Rahul Singh in August, who offered to help her with the admission for the PG course through government quota. Singh said there are seats are available at the hospital where the accused works. The complainant met Singh and the duo then spoke to the assistant dean, said Ghuge.The complainant then handed over her documents to Singh for the admission process. A few days later, she met Singh along with her father at Mumbai Central. The next day, the complainant’s father and brother met Dr Verma at hospital where he allegedly demanded ₹1.5 crore for the admission. The duo said they could not manage paying the amount, following which it was reduced ₹50 lakh, said the officer. But when she did not get an admission, she approached Sion police on Tuesday, where a case was registered against the assistant dean under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sion-hospital-assistant-dean-held-for-duping-pg-aspirant-from-pune-of-50-lakh/story-bADCfcoophpY1oCjB8X3dP.html
24-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC commutes death sentence of man who killed unborn child, kin||Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday commuted death sentence handed down to a resident of Jalna district for killing his mother-in-law and the child in the womb of his pregnant wife, into life imprisonment.“No doubt, the crime is heinous and condemnable,” said the bench of justice Ravindra Gauge and justice BU Debadwar. The bench, however, felt that the crime committed by Krishna Pawar was not so barbaric and cold-blooded that it would send shivers down the spine of a person, warranting imposition of capital punishment, not only to punish him but also to deter such other murders.According to the prosecution, the incident took place on October 24, 2015, at Walkhed. Wife of the 35-year-old labourer from Yawalpimpri in Jalna district had gone to her parent’s place, as Pawar used to suspect her character and harass her.On the fateful day, Pawar had gone to bring back his wife, who was nine-months pregnant at the time. But, he was asked to meet them at Walkhed, where the parties intended to discuss the issues faced by the couple and resolve them mutually.Pawar assaulted his pregnant wife, her mother and mother’s sister with a knife when the three women were waiting for Pawar’s brother-in-law. The attack resulted in the death of Pawar’s mother-in-law and the foetus in his wife’s womb. His wife and the sister of his mother-in-law survived the brutal attack.Pawar was arrested and prosecuted for the murders and attempted murders. This year on June 18, an additional sessions judge at Jalna convicted Pawar for the murders and sentenced him to death, terming the case a rarest of a rare one.On Tuesday, HC upheld his conviction, but commuted the death penalty handed down to him, to life imprisonment, after noticing that the brutal attack had resulted in the death of a woman and an unborn child, but the crime did not warrant the imposition of the extreme penalty. The judges said though Pawar had planned to attack his wife and mother-in-law, it was perhaps only a coincidence that the sister of his mother-in-law, Alkabai, also accompanied them. They felt, in the fit of anger Pawar might have overcome his sense of reason and went on to stab all the three ladies.HC has, however, taken stern note of four witnesses, including Alkabai, a victim of the attack, in the case turning hostile, and directed Jalna sessions court to conduct an inquiry as contemplated under section 340 of the Criminal Procedure Code, to initiate an action of perjury against the four witnesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-commutes-death-sentence-of-man-who-killed-unborn-child-kin/story-vQE7SncAWHDlaT6IrDwYgM.html
24-12-2020||City||Maharashtra govt approves EWS benefits for Marathas||In a bid to provide respite to the Marathas amid the stalemate over the reservation in jobs and college admissions, the state cabinet on Wednesday approved the proposal of extending the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) quota to the community.The step has paved the way for the community’s members from the economically weaker sections, with the annual income of less than ₹8 lakh, to avail the benefit of the 10% EWS quota.“Candidates availing the benefits under EWS, however, will not be allowed to avail the SEBC quota. The decision is subject to the final verdict of the Apex court in the petition pending before it. The decision of allowing the Maratha community members to avail the benefits under EWS quota has been taken in accordance with the observations by the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court,” the government resolution issued on Wednesday has stated.Following the decision, the Maratha community members will be able to draw certificates to avail the benefit under EWS for college admissions and government jobs. The community members will however have to compete with people in the open category for the 10% quota as opposed to the 12% and 13% reservation they would have got under the SEBC Act in admissions and jobs respectively.The community members have expressed their reservations over the decision. “The decision could go against our contention of urgency in hearing the matter in the top court. We have been opposing this move since the beginning. Secondly, the SEBC reservation has just been stayed and not cancelled by the court. This means the community cannot avail second reservation when the one meant for them is still in force. Most importantly, the actual percentage of Marathas getting EWS quota will be far lesser as compared to SEBC, as we will be competing with people in open category,” said Virendra Pawar, one of the organisers of Maratha Kranti Morcha.The constitution bench of five judges on December 9 had ruled to begin the regular hearing in the reservation petition from January 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-govt-approves-ews-benefits-for-marathas/story-vkGRdKYPg9UwEVgx3GEO5J.html
24-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body panel wants audit of ₹1,250 cr spent on Covid relief||Suspecting corruption into the emergency expenditures related to Covid-19, the standing committee of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has directed the administration to conduct a financial audit into the ₹1,250 crore spent for Covid relief work by the civic body. More than 100 proposals worth ₹1,250 crores were tabled in Wednesday’s meeting before the committee, about the various expenses related to Covid, like medicines, PPE kits, Covid Care Centres and so on.The committee refused to sanction the proposals and demanded that an audit report of all the expenditures to be submitted to the committee. Prabhakar Shinde, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) group leader and senior corporator in the BMC, said, “The administration has not given clear information on the expenditure done for Covid related works. A lot of Covid centres have only shown the total charges, but have not mentioned the number of patients that were treated there. There could be a mismanagement of ₹200 crores in all of the proposals.”Read more: Rs 630 crore spent on Covid-19, Mumbai civic corporation may have to rework budgetRais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party leader, said, “There has been gross negligence and mismanagement in awarding tenders for constructing Covid Care Centres. I have multiple examples where the tendering process was faulty.” Following the demands, the standing committee chairman, Yashwant Jadhav, directed the municipal auditor for a complete audit of the expenses.The proposals of Covid expenses tabled during Wednesday’s meeting were for post-facto approval, which means the contracts for the civic works have been awarded and BMC has already committed them for payment. This leaves little scope for the standing committee’s effective rejection of the proposals. This is possible because the standing committee gave spending powers to the municipal commissioner in March, in light of the lockdown, since the committee did not meet during that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-panel-wants-audit-of-1-250-cr-spent-on-covid-relief/story-ZjvXrmmVfmrwWmTwZTJsTN.html
24-12-2020||City||Bombay HC relief for Colaba special school against eviction order||In a relief to a Colaba-based school for special children, the Bombay high court (HC) has directed the army estate officer to consider afresh an eviction order issued by him on November 20 to the institute. The order had asked the school to vacate the premise on the grounds that the land belonged to the Indian Army. A division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Milind Jadhav, while hearing the petition filed by Able Disabled All People Together (ADAPT), earlier known as the Spastics Society of India, was informed by advocate Sunip Sen and Shrubo Dey that the estate officer had issued a show-cause notice on July 20 and an eviction order, passed under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971, was sent four months later. The order asked the school, founded Padma Shri awardee Mithu Alur, to vacate the premise within 15 days. The petition has stated that the school was a tenant of the adjoining Afghan Church since 1972 and could thus not be called a ‘public premise.’ Therefore, the estate officer was not competent to pass such an eviction order, said the petitioner. The petition further states that the special school provided counselling, inclusive education, skills training to more than 3,000 special children and 10,000 families cutting across economic backgrounds, and it had been paying rent to the Bombay Diocesan Trust, which has been looking after Afghan Church since the early 1970s. It said that a similar eviction notice was issued in 2007, which was later stayed by the Centre. The advocates also submitted that a query of the school on the propriety of the estate officer to pass the order did not get a response. In response to the petition, the Centre submitted that the petitioner could appeal against the estate officer’s order, which was opposed on the grounds that the alternate remedy was not required, as the initial order was without jurisdiction. After hearing the submissions, the bench noted that as the query of the school on the propriety of the estate officer was not reflected in the November 20 order passed by him, it should be considered a ‘prima facie opinion.’ After the court’s insistence, the Centre and the estate officer said that a fresh order would be passed. The Court then asked the school to file its reply to the show-cause notice within two weeks ‘without prejudice to their rights and contentions regarding the issue of jurisdiction’. The bench also allowed the petitioner to make representation for inspection of the documents related to the premise before the authority as per the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bombay-hc-relief-for-colaba-special-school-against-eviction-order/story-ZfvGg1g6FUKgxLLetbFYdM.html
24-12-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra government to trace UK fliers||In view of the new strain of Covid-19 found in the United Kingdom (UK) and other countries, Maharashtra government on Wednesday asked the administration to trace and test air travellers arrived in the state from the UK in last one month from November 25 to December 23, for genomic sequencing and ascertaining if they match the new variant found there. Around 3,000 people have estimated to have arrived in the state from the UK in the past four weeks.Meanwhile, the state registered less than 4,000 cases for the seventh day in a row. With 3,913 new cases, the state tally touched 1,906,371, while the toll stands at 48,969 after 93 deaths were added on Wednesday.The state officials said they are taking all precautions to prevent the spread of the new variants of Covid-19.Read more: Over 1,500 landed in Mumbai from UK, other countries since Tuesday; none found infected yetThe respective district administrations have been provided with a list of travellers arrived in Maharashtra from the UK over the last four weeks. “The travellers found with the positive report will be institutionally quarantined. The samples of positive patients will be sent to Pune’s National Institute for Virology for genomic sequencing,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has appealed to citizens in Mumbai who have returned from the UK between November 25 till date to contact the ward control room of their areas in case they develop any Covid like symptoms and also get a preliminary medical check-up from a family doctor or nearest municipal health centre. They have also asked the UK returns to go through a Covid-19 test.Suresk Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said there could be an estimated 3, 000 UK returnees across Maharashtra, 30% of which will be in Mumbai. “We are preparing a list of all such returnees in the city and will contact them through ward war rooms,” he said.In the backdrop of the new strain of Covid-19 found in these countries, the state government has already announced measures to arrest the spread of the new variant of the virus. It has already stopped flights from the UK and enforced compulsory quarantine for passengers arriving from Europe, Middle East and South Africa.On Wednesday, the government extended the night curfew, imposed between December 22 and January 5, to the rural parts of the state on Wednesday, two days after it was announced only for the urban areas. The revised notification issued by chief secretary Sanjay Kumar says that if the district collector of any district is of the view that imposition of the said night curfew in his respective district will reduce the transmission of the virus, he is hereby authorised to do so, after obtaining permission for the same from the chief secretary.The decision of imposing the night curfew was taken as a precautionary measure after a new strain of Covid-19 was found in the United Kingdom and a few other countries. The government has however allowed the entertainment and amusement parks, tourist places outside the containment zones to operate. Similarly, water sports at various places too, have been allowed in the state. The operators will have to follow the standard operating procedure to be issued by the tourism department of the state government.Mumbai reported 745 cases and 14 deaths on Wednesday taking the tally to 2,88,561 and toll to 11,033. Pune, Nashik and Nagpur districts are among the highest contributors of fresh infections with 621, 394 and 330 cases respectively.State health department officials have expressed the sigh of relief as the cases continue to remain under control. Against the projection of the rise in the cases in December, the cases continue to be below 4,000 over the last few days.The experts, however, have a word of caution as they expect a surge in cases, in the second week of January. “The risk of the second wave is still there, though it would not be as high as it had been after the Ganpati festival in Festival. We still expect a surge in cases 15 days after Christmas festival. I do not think the new strain found in the United Kingdom, European and other countries will have any impact here as we have already started taking precautions. The district administrations have already been told to take due measures to contain the spread because of the crowding,” said Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the state-appointed death audit committee.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during his meeting with the district collectors and commissioners on Tuesday has directed to increase the testing and tracing to contain the spread. The testing rate over the last 10 days has dropped to a daily average of 57,602 tests from a daily average of 82,071 tests in the last ten days in November.“The positivity rate in the state has dropped which means the number of cases has overalled dropped. The tests are done on the symptomatic people and since their number is low, the tests too, have dropped,” said Dr Supe.State’s case facility rate stands at 2.57%, while the recovery rate has reached to 94.51%. The active cases in the state are 54,573 after 7620 patients were discharged on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-maharashtra-government-to-trace-uk-fliers/story-1DYFaCC3EkGYkTE0ZdDZwM.html
24-12-2020||City||Looking for long-term alliance with Shiv Sena: NCP||Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is looking for a long-term alliance with its ruling partner Shiv Sena. The party on Wednesday informed its cadres that they will remain with Sena for a long time and hence would to work accordingly to resolve disputes at local level. The party also inducted 18 rebel corporators of Congress from Bhiwandi-Nizampur on Wednesday, giving a jolt to its alliance partner. This is likely to lead to another round of tussle between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress. Congress’s interim president Sonia Gandhi had recently written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and had expressed her unhappiness over the alleged non-utilisation of funds meant for socially backward classes in the state. Kicking off its preparations for the upcoming local bodies elections, NCP had called a meeting of party cadres, leaders and candidates who had lost the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections last year. The meeting was addressed by the senior ministers and leaders including Ajit Pawar and Jayant Patil.“We know that disputes are going on at the local level since the time the MVA government was formed. But we will be staying with Shiv Sena for a long time, so act accordingly and resolve disputes,” Ajit Pawar is said to have told the gathering in his address.Despite discontent and differences over several issues, MVA had recently completed its first year in the government. However, NCP inducted 18 rebel Congress corporators, including Bhiwandi-Nizampur’s deputy mayor Imran Ali Mohammad Khan, which may not go down well with the Congress.The rebel corporators in cross-voting had voted for Pratibha Patil, a candidate from Konark Vikas Aghadi, for the mayoral elections, following which the Congress lost the poll, despite having 47 members in the 90-member corporation last year. The party has already initiated disciplinary action against them.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said they are rebels and a report will be sought from the district president. “They all are the rebels who have voted against a party candidate in the mayoral elections held last year. District president Tahir Rashid will be asked to submit a report on the matter,” Sawant said.NCP leaders said the corporators were planning to leave the Congress and would have joined some other party had the NCP denied them entry. “NCP has become a centre of attraction in the state and these 18 corporators had already decided to leave the Congress. We are not at fault. They would have joined any other party if we have denied them entry,” said a senior NCP leader, wishing not to be named.Political analyst Pratap Asbe said the move will impact the Congress-NCP relationship. “However, it won’t go to a level where they will think of falling apart from MVA, as they also need to be in power,” Asbe said.Meanwhile, the state Congress unit has started its preparations for the upcoming local body polls. Congress’s state president Balasaheb Thorat has constituted a 13-member election management committee and appointed observers for every observer for each election. Thorat has also appointed 12 ministers as contact ministers in each of the districts going for polls.

24-12-2020||City||Mumbai Metro: No end to Maharashtra govt-BJP war of words over Kanjurmarg plot||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday slammed the Centre and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over their opposition to construct the car shed for three metro lines at the Kanjurmarg plot proposed by the state.Urban development minister Eknath Shinde said the state has documents to prove that the land is owned by the Maharashtra government, but it is because of the Centre that the Bombay high court (HC) has imposed a stay on the construction of the car shed on the plot. He added the state is exploring various options for the car shed. Shinde also said the previous BJP-led state government had given permission for a housing project on the Kanjurmarg plot.“Politics is being played over the Kanjurmarg plot. Going by the land records, the plot is a state property. If they [BJP] were okay with a housing project on the plot, why do they not want it to be used for the Metro project,” Shinde said during a press conference on Wednesday.Sena’s ally Congress also questioned the intention of the Devendra Fadnavis government over its decision to explore the possibility of launching an affordable housing scheme proposed by a developer on the plot. “What made the Fadnavis regime to accept the proposal of the developer for building one lakh affordable houses under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s (PM) flagship scheme ‘Housing for All 2022’ on the same plot? The state had also appointed a high-level committee of bureaucrats headed by the then additional chief secretary of finance on June 11, 2019, for the project,” said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.The Congress also said that one of the petitioners who moved HC against the constriction of the car shed at Kanjurmarg plot claiming to be the land’s lessee, had signed an agreement with the developer. He also claimed that the petitioner was supposed to get a benefit of hundreds of crores of rupees from the deal of agreement of development of the Kanjurmarg plot in 2009 with the developer. However, the petitioner had claimed that the agreement was later scrapped by the city civil court in 2016.Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said his party has always taken a congruous stand on developmental issues and if the state government make the findings of the report of the committee headed by additional chief secretary Manoj Saunik on shifting the car shed to Kanjurmarg public, then the truth will come out before everyone. “It is the state government that has made it an ego and prestige issue. Our only demand is to make findings of the Saunik committee public. Everyone will come to know what is going on,” Upadhye said.Replying to the Sawant’s allegations, he said, “The agreement between the developer and the petitioner was signed in 2009 when the Congress-NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) government was in power. The BJP government only tried to find out the feasibility of the proposal for PM’s flagship scheme. Moreover, the committee was formed to see if the state government can use all the saltpan lands for affordable housing schemes as discussed in the western regional council meeting as well in a meeting chaired by PM.”Meanwhile, Shinde said the decision to shift the car shed to Kanjurmarg was taken in the larger interest of the citizens. “Constructing a car shed for Metro lines 3, 4 and 6 would have benefited the people. But amid the ownership battle between the state and Centre, the HC has unfortunately put a stay on the construction of the car shed at Kanjurmarg. The construction work for the Metro project is in full speed and we are exploring other options for the car shed. A plot in BKC is one of them and a study has been undertaken is this regard. The Centre should have taken a congruous stand on the matter,” he said.The state and the Centre have locked horns over the ownership of the Kanjurmarg plot. In October, the state government had decided to scrap the Metro car shed at Aarey Colony and shift it to Kanjurmarg. It also decided to integrate Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz), Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli) and Metro-4 (Wadala-Kasarwadavali) lines. However, HC granted a stay on the construction of the car shed, following the petitions filed by the Centre and the lessee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-metro-no-end-to-state-bjp-war-of-words-over-kanjurmarg-plot/story-NHaoQfiQ0BuVtNlsRv03kO.html
24-12-2020||City||Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train land acquisition proposal put in abeyance by Thane civic body||The proposal to hand over the reserved plot in Diva for the Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train was put in abeyance by the Thane Municipal Corporation’s (TMC) ruling party Shiv Sena after it was tabled in the civic body’s general body for the fourth time on Wednesday. As per procedure, the proposal cannot be tabled again for approval for the next three months now. The move hardly comes as a surprise amid the tussle between the Sena-led state and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre after the Bombay high court (HC) stayed the constructed of the Mumbai Metro car shed plot in Kanjurmarg. The Sena is trying to create hurdles for the Centre’s bullet train project in Thane by not approving the land transfer for the fourth time. The bullet train is proposed to pass through nine villages in Thane district, including Shil, Davale, Padle, Desai, Agasan, Betavde and Mhatardi. It will have a station at Mhatardi in Diva. As per the agreement with the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL), TMC has to acquire a land of 3,849 square meters near Shil, for which a compensation of Rs6.92 crore is offered to the locals. However, the residents had opposed the acquisition, demanding better facilities. The local corporators, too, had opposed it, following which the proposal was tabled for discussion on Wednesday. Thane mayor Naresh Mhaske said, “We have not taken any decision regarding the bullet train land acquisition proposal. We have kept it in abeyance as of now.” The BJP alleged that the Sena is playing politics for their benefit. Sanjay Waghule, BJP team leader in TMC, said, “Shiv Sena always claims that they are on the side of development, but the decision over the bullet train proposal proves otherwise. Shiv Sena is merely playing politics and trying to stall the project. They are doing the same in Mumbai too. They are demanding huge funds from the Centre for various projects but are creating obstacles for the projects. We will bring this to the notice of the central government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train-land-acquisition-proposal-put-in-abeyance-by-thane-civic-body/story-lvMYTdGviPDsMG8RJWMc8L.html
24-12-2020||Mumbai||Farm loans fraud in Maharashtra: ED attaches sugar plant, assets worth ₹255 crore||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday attached sugar plant, machinery, land, balances in a bank account and shares totalling to ₹255 crores of Gangakhed Sugar & Energy Limited (GSEL) and others in connection with a multi-crore bank fraud case, in which agricultural loans were fraudulently availed in the name of farmers.ED officers said assets worth ₹255 crores of GSEL, Yogeswari Hatcheries, Gangakhed Solar Power Limited have been attached under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). The attached assets include sugar plant and machinery of GSEL worth ₹247 crores, situated at Gangakhed, in Parbhani district of Maharashtra, land worth ₹5 crores of GSEL, Yogeswari Hatcheries, Gangakhed Power Solar Limited situated in Parbhani, Beed and Dhule districts. Also bank balance of ₹1.58 crores, investment in shares worth ₹1.91 crores were held in the name of GSEL.Read more: ED raids 10 places in Maharashtra ‘linked’ to sugar baron Ratnakar GutteED had initiated an investigation in the case in May 2019, based on a first information report (FIR) registered by Gangakhed police against GSEL, its chairman Ratnakar Gutte and others.The FIR alleged that GSEL chairman and other accused allegedly conspired and by cheating, forgery and falsifying documents fraudulently availed agricultural loans in the name of poor farmers, based on forged loan proposals submitted to the banks. Gutte was also arrested in the case. The crime investigation department (CID), Aurangabad, investigated the case and filed a charge sheet revealing details of misappropriation of the funds.Investigations have revealed that the accused persons created the data on the farmers, who supplied the sugarcane to the factory, by collecting their KYC at the time of purchasing the sugarcane from them. The factory further signed an agreement with the banks for obtaining an agricultural loan for the farmers. Under the agreement, GSEL becomes the agent for the banks, whose responsibility was to do KYC verification of the farmers.“During the period from 2012-13 to 2016-17, GSEL forged agricultural loan proposals in the name of farmers based on of the KYC and submitted them to the banks. Banks had sanctioned the agricultural loan of around ₹ 772 crores. Using this modus operandi, around ₹635 crores were disbursed by the banks into the bank accounts opened in the name of the farmers,” ED officers said.GSEPL fraudulently availed loans from Andhra Bank, UCO Bank, United Bank of India, Bank of India, Syndicate Bank, Ratnakar Bank in the guise of ‘crop loan’ to 8,000 to 10,000 farmers on the guarantee given by GSEPL.The funds were never utilised by the farmers and instead, they were siphoned-off into different bank accounts of the GSEL, ED officers added.As agricultural loans of around ₹255 crores have become non-performing assets (NPA), hence, the assets have been provisionally attached under PMLA, ED stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/farm-loans-fraud-in-maharashtra-ed-attaches-sugar-plant-assets-worth-255-crore/story-ptmYWKY3TCX8X1y2mPVRDJ.html
24-12-2020||Mumbai||BKC plot not feasible for Mumbai Metro shed: Maharashtra govt panel in Jan||While the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is eyeing the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) plot for the Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) car shed, a committee appointed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had rejected the option in January 2020, stating it would not be technically and financially feasible. The Thackeray government recently shifted the shed from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg, however, the Bombay high court (HC) recently ordered an interim stay on the transfer of the land as the Central government also claimed ownership of the land. The state government had in December 2019 appointed a four-member Manoj Saunik committee to look at alternative sites for the car shed. The committee studied nine plots – Backbay or reclamation behind World Trade Centre, Colaba, Kalina, BKC, Mahalaxmi, Seepz, Kanjurmarg, Dahisar, SRPF Ground and Pahadi Goregaon. However, it stated that Aarey would be the most suitable option for the car depot. Based on suggestions from citizen groups, the committee had considered bifurcating the depot into two plots (BKC and Kalina) based on the space requirements. Metro-3 requires a 25-hectare plot for its depot. However, the 98-page Saunik committee report (accessed by HT) states, “Bifurcating depot requirements in two individual plots and accommodating them in Kalina and BKC is also not possible as the tunnels in this reach are already constructed. Any change in the constructed tunnels for joining it to the depot would require dismantling of both up and down tunnels at multiple locations for making two separate connections between the two tracks; and two separate connections with the depot connector (sic).” It further states, “Moreover the cost of land will be very high and lots of BKC land is reserved for the terminal station of the ongoing bullet train project and other infrastructure development already planned above it. This proposal has dual challenges of technical feasibility and serious cost and time overruns.” The committee had stated that the land in Kanjurmarg is sub-judice and shifting the car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg would result in numerous technical, financial and operational difficulties apart from majorly delaying the project, which was to be partly operational by 2021. HT had earlier reported that the BKC option was also rejected in the detailed project report for Metro-3 in November 2011 and by a committee chaired by former metropolitan commissioner UPS Madan. A senior official from the state government said the government was looking at various possibilities in BKC, including the option of taking the car shed underground. The official said, “The government is keen on Kanjurmarg, considering that it will serve as a common car shed for lines 3, 4 and 6 with an integration with line 14.” While line 4 will stretch from Wadala-Kasarwadavli, line 6 will be from Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli and 14 is a proposed line from Kanjurmarg-Badlapur. The chief minister, in his address to the state on Sunday, also invited the Central government for a dialogue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bkc-plot-not-feasible-for-mumbai-metro-shed-maharashtra-govt-panel-in-jan/story-xTgqMaMUM3juwNpyTWFkxO.html
24-12-2020||Chandigarh||Two Punjab ministers to meet Piyush Goyal today to push for release of rural devp fund||As the Centre has not permitted Punjab to deduct rural development fund (RDF) from the cash credit limit (CCL) released for paddy procurement that ended on November 30, two cabinet ministers from the state – Manpreet Singh Badal and Bharat Bhushan Ashu would meet Union food minister Piyush Goyal to push for the release of funds, in New Delhi on Thursday. The RDF from the sale of kharif crop (paddy) for the central pool runs into Rs. 1,250 crore, a major revenue source for the state on which development of rural Punjab depends. It also funds the state’s key expenditure such as debt waiver launched by the chief minister (CM) Capt Amarinder Singh and sangat darshan programs of the former CM Parkash Singh Badal. As per the state’s regulations, 3% RDF is charged on the sale of food grains, and the Centre has, for the first time, missed mentioning it on the provisional cost sheet sent to the state before procurement of paddy. “We took up the RDF release issue with the Centre numerous times, but there has been no response; so we are meeting the Union food minister tomorrow,” said Ashu, who holds the portfolio of food and civil supplies minister. He is accompanying finance minister Manpreet Badal. Ashu added that the state government was hopeful of a positive response from the central minister. On October 30, the Centre had asked the state government to give justification for RDF, to which it was replied that it is very important and crucial for the rural development. As per a provisional cost sheet sent to the Punjab government last week, for giving taxes and incidentals on paddy procurement for the current season, clearance was given for dami (commission) of Rs 46 per quintal to commission agents (arhtiyas) and 3% mandi fee, but RDF was held back, seeking justification from the state government. “RDF is very important for us, especially when the revenues from all sources have shrunk due to Covid19 pandemic. We are hopeful that the Centre will accept our plea,” added Ashu, informing that it took more than a month to get an appointment from minister Goyal who took over the ministry after the death of previous incumbent Ram Bilas Paswan. What is RDF? The tax was imposed on purchase of wheat and paddy by an act of state assembly ‘RDF Act 1987’. It was increased from 2% to 3% in 2017 when Capt Amarinder Singh took over. The fund is under the purview of the rural development board which is headed by CM as ex-officio chairman. Mandi board manages usage of RDF, which is used on building and maintaining infrastructure in rural Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-punjab-ministers-to-meet-piyush-goyal-today-to-push-for-release-of-rural-devp-fund/story-FtP6nUp08LT5W4UCfhiu8K.html

Previously the central agency after raiding his premises in Mumbai and Thane last month had questioned him for several hours at ED office.Officers are now questioning him about the details on the business deals with Amit Chandole, a close associate of Sarnaik, and Tops Grup, that had surfaced during the interrogation of other suspects in the case, ED sources said.The ED had also summoned Sarnaik on Monday for the second round of questioning, however, the legislator didn’t appear before ED.Read more: Pratap Sarnaik-Topsgrup case: MMRDA denies allegations of irregularities in security contractsSarnaik and his family members have already secured relief from the Supreme Court that directed ED to not to take any coercive action against the Sarnaik’s family. ED had summoned Sarnaik’s both the sons, but only one appeared before the agency on Wednesday.In the past, ED had arrested Sarnaik’s close associate Amit Chandole and Nanda’s company’s managing director M Shashidharan. ED had stated that it appears that Tops Grup obtained a contract from Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) in collusion with Sarnaik through illegal means, by a well thought out strategy. The aim of these illegal manoeuvres was to get additional inadmissible benefit by inflating the bills at the cost of MMRDA and illegal cash gratification to Sarnaik for facilitating this scam. Against this active role and criminal conspiracy, Sarnaik received 50% profit, earned out of the said contract through Amit Chandole.The remand application of ED stated that in the year 2014, a contract was signed by TopsGrup Security Services Limited (TGSSL), with MMRDA, as per which, there were about 350 to 500 guards which were to be deployed at MMRDA sites on a monthly basis. Out of the same, only 70% of guards were actually deployed. However, the billing was done for all the guards as per contract.The MMRDA has refuted all the allegations in its say submitted to Mumbai police Economic Offenses Wing (EOW) which is also probing a case against TOPS Grup.MMRDA submitted that alleged irregularities in providing 500 security guards by (Rahul Nanda’s) Tops Grup Security Services Limited (TGSSL) are baseless. Instead, there was no 500 strength at any given time in three shifts a day, the authority said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-ed-questions-shiv-sena-mla-sarnaik-s-son-in-money-laundering-case/story-lZDRrzAB9etaSVEMK0000M.html

This may lead to problems for students taking online lessons from home due to the pandemic. Exams are round the corner and any disruption would have an impact on their studies,” said additional director general of police (ADGP, law and order) Ishwar Singh while asking the district police to persuade farmers to stop such disruptions.Senior superintendent of police Swarndeep Singh said special instructions have been issued to the district police to ensure that power supply to telecom towers continue. “PCR teams will be keeping a vigil in areas where the towers are located to ensure this,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vigil-up-as-farmers-snap-power-supply-to-telecom-towers-in-faridkot/story-RZmO6rmNZhBVUcWvUoZhxN.html
24-12-2020||Mumbai||Only 171 new colleges got AICTE approval in 2020-21||The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) approved 171 new institutes in the 2020-21 academic year, marking a 138% drop compared to last year when it gave approvals to over 945 institutes across professional courses. Experts say the lower number is due to the blanket ban on private engineering and pharmacy institutes across the country, despite year-on-year seat vacancy of up to 50%.According to AICTE, almost 70% of the institutes that were approved this year are government-run whereas in the past few years, private institutes have dominated engineering and pharmacy sectors. “While originally the ban on new engineering and pharmacy institutes was supposed to be until 2022, we received complaints and decided to go lenient on proposals for government-run engineering institutes only in those states where certain districts don’t have enough colleges for students,” said Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman, AICTE.This year, the maximum number of institutes have been approved under management programs, followed by engineering. However, under engineering programs, more than 75% of the approved institutes will be government-funded. This year, Maharashtra received approvals for seven institutes, which include five management institutes and two government-aided engineering institutes.Despite the yearly hike in management seats and institutes, experts feel the ongoing pandemic and delay in admissions process may result in professional courses seeing vacant seats this year. “In any recession or pandemic-like situation, unemployment usually goes up and this forces many youngsters to opt for higher education courses like MBA [master of business administration]. However, this year, due to the high number of uncertainties across sectors, colleges might have to brace for vacant seats because many are also unsure about being in a position to pay the annual fees,” said R K Srivastava, professor and head of Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship Education (SIMSREE).Earlier this year, HT had reported that 2020-21 had seen the highest number of closures for technical institutions in the last nine years, with 179 institutes shutting down. Another 44 institutes had withdrawn their approvals for the 2021 academic year and 762 professional institutes had applied for reduction of seats. All this brought down the total number of seats for professional courses across the country by over 2.63 lakh in 2020-21 compared 2019-20.Under AICTE’s blanket ban policy, not only were new institutes banned but additional seats in traditional engineering areas of mechanical, electrical, civil and electronics have also been banned. The committee further recommended that AICTE instead focus on existing institutes introducing undergraduate engineering programs in new-age courses such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, machine learning, data science and analytics, cloud computing and robotics. Since the two-year ban on new engineering institutes was implemented starting 2020, several institutes have sought permission to start new branches in these areas.“Several branches of engineering including civil and mechanical are attracting very few students of late due to the few job offers they get. The software industry, on the other hand, is continuously evolving and thus attracting good jobs and students,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal, Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, in Bandra. He added that reduced seats in redundant branches and giving boost to new dimensions in the field are being welcomed by engineering aspirants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-171-new-colleges-got-aicte-approval-in-2020-21/story-b0vFs2F21lW28ufBAQBNML.html

24-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: SSC, HSC supplementary exam results declared||The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) declared the results of Class 10 (SSC) and Class 12 (HSC) supplementary exams at 1pm on Wednesday. In the SSC exams, the state recorded a 32.60% result, a jump of about 10% points from that of 2019. Mumbai division which also consists of Thane, Raigad and Palghar recorded 29.88% result also witnessing a similar rise in the pass percentage. This year, a total of 41,397 students had appeared for the exams from the state. Of these, 12,646 were from the Mumbai region alone. In the HSC exams, the state recorded 18.41% result, a dip of about 5 percent points as compared to 2019. A similar trend was seen in the Mumbai division with 16.42% students passing the exam this year. A total of 69,274 students had appeared for the exams from the state of which 22,700 were from Mumbai division. The education department started supplementary exams in 2014 to ensure that students who fail the regular board exams, that are conducted in March, do not have to repeat an entire year. While the exams are usually conducted in the month of July-August, this year due to Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown, the exams were held in November-December. While SSC exams were conducted between November 20 and December 5, 2020, HSC exams were held between November 20 and December 10 across the state. This year, the number of students taking the exam had reduced by 80% and 47% for the SSC and HSC exams respectively. Teachers said that with the fear around the virus, very few students who failed the exams ended up filling forms for the supplementary exams. “There might be more applicants for the March series exam (which are planned post May 2021 due to the Covid-19 outbreak) as students would want to wait until cases reduce,” said the principal of a civic school in the western suburbs. Students who have cleared the SSC exam can apply for the additional admission rounds for first year junior college which are likely to be declared soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-ssc-hsc-supplementary-exam-results-declared/story-zIhE8UxT1WeBhvqhRuzvPN.html

He said that each grievance must be assigned a unique reference number and its receipt should be acknowledged within the next 24 hours. It should also be ensured that the grievance is resolved within the next 3-4 working days,” Gahlot said. Vehicle owners can apply through a single window for both the HSRP and colour coded sticker by logging www.siam.in or www.bookmyhsrp.com. For any grievance or queries, a user can call on 1800 1200 201 or write to hsrpquery@siam.in, grievance@bookmyhsrp.com and homegrievance@bookmyhsrp.com.Buoyed by the huge number of complaints from owners of vehicles registered in other states, the minister asked transport officials and SIAM to come up with a solution “as soon as possible” so that vehicles registered in other states can also apply in Delhi. The state transport department has been running a drive to challan and impose a fine of Rs 5500 on vehicle owners violating mandatory HSRP and color coded sticker norm. There are many vehicles in the city that are registered in other states where HSRP and sticker affixation are yet to take off. “We are exempting vehicles registered in other states and two-wheelers from the ongoing drive for now,” a transport official said. A statement from the transport department said that SIAM has agreed to resolve all issues before the next meeting scheduled on December 30.“SIAM has also been directed to scale up and strengthen home fitment facility so that public does not have to step out during the pandemic to get their HSRP affixed,” it said.Transport unions such as the state transport authority (STA) operators’s Ekta Manch, however, have demanded postponement of implementation of the HSRP affixation and sticker norms for at least one year. Shyamlal Gola, general secretary of the Union, said they have sought an appointment with minster Gahlot and are demanding slashing of the fine of Rs 5,500 as well.

24-12-2020||Delhi||North MCD approves loans for 8,000 street vendors||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has approved applications of loans of ₹10,000 for over 8,000 street vendors under the Prime Minister Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) Yojna. The civic body has proposed to provide small non-guarantee loans to nearly 15,000 street vendors to help them build their livelihood. The civic body has also established a special camp at Dussehra ground in Mukherjee Nagar to facilitate applicants for the loan process. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash on Wednesday also visited the SVANidhi Yojna camp to take stock of the enrolment process. According to civic officials, the north corporation has received 11,267 applications so far for the loan, of which 8,819 have been approved, while 631 are pending. The remaining 1,817 applications have been rejected on various grounds. Prakash said the PM SVANidhi scheme intends to facilitate collateral-free working capital loans of up to ₹10,000 of one-year tenure, to help vendors resume their businesses in urban areas, including surrounding peri-urban and rural areas. He said the scheme intends to benefit nearly five million street vendors across the country but the local body aims to target 15,000 people by the end of the year “We are proactively working for the scheme and would achieve our target of 15,000 by December 31, 2020. We are organising camps in each of the wards to facilitate street vendors specially in the weekly bazaar areas to assist the vendors in filling up letter of recommendation applications and loan applications. To spread awareness among street vendors about the scheme, special arrangements of public address systems, distribution of pamphlets and banners have also been made,” he said. The mayor added that Aadhaar enrolment and updation centres have been set-up in every zone to link mobile numbers with Aadhaar as the generated one-time pin (OTP) is sent to the cellphone number linked to the Aadhaar card.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-mcd-approves-loans-for-8-000-street-vendors/story-p3FlqQOMM93FA2TvB0iNeN.html
24-12-2020||Delhi||AAP offers legal assistance to farmers seeking action against derogatory remarks by BJP leaders||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said on Wednesday that it will provide legal assistance and support to farmer groups across states willing to file court cases against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders for allegedly using derogatory remarks against those protesting against the contentious farm laws. The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless” and hit back, saying that the AAP is trying to “divert attention from the plight of farmers in Delhi”. “Leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party have at different times described the farmers as terrorists, anti-nationals, goons, agents of Pakistan and China, etc. The farmers now want justice. It is evident that the entire BJP is strategically working to destroy and discredit the farmer movement with their relentless abuse,” said Raghav Chadha, national spokesperson of the AAP. Chadha, who is also MLA of Delhi’s Rajendra Nagar assembly segment, said: “ They now want to knock at the doors of the court for justice. Several farmers have reached out to the Aam Aadmi Party for help, for seeking justice. They want to avenge their insult. The AAP vows to extend its whole-hearted support and legal assistance to farmers across the country in this regard.” But leader of opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “It is a baseless allegation. No BJP leader has abused farmers. Parties like the AAP, on the other hand, have been misleading farmers on the issue. With this new gimmick, they are trying to divert attention from their own failures as a government in the Capital and plight of farmers in Delhi who still have to pay road tax on tractors, higher power charges for irrigation, and fail to sell their agricultural produce at the minimum support prices. I have asked questions on these issues in the special Assembly session last week which chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has yet not answered.” Meanwhile, a group of AAP supporters protested outside the residence of MP Ramesh Bidhuri in Lodhi Estate on Wednesday, accusing him of using derogatory remarks against protesting farmers groups and demanding an apology. “..BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri crossed all limits and abused the farmers. He must apologise and the central government must roll back the three contentious farm laws,” said AAP MLA Atishi, who led the protest. Ramesh Bidhuri said, “This is a totally baseless allegation. The AAP leaders twisted my words. What the AAP is doing to me and the BJP should be seen as an act of defamation and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has a record of apologising for such instances in the past. Right now, he is just trying to score brownie points by misleading farmers on the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-offers-legal-assistance-to-farmers-seeking-action-against-derogatory-remarks-by-bjp-leaders/story-59AT81OrQ6gJSMwI6g6WIJ.html
24-12-2020||Delhi||DDA to offer 1,210 flats in its new housing scheme in January||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Wednesday approved the proposal to launch a new housing scheme next year in January wherein 1,210 flats, mostly in high and middle income category, will be put on sale. This was approved along with other important proposals such as development control norms for unauthorised colonies and modification in the transit oriented development policy. The proposals were approved in a meeting, chaired by Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, on Wednesday.Delhi L-G tweeted, “Chaired meeting of Delhi Development Authority with VC, DDA @official_dda and other members. After detailed deliberations following key proposals were approved by the Authority: Development Control Norms for Unauthorised Colonies; Housing Scheme 2021, modification in Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Policy & Regulation, change of land use for TOD project at Trilokpuri, modification in UBBLs-2016 to promote Ease of Doing Business, disposal of Group Housing plots by e -auction.”Of the 1210 flats, 230 are high income group (HIG) flats in Dwarka and Vasant Kunj, 704 middle income group flats in Jasola and Dwarka and remaining in Manglapuri in Dwarka for economically weaker section category. A senior DDA official said that the 2021 housing scheme will be launched in January next year.After three unsuccessful housing schemes, the land-owning agency is hoping for a good response to its new housing scheme as these flats are spacious and located in areas which are well connected to the rest of the city.Last year, the DDA had put 18,000 flats, but had to reduce the number of flats in the scheme from to 10,294, as it didn’t get the desired response. The land-owning agency had received 45,012 applications for its flats, but it could sell only 8,438 flats—488 HIG, 1,555 in MIG, 5,172 in low income group (LIG) and 1,223 EWS category flats--- of which close to 6,000 flats have been returned, according to a senior official aware of the development.A year after the Centre started the process to give ownership rights to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has formulated the development control norms for these colonies. In a meeting chaired by Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Wednesday, the DDA gave preliminary approval to the development control norms for unauthorised colonies.According to senior DDA officials, the norms will pave the way for planned development in these colonies. Apart from this, several key proposals such as housing scheme for 2021, modifications in the Transit Oriented Development policy etc were also approved in the meeting.Last year, the Centre had passed the National Capital territory of Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Act, 2019, to confer ownership rights to residents in unauthorised colonies in Delhi. The Centre had directed the DDA to formulate norms for planned development in these colonies to improve the existing infrastructure.The DDA has revised the TOD policy and identified 12 nodes (locations) which will be developed as per the TOD norms wherein development will be done around the transit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dda-to-offer-1-210-flats-in-its-new-housing-scheme-in-january/story-NroiooC191VtElz5WyPpbM.html
24-12-2020||Delhi||Cabinet approves ordinance to protect unauthorised colonies||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved an ordinance, extending protection to unauthorised colonies, JJ clusters and constructions in Delhi’s rural areas built on agriculture land for another three years, Union minster Prakash Javadekar said on Wednesday.The NCT of Delhi (Special Provisions) Amendment Ordinance 2020 is an extension of a similar law first passed in 2011. When the 2011 law had expired, the government had in 2014 enacted the law again to grant a fresh extension.Since the law re-enacted in 2017 was ending soon and there was no winter session of Parliament, an ordinance was approved to extend the protection for another three years (till December 2023), Javadekar told reporters after the Cabinet meeting.The minister also said that the ordinance would have to be signed by the President before it comes into force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cabinet-approves-ordinance-to-protect-unauthorised-colonies/story-HACpQeyEryDI15PAWsZfSK.html
24-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality stays ‘severe’, IMD forecasts further drop in temperature this week||Air quality in the national capital continued to remain in the ‘severe’ zone for the second consecutive day on Wednesday as low winds and falling temperatures kept pollution levels high. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast a marginal improvement in the air quality on Thursday, but the air quality index (AQI) is likely to remain in the early end of the ‘severe’ zone. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that Delhi’s overall AQI on Wednesday was 433, up from 418 on Tuesday. In view of the deteriorating air quality in Delhi, the CPCB on Wednesday held a review meeting where they announced a slew of precautionary measures to prevent any further rise in pollution levels, including order hot-mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi to stay shut till January 2. The pollution monitoring body also ordered agencies concerned to increase the frequency of mechanised sweeping in all major roads and also directed agencies to step up dust mitigation measures. Senior CPCB officials said that even though the overall AQI has been in the ‘severe’ zone for two consecutive days now, but measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) will not be put in place in unless the levels of PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) consistently remain above the 300ug/m3 mark and PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) remains above the 500ug/m3 mark for 48 hours. At 7pm on Wednesday, it was 17 hours since PM 2.5 levels were above the 300ug/m3 mark, but PM10 levels were below the 500ug/m3 mark. Scientists said the pollution levels were higher because of low wind speed and the temperature, which was trapping the pollutants closer to the ground. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said that the wind speed did not pick up during the day which led to the accumulation of pollution particles. “The wind speed was largely calm through Wednesday, which led to an accumulation of pollutants closer to the surface. The forecast says that the AQI will remain in the severe zone on Thursday too,” Soni said. Soni added, “The prominent pollutant has been PM 2.5, the contribution of larger particles has been less, in the pollution over the last few days, has been.” He added that there is a possibility of marginal improvement in wind speed from December 25, which bring down the high levels of pollution. Meanwhile, the temperature will also continue to drop over the coming days in Delhi and the neighbouring cities. IMD recordings show that on Wednesday the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official recording for the city, was 4 degree Celsius. This was four degrees below the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 23.3 degree Celsius, two degrees above normal. At the Palam observatory, the minimum temperature was 7.1 degree Celsius, while in Ayanagar, it was 5 degree Celsius. IMD scientists said the minimum temperature is likely to remain the same on Thursday and start falling again from Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-air-quality-stays-severe-imd-forecasts-further-drop-in-temperature-this-week/story-3oqbDJLOZh5bmNvWhPV3EJ.html
24-12-2020||Delhi||Police prosecute six in central Delhi for causing noise pollution||The Delhi Police in the central district, recently armed with sound-level meters, have prosecuted six people causing noise pollution since Sunday.Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (central), said that while one such device was issued to all assistant commissioners of police a few weeks ago, the central district has started measuring the violation of the sound levels and has started prosecuting violators. Officers said this is the first time the city police have started using meters and booking people for this violation. The first person to be booked was a disc jockey in Chandni Mahal on Sunday who was allegedly playing loud music. “When we checked his sound level using the device, we found it to be 145.55 decibels,” Bhatia said.A motorcycle rider who had modified his vehicle’s silencer was another booked for noise pollution the same day. The DCP said the modified silencer’s noise was found to be 113.11dB of sound. Then, police near Jama Masjid booked an auto driver who was allegedly playing loud music in his vehicle at a level of 108.31 decibels. They were all booked under the Delhi Police Act and the Environment (Protection) Act, the officer said, adding that they were fined ₹5,000, but handed no jail term. Police said that as per law, there are different noise limits in separate zones during the day and night. Daytime is regarded as 6am-10pm, while 10pm-6am is considered nightime. Industrial areas have a limit of 75 decibels during the day and 70 at night. In commercial areas, the limit is 65 decibels during daytime and 55 at night, while in residential areas it is 55 and 45 respectively. And in silence zones, mainly around hospitals, schools and religious places it is 50 in the day time and 40 at nights. Experts said sounds louder than the prescribed limits can have serious health implications ranging from deafness to heart conditions to sleep disorder.While the DCP said it was the first time the Delhi Police has used this device, the traffic police have been issuing fines for pressure horns and loud music for a long time. “While pressure horns are easy to identify without a device, we were issuing those challans depending on how we manually perceived the sound levels,” Bhatia said. The officer said that the prosecutions using these devices will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-prosecute-six-in-central-delhi-for-causing-noise-pollution/story-bQzgeDvjWW6kmqCrQ2FeYL.html
24-12-2020||Delhi||Six districts in Delhi had higher positivity rate than city’s average during first 19 days of Dec: Govt tells high court||At least six of Delhi’s 11 districts reported a positivity rate higher than the city’s average of 3.25% during the first 19 days of December, according to data submitted by the state government in the Delhi high court. The highest average positivity rate was reported by northwest district at 4.75%, followed by southwest district (4.00%) and New Delhi district (3.51%), the data shows. The highest daily positivity rate reported during this period was in southwest district on December 1, when it saw a positivity of 7.99%. In the same period, Delhi’s daily positivity rate dipped from 6.85% to 1.30%. On Wednesday, Delhi saw a positivity rate of 0.99% — the lowest since the Delhi government releasing regular data on cases and tests. In comparison, the national average positivity rate stood at about 6.1%. Positivity rate or the proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested depicts the ongoing spread of the infection. Experts believe the spread of the infection to be under control when a positivity rate of 5% or less is maintained in an area for more than two weeks. The data was submitted to the high court on a petition seeking to ramp up testing in the capital. During the hearing on Dec 14, the bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad asked the Delhi government to ramp up testing in the districts that had seen a surge in the number of cases. “In the status report, you should indicate the districts in Delhi where number of cases have gone up. We expect you to increase the testing in those particular areas in districts where rate infection is higher. Doing random testing is one part, but if the focus is not on those particular areas, that won’t help,” the bench said. The court wanted to know the current situation while also seeking to know whether the government had started a fresh sero-survey. As per the data, northwest Delhi, which had the highest positivity rate, saw an increase of 1,863 between the average number of tests in the first week of December and the third week of December. For New Delhi district, the increase was of 1,468 between the first week and third week. As for southwest district, where the positivity rate was the second highest, the average number of tests dipped in week two and went up by only 101 between the first and third weeks, as per the data. “It is very encouraging to see that the positivity rate in Delhi has been going down consistently, especially since the government has increased the number of more accurate RT-PCR [reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction] tests. However, this does not mean that the government can scale down the number of tests. If the current number of tests is maintained and the positivity rate continues to remain low, it will instil confidence in people that the number of infections have gone down and to keep an eye out for future increase in the number of cases,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/six-districts-in-delhi-had-higher-positivity-rate-than-city-s-average-during-first-19-days-of-dec-govt-tells-high-court/story-XUyeSh19KA5y6QhDnGySzN.html
24-12-2020||Mumbai||Air India may refurbish seats of two Boeing 777 aircraft||Air India may refurbish seats of two of its Boeing 777 aircraft with seats pulled out from the two newly-acquired B777-300ER, which have been converted into VVIP aircraft. This task will be performed at Air India’s Nagpur maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility. Sources confirmed that though the work is yet to begin, the seats have arrived at the airline’s Nagpur facility from the United States of America (USA). In 2018, Air India had received two brand new B777s as part of a 2005 aircraft order. These were later converted and used for VVIP travel. The decade-old B747s that had previously been used for VVIP travel were converted back to regular seating and used in commercial operations.Airline sources said the de-configuration of these two aircraft is likely to be carried out soon by Air India’s Nagpur MRO facility. “This will help the airline [which had complaints for poor seat quality in these aircraft] to refurbish two of its old B777 aircraft,” a source said.A Nagpur-based source from Air India said over 650 seats have arrived at the Nagpur facility and work would commence this month. “It has been delayed due to some immediate issues that had to be taken care of on an immediate basis,” the official said. Air India did not respond to queries on this matter.The newly-acquired Boeing 777-300ER duo with the call sign Air India One landed in Delhi in October this year. Senior officials of Air India, security officers and senior government officials had visited USA in August to accept the delivery of the VVIP aircraft. The aircraft’s interior design was modified recently by Boeing and includes customisations. Air India One is used exclusively by the President, Vice President and Prime Minister.President Ram Nath Kovind boarded the inaugural flight of the Air India One-B777 aircraft on November 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ai-may-refurbish-seats-of-two-boeing-777-aircraft/story-idSz3yL5zkdl1GFMR4kDsK.html
24-12-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Positivity rate in Delhi falls below 1%||The national capital on Wednesday recorded a Covid-19 test positivity rate lower than 1% — the first time it achieved the milestone since the state government has started releasing regular data on the number of cases and tests, even as it added fewer than 1,000 new infections for the third straight day.Delhi reported 871 cases of the coronavirus disease on Wednesday, with over 87,000 tests conducted — a positivity rate of 0.99%. This is also the first time Delhi has added less than 1,000 cases for three straight days, since the city started seeing over 1,000 cases a day for the first time on May 28. At that time, the city was testing between 5,000 and 7,000 samples a day. Experts regard the positivity rate as a crucial metric to gauge the spread of an infection, and the World Health Organization recommends that a region with a comprehensive testing programme should maintain a positivity rate below 5% for two weeks, for an outbreak to be considered under control.“Yesterday [Tuesday], the positivity rate dropped to 1.14%, which is the lowest in eight months. And, today [Wednesday] we have seen that it has dropped to below 1%, which is probably the lowest in the country,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain during a press briefing on Wednesday. In comparison, the national average positivity rate stands at about 6.1%. Don’t need to vaccinate kids before sending them to school: Jain Health minister Jain on Wednesday also said it is not necessary to vaccinate children before sending them to schools. “It is not necessary to vaccinate the children before sending them to schools. The aim is to prevent the circulation of the virus in the community and to protect the vulnerable. In the first phase, the vaccine will be given to healthcare workers, front line workers, and those above the age of 50, or those who have comorbidities. The government is working on collecting the data of these persons,” he said. About 300 million people across the three priority groups were recommended to receive the vaccine first by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC). The Delhi government had insisted on keeping the schools and colleges in the state shut till a vaccine became available. This is mainly to prevent the children from carrying the virus back home and infecting the vulnerable members of the family, experts say. As for the new UK variant of the virus, the minister advised that people maintain mask discipline to prevent the spread of the infection. “Scientists say that the new UK variant spreads faster. However, the coronavirus is known to mutate over time and whether it is a UK variant, or the one from China, or the one from US, wearing a mask can prevent any of the strains from infecting a person. So, I urge people to continue to wear a mask. It was with the help of the people from Delhi that we have been able to control the spread of the infection,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-positivity-rate-in-delhi-falls-below-1/story-vejVJNdyWKb2P8jSlEEvNN.html
24-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt expedites process to launch cloud-based health info system||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal directed the health department to finalise the tender for a cloud-based health information management system (HIMS) at the earliest, during a review meeting on Wednesday. He was informed that the vendor is likely to be selected by February next year, with the system to be implemented by August next year. The central government has also announced an ambitious National Digital Health Mission that will digitise all patient records, where the ID will act “like a health care account” where a patient’s entire medical history will be available.The government plans to connect all its hospitals, dispensaries, polyclinics and mohalla clinics digitally. The comprehensive system will have a mobile app as well as a 24x7 call centre to help patients with health related information, seeking consultation and other assistance. The centralised call centre will provide two levels of help — the first where an operator will receive people’s calls and messages and provide information and the second where doctors and experts will provide appointments based on the problem or immediately provide solutions for an emergency case. The centralised centre is likely to have 45 seats, with five being for peak hours. There will be three shifts for people working in the centre: from 6am to 2pm, 2pm to 10pm, and 10am to 6pm. A QR code card provided to all Delhi residents will store basic demographic and health information of all residents, and help the government map all people eligible for its schemes. The HIMS will help the government deliver health care by bringing all patient-care services, hospital administration, budgeting and planning under the system. The system will initially connect the Delhi government health facilities, followed by other government health facilities, and will finally be extended to the private sector as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-expedites-process-to-launch-cloud-based-health-info-system/story-HgEu4thEATltlKhdw5NewM.html
24-12-2020||Delhi||Formulate SOPs for Covid complications: HC to Delhi govt||The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the Delhi government to formulate standard operating procedures (SOPs) to deal with post Covid-19 complications and to ensure that facilities are available to test and quarantine travellers from the UK where a new strain of Covid-19 has emerged.The petitioner, Rakesh Malhotra, a lawyer, told a bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad, that there should be some SOPs for managing post Covid-19 complications in those who have recovered from the infection.The bench noted that Malhotra, who had been infected by Covid-19, continues to face serious health issues.“The expert committee already constituted by the Delhi government shall examine the aspect and come up with a SOP, which will be given wide publicity,” the bench said.“Keeping in mind the recent decision of the Central government of suspending flights from UK to India till December 31 due to an apprehension of transmission of a coronavirus variant that can spread very fast and the fact that a large number of persons had flown into Delhi before suspension of flights from UK, Delhi government shall ensure prompt and adequate testing and follow up in respect of those found positive with all seriousness to avoid another spate of infection in the city,” the bench directed.During the hearing, the Delhi government’s counsel filed a status report which says that in a meeting held on December 21 by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), it was decided that the “representative testing” shall be done with the focus on pockets where the positivity rate is more.According to the status report filed by the Delhi government, as of December 19 the positivity rate was below 2 per cent in all districts except north-west where it was 2.12 per cent. It also detailed the district-wise positivity rate which had court had asked them on the last date.“The positivity rate in Delhi between December 11 and 20 shows that it has climbed down from 2.64 to 1.29. It may be emphasized that while following the representing testing, suggested by DDMA, Delhi government shall ensure that testing through RT-PCR remains higher than through RAT,” the court said in its order.The matter would be now heard on January 14, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/formulate-sops-for-covid-complications-hc-to-delhi-govt/story-r6exWciUQGSq2kHrRcZU6O.html
24-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt goes all out to trace UK returnees, test them||With no new passengers from the United Kingdom (UK) arriving in Delhi, the city’s district administrations on Wednesday went all out to track and trace those who came from the UK over the past four weeks. A senior official in the revenue department said around 14,000 passengers arrived at the Delhi airport since November 25 of which only around 1,500 are Delhi residents. “The number of Delhi-based passengers is not more than 1,500. On Tuesday, when we were first asked to track passengers who arrived over the past two weeks, the number of Delhi-based passengers of the 7,000 total arrivals was 1,246 only. Numbers and addresses of the 1,500 passengers are still being given out by the airport authorities which is immediately being relayed to the districts,” said a senior revenue official. HT reached out to all the 11 districts of Delhi of which five responded. As on Wednesday evening, these five districts had identified and tracked a total of 357 passengers who flew into the Capital from the UK since November 25. The south east district which covers areas such as New Friends Colony, Jor Bagh, Lajpat Nagar, Greater Kailash, Nizamuddin and Chittaranjan Park had 94 passengers who came from the UK during the said period — the highest from among the districts of which data was available.“RT-PCR tests of most of the 94 passengers identified have been conducted and results are awaited. While tracking these people, we found that one passenger who arrived from the UK on December 12 had later tested positive after six days in Delhi on December 18. So, we immediately sent the Covid-19 positive person to the dedicated ward built at Lok Nayak Hospital. This ward is meant for only those passengers who came from the UK. The person’s sample has been sent for genome sequencing as well and result of whether it is the new strain of coronavirus is expected in 3-4 days,” said a senior official of the southeast district on condition of anonymity.The contacts of the person have opted for the paid quarantine facility at Aloft Hotel in Aerocity which has been designated for Covid-19 quarantine by the New Delhi district administration, the official said. For contacts of any UK returnee testing positive, the government’s free institutional quarantine facility has been created at Terapanth Bhawan in South Delhi’s Chhatarpur area. After the Central government released a fresh standard operating procedure (SOP) for tracking, testing and isolating UK returnees, Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev issued a fresh order on Wednesday asking all stakeholders in Delhi to ensure “strict compliance” to the guidelines. “This variant has an unusually large number of genetic changes particularly in the spike protein and therefore, requires enhanced epidemiological surveillance, enhanced containment and other measures to effectively tackle the challenge,” read the chief secretary’s order seen by HT. The New Delhi district said it has identified 74 passengers so far of which RT-PCR results of 46 persons arrived till Wednesday evening and all tested negative.The east district said it traced 55 UK returnees in its area of which Covid-19 results of 15 had arrived and all were negative. The tracking and testing process of UK returnees which began from Tuesday, however, is still on and was mired with some errors or confusion on day one, officials on condition of anonymity said. In some cases, it is the alertness of the passengers which is preventing a possible spread of the new strain of the virus.“One of the five UK returnees who tested positive at the IGI airport on Tuesday was from the east district. The person was taken to Safdarjung hospital. But there was some miscommunication and Safdarjung hospital released him prescribing home isolation. Then the alert Covid-19 passenger himself came into the government’s Arogya hospital in east district and that is how he came under the city’s Covid surveillance system. He was later shifted to the dedicated ward in Lok Nayak hospital on Tuesday night itself,” said a senior health official. The west district said it has identified 67 passengers who flew in from December 6 and that the number will increase further as they trace back to November 25. “It is not an easy task. Of the 67 passengers, we have been able to trace 60. The remaining 7 are all international residents with addresses of Delhi. Upon visiting the address, we find they are not there or have gone to some other state. Of the 60 people, samples of 42 passengers have been picked up and results of 17 have come. All are negative so far,” said a senior official of the west district. Similarly, the south west district had a list of 89 passengers, but it could track and trace only 67 due to the same problem. Of the 67, RT-PCR tests of 32 were done as on Wednesday evening and all were negative. Officials of the south west district said many passengers end up arguing with medical teams over getting RT-PCR tests done at a government facility.“In some cases, people are saying that we got RT-PCR tests done after arrival through private laboratories in Delhi as well, so there is no need to get it done again. We explain it to them that getting an RT-PCr test done within a day or two of arrival does not necessarily mean they might not have the infection as the virus takes at least five days to be noticed in the RT-PCR test. So, we are convincing them to undergo the test. If the test has been conducted a day or two ago, that still makes sense,” said member of the surveillance team in south west district. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said the government is alert and responding responsibly. “We are alert and watchful at our end. People who have arrived here from the UK in the last several days are being rigorously traced and tested for slightest of Covid-like symptoms.” “A team has been made and house-to-house tracing is being done... they (UK returnees) are being advised self-isolation too,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-goes-all-out-to-trace-uk-returnees-test-them/story-r6AWc8jUwnQsnocztYO2LL.html

24-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG planning to construct an indoor stadium in Sector 23||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is planning to construct an indoor sports stadium in Sector 23, opposite Palam Vihar.As per MCG officials, the indoor stadium will have facilities for sports such as badminton, table tennis, boxing, wrestling and kabaddi, among others.The MCG has already got an approval from its finance and contract committee (F&CC) for the project and work on preparing a detailed project report (DPR) has started.The project is part of MCG’s bigger objective of establishing a sports stadium in each of its four zones. Sector 23 falls under MCG’s Zone-2.“We have already got clearance from the F&CC on the matter. The project will cost us around ₹2.5 crore and the stadium will be entirely centrally air-conditioned,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.The official further said that as per the plan, a medical room will also be established inside the stadium for ensuring basic first aid to the athletes.Among the key points that the DPR will address is the parking facility and source of electricity. MCG officials said that they are exploring the option of installing solar panels on top of the stadium that will help in the running of the stadium lights, central air conditioning system, and other electricity equipment.MCG officials said that it will take them around three months to compile the DPR and subsequently tenders for the project will be floated.During a house meeting in August 2018, the MCG approved an agenda for constructing a sports stadium in each of its four zones. In another house meeting in September last year, MCG officials disclosed that, as per their planning branch’s report, a city needs a stadium measuring at least 10 acres to cater for a population size of 300,000-500,000.The report further highlighted that the city’s population is projected to increase to 4.2 million by 2031 and, overall, the city needs eight stadiums to cater to the needs of the residents.The city has two stadiums — Tau Devi Lal Stadium in Sector 38 and Nehru Stadium near Civil Lines.In MCG’s own master plan, areas in sectors 9, 23, 64, 72, 89, 91, and 102 have been identified as potential locations where stadiums can be constructed.“Sports is a key part of any city. To facilitate in this endeavour, MCG is constantly looking to develop infrastructure so that residents have an option for recreational activities while athletes can also use it to further hone their skills,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-planning-to-construct-an-indoor-stadium-in-sector-23/story-5hd4jXzZjp5ErN8En0btNP.html
24-12-2020||Gurugram||HSVP gets approval for auto market in Sector 10||After a long delay, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has finally got approval for setting up an auto market in Sector 10 of the city. The project will be developed over 32 acres of land, which is free of encroachment and it will have shops and repair areas for vehicles. The market will have bays for large and small vehicles, where these can repaired without causing any traffic congestion, said HSVP officials. Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP, said that they have got an in-principal approval for the auto market and the broad contours of the project have been finalised. This will help in executing the project in a short time, said Yadav. “There would be shops for auto parts owners, workshops and other such services in the market. Adequate space will be made available so that the roads are not encroached on. The revised plan for the market has been submitted by department of town and country planning and it is being sent to headquarters for approval,” said Yadav. The market will have a single entry and exit and the roads will be of 24 metres and 18 metres in width. It is being designed in such a manner that vehicles can move with ease, said officials. The market will also be self-sustaining with adequate amenities so that there is minimum impact on the adjoining residential areas, they added. Yadav said that they have identified auto shops and spare parts owners on Sheetla Mata Road, Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road and Old Jail Complex, who will be initially given an opportunity to own shops in the auto market. “The presence of so many shops and workshops on these roads leads to congestion. Shifting to the auto market will help in reducing these problems,” said Yadav. The department, however, still has not figured out the rate at which these shops would be allotted to the auto traders but it is expected that they would be given an incentive in price to ensure that they shift to the market. The auto market in Gurugram has been delayed by almost two decades and the project was originally planned to come up on a 55-acre plot in Sector 10. It remained stuck due to encroachment and litigation, said officials. The issue has been raised by CAG in its report on 2015 and it was also raised subsequently in the state assembly. Yadav, however, said that this time the plan was concrete and would be executed on the ground in next six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-gets-approval-for-auto-market-in-sector-10/story-tNiC5BN2HGESHcT42BrI0O.html

24-12-2020||Pune||Pune records its third warmest Dec of the decade||While the city saw a dip in mercury with 8.3 degrees Celsius on Wednesday night, December has also been the third warmest month in the last decade. Over the years, there is a steady rise in night temperature with December 2019 reporting the warmest in the decade with 13.7 degrees Celsius as the season’s lowest. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), said that such types of variations happen from year to year. “It is called inter-annual variability. This happens every year. This year, the weather was hotter due to climate change. For Pune, the local orography contributes to the local phenomenon. There will be no more drop in temperature for December. There will be temperature drop further in January. Month to month and from place to place, the meteorological parameters vary,” said Kashyapi. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of private weather forecasting agency Skymet, said that there are cold wave conditions across India, but the intensity and frequency of cold waves is reducing. “If we see in the last decade or so, the severity of cold waves are increasing. Duration of cold wave is reducing due to climate change. Every New Year is hotter than colder. All extreme weather events are increasing for rain, heat wave and cold wave. There is an increase in extreme weather. We can see a steadily rising graph of overall temperatures,” said Palawat. He said that there will be an increase in case there is not any immediate measure taken to tackle climate change. “If the greenhouse gases are reduced then we can see a downward trend. But even for that, we need to dedicatedly work for the next decade before the global average temperature is maintained or reduced,” said Palawat. Pleasant day and night ahead of Christmas After two days of cold weather in the city, IMD has forecasted a relief with normal day and temperature for the next few days. “The day temperature will be around 28 degrees Celsius and the night temperature will be around 9 degrees to 10 degrees Celsius in the next few days. The weather in the state will also continue to remain dry with no drop in temperature,” said IMD officials.

Lonavla and Mulshi within the district, and Mahabaleshwar and Konkan are their top destinations. “We have booked a resort in Lonavla for the weekend starting from December 25 to 27. As we cannot celebrate Christmas with the family this year because of the night curfew, plan is to go out of Pune,” said Sandeep Ovhal, an IT engineer from Hadapsar. Rohit Mehta and his friends plan to travel to Mahabaleshwar for the year-end. “For the last eight months, we are at home studying for our exams and other entrance tests. Now we want to celebrate the New Year and forget all the tensions due to Covid-19 pandemic as we have already suffered a lot. We have booked a studio apartment for four days at Mahabaleshwar. We college friends are going to enjoy as there won’t be any restrictions of night curfew and other rules on our celebrations.” Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh had said that considering the possibility that revellers may attend parties outside municipal limits, the administration will take appropriate steps. “We have considered all these aspects and necessary steps will be taken. We also discussed the issue on Tuesday during a video conferencing with the chief minister,” said Deshmukh. Ashok Chaudhary, a tourist hotel owner in Lonavla, said, “We are getting many enquiries daily from Pune and Mumbai for bookings during Christmas and year- end days. Half of our rooms are already booked for the season like other hotels and resorts in the hill station. Tourists won’t be able to go out in the night for celebrations if the night curfew is imposed in Lonavla.” Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “I already had meeting with senior police officials from Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad areas and today again we met with the task force team. We are thinking about extending night curfew to tourist places in the district, but a decision is yet to be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/tourists-spots-outside-pune-limits-in-demand-for-bookings-due-to-night-curfew/story-4MsB8mIp6NiGicMgEBCbXM.html
24-12-2020||Pune||Early screening key to cure cervical, breast cancer: experts||As per the National Health Survey (NHS), only 3.8 per cent women between the ages of 30-49 years in Pune district have undergone screening for cervical cancer. The figure for breast cancer screening in the district for the same age group is 2.3 per cent. Experts note that early screening and detection is vital in reducing the mortality rate for cancer. Speaking about breast and cervical cancer, Pune-based surgical oncologist Dr Snita Sinukumar said that early cervical and breast cancer detection help patients to beat the ailment. “If a patient comes to us at advanced stages, the treatment modality is chemotherapy and radiation. We advise that every woman above the age of 21 years should get screened for cervical cancer. As cervical cancer has a higher rate of mortality, early detection definitely helps. At early stages we can offer a cure to the patients,” said Dr Sinukumar. She emphasised that screening is an important tool. “The whole idea of screening is to test healthy individuals. Routine health check-ups only help identify any abnormalities in the report,” said Dr Sinukumar. She said that breast cancer has a lower mortality as there are a variety of treatment modalities for it. Dr Rakesh Neve, surgical oncologist with city-based Columbia Asia hospital, said that breast cancer accounted for 31.4 per cent of all cancers in women in Pune and cervical cancer 10.6 per cent. “The mortality rates for cancer remains high. For breast cancer, it is around 50 per cent and for cervical cancer, it is around 60 per cent. Early detection ensures diagnosis in stage one or two where cure rates are over 95 per cent,” said Dr Neve. He said that screening helps identify cancers early and early detection gives possibility of cure. “So, it is important to ensure screening covers maximum population,” said Dr Neve. As per NHS, women undergoing screening for cervical cancer is as low as 2.3 per cent in Maharashtra. The screening for breast cancer is also on a lower end with only 1.3 per cent women undergoing screening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/early-screening-key-to-cure-cervical-breast-cancer-experts/story-SpmELBN47oqE9megCxNZfL.html
24-12-2020||Pune||No plans for night curfew in Lonavla, other tourist destinations: Rural SP||The Pune rural police are undecided and presently have no plans to impose “night curfew” in their jurisdiction under which Lonavala hill station and other party destinations are situated. Pune Rural SP Abhinav Deshmukh said, “We do not have any such plans as of now. Currently, there is no restriction of movement in the rural parts of the district.” Social media and online discussion forums were abuzz with the likely move of the rural police to stop residents from mass partying at the popular holiday destination which comes under the rural police jurisdiction. A number of revellers from Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Mumbai find Lonavla an apt party destination for the New Year. The hill station also sees visitors from other states, including Gujarat, during this period.According to local residents, family bookings, including those of party destinations like villas and bungalows, have started in advance. Hoteliers who were looking forward to welcome visitors after a dull eight-month season are apprehensive about the possible night curfew and restrictions.Sakshi Kumar, a youngster from Baner, said, “We have already booked a place in Lonavla for New Year celebrations for seven of us. The news of party restrictions on social media and WhatsApp is a dampener. We don’t want restrictions to be imposed just because a section of people want it and the police must not act under pressure from different quarters.” The representatives of a few three and five star hotels in Lonavla said that New Year celebrations will not take place at their properties.Manas Garg, a software professional who has booked a private place in Lonavla said, “We have received a positive response from the owner of the place, but with the imposition of night curfew in corporation areas, citizens are demanding the same be implemented in rural areas which is likely to spoil our yearend plans.” The Maharashtra government has announced that a seven-hour night curfew would be put in place across all cities and municipal corporation areas in the state from December 22 from 11pm to 6am for 15 days until January 5, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-plans-for-night-curfew-in-lonavla-other-tourist-destinations-rural-sp/story-Q6DCXq2dx97J7ZvMHPfa7M.html

Smart devices, old and new, have been distributed to students from municipal schools and government schools in Mumbai, Palghar, Karjat and Pune.“Christmas is the season of gifting our loved ones. With the help of social media, we are asking people to gift a device and be a Santa to the student,” said Malaika Shivalkar, 20, co-founder of the project.“So far we have provided 215 devices and reached out to over 1,000 students through the initiative. Over the past four months, we have realised that the number of students, who require a smart device to attend online classes, is far greater than the number of devices we have distributed,” said Shivalkar who is pursuing her undergraduate law degree at National Law University, Jodhpur. She launched the initiative along with her younger brother Ishaan and friends Anoushka Jaipuria, Natalia Mistry and Malini Dasgupta.Read more: Thane teachers go the extra mile to help their studentsThe students used social media to crowdsource the devices. “In case anybody wants to donate an old device, we arrange for pick up and drop. For those who want to sponsor a new device, we ask the donor to make the payment to our vendor. The devices are then distributed every week,” said Shivalkar.Following the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, schools and colleges adopted an online mode of instruction, for the safety of students. However, access to smartphones and internet connectivity, particularly in areas around the city, has been a concern.While the number of requests for these devices is swelling, Project Pahunch has restricted the distribution to Class 10 and 12 students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-students-gift-smartphones-to-underprivileged-kids/story-RxJXkHXqfjHkeWY3DwP90K.html
