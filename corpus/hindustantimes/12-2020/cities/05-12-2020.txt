05-12-2020||Chandigarh||Sports associations to conduct social audit of devp projects in Ludhiana||Punjab cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Saturday said that social audit of sports projects in the city will be mandatory.Monitoring committees which will comprise members of various sports associations will be formed to oversee the projects, he added.The decision was taken during the meeting conducted by cabinet minister Ashu, mayor Balkar Sandhu, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal and deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma regarding the development projects with members of different sports associations at Bachat Bhawan on Saturday. The sports associations had earlier raised concern that their non-involvement while taking up development projects will result in the establishment of white elephants like the indoor stadium on Pakhowal road. The meeting was organised to get their suggestions/objections regarding the projects being taken up by MC under Smart City Mission. Representatives of sports associations including swimming, sports, hockey, basketball, weightlifting, martial arts and football took part. The projects which were discussed include transforming the open basketball courts at Guru Nanak Stadium (project cost Rs 9.42 crore), upgrading Shastri hall at Guru Nanak stadium (Rs 3.14 crore), developing an all weather swimming pool near Rakh Bagh (Rs 5.77 crore), developing a sports park in Jainpur (Rs 50 crores) and repairing astroturf, hockey stadium and a cycling velodrome (cycling track) at PAU. Also, a new table tennis court is coming up near Rakh Bagh, the architectural layout for which has been prepared. The members, including Hockey Olympian Hardeep Singh Grewal and Rajinder Singh from cycling association, said that involvement of sports associations in these projects is a must otherwise there will be many loopholes in the works despite spending a hefty amount. Rajinder said that if the associations are not involved, MC will end up constructing more project like the indoor stadium on Pakhowal road, which is not financially and technically feasible for sports association to use. Members of the weight lifting and martial arts associations said that nothing much has been planned for the development of their respective games.Ashu said, “MC has to float tenders for these projects and this meeting was organised to get suggestions/objections from sports associations as they are aware of the needs of athletes. Their feedback will be incorporated by MC team and consultants, following which the projects will be taken up. More meetings will be held in the coming time to develop infrastructure in the city for all games/sports.”Jainpur sports park to have international level facilities: Ashu During the meeting, there was a detailed discussion on the construction of the sports park in Jainpur area (1.5 kms from Ayali Khurd bridge on Sidhwan Canal). It is being established over an area of 32 acres at a cost of around Rs 50 crore. The land was earlier being used as a garbage dump.The sports park will have playgrounds for cricket, football and hockey, as well as an astroturf, Olympic-sized swimming pool, Olympic-sized football ground along with a synthetic athletics track, four acrylic basketball courts, four lawn tennis astroturf courts, three Olympic-sized volleyball courts, four lane outdoor archery range, 50m indoor shooting range, six badminton courts, two squash courts, two boxing rings, four table tennis tables, two wrestling rings and a weightlifting complex. Also, there will be a 3.5-km long and 15-feet wide cycling and pedestrian track. Besides this, the sports park will have a club area with refreshment lounge, children zone and yoga pavilion.Ashu said that the sports park will also have the first parkour park of the state. Apart from providing the sports facilities, focus will also be on promoting solar energy and encouraging cycling among the visitors, he added. Cycle on rent facility will also be provided at the park, Ashu said. 13-km long cycling track proposedWith rising demand for cycling tracks in the city, the district administration has proposed a 13-km long cycling track alongside Ladhowal Bypass. Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma has forwarded the proposal to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).During the meeting, a discussion was also held to upgrade the cycling velodrome at PAU. Cyclist Rajinder Singh submitted a suggestion that rather than spending more on the existing velodrome, MC should establish a new structure.Singh said that the length of existing velodrome is 333.33 metres, however, it should be 250 metres as per international standards. Ashu said that MC will conduct a meeting with cycling association regarding the same in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sports-associations-to-conduct-social-audit-of-devp-projects-in-ludhiana/story-bhxzzCb71CuESxtcr2EJiP.html
05-12-2020||Chandigarh||Taken in by promise of expensive gifts, Ludhiana woman duped of ₹1.4 lakh||A woman was duped of ₹1.4 lakh by a prospective suitor who asked her pay the amount to the customs department in order to clear an expensive gift sent to her from New York. Two of the accused have been identified as Ranbir Singh and Rustom of Maa Shimla Homes, Kharar.The victim, Jaspreet Kaur, 34, of Rajguru Nagar, said she had met the accused, who called himself Chetan Bhagat and said he stayed in New York, on a matrimonial site. Bhagat said he wanted to come visit her and was also bringing an expensive present for her. Later, he told the complainant that all flights had been cancelled due to the pandemic but he had sent a parcel containing a valuable gift and she should get it cleared from the customs department. A few days later, Kaur received a phone call from a woman claiming to be a customs officer who asked her to deposit ₹1.4 lakh in an account as custom fee to clear the parcel. When Kaur deferred to Bhagat, he asked her to pay the fee and promised to return the sum after her returned to India. When Bhagat stopped responding to her messages and she did not receive any parcel, she realised she had been conned and filed a police complaint. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, investigation) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said the accounts to which the money had been transferred to belonged to Rambir and Rustom and a search was on to nab them. She said it was possible that the crime had been committed by an organised gang that has duped several other people. A case was registered under Section 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal appealed people to not share their bank details, PIN Code and other details with anybody. He also appealed people to send complaints pertaining to cyber crimes to cp.ldh.police@punjab.gov.in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/taken-in-by-promise-of-expensive-gifts-ludhiana-woman-duped-of-1-4-lakh/story-NEUsA63OnzxHx0yqY9GQ4I.html
05-12-2020||Kolkata||‘Sycophants are given importance’: Another TMC minister shows signs of disgruntlement||A day after Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee sent a stern warning to rebels within the ruling party in West Bengal, a minister of her cabinet showed signs of disgruntlement on Saturday. “Whenever I tried to prove my competence and skill, I was relegated to the back seat. I don’t know what happened. Corrupt leaders, liars and those who do not enjoy the confidence of people are being brought to the forefront just because they are sycophants,” said Rajib Banerjee, state forest minister, who is known for his clean image.He is the second minister of the TMC-ruled government to express his dissatisfaction. Earlier, state transport minister and TMC heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari had resigned from his posts and launched a veiled challenged at the TMC leadership, widening his rift with the party. “It hurts me when I see that those who have the competence and dexterity and are working on ground standing amidst people are not given any importance. Instead, those sitting in AC chambers and thinking that they would be able to fool the people are occupying the front seats,” he added. This is, however, not the first time that Rajib Banerjee has spoken out against corruption. Earlier this year, he had said the party’s drive against in-house corruption should be aimed at not only ‘’small fries’’ but also against ‘’big fish’’. A senior minister, however, hit out at Banerjee, accusing him of echoing BJP’s stance. Also read: ‘BJP out again to topple my govt,’ alleges Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot“This is the age of sycophants. But people don’t like these things. People elect their political leaders with many aspirations. But when they see that the leader is a sycophant, they refuse to accept him. Some people are not being able to feel the pulse of the people,” he said, adding that if leaders think people are fools then they are living in a fool’s paradise. Even as the TMC is desperately trying to fix the chinks in its armour, more gaps are appearing with one after another leader speaking out against the party. “Those who have minimum self-respect left within them, will not be able to work in the TMC. It is because in the TMC party, only those who hail from a particular house in Kalighat are allowed to become leaders. The rest who gave their sweat and blood will always remain as employees,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of the BJP’s Bengal unit. Earlier while Mihir Goswami, a TMC MLA had switched over to the BJP, Silbhadra Dutta another TMC MLA from Barrackpore lashed out against poll strategist Prashant Kishor’s team without naming it. Kishor was roped in by the TMC leadership after the BJP made some impressive gains in the 2019 elections. BJP leaders have already named at least seven MPs and MLAs, claiming that it is just a matter of time before the lawmakers from the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal resign from the party and join the BJP.“Mamata Banerjee has sent a loud and clear message to all rebels within the party. If they need to stay within the party they will have to work for the party. Those speaking against the party will not be tolerated. She, however, didn’t name any leader,” said a senior TMC leader who attended the virtual meeting held by Banerjee with TMC leaders from across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/sycophants-are-given-importance-another-tmc-minister-shows-signs-of-disgruntlement/story-dVEpgFlDQGp4d3YTcsl8kI.html
05-12-2020||Gurugram||GMDA to develop Gurugram’s first parking app||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is planning to develop the city’s first dedicated app for parking that will allow residents to find the nearest parking lot, know the number of parking spots available, and to book parking spots in advance, said officials on Saturday. In October, GMDA had directed the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), Public Works Department (PWD), and Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) to survey vacant plots in their respective jurisdictions with the aim of potentially converting them into park lots. As per GMDA officials privy to the matter, the departments have submitted a list of at least 80 such sites for this purpose and the geographic information system (GIS) mapping of the same has been initiated.GMDA officials said that sites which would be finalised for parking purposes would subsequently be uploaded in this app under development, which would help residents to know vital details such as the parking lot closest to their current location and the total number of available parking spaces in each site, along with providing them with the option of advance booking. Further, the app will also reflect key information such as a city-wide standard parking fare under GMDA’s parking policy to ensure that the parking contractors are not overcharging residents while the digital issuance of parking tickets will ensure that all revenue is accounted for and the possibilities of embezzlement of funds are minimised.“We have received relevant details of vacant plots for the purpose of turning them into parking lots from various public departments. The process of finalising the sites is in the process. Simultaneously, we are also working on developing an app that would reflect all key details under a single window, allowing residents to avail parking facilities in the city seamlessly,” said a GMDA official privy to the matter.Officials further said that all existing government parking lots would also be integrated into the app and showcase all aforementioned relevant details.In a city of more than 20 lakh residents, there are only 15 sanctioned HSVP parking lots, and a solitary multilevel parking in Sector 29. Therefore, parking remains a major crisis in the city. Many residents opt to use the main carriageway or service lanes near markets, malls, and eateries to park their vehicles illegally which often results in snarls especially in areas such as MG Road, Galleria Market, Sohna Road, and Golf Course Road.“Parking apps have now been developed in many cities across the country. The objective of such parking apps is to ensure that the parking demand does not exceed more than the total supply. The app should not be limited to being an information tool but also highlight the exact points where the sanctioned parking lots are situated. This can be achieved via GPS navigation to ensure that commuters do not end up parking in unauthorised areas,” said Sewa Ram, an urban transport system design expert and a faculty member at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA). “Further, all the city’s sanctioned parking should be linked and integrated in such a manner that it automatically directs a commuter to the nearest parking lot when the demand for a particular parking lot is nearing its total capacity,” he said. He further said that the app should also display commonly known illegal or unauthorised parking areas to caution commuters in advance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-to-develop-gurugram-s-first-parking-app/story-DQEhNH5oE8rZAflPfeHiTI.html
05-12-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram records less than 400 Covid-19 cases for the first time in over a month||At least 394 new Covid-19 infections were confirmed in the district on Saturday taking the tally to 51,840, according to the district health bulletin. This is the first time in the last 38 days that Gurugram has recorded less than 400 new Covid-19 infections in a single day. Senior health officials attribute the decline in the new Covid-19 cases over the last one week to the aggressive testing conducted across the city. On Saturday, more than over 10,000 tests were conducted in the district.Data shows that on October 28, the district health department had identified 397 new cases. Since then, there has been a consistent upward trend in new infections. The slump in new cases, however, became visible from November 29 onwards with daily average cases hovering around 460 — far lower than the 726 daily average cases in the first half of November. The weekly test positivity rate — total positives out of the samples collected for testing — has come down to nearly seven percent from almost 18 percent recorded in the first half of November. The test positivity rate along with a high recovery rate in the last one week has also led to a decline in the number of active cases, which have been reduced to 3,792 from 6,367 recorded on November 28. “A significant increase in testing in the last two weeks has helped in lowering the positivity rate,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO). On Saturday, a total 10,002 Covid-19 tests were administered. Of which 8,625 were Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). It is for the third time that the district health department conducted more than 10,000 Covid-19 tests. On November 21, at least 10,200 tests were carried out, followed by 25,101 tests on November 28. In the last two weeks, at least 1,06,659 tests have been conducted, almost 40 percent higher than the cumulative sum of 64,135 tests conducted in the previous two weeks (from November 8 till November 21). “Regular testing camps and increased RT-PCR have helped in identifying new cases. On Saturday too, 21 camps were being held. Daily testing will continue to remain above 5,000 until there is a further downfall,” said Yadav, The decline in new cases has also led to the downfall in seriously ill patients requiring hospitalisation. As per the health bulletin, 262 people were admitted in hospitals. It exceeded above 400 in November. Presently, out of the active cases, at least 3,515 positive patients are home-isolated. The Covid-19 toll stands at 314 with four deaths on Saturday, out of which 243 were due to co-morbidity and 71 without co-morbidity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-records-less-than-400-covid-19-cases-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-month/story-lzH0a4amaO5q2QZn8T8vnM.html
05-12-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram doctors to protest against decision to allow Ayurveda practitioners to perform surgery||Over 400 doctors in Gurugram are likely to withdraw all non-essential and non-Covid-related services and hold demonstration for two days next week as part of a nationwide protest by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) against the Central Council of Indian Medicine’s (CCIM) decision to allow Ayurveda practitioners perform surgeries.On November 19, a notification was issued by the Ayush ministry on the amendments made to the Indian Medicine Central Council (PG Ayurveda Education) Regulations, 2016 that allowed postgraduate students of Ayurveda to practice general surgery. The new amendments allow Ayurveda postgraduates to get trained in 58 surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology, orthopedics, dental procedures, among others. It also permits them to perform the surgeries after the completion of their degrees.Opposing the move, the Gurugram chapter of IMA will be holding a protest on December 8 and will withdraw non-essential OPD services on December 11. “Following the safety guidelines in the wake of Covid-19, the protest will be held in groups of 20 people each across different locations from 12 noon till 2pm on December 8. Likewise, OPD services (non-essential and non-Covid) will be withdrawn from 6am till 6pm on December 11. All emergency services including the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) will be functional,” said Dr Ajay Gupta, secretary, IMA, Gurugram.According to the statement issued by the IMA, the CCIM’s decision on postgraduate Ayurveda surgery and the entitlement to study and practice medicine independently can be seen as another step in advancing legitimising “mixopathy” of medical science.Dr Rajan Sharma, national president, IMA, called it a mixopathy practice, and said, “We are not against any particular stream of medicine. But the move by CCIM in the Covid-19 times to mix the streams is not justified. Doctors go through years of rigorous training and continue to get trained even after finishing their education.”He said that at least 674 doctors across the country have died this year while treating Covid-19 cases. “The move by the government is a mockery of their contribution to the society,” he added.The Ayush ministry, however, in its official statement issued on November 22 clarified that there is no ‘mixing’ of Ayurveda with conventional (modern) medicine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-doctors-to-protest-against-decision-to-allow-ayurveda-practitioners-to-perform-surgery/story-VpKCsAJWAyJ6Azuw2q2kON.html

Not only that, even the case fatality rate (CFR) in the district has been maintained below 0.40% for the past three months, shows the data from the state health department. According to the data, among the districts having over 23,000 positive cases in Uttar Pradesh, only Prayagraj has better recovery rate of 95.93% than that of GB Nagar. In terms of case fatality rate (CFR), GB Nagar’s CFR of 0.35% is the best among the seven districts having over 20,000 cases. Among the districts of Meerut division, GB Nagar’s CFR of 0.35% (83 deaths among 23,170 cases) is the lowest. While Ghaziabad’s CFR is 0.39% (93 in 23,551), Baghpat has 1.52% (30 deaths in 1,968 cases), Bulandshahr 1.54% (86 in 5,580), Hapur 1.62% (64 in 3,948) and Meerut has CFR of 2.10% (412 in 19,590). GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that early and timely tracking and providing adequate treatment are the main goals before the administration. “Despite having adequate beds for Covid-19 patients, all private and government hospitals have been asked to increase the number of beds in their intensive care units (ICU) and high dependency units (HDU),” he said. The DM also said that further spread of viral infection can’t be ruled out. “But, our focus is on reducing the number of deaths and curing the maximum number of infected patients possible on time. For that, we have adapted the ‘tracking, testing and treating’ methodology in which we are ensuring maximum contact tracing, testing nearly 4,000 people every day and treating infected patients as per symptoms. While recovery rate in GB Nagar has gone over 95%, the case fatality rate (CFR) is only 0.35%, which is much better than the state’s overall CFR of 1.43%,” Suhas said. District chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that to avert any chance of surge, the health department has increased the contact tracing and testing, especially in high-risk areas, from where more cases are being reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-crisis-recovery-rate-crosses-95-in-gb-nagar/story-Lc6oI7eY97rvHYzImUAVQO.html
05-12-2020||Noida||UP launches app to help residents locate nearest Covid-19 testing centre||Ghaziabad: The UP government on Saturday launched a mobile app -- Mera Covid Kendra -- which will help residents locate the nearest Covid testing centre. The app was launched by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow. The state health department officials said that the app will locate the nearest centres within 5km radius and user will be able to know the exact location through the maps. They further said that anyone using a computer or a laptop can also view the list of all such Covid-19 testing centres in any district by going to the website link: http://dgmhup.gov.in/en/CovidTestCenter The app has a list of 13 Covid-19 testing centres each in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar districts, along with their locations. The officials said that the testing centres added with location to the app are the static centres and not the mobile testing booths. “Till now, residents were finding it difficult to locate the exact location of the nearest testing centre. With the launch of the app, they will now be able to track testing centres. We also expect that more people will arrive for testing now,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad.After launching the app, CM Yogi said, “When we started fight against Covid, we were lacking Covid testing facilities. Initially, we were doing only 72 tests per day. But with coordination of all departments, we are now conducting 1.5 to 1.75 lakh tests per day. And, these tests include 40% tests conducted by RT-PCR method and not just through the rapid antigen kits,” . “We have also completed two crore tests now and it is all because of efforts by various departments, healthcare workers who have worked continuously even during the holidays. The World Health Organisation has also appreciated our efforts in Covid management. It is due to our efforts that we have been able to launch the app which will immensely help citizens,” he added. The officials of the state health department said that the state has conducted a present total of 201,28,312 tests till December 5. “We have launched the app which will help residents track the nearest testing centre. This is another initiative on part of the government to make available a citizen-centric system to the people. With the help of this app, anyone in 75 districts of the state will be able to locate nearest testing centre where Covid-19 testing will be free of cost. These testing centres will be operational from 10am to 4pm,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health). “Previously, we made available facility to citizens to view their test reports online. This facility has been used by about 30 lakh people so far,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-launches-app-to-help-residents-locate-nearest-covid-19-testing-centre/story-dLDvk6DiKQWSvDwOPg2k7H.html
05-12-2020||Noida||Farmers block Delhi to Noida carriageway too at Chilla border||Noida: A group of protesting farmers on Saturday morning blocked the Delhi-Noida side of the road at Chilla border. The Noida-Delhi side at the border has been blocked by the farmers for the past five days. According to a farmers’ leader, they have completely blocked both the carriageways at Chilla border as some farmers coming from western UP were stopped at Jewar toll plaza. Police said that the farmers were trying to march towards Delhi and they were stopped to maintain law and order situation. The Noida police and Delhi police have placed barricades on both sides and diverted traffic to DND Flyway, Kalindi Kunj and Dadri-Surajpur-Chhalera (DSC) road. According to police officials, the police are trying not to let large gathering at one spot in order to manage the crowd.The farmers from districts like Gautam Budh Nagar, Etah, Mainpuri, Firozabad, and Bulandshahr, on their way to Delhi to protest the Centre’s new farm laws, had been stopped at the Chilla border on December 1. They have set up camps since then, and continued to stay there. “We had blocked Noida-Delhi road on December 1 against the farm bills. But the police strategically blocked different roads leading to Chilla border. In our support, about 200 farmers in tractors and cars from western UP were coming to Chilla border on Saturday. But they were stopped by police at Jewar toll plaza. We asked the police officials to allow the farmers to reach the Chilla border. But the police did not agree and in retaliation, the farmers blocked the Delhi-Noida side too,” said Vikas Gurjar, UP vice-president, Bharatiya Kisan Union-Bhanu. Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Zone 1, said that the police personnel are deployed at the spot to maintain law and order. “The farmers were trying to march towards Delhi in the morning. The Delhi police set up barricades and blocked the road on Delhi-Noida side. The Noida-Delhi road has already been blocked for five days. We are holding meetings with farmers to end this deadlock,” he said. Reshma Rana, BKU-Bhanu spokesperson, has come from Meerut to participate in the protest. “We demand the government to withdraw the farm bills. In many cases, the farmers are not able to get even their investment after selling their crops. I grow sugarcane. I sell the produce at the government mills and the bills are not cleared even after one year. A number of farmers commit suicide due to financial instability,” she said. At the protest site, there were some farmers who had lost their family members due to heavy debt. Devendra Singh, a resident of Muzaffarnagar, said that his 46-year-old brother committed suicide in August this year after he failed to clear loans. “My brother Pritam Singh had planted sugarcane in 16 acres after taking loans. He did not get sufficient money after selling the harvest, and failed to return Rs 3 lakh loan. The bank started charging penalty. He remained depressed for a few months and one day he hanged himself,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-block-delhi-to-noida-carriageway-too-at-chilla-border/story-PRYhfiZAYdTFdZBXW3kBDO.html
05-12-2020||Noida||More farmers arrive at UP Gate protest site||Ghaziabad: As the crucial talks between the government and the farmers’ leaders started on Saturday afternoon in Delhi, the gathering at the UP Gate swelled further as around 200 more farmers arrived there on Saturday evening. Besides, hundreds of farmers also gathered at Loni and tried to proceed to Delhi on Saturday evening, the police said. On Saturday, a total of around 1,000 farmers were on a sit-in at the UP Gate.The farmers said that their protests have entered tenth day and the fifth round of talks between the farmers’ leaders and the government were going on in Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan to break the deadlock over the Centre’s new farm laws. “Hundreds of more farmers arrived to show support to our protest. Most of them have arrived from Uttarakhand, UP and even Madhya Pradesh. The talks are on with the government and there is no decision as of now (till Saturday evening). When our leaders come from Delhi, they will brief us about Saturday’s development,” said Rajvir Singh, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). The farmers, however, said that they did not want amendments to the new laws but want them rolled back entirely. “We have heard that the talks will continue on December 9. There has been a ‘Bharat Bandh’ call on December 8 as well, and we will continue our protest till the demands are met,” Singh said. The protests were initially held by BKU supporters below the UP Gate flyover where the farmers have parked their tractor-trolleys and have also set up kitchens. However, on Saturday, the protests have shifted almost entirely to the upper portion of the UP Gate after the farmers blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of National Highway-9 on Thursday morning. The blockade continued on Saturday as well and likely to continue further. “Most of the farmers are now sitting in protest at the highway which is blocked. We are listening to speeches of our leaders at the site. We all are here to press for our demands of roll-back of the new bills. Other issues related to electricity and minimum support price should also be resolved,” said Sandeep Chaudhary, one of the protesters. Far away from the UP Gate, hundreds of farmers on Saturday evening also tried to proceed to Delhi from Pushta police post on Delhi-Saharanpur Road in Loni. The farmers had come from neighbouring districts like Baghpat and arrived in their tractor-trolleys to galvanise support.Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural), said, “The farmers were trying to move to Delhi but they were stopped near Loni border. It is likely that they will return back to their districts. In case they wish to proceed in orderly manner, we will allow them passage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/more-farmers-arrive-at-up-gate-protest-site/story-lpu6MROcHcswdQscNvKmNN.html

However, the farmers opposed the move and said that it is their own fight. The protest at UP Gate is led by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) whose leaders and supporters have been camping below the UP Gate flyover since November 28 to support the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s new farm bills. The protesting farmers are also joined by their counterparts from Uttarakhand and Punjab, and have also blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of NH-9. Lallu also participated in a ‘havan’ which was performed by the protesting farmers on NH-9 before their leaders headed for talks with the central government in Delhi on Saturday afternoon. “We are standing with farmers and the government should consider their demands. We oppose the bills brought in by the government. With the ‘havan’, we want that good sense prevails with the government as they are favouring the businessmen,” Lallu said at the protest site on Saturday. “In fact, the farmers are ‘annadata’ (food provider). Those who know how to make government also know how to bring it down. Just wait and watch. The Congress will fight for the farmers in Parliament as well as on roads,” he added. After his short stay at the UP Gate, Lallu left with his supporters. However, the move was opposed by farmers who said that the Congress leaders have come to show concerns when the farmers’ protest has already entered the tenth day. “The Congress leaders came to show their support today. When the Congress government was in power, the Bharatiya Janata Party was saying same things what Lallu was saying today. When their (Congress) government was in power, they did nothing for the implementation of the Swaminathan Committee report,” said Mange Ram Tyagi, chief secretary of the BKU’s NCR unit. “We would have considered their support if they had brought in tractor-trolleys and should have stayed with us in winter chill. We have understood that whichever party is in opposition, they will sympathise with us. So, we will do our good on our own and we will stay here (at the protest site) on our own. They have come to show us their support when our protest has entered the tenth day,” Tyagi added. Meanwhile, the farmers continued their blockade of the highway on Saturday as well. The Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of NH-9 continued to remain blocked for the third day and no traffic was allowed. After the participating in the ‘havan’ at the protest site, BKU leader and spokesperson Rakesh Tikait tried to proceed to Delhi on a tractor but was prevented by the police from doing so. Later, he was taken to Delhi in a vehicle arranged by the police. “We did a ‘havan’ so that good sense prevails among the government functionaries. Ways will open when people sit together with open heart and positive minds,” Tikait said. The Ghaziabad police continued their deployment on Saturday at the protest site. “Our personnel are deployed and we will continue to keep a close watch on protesters. We are also trying that no disturbing elements join the protest which has so far remained peaceful,” said Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (city 2).Interestingly, just several hundred metres from the protest site on the highway, children from nearby locality of Khoda on Saturday arrived and played cricket on the highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-congress-chief-arrives-to-support-protesters-at-up-gate-farmers-oppose/story-LVBQvtKOkixRAuTqis8H5H.html
05-12-2020||Noida||Mercury to rise, expect fog in the morning, says IMD||Mercury soared by four degrees Celsius over the past 24 hours in the city as winds changed direction with the weather department saying that a further rise -- by a degree or more -- may be expected over the next few days. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said since the wind directions have changed from north-westerly to easterly, the temperature has risen, as is the case with such changes. The north-westerly are usually cold as it enters the NCR from the northern mountain regions of Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. According to the IMD, the minimum temperature in Noida on Saturday was 14.2 degrees Celsius, a steep climb from the 10.5 degrees Celsius on Friday. The maximum temperature on Saturday was 26.9 degrees Celsius against 27.8 degrees Celsius the day before. The average minimum temperature for entire NCR, as recorded at Safdarjung monitoring station in Delhi, was 11 degrees Celsius on Saturday which is two degrees above the season’s average and a climb-up from the 8 degrees Celsius a day earlier. “The minimum and maximum temperatures will hover around 12 degrees and 28 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Sunday,” said a weather analyst from IMD. Official added that the morning hours will also see shallow to moderate fog in the coming days. “Shallow to moderate fog is likely to obstruct visibility during the morning hours. In shallow fog, the visibility stays between 500 and 1,000 metres and in moderate fog, it dips to between 200 and 500 metres,” the analyst said, on condition of anonymity. According to the weather analysts, however, there is a possibility of another western disturbance– a phenomenon that causes snowfall in the mountains and sometimes rain in NCR – around December 7 and 8. “The western disturbance is likely to cause good snowfall in the upper reaches of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir on December 7 an 8. The wind directions is likely to change back to north-westerly on or around December 9 which will cause a sharp fall temperature around December 10,” said Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecasting agency, Skymet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/mercury-to-rise-expect-fog-in-the-morning-says-imd/story-vWqOKcZCmlviw6axlHTVJO.html
05-12-2020||Lucknow||Yogi govt harassing those expressing solidarity with farmers: Congress||Accusing the Yogi Adityanath government of harassing those who expressed solidarity with the farmers agitating against the Centre’s “black farm laws”, the Congress on Saturday alleged cases has been lodged against its leaders and workers for staging a protest here in September.It said that on September 28, Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu staged a protest at the Parivartan Chowk in Lucknow after which party leaders were taken to Eco Garden, from where all were released the same evening on personal sureties.“The Yogi Adityanath government has lodged cases against 13 Congress leaders, including UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu, and 300 unnamed workers for holding a protest in support of farmers in Lucknow on September 28,” the party’s media convenor, Lalan Kumar, who has also been named in the FIR, said.This is another example of the dictatorial attitude of the state government, which is attacking the freedom of expression of the people, Kumar said, adding that he and others came to know of the FIR only on Saturday. He also alleged that it has been filed in “back date”.This move of the state government has agitated party workers and they are in no mood to tolerate this, Kumar said.A police spokesperson said action will be taken against anybody found breaking the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-govt-harassing-those-expressing-solidarity-with-farmers-congress/story-LvaODH5t8FvKILFm8t2TkN.html
05-12-2020||Noida||Noida continues to suffer ‘severe’ air quality||Noida and Greater Noida continued to reel under high pollution for the second day in a row with the air quality index remaining in ”severe” category, mostly due to local emissions and poor ventilation. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Saturday, was 414 or ‘severe’, the same category where it was a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 408 against 415 a day earlier. The air quality of Ghaziabad, was 434 against 440 a day earlier. The AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. Ghaziabad turned out to the most polluted city in the country on Saturday, followed by Kanpur and Bulandshahr.It is to be noted that for the past two days, the smoke from stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana had been negligible, according to the Union government’s pollution monitoring agency System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar). On Saturday, the wind speed dropped from what it was a day earlier, and even though it picked up a little towards the afternoon, the speed was not strong enough to disperse accumulated pollutants in the air. According to the weather analyst, due to the change in wind direction, the speed had dropped on Saturday and the region is likely to suffer toxic air quality for the next few days until it either rains or wind picks up speed. A western disturbance is expected in the upper reaches of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh around December 7-8 and, consequently, the wind is expected to pick up speed around December 10. There will be a slight improvement in air quality with the AQI remaining either in severe category or improving slightly to the very poor category over the next 24-hours. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the wind direction currently is easterly and south-easterly which are usually of low speed. “The average wind speed in some parts of the Delhi-NCR cities was good. On average, the wind speed was around 4kmph, against 6kmph on Friday. This is the reason that the pollutants remained in the air,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. He said while the wind speed may rise slightly in some areas, the speed would remain around 5kmph on Sunday, though a slight rise in temperature may improve the ventilation.The fine particles or PM2.5 level also remained four to five times high than the safe limit of 60 microgrammes per cubic metres. PM2.5 for past 24 hours in Noida was 279.54 microgrammes per cubic metres, against 285.13 microgrammes per cubic metres a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 269.54 units against 262.22 units a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Ghaziabad was 312.8 units against 302.98 units a day earlier. According to Safar, the AQI is likely to recover slightly on Sunday. “Air quality is likely to improve marginally by Sunday owing to slightly better ventilation conditions. AQI is likely to further improve on December 7 and 8 due to better ventilation,” the Safar bulletin said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-continues-to-suffer-severe-air-quality/story-nCGsQcd0eb8ulSWClhCtwI.html
05-12-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad topped list of most polluted cities seven times in last 14 days||Ghaziabad on Saturday once again topped the charts as the most polluted city in the country among over 100 cities listed in the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) Air Quality Index (AQI) bulletin. As per CPCB data, Ghaziabad recorded the maximum instances of “severe” AQI recordings — at least seven times in the past 14 days — between November 22 and December 5.The last time the city emerged as the most polluted city was on November 22 and continued the trend till November 25 for four consecutive days. Thereafter, the city once again emerged as the most polluted on December 1 for two consecutive days. Finally, the city topped the list yet again on Saturday with an AQI value of 434 under the “severe” category. The experts said that the current pollution scenario in Ghaziabad can be attributed more to the local pollutants rather than stubble burning fumes from the neighbouring states. “The city has a number of major construction and infrastructure projects as well as industrial units and vehicles. So, local factors are more responsible for the current situation. Further, meteorological conditions, such as low wind speeds and low temperatures are also helping in the accumulation of pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of Indian Meteorological Department’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, New Delhi. Environmentalists have raised concerns about the rising air pollution in the city and its continuing trend this season. “Similar pollution levels have been prevalent for the past several years now, although officials claim that they have taken several steps to check pollution. But pollution in the city continues unabated and is a major cause for concern for residents. Nowadays, there is no issue of stubble-burning. Almost all pollutants are now BEING generated at the local level,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer. “Moreover, there is also a lot of diversion due to farmers’ protest and roads remaining choked. This also results in lot of vehicular emission,” he, added. According to CPCB records, the city also topped the list of most polluted cities at least six times in January and eight times in February. In March too, the city topped the list of most polluted cities at least twice. On all the 15 occasions in the months of January, February and March, the city topped the list when the AQI was under “poor” or “very poor” categories. “We are taking up every measure to check pollution and recently all agencies have been asked to step up measures to effectively control local pollutants,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Several of the officials of the regional office of the UP Pollution Control Board are suffering from Covid-19, which has hampered process of monitoring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-topped-list-of-most-polluted-cities-seven-times-in-last-14-days/story-9wINSG6wHmeBdtupfg1wIJ.html
05-12-2020||Kolkata||BJP campaign in Bengal marred by violence, party calls for President’s Rule||Sporadic clashes between ruling TMC and the opposition BJP activists on Saturday marred the saffron party’s anti-government campaign in West Bengal leaving more than a dozen people injured and prompting it to demand the imposition of President’s Rule in the state.The BJP Saturday held its state-wide campaign christened ‘Aar Noi Anyay’ (No more injustice) against the “misrule and corruption” of the Mamata Banerjee government.At least two union ministers participated in the campaign at Kolkata and East Midnapore district.Several instances of violence between Trinamool Congress and BJP were reported from West Burdwan, North 24 Parganas and Coochbehar districts.At least nine people were injured and several houses were ransacked in a clash between TMC and BJP supporters at Barabani in West Burdwan district on Saturday during which crude bombs were hurdled. The clash broke out when the ruling party tried to stop the saffron party activists from taking out rallies, police said.The BJP alleged that TMC supporters beat up its workers, a charge which was dismissed by the ruling party in the state. The TMC termed it an incident of “infighting” within BJP.Union minister Babul Supriyo alleged that the local TMC leaders were behind the incident.“Those involved with the coal mining mafia were also involved in the incident. This is the reality of West Bengal,” the Asansol MP said.BJP national secretary and Bengal in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya who rushed to meet the injured, alleged that the police failed to take action against the miscreants despite seeing that bombs were hurled at people.“The rule of law has ceased to exist in West Bengal. The goons are calling the shots. We have informed our senior party leaders and demand that President’s Rule be immediately imposed in the state,” he said.Dismissing BJP’s allegations, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said, “The clash was a result of infighting within the BJP. TMC is not involved in the incident. The saffron party is trying to create an issue to malign us.” Reacting to the saffron party’s demand for imposition of President’s Rule, Ghosh dared it to do so in the state.“The BJP is in power at the Centre. Instead of threatening us, let them impose President’s Rule in the state if they have the guts. They will get a befitting reply in the elections,” he said.In Coochbehar’s Sitai area clashes broke out between TMC and the saffron party activists which left more than 12 workers of both parties wounded. The BJP’s rally was led by MP Nisith Pramanik and state BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu.At Duttapukur area in North 24 Parganas district clashes broke out between the police and BJP workers after they tried to break a barricade put up by the force.Speaking on the clashes, BJP state chief Dilip Ghosh alleged that law and order have collapsed in West Bengal.“The rule of law has ceased to exist in West Bengal. It will be restored only if the BJP comes to power,” he said.The TMC on the other hand accused the saffron party of trying to vitiate the political atmosphere of the state ahead of the assembly polls due in April-May 2021.The BJP has emerged as the main rival of the TMC by winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in the 2019 general elections. Its leaders are now upbeat that the party will be able to end Banerjee’s 10-year rule in the state polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-campaign-in-bengal-marred-by-violence-party-calls-for-president-s-rule/story-JCSHwps6Tb9AfpavzFAWeP.html
05-12-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: The lines of fate||Human influences alter the lines of fate of even the most ‘missable’, obscure and furtive of creatures. Last Monday, tricity’s snake rescue expert Salim Khan was summoned to Panchkula’s Sector 19. People residing in a colony adjacent to the railway track were at their wit’s end. Two highly venomous Russell’s vipers were given to regularly sunbathing after emerging from the rubble of a wall that barricaded the track. Khan was able to nab one viper and while searching for the other, a commotion erupted among anxious onlookers. A lady’s eye chanced upon what she hysterically proclaimed a “saanp ka bachha”. Her blabbering further inflamed the situation as she declared the area was crawling with different venomous snakes and that a death was inevitable in the colony. Khan rescued the 35-cm snake, which was innocently enjoying a spot of sunbathing, from the crowd’s frenzy but was left puzzled as he had never seen such a species. On examination of its photograph by taxonomy experts, the species was declared as probably the very uncommon, non-venomous Cantor’s Black-headed snake (Sibynophis sagittarius). It was possibly the first authentic record of the species from the greater Chandigarh region.Very much an understudied species, this one does not grow to more than 55 cm as an adult. It dwells in a secretive manner, hiding under leaves, stones and fallen wood to ambush geckos and skinks. Its method of killing is to deploy multiple teeth to grip the prey while using its body coils to an extent to constrict the prey. The teeth in snakes act like hands: to grip and then direct the ingestion of the prey down the throat. Tree art & wagging tailsThere were a couple of Nature’s delightful asides to the ongoing Rs 1.5 crore Jeev Milkha Singh Invitational by Take Sports at the tree-lined and verdant Chandigarh Golf Club. Mature and majestic tall trees represent the principal challenge to the professional golfers fighting hard to win the prestigious trophy. Virtually each tree standing in the groves flanking the fairways has a story to tell, of a golf ball that struck it and rebounded. Mostly to the golfer’s detriment but occasionally to good luck when the ball had deflected to a clear patch. A creative soul has anonymously inscribed a fascinating graffiti of a golfer in action on the trunk of a stately tree to the right of the 4th hole green and adjacent to the cart path. Perhaps, to ward off the evil spirits of golf that dwell in trees!The 18th hole green is the arena of championship climax and is usually attended by galleries and caddies. In the interludes of peace and quiet when the action ebbs and the leadergroup is yet distant on the horizon, a delicate migratory bird, the White wagtail, seizes the opportunity to forage for insects in the ruffled 18th green collars. Like the resident stray dogs, whose tails tirelessly wag sideways in the fervent hope of having a morsel flung in their direction, this petite bird is also characterised by a wagging tail. Only that it is not a beggar’s tail. Also, the bird’s tail is incessantly wagged up and down as it runs about swiftly to pluck tiny insects and springs in the air to capture winged prey. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-the-lines-of-fate/story-Lgg6y8g4UqbRCxILI6Cs0K.html
05-12-2020||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Return of the Touch in the second wave of the pandemic||The gentle sensation that passes on the emotion of love, understanding and warmth vanished in human communication. We got busy washing our hands, hoarding sanitiser bottles with the right measure of alcohol, covering our faces with masks and stood at a safe distance of six feet even from our dear ones. Tougher still for the 65 plus community getting glared at by neighbours and family.What came to mind were some lines from Sailing to Byzantium, a poem by WB Yeats: An aged man is but a paltry thing, A tattered coat upon a stick, unless Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing For every tatter in its mortal dress...Suddenly, the time came to clap our hands, sing and laugh, wear coloured clothing with a mask to match and go to the delayed and then suddenly announced Chandigarh Press Club elections on the last but one day of November. This annual fair makes retired old scribes very welcome too. One of the attractions always was the chance of meeting old folks who rarely visited the club. One enjoyed the attention of colleagues divided for the day in two groups during an election which, in times of Covid, had none of the old revelry and followed strict rules of entering the club, picking up a brown sketch pen ticking on the names and then walking out with the pen lest someone touched it. Don’t touch or hang around were the orders of the day.Meeting friends after a long timeYet many chose to hang out on the road, across a little park, meeting friends after nine months, laughing and getting pictures clicked, sipping coffee from disposable paper cups. But something was missing and one looked around and saw that there were none of the old seniors whom one could chat with. Where had they all gone? Then came the realisation that we were the old ones and the older ones had gone over the years to the destination where we all had to go. Not being there for a friendBut the joy of now and here lingered for a day and then came the sad tidings that a close friend, the much-loved poet of Hindi, Mangalesh Dabral, was battling the second coming of Covid 19 in Delhi, his condition serious as his lungs had been affected.Social media was flooded with his poetry and friends anxiously exchanged notes, some trying to reach out to the family, and others doing what they could. But never before had one felt so helpless at not being there for a friend personally at that hour. However, the pull of Mangalesh’s poetry and persona brought many together in messages and phone calls. My acquaintance with Mangalesh happened through a senior poet of our city, Kumar Vikal. In the mid-eighties, on a whimsy, I quit my job, left the city and moved to Delhi, hired a mezzanine barsati and decided to do my own creative writing. Vikal, on a visit there and concerned by the state of affairs, decided to make arrangements for me so that I didn’t go hungry by introducing me to a grocer who would give home supplies on credit and suggested that I visit his wife’s family, living not too far away, whenever I wanted a good home-cooked meal. Next was a bus ride to the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg where the newspaper offices were located to meet his journalist writer friends so that work could keep flowing in.Himalayan breeze in his poetryAt that time Mangalesh was the magazine editor at Jansatta and though I was introduced to many of Vikal’s friends it was he who in his generosity encouraged me to contribute to the magazine. So there I was doing story after story in Hindi, a language I had not written in earlier. Besides, it was the beginning of camaraderie with the poet who came from Tehri Garwal with Himalayan breeze in his poetry and said thus of staying on: I looked at the city and smiled, I came to know how anyone can live here, And never went back!” The voice of dissent has always been strong in tradition of poetry but never as a slogan. He touches many souls with his poem titled Touch: To touch it is not necessary for someone to sit close, From very far it is possible to touch, Like a bird from a distance who keeps her eggs protected! Perhaps it was the silent touch of his many friends and admirers that has healed him and he is recovering from the dreaded illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-return-of-the-touch-in-the-second-wave-of-the-pandemic/story-V5Inv3JE8VTJhtIFl5maTJ.html
05-12-2020||Chandigarh||Witerati: The great Indian un-groom on Zoom||The new POTUS Joe Biden may be deliberating the political correctness of the guest list at his inauguration, in particular Donald Trump’s attendance, but what is concerning lesser mortals in the New Normal narrative is another kind of attendance – Zoom roll call.When a couple of us humorists congregated virtually some days ago, it was not only an occasion to do our boom on Zoom. It also became a stage to spotlight some species of Zoomers who have perfected New Normal’s Art of e-Attending, with or without boom, dhoom or groom. And also, the Art of Leaving (a pandemic art that may threaten stiff competition to Sri Sri’s ‘Art of Living’)! Art of Leaving The most popular tribe of us Zoomers is those who turn off videos while marking their presence.If the title of the Chetan Bhagat’s novel Half Girlfriend could be tweaked to best describe this new species, it would be thus – Half Zoomer.Half there, half not there.That is, present on the audio, but absent on the video. Alas, this half-heartedness can sometimes spell pitfalls that are hard to swallow. Literally.As a senior colleague recently shared, after putting in a video presence on a Zoom meeting, he turned off his video to partake of dinner. He was in the midst of chomping on Chettinad curry and sundry savories when his earphones sounded an alert as he heard the host announce his name. “Now, Mr X will say a few words on today’s topic.”Caught off guard, he hastily swallowed the supper, speedier than Trump is wont to eat humble pie, and being endowed with the gift of the gab, thankfully prattled some lines with panache.The curious case of ‘One Swallow Does Not A Zoomer Make’.Anonymous, ahoy!Then there are the Zoomaholics Anonymous. They are unlikely to be caught off guard like the aforesaid colleague or be invited to babble impromptu speeches.Pray, why not? Simply because the host can’t spot them on screen as they haven’t logged in by name.Instead, they’re mask-uerading under device names.Whilst we humorists were trying to talk of the humour genre seriously, we found the detective genre bestirring in our bosoms. Invisible invitees began entering the session midway but the Zoom grid identified them only by curious device names.The best twist came when in the middle of our mirth, there popped on the grid a brand name that had more to do with girth.Ample’s iPad.This seemed so like China ‘mask-uerading’ as a clone of America’s “Apple” called “Ample”!Alarm bells did a boom at the back of my mind, “Had an invisible intruder hacked into our Zoom outing?”.The curious case of Zooming not only spiritedly, but also as ‘spirits’.Neither Hair Nor ThereWhen Zoomers come, can Lollita, Lamba ji & Co be far behind!Picture this. Lollita is on a family reunion Zoom call to celebrate the 90th birthday of a maternal uncle. But she hasn’t dared to switch on the video, for her hair bear an (un)poetic resemblance to a porcupine plagued by a bad hair day.Since her hairdresser “Spruce Lee” is inaccessible in semi-Lockdown plus, in keeping with India’s “Chini Kum” narrative, it may not be politically correct to allow this chinky-eyed Chinese hairstylist into domestic terrain, it befalls Lamba ji to do the honours of treating her tresses to groom whilst she does her Zoom.But trust Lamba ji, while fumbling for the scissors near her iPad, to brush past her touchscreen clumsily enough to bring her video blinking alive. Abrupt-Lee!That too when only the right half of her hair are blow-dried and left half still in curlers..The curious case of “Honey, I bunk the grids.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/witerati-the-great-indian-un-groom-on-zoom/story-5DMds5r5Da2YlmWZe1TRQK.html
05-12-2020||Bhopal||In Madhya Pradesh, any marriage with intent to convert will now lead to 10 years in prison||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday held a high-level meeting with officials on the Religious Freedom Bill, 2020 to stop forced religious conversions in the state.The new bill introduces penal provisions for conversion through marriage or by any other fraudulent means. Under the proposed law, conversion through marriage or by any other fraudulent means will lead to a prison term of up to ten years and a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh.A statement, released by the chief minister’s office, said mass religious conversions will also attract a prison term of up to 10 years and a fine of up to Rs. 50,000. The statement also said that any marriage performed with the intention of religious conversion will be declared null.“Religious conversion after hiding one’s own religion will attract 3-10 years of imprisonment & minimum Rs 50,000 fine. Mass religious conversion (2 or more people) will attract 5-10 years of imprisonment and a minimum fine of Rs 1 Lakh,” the statement from the chief minister’s office said.The statement also said that if any individual wishes to convert their religion, then they have to inform the district magistrate’s office one month in advance. Religious leaders involved in the process will also inform the DM’s office a month in advance.The chief minister’s office in its statement said in case of conversion of a minor or any person belonging to the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe community, violators could face a prison term of up to 10 years or face fine of up to Rs 50,000.Earlier on Saturday, Madhya Pradesh chief minister had said that the Religious Freedom Bill, 2020 is his government’s ‘Beti Bachao Abhiyan’. While speaking to mediapersons before the meeting, he said, “It is easy to mislead young girls with malicious intent. Later, their life becomes hell. Dharma Swatantrya (Religious Freedom) Bill 2020 is our beti bachao abhiyan.”Several BJP-ruled states are planning to introduce anti-conversion bills in a bid to stop ‘love jihad’. ‘Love Jihad’, according to right-wing groups, is a process of conversion where Muslim men lure Hindu women into marriage with an intent to convert them.On November 28, Uttar Pradesh government introduced the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 to stop forced or fraudulent religious conversions. The Karnataka government is also planning on introducing a similar bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/in-madhya-pradesh-any-marriage-with-intent-to-convert-will-now-lead-to-10-years-in-prison/story-9DvLM23wdU2Tfh3wJYFrhJ.html
05-12-2020||Chandigarh||Random Forays: The art and science of paying compliments||Compliments which are meaningful and which emanate from the heart are rare these days, what with people falling over each other to praise their bosses or those who ‘matter’. Sycophancy has been quite the norm and an integral part of many professional circles for decades. Thus, many a compliment should be shrugged off by the recipient as being clearly aimed at his authority and influence rather than any intrinsic qualities which he possesses.A station house officer (SHO) who heads a police station or an executive engineer (XeN) who heads a division can expect compliments to be flying into their air zones with unflagging regularity. The moment they receive their transfer orders, however, such words of praise and those who have been mouthing them would become as scarce as luscious mangoes in winter months. Similarly, the CXO of a corporate entity would surely have people in his team lapping up every idea that his mind generates. False and inflated compliments are part and parcel of organisational credos, with very few hardliners being able to resist the temptation to fall in line. In fact, people in power often baulk at those who do not indulge in ‘chamchagiri’. The game of egos plays a big part in life as a whole, and definitely so when high level elevations or spoils of any kind are at stake. But why continue to take potshots at the opportunist? This write up is also about the ‘how’ and not only the ‘why’ of complimenting others. There are those who are highly adept at bestowing compliments while others feel tongue tied and diffident when their moment comes!Lovers learn this art pretty soon in their relationships, particularly men. They leave no stone unturned in praising to the skies, the looks or the voice or the choice of apparel of their muse. And such muses of course love the attention that they receive from new suitors, though sometimes an overdose of it can be quite off-putting for the young lady, if she is of the discerning variety.Spouses usually fail to keep up the momentum though. All the songs of praise which had been sung with gusto in the halcyon days of honeymooning somehow disappear once life’s rough and tumble roller-coasters start becoming as overbearing as they usually are. Compliments inter se between spouses become as rare as warm quilts in summer months. The husband who regularly manages to praise his wife as the decades pass by, is truly a very visionary man. Wives need to reciprocate too. My wife, Neena, pays me an indirect compliment each time she reads my column, for example!On the other hand, human love and genuine compliments do possess a synergetic bond after all, and if love sustains then so should words of appreciation. Taking the other for granted is clearly often the source of all friction in long term relationships. The other thing about a kind word is that it can last for a long time. A teacher in school praised me fulsomely in front of the whole class once, and I treasure his words till today. Teachers and bosses should especially be trigger happy with compliments instead of being frugal, albeit when a recipient does indeed merit them.In Haryana, I learnt during several public meetings, where I was on duty, that praise can often be misleading and even misdirected. Thus, the compere of an event where the chief minister (CM) would be the chief guest, would often go grossly overboard in praising the said dignitary to the skies. On one occasion, in fact, the gentleman with the microphone was so gushing and so excitable in his invitation to the CM to address the audience, that he actually named the previous CM instead of the current one, clearly a faux pas that was unpardonable. And of course the said gent was never to be heard on the stage ever again!I myself have learnt the oblique and unique art of complimenting myself in some manner, each time I praise others. I don’t know exactly how I do it, but as soon as I discover the exact formula, I will gladly share it in these columns! vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/random-forays-the-art-and-science-of-paying-compliments/story-LogC3WDdbfEQVSSb33zjIM.html

05-12-2020||Bangalore||Lost goodwill of people after joining hands with Cong: Kumaraswamy||JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy on Saturday said joining hands with the Congress and forming coalition government with the party has destroyed the goodwill that he had earned from the people of the state and maintained for 12 years.The former Chief Minister said, he fell to the “trap” and accused Congress leader Siddaramaiah of a conspiracy, as he stated that even BJP had not “betrayed” him to that level.Hitting back, Siddaramaiah said Kumaraswamy was an “expert in lying” and shedding tears was his family’s culture.“The goodwill that I had earned from the people of the state in 2006-07 (as CM) and which I had maintained for 12 years despite the big campaign against me for not transferring power to BJP, everything got destroyed by joining hands with the Congress,” Kumaraswamy said.Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, he said he should not have joined hands with Congress which had campaigned against the JD(S) calling it BJP’s ‘B team’, but because of party supremo H D Deve Gowda’s insistence he agreed to form the coalition government. “It has now led to my party losing its strength....I fell to the trap, to emotional feelings of Deve Gowda because of which my party that had won 28-40 seats independently in the last three elections is suffering, “ he said.He maintained that joining with Congress was the reason for the downfall of his party and his personal goodwill.Kumaraswamy however clarified that he was not blaming Gowda for it, as he knows and respects his father’s lifelong commitment towards secular identity.With no party getting a clear majority in the 2018 assembly polls, Congress-JD(S), which had fought against each other during the election, joined hands to form a government with Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister to keep BJP out of power.However following the rout in the Lok Sabha polls, which both parties fought in alliance, internal differences cropped up and due to rebellion by some MLAs the coalition government collapsed last year, and since then Congress and JD(S) leaders have been blaming each other for it.Siddaramaiah in his rebuttal asked if there was a goodwill for Kumaraswamy to blame Congress for him losing it.“Kumaraswamy is an expert in lying, he can lie according to the situation for the sake of politics...was making him Chief Minister despite JD(S) having 37 seats our fault? Shedding tears is the culture of the Deve Gowda family, nothing new in it, they can shed for appeasement or to make someone believe,” he added.Kumaraswamy, while responding to Siddaramaiah’s recent statement that there is always an internal understanding between JD(S) and BJP citing his meetings with Yediyurappa twice in the last couple of months, said the CLP leader should stop making such baseless allegations.“I meet openly, not in disguise...don’t I know whom he (Siddaramaiah) met recently?” Kumaraswamy said, adding that if he had such an understanding with the BJP he would have continued as the Chief Minister.BJP and JD(S) had earlier formed a coalition government in 2006 with Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister and Yediyurappa as his deputy, under a power-sharing formula of 20 months each.However, the government had collapsed as JD(S) did not transfer power to BJP, which later went on to win the next assembly elections and form its first ever government in the south.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/lost-goodwill-of-people-after-joining-hands-with-cong-kumaraswamy/story-TCZd9YThpIza3wZ25e704I.html
05-12-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana agriculture department employee lands in soup over Facebook post on farmer protests||An agriculture department employee of Charkhi Dadri in Haryana was suspended over his Facebook post on the farmers’ protest and has jeopardized chances of timely delivery of his retiral benefits. The matter came to light when the officer, Ranbir Singh Mann, technical assistant at deputy director, agriculture and farmer welfare department, Bhiwani, approached the Punjab and Haryana high court on December 4 challenging his suspension order of September 25. He sought direction that since he retires on December 31, the department be asked to take a decision on his response submitted after a show cause notice before. He was also transferred from Bhiwani office to director’s office in Panchkula following the episode. The three posts on September 10 and September 11, as per Mann, were put by his granddaughter whom he had given his Facebook account access to attend online classes during Covid-19 outbreak. He was suspended and transferred on September 25 and issued show cause notice under conduct rules for government employees for criticising government. The Facebook posts had suggested that whenever governments tried to disturb farmers, they ruined themselves, second exhorting to listen to demands of farmers and another one praising farmer leader late Chhotu Ram for getting “double rate” for wheat that too in British era. That is why farmers supported such leaders, the posts had suggested.In the high court, he had stated that the “correct position” with regard to the comments posted have been explained to authorities on September 29. However, the authorities have not taken a decision on the same after lapse of over two months. The petitioner is at the end of his career as he is about to superannuate on December 31 and in case, the appropriate decision is not taken by the competent authority prior to the said date, he is likely to suffer prejudice on the release of his retiral benefits, his counsel had told court. He had argued that his Facebook posts do not violate any provisions of the Haryana Civil Service (Government Employees Conduct) Rules, 2016. He had also argued that he cannot be prevented from expressing his views merely because he is an employee. In a democratic society, every government institution is governed by democratic norms. Healthy criticism is a better way of good governance, he had argued. He had also levelled allegations against the deputy director for keeping a personal grudge. Now, the high court has disposed of the plea as government counsel assured the court that appropriate order will be passed within a period of three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-agriculture-department-employee-lands-in-soup-over-facebook-post-on-farmer-protests/story-XchOtsCW8isvX8RyVCXLkK.html

05-12-2020||Jaipur||‘BJP out again to topple my govt,’ alleges Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday again blamed the BJP for trying to topple his government, four months after a political crisis, triggered by the then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s rebellion, was resolved. Gehlot had blamed the BJP at that time for engineering the revolt to pull down his government. “They (BJP) conspire to topple the elected governments. In Rajasthan they are again starting the game – this is their thinking. People are also saying now that they are targeting Maharashtra,” said Gehlot after the inauguration of a new building of the party office at Shivganj Nagar area of Sirohi district. AICC general secretary Ajay Maken and state Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasara also participated virtually in the event. “BJP earlier conspired to topple the government with money. Everyone saw how the MLAs (backing Pilot) met home minister Amit Shah in the presence of Dharmendra Pradhan (minister), and Syed Zafar (now MP). The meeting went on for an hour. After the meeting, the MLAs said that they were embarrassed seeing a home minister offering sweets and namkeen,” Gehlot alleged. Also read: Farmers’ protest: No headway yet, next meeting to be held on December 9“All our senior leaders, such as Randeep Surjewala, Ajay Maken, KC Venugopal, and Avinash Pande, camped in the state and took the decision to dismiss the party leaders so that the government could be saved,” the CM said. During the political crisis, Pilot was removed as deputy chief minister and Congress state chief on July 14. Two ministers in his camp were also dropped from the Gehlot cabinet. An MLA, who was part of the rebel group, denied that they had met Amit Shah or any other BJP leader. “The CM is raising this issue as he is being asked by the leadership to expand the cabinet and make political appointments. These unwarranted statements are to delay the processes,” he said on condition of anonymity. BJP MLA and spokesperson Ram Lal Sharma said, “Earlier also the BJP had never tried to topple the government. What all happened was due to their internal clashes. The CM stated that first the instalment has been received by the MLAs. Then why doesn’t he name his MLAs who received it? If the government falls, it will be because of their infighting.” He said the allegations against BJP leaders are baseless. “Recently, a Congress MLA alleged that Rs 10 crore was given to other party MLAs to save the government. Why didn’t the CM get the issue probed?” Sharma asked. Recently, a video purportedly showed Congress MLA Mahendrajeet Singh Malviya accusing two Bharatiya Tribal Party MLAs of receiving Rs 10 crore each during Rajya Sabha polls and Congress-Sachin Pilot feud. The alleged video of Malviya prompted the BJP to accuse Gehlot government of involvement in horse-trading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/bjp-out-again-to-topple-my-govt-alleges-rajasthan-chief-minister-ashok-gehlot/story-P8Nw9a5AbtY2PUGuNgoPUI.html

Both the brothers are private practitioners at Chandigarh.“Everyday, we are giving medical care to almost 1,500 people coming up with different complaints,” Sukhwinder said over the phone.At the camp, they have kept a range of medicines in the boot space of two cars.“We have medicines which can take care of several health-related issues,” he said.“Most of people are coming with complaints of hypertension, joint pain among elderly ones, diarrhoea, constipation etc,” said Sukhwinder. “Some elderly people who have run out of their medicines are also approaching us,” he further said.A team of 10-15 people including paramedic staff are working at this camp to provide medical care, he said.Sukhwinder said they themselves belong to a farming family and this has motivated them to serve people here. He further said more doctors from Barnala in Punjab will soon join them to extend their support.Some religious and social organisations and local people are also providing them medicines, he further said, adding he and his brother are staying at nearby places so they come here early to start their free medical camp. A protester from Punjab who came to the medical camp for treatment of a hand injury was all praise for the team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-protest-doctor-brothers-from-haryana-set-up-free-medical-camp-at-singhu-border/story-3aEqwSlnlcWTRyMccbLYWL.html
05-12-2020||City||Farmers’ agitation gains momentum in central Haryana, Ahirwal||Nearly ten days after the farmers began their ‘Dilli Chalo’ march against the Centre’s three agricultural laws, the agitation has picked up pace in central Haryana and Ahirwal region.Initially, farmers from the GT road belt and districts like Sirsa and Fatehabad, which share border with Punjab, were hitting the road against these laws. However, after the Punjab farmers started a march in November end towards Delhi through central Haryana, peasants from these areas have also joined them. Now the khaps, social organisations, students, village panchayats and other groups have come forward to join the protesters.Balbir Thakan, secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha, said participation of farmers in the protest has increased after the Haryana Police detained union leaders on the intervening night of November 23-24 from across the state in a major crackdown ahead of the ‘Delhi chalo’ march on November 26.“The BJP-JJP government has added fuel in the agitation by using barricades, water cannons and tear gas shells to disperse farmers and stop their entry in Delhi. The other factors which brought the attention of common farmers are registration of cases against protesters, digging roads to stop their movement and linking the agitation with Khalistan, China and Pakistan,” he added.Kisan Sangharsh Samiti (KSS) president Mandeep Singh Nathwan, said farmers from every part of the state are joining the dharna against these three laws.“The agitation is also picking up pace in Palwal, Faridabad, Nuh and Mahendergarh districts. It was low in few parts of the state earlier because farmers were engaged in wheat sowing and selling their crops. The BJP ministers had also provoked farmers to join the protest by calling them Congressmen and having links to Pakistan, China and receiving funding from Canada,” he added.Saurabh Dahiya, a farmer from Sonepat, said he along with other villagers has been extending support to the farmers by supplying them essential commodities. Bijender Sheoran, head of Sheoran Khap from Badhra, a constituency represented by deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala’s mother Naina Chautala, said the farmers from their constituency have been turning up at Tikri border in large numbers.“ Naina had entered our constituency 16 days before the assembly polls and we had elected her by considering her Devi Lal’s heir. But she and her son Dushyant had disappointed the farmers by not backing them. The JJP leaders failed to take a stand when the police lathicharged farmers and registered FIRs against them. Their lackadaisical approach was also a reason that the farmers from this region joined the protest. Now, the farmers are fighting on their own and do not need any help from politicians to force the government to repeal these laws,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-agitation-gains-momentum-in-central-haryana-ahirwal/story-Ft2OH8KkOGSQ5q61E4zd6I.html

05-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress warns MVA allies over comments on its leadership||The Maharashtra Congress on Saturday warned its partners in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) against making comments on its leadership if they wanted a “stable” government in the state. a rap amid the three parties in the ruling coalition — Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress —celebrating one year in office. The warning by Yashomati Thakur, working president of the state Congress unit and a minister, came days after NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s interview by regional media house Lokmat, in which, when asked if the country was ready to accept Rahul Gandhi as a leader, Pawar said Gandhi’s leadership has a “few problems” and lacks consistency. In a series of tweets in English and Marathi, Thakur said, “Some interviews/articles of MVA leaders have come to my notice. Being a working president of MPCC [Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee], I must appeal to colleagues in MVA that if you want a stable govt in Maharashtra, then stop commenting on the leadership of Congress. Everybody should follow basic rules of coalition. Our leadership is very strong and stable. Formation of MVA is the result of our strong belief in democratic values,” she said. Congress leaders opined that Pawar’s comment was uncalled for, considering the fact that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi decided to support a Sena-led government after discussing the matter with him. “Our leadership not only consulted state Congress leaders and legislators, but also Pawarsaheb. If they give him respect, he should avoid unnecessary comments on leadership,” said a senior Congress minister. NCP and Sena leaders, however, sought to play down Pawar’s remarks, saying that it had no connection with the stability of the three-party state government. NCP spokesperson Umesh Patil said, “Pawarsaheb’s statement must be taken positively, looking at his age and experience. [Yashomati] Thakur’s comment on the stability of the government is unnecessary. There is good coordination within the MVA. Just recently, we saw celebrations on the first anniversary. The alliance registered wins in the council elections.” Sena leader and one of the architects of the MVA alliance, Sanjay Raut, said the statement must be viewed as “directions”. Speaking to a regional news channel, Raut said, “Whatever Sharad Pawar might have said about Rahul Gandhi, it has nothing to do with the stability of Maha Vikas Aghadi. I have always stood behind Rahul Gandhi, when his leadership was being damaged. Sharad Pawar is a tall leader in politics. The opposition parties in the country consider Pawarsaheb their leader. When an experienced leader like him says something, it must be viewed as directions. However, I am not saying that they should take steps according to what Pawarsaheb says.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-warns-mva-allies-over-comments-on-its-leadership/story-5b0wpZBAX3LptCgeKlis3K.html

05-12-2020||Kolkata||Top BJP leaders add fuel to speculations of TMC heavyweight switching sides||Top leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party have added fuel to speculations on whether Trinamool Congress heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari would switch sides, a day before the former state minister could clear his stand. “Already he has resigned. Time will speak what he wants to do and how many more days does he want. But within a day or two, the entire dilemma would be over. I expect he will join the BJP,” Mukul Roy told the media. ALSO WATCH | ‘2/3rd majority in West Bengal...’: Rajnath Singh on BJP-TMC fight #HTLS2020 While Adhikari has already resigned from the cabinet quitting his post, earlier this week he told the TMC leadership that he couldn’t work for the party. Adhikari wrote a text message to Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy, saying the problems he was having in the TMC were far from over. All eyes are now on the former minister’s press conference on Sunday which he is scheduled to hold at East Midnapore district, his hometown. Also read: Stop commenting on our leadership if you want stable govt: Cong leader to Maha alliesOn Saturday, however, president of the BJP’s Bengal unit Dilip Ghosh camped in Adhikari’s bastion holding rallies and lashing out against the TMC and taking a dig at the TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee. “No matter what Adhikari does, TMC will never allow him to become a leader, because, in the TMC party, only those who hail from a particular house in Kalighat are allowed to become leaders. The rest who gave their sweat and blood will always remain as employees,” said Ghosh, adding that BJP makes leaders. The BJP state president cited the example of Mukul Roy who has been made the party’s national vice president after he quit. the TMC and joined the BJP. Last week, hours after Adhikari quit the Mamata Banerjee-cabinet, further widening his rift with the ruling party, the BJP started flexing its muscles in a TMC-citadel in East Midnapore district allegedly capturing the multiple-party offices of the latter. “BJP taking over TMC party offices, Dilip Ghosh holding rallies in Adhikari’s bastion were unthinkable earlier. Things are not right in East Midnapore,” said a TMC leader. Banerjee is also set to hold a rally in West Midnapore district on December 7 and has directed leaders from East Midnapore to remain present. The BJP leaders’ statements on Adhikari gain more importance because on Friday Banerjee had sent a strong message to rebels inside the party. “Didi had sent a loud and clear message to all rebels within the party. If they need to stay within the party they will have to work for the party. Those speaking against the party will not be tolerated. She, however, didn’t name any leader,” said a senior TMC leader who attended the virtual meeting held by Banerjee with TMC leaders from across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/top-bjp-leaders-add-fuel-to-speculations-of-tmc-heavyweight-switching-sides/story-tZ8MD5JGtAy9weddQM2WpO.html

BJP city unit president Chandrakant Patil, who used to represent this constituency, said, “Three parties come together and contested against single party. Shiv Sena is helping the Congress and NCP but getting nothing in return. Sena must think about it.” Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar said, “The victory of Arun Lad is the answer to opposition party leaders making allegations. Now it is proved that graduate voters also support the Maha Vikas Agadi.”Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “We failed to estimate the power of the three parties unitedly.”NCP leader Sharad Pawar said, “The results show that the citizens are expressing confidence in the Maha Vikas Agadi.

05-12-2020||Pune||Two missing minor girls found after 3-day hunt in Pune||A happy video of two toddlers playing on a swing inside a shelter home in the Shivajinagar gaonthan area of Pune quickly turned into a nightmare, as their frail figures were seen jumping over the security gates of the building. The two girls - one a 6-year-old and one an 8-year-old - were reported missing on Tuesday. After a three-day hunt, the girls were found with a family under a bridge near the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) building in Shivajinagar. “We were searching for them on a war footing. They are young and the parents were not able to look after them. They were missing their parents. They could have easily been pushed into human trafficking. Finally, we could find them and we will try to take steps that will prevent the recurrence of this incident,” said Priyanka Narnavare, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1, Pune. “The girls were found by the beggar family that took them in without questioning them, fed them whatever they could, and gave them clothes they had. They did not bring the girls to the police, as they should have, but they did not abandon them either,” said senior police inspector Balasaheb Kopnar of Shivajinagar police station. When they were found to have gone missing, a case under Section 363 (kidnapping) of Indian Penal Code was registered and the police machinery got active. However, the two sisters were blissfully unaware of what had transpired over the past few days. After being found on Thursday evening, the elder one flopped on the police station floor with a pen and paper she had borrowed from the police station official who was recording her statement. As she drew stick figures of a man and his child in front of a house, her younger sibling ran around the station and gave different answers to similar questions that was directed towards her by everyone around her - what did you do for three day? Why did you leave? However, the answer she gave to a worker of the Rainbow Foundation was the most believable to her parents as well as her caretakers at the shelter home - “We wanted wada pav, so we left”. For the girls who were born on the open-air of the streets, the security of four walls albeit without their parents, was restricting and less fun. “We found them on March 5 in a tin-shed with their parents and grandmother in Ramtekdi, Hadapsar. They live on the streets, beg for a living, and we counselled them that their children will have a better home with us. With their consent, we brought the girls to the shelter home that is above a school run by PMC,” said Pooja Karande, manager at Rainbow Foundation. The girls had attempted to run away from the shelter on the third day of Diwali - November 16 - too. “A rickshaw driver had found them and brought them to the Faraskhana police station. We had felicitated him for doing it. But this time it was very difficult. We formed two teams - one was checking CCTV footage and providing inputs to the team on ground. For the first entire day, we traced various locations, and at last saw them near the rear end of the Omkareshwar temple after which we lost their trail for some time before finding a footage of them walking with the family,” said police inspector (crime) V Goud of Shivajinagar police station. Since the girls went missing, the foundation has pushed the PMC to provide funds which were used to install a mesh on the security gate and metal arrows on the top of the gate. The girls, who now seem more attached to the shelter home care-takers than their mother, have been sent to live with their mother and her parents in Nigdi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/two-missing-minor-girls-found-after-3-day-hunt-in-pune/story-HXxThfAVZ5Ow291u6MNasO.html
05-12-2020||Pune||Covid-19 virus type has changed since June, says expert in Pune||The scientist emeritus at the National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS) Dr Yogesh Shouche made a key observation on Covid-19 during a webinar on Friday.According to Dr Shouche, the Covid virus type detected in June and July earlier this year in various states is different than the 20B type found now.He was talking on, “Changing nature and current status of Covid-19” during the curtain-raiser for the India International Science Festival (IISF 2020) organised by NCCS online. ALSO WATCH | What’s govt’s budget for Covid vaccine distribution? FM Nirmala answers #HTLS2020“In June and July as per our studies, in Nashik, Pune and Satara districts there were four different types. However, now, we have seen only 20B. As we stepped into unlock there was only 20B found,” said Dr Shouche.He further said that the second wave of Covid-19 has affected many countries and that infectious diseases have multiple waves.“The same is with Covid-19. We have to yet understand how severe Covid-19 will be during the second wave. However, we are surer now, of the treatment modality,” said Dr Shouche. He further said that the virus may affect differently now.“There are changes in the virus. Also, the virus may behave differently in different types of weather for the second wave. We can see throughout the world that the cases are increasing. Italy, Germany and Russia have witnessed the second wave. The numbers have reduced now,” said Dr Shouche.As part of the curtain-raiser of IISF organised by National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), chief guest AB Pandit, Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), Mumbai vice-chancellor delivered an online talk on “Expected impact of the new National Education Policy (NEP) and National Innovation and Start-Up Policy (NISP) on Future Research.” Pandit initiated his talk stating that the research institutes need to be ready for the course correction or re-orientation of the research efforts which are being made.“It is important to understand the necessity of the NEP and NISP and what it addresses. It is a general perception that we are producing a large number of degree holders with very little or no capability,” said Pandit.Pandit also said in the last few decades the industrial automation has taken over, the kind of skill-sets which were required for the graduating students was not necessarily addressed in terms of the requirements of the industry. “The automation has improved the quality of the products and the syllabus was never addressing the changing needs and skill-sets of the industry,” said Pandit.He further underlined that it is not possible for us to see the impacts of the NEP and NISP right away but five years down the line, it will be visible. He highlighted that the NEP was formulated in such a way that the first eight years, the students will essentially address the foundations including basic maths, language literacy, the environmental concerns and the relationship between action and reaction, and cause and effect phenomenon.“The syllabus will be continuously being revised being in the dynamics equilibrium with the surroundings and environmental and industrial needs,” said Pandit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-virus-type-has-changed-since-june-experts/story-ZYxzwlqPqiLACqXotDQ6OI.html

05-12-2020||Pune||State seeks contacts of those diagnosed with Covid-19 based on HRCT||The state government has issued directives to all civic bodies stating that all details of those undergoing treatment for Covid-19 based on the initially similar symptoms based on the High Resolution Computerized Tomography (HRCT) must be sought from the diagnosis centre or the concerned hospitals. The letter issued by the state health department noted that there are patients whose contacts could be traced as they were treated for Covid-19 based on the symptoms diagnosed on HRTC but were not registered with the local civic body as Covid-19 patients. The letter was issued by the department on December 2, 2020 and was issued to all civic bodies and district administrations which says that hospitals and laboratories must note down the name, contact number, address of the concerned person which would be mandatory for them. The order states that it has also been found that patients are undergoing Covid-19 treatment without a confirmed test which is why following contact tracing could not be done by the local civic authorities which makes it difficult to break the chain. City doctors also believe that the HRCT is only a suggestive tool and is not 100 per cent accurate. Dr Vijay Natarajan, chief executive officer (CEO), at the Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre (SUHRC) said, “The HRCT is only suggestive and a new development in terms of Covid-19. Although, it has been helpful in some cases as we are looking for pneumonia like symptoms in the lungs. RT-PCR is still considered the gold standard and so based on the radiologist’s expertise of whether a follow up RT-PCR test is required or not, the test is done. The HRCT is just a screening method and based on the involvement of the lungs which show pneumonia like patches in the scan.” With this order, every suggestive Covid-19 patient found through HRCT must be subjected to an RT-PCR or a Rapid Antigen Testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-seeks-contacts-of-those-diagnosed-with-covid-19-based-on-hrct/story-f7Di9Gwu25QBQxOwOTfFBI.html

Of the six such zones, three are from the Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward. The ward has been reporting maximum number of cases since the beginning of the pandemic and geographical challenges, including the wide spread of the area is now proving to be a challenge for the administration. The six newly declared micro containment zones are areas from Kasba-Vishrambaugwada, Bibvewadi, Kondhwa-Yewlewadi and three areas from the Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward namely, Iris society in Magarpatta city, Sasanenagar and Fursungi. Somnath Bankar, assistant municipal commissioner of the ward claimed that people in the ward did not follow any social distancing norms or wear masks during the Diwali days. He said, “People thronged the markets despite repeated warnings by the administration. However it is also true that this is the largest ward of all the 15 wards in the city, spread across an area of about 54 square kilometres with a population of about 10 lakh people. We also have the maximum number of hospitals which is why people from nearby villages and outside PMC limits are also being brought here.” The ward has been consistently reporting the maximum number of cases, which is why it has been one of the worst affected wards in the city too. “The newly added villages are also reporting fresh Covid-19 cases which is adding to the total tally of the ward,” said Bankar. As per the latest guidelines issued by the state, all SARI and ILI patients in any containment zones must be tested regularly for any flu-like symptoms for early detection and treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-civic-body-issues-fresh-list-of-micro-containment-zones/story-HpQwYuQC9iRfmE3cG5NwgL.html

Three other firemen who complained of difficulties in breathing are under observation in a Navi Mumbai hospital. Fire fighting teams from four different local governing bodies were involved in seven hours long operation with ten fire tenders. The deceased has been identified as Balu Damu Deshmukh, a fireman from Ambernath fire station. The fire broke out shortly after midnight at plot J39 in Mody Chemi-Pharma Pvt Ltd which reportedly manufactures materials for pharmaceutical companies.Deepak Dorugade, Taloja MIDC fire station chief, who himself is under observation after inhaling the fumes, said, “We received the fire call at 12.05 am. When we reached the spot the one storey building was completely engulfed in flames and there were explosions taking place inside. Our priority was to ensure that the nine chlorine tunnels with 900 kg chlorine in each were protected from fire.” Chlorine gas is very poisonous and does not dilute easily in air. If there had been an explosion in even one tunnel it would have been catastrophic with lives being lost, claimed Dorudage. The team managed to ensure the drums were secured. Fire personnel from Navi Mumbai, CIDCO, MIDC and also Ambernath rushed to the spot to douse the blaze.Around 10 fire tenders were deployed and it was eventually put out at around 7 am.

He came out and vomited and then felt better and was walking fine. He then went to take rest in his vehicle. A little later, I too felt dizzy and came out of the fire fighting operations and collapsed. However, after vomiting thrice on the road, I felt better.” The team then checked on Deshmukh who was in the vehicle.

It is a huge shock for us.” A case of accidental death has been registered at Taloja police station. Apart from Dorugade, two other fire officers inhaled the fumes and have been asked to take rest.

05-12-2020||Mumbai||United front needed to defeat impregnable BJP: Shiv Sena||Buoyed by the Maha Vikas Aghadi’s victory in Maharashtra Legislative Council polls, Shiv Sena on Saturday said that impregnable BJP can be defeated if parties fight elections together.“Elections were held for 6 seats of the Legislative Council, out of which Maha Vikas Aghadi won 5 seats. Graduate, Teachers Election Association is known as impregnable BJP bastion where well educated, well-settled voters preferred to vote for the BJP. This myth has been busted,” read the editorial in Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana.“The defeat of the BJP in Nagpur and Pune is a call of changed stormy air... We have seen how a miracle happens when all the groups of Congress, leaders come together. The Congress high command should also take cognizance of this victory. The BJP’s pocket borough can be demolished by a united front, it is seen in Maharashtra,” it said.The editorial termed the results from Nagpur as “most shocking” stating that BJP suffered on the seat which it has been winning for the past several years.“Teachers and graduates voted for Maha Vikas Aghadi everywhere in Maharashtra. The most shocking result has come from Nagpur. For the last five decades, the BJP has been victorious over the Nagpur Graduate Election Association,” it said. “The headquarters of the Sangh are in Nagpur, but despite the strong association of Sangh ideologues, Nagpur Mayor Sandeep Joshi had to accept defeat. The stronghold was tunnelled, now the foundation has been shaken,” it added. Sena also accused BJP of fielding rebels to bring down its numbers when both parties used to contest elections in the alliance. “BJP-Shiv Sena used to fight together, then the BJP used to spoil the game by putting secret rebels in place to pull the leg of Shiv Sena. Now, this has not happened among the three, the BJP should learn a lesson from this,” the editorial said. Of the six seats of the Maharashtra Legislative Council where polling was held earlier this week, the BJP could win only one while the MVA bagged four. Shiv Sena fielded candidate only on one seat in Amravati where too it suffered defeat.The elections were held on December 1 for the six seats -- three Graduates’ constituencies (Aurangabad, Pune and Nagpur), two Teachers’ constituencies (Pune and Amravati), and one Local Bodies’ constituency in Dhule-Nandurbar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/united-front-needed-to-defeat-impregnable-bjp-shiv-sena/story-7E6QKLPjN7r1b16JleasCM.html

Suresh Kakani, an additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s public health department, said they have sufficient beds to handle the spike. “Most symptomatic patients need oxygen beds... fewer need ICU beds and even fewer need ventilator beds. Hence 50% of Mumbai’s total bed capacity are oxygen beds.” Around 72% of the active cases in Mumbai are asymptomatic, 21% are symptomatic, and 7% are critical, BMC said.

05-12-2020||Mumbai||Clear and unequivocal agreement must for arbitration: Bombay HC||Observing that existence of a clear and unequivocal agreement to refer disputes to an arbitrator is a pre-requisite for arbitration, the Bombay high court on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by one of consultants appointed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA).“There must be a demonstrated consensus ad idem (a meeting of minds or agreement) to refer disputes to arbitration,” said justice Gautam Patel while rejecting the petition filed by Dhargalkar Technoesis (India) Private Limited, seeking to refer its dispute with MMRDA for arbitration.The firm, which had acted as MMRDA’s consultant for a rehabilitation project, contended that certain clauses of its June 2004 agreement with the metropolitan authority clearly indicated the intention of the parties to refer disputes between them to arbitration, though the words arbitration, arbitrator etc. are not specifically mentioned in those clauses.It laid stress on the termination clauses included in both, general and specific parts of the contract, claiming that these clauses mention the term arbitration and confirm or re-affirm the intention of the parties to refer their disputes to arbitration.In support of its argument, the firm relied on the decision in Jagdish Chandler’s case, in which the Apex Court has held that “the absence of words like arbitration and arbitral tribunal or arbitrator are not determinative and an arbitration agreement may well be valid even without such wording.”Also Read: It’s winter in Maharashtra as mercury drops; Mumbai’s air worsensThe firm further claimed that its agreement with MMRDA also fulfilled the requirements for a valid and binding arbitration clause, as laid down by the Supreme Court in the same case - that the agreement must be in writing, parties must have agreed to refer their disputes to a private tribunal, the tribunal should be empowered to adjudicate the dispute in an impartial manner and parties should have agreed to bind themselves by the decision of the tribunal.MMRDA opposed the petition claiming there was no arbitration agreement between the parties and the dispute therefore could not be referred to arbitration. Its counsel, advocate Ajay Khaire, pointed out that the main attribute of any arbitration agreement is consensus ad idem or a meeting of minds, to refer disputes to arbitration. “If this is missing, there is no arbitration agreement,” he asserted.Also Read: SC rejects demand for govt nominees in trust formed for Ayodhya mosqueJustice Patel accepted MMRDA’s stand. “If the non-use of words or phrases like arbitration or arbitrator is not determinative, then, by the same token, the mere use of these words is not determinative either,” said the judge.HC noted that one of the clauses referred by the firm only said that any dispute was to be referred to the joint metropolitan commissioner and project director of MMRDA, whose decision will be final.“On its own — and even allowing that the absence of words like arbitration and arbitrator is immaterial — this is not necessarily an arbitration clause,” said justice Patel. “We cannot unequivocally say this is to be an arbitration (clause) and nothing else,” he added.HC held that the clause did not fulfil the important requirement of “adjudicating the dispute in impartial manner, giving due opportunity to the parties to put forth their case” and therefore can’t be termed as an arbitration agreement.As regards the termination clauses, HC said the mere use of the word “arbitration” in those clauses was immaterial and those clauses indicated that the mode of “dispute resolution” contemplated in it was definitely not arbitration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/clear-and-unequivocal-agreement-must-for-arbitration-bombay-hc/story-tckisCWOviu8dEaA8qvC9M.html

The AQI was 99 (satisfactory) on November 30, worsened to 118 (moderate) by Tuesday and kept increasing to 176 (moderate) by Friday. Bandra Kurla Complex (316) recording a very poor AQI. Colaba (276), Mazgaon (269), Chembur (283), Andheri (218), and Malad (300), all recorded poor air. Worli (73) had the best AQI on Saturday.Researchers said the drop in temperatures combined with calm winds had allowed a rise in pollution levels. “Due to low ventilation, AQI is likely to remain poor for the next two days,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR. The AQI is predicted to be 211 (poor) on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/it-s-winter-in-maharashtra-as-mercury-drops-mumbai-s-air-worsens/story-94oFTg4GTOw7yUGIxkC3pI.html

05-12-2020||Mumbai||BMC orders Global Pagoda at Gorai shut between December 5 and 7||Municipal authorities in Mumbai have cited the Covid-19 pandemic and ordered the closure of Global Vipassana Pagoda at Gorai between December 5 and 7.The Pagoda is a meditation centre and also a monument built as a tribute to Lord Gautama Buddha near Gorai beach. Hundreds of followers of Dr B R Ambedkar who visit his memorial at Dadar in Mumbai on his death anniversary on December 6, also visit the Pagoda. BMC officials said the decision to close the memorial was taken at a meeting of police, ward officials, and the Pagoda’s management on Friday. A BMC official said, “Every year hundreds of people gather at the Pagoda during this time of the year and mere appeal may not help. Hence, we have ordered the management to keep the Pagoda kept shut under the Epidemic Act.” The BMC has said the annual event to pay homage to Ambedkar, who headed the Constitution’s drafting committee, will be organised virtually. Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “This year, on December 06, I will request all citizens to not have gatherings anywhere that might help Covid-19 spread. Instead, we should continue wearing masks, maintain social distancing and maintain all type of hygiene to control the spread of Covid-19.” Around 500 stalls are set up for selling books, lamps, calendars, decorations, posters, T-shirts, watches carrying Ambedkar’s image near the memorial. No such stall will be allowed this year. Anandraj Ambedkar, grandson of Bhimrao Ambedkar, last week cited Covid-19 and appealed to people to not visit Mumbai in large numbers. “I appeal to all followers to organise events at a smaller scale in districts and towns to ensure the safety of all the citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bmc-orders-to-keep-global-pagoda-at-gorai-shut-between-december-5-and-7/story-FOx30MxMgHdOkcbEniZwmI.html

The 701 km ambitious expressway is expected to be fully operational by May 1, 2022, connecting the State’s capital with its second capital at a total project cost of around Rs 55,000 crore.Back in 2017, the land acquisition for the project was opposed by farmers across 10 districts. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation, which is executing the project, has said that the entire land acquisition process has now been completed smoothly. Also Read: Mumbai is Hindi film industry’s heart and soul: IMPPA in letter to Uddhav ThackerayThe expressway will connect 10 districts, 26 talukas and 392 villages between Mumbai and Nagpur.

05-12-2020||Delhi||At 402, Delhi AQI breaches severe category again||Delhi’s air quality deteriorated to the “severe” category on Saturday with the city recording an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 402 at 8 am. The average AQI on Friday was 382. At least 17 of the 35 monitoring stations recorded “severe” category air quality from Friday evening. On a scale of 0-500, an AQI value between 301-400 is considered “very poor” while 401-500 is “severe”. Government agencies had warned the air quality will deteriorate because of a change in wind pattern and slowing down of winds. The situation is likely to remain the same over the weekend.India Meteorological Department (IMD) said stubble burning incidents are now negligible but local pollutants accumulated in the atmosphere have not been able to disperse because of unfavourable weather conditions.“The wind direction changed to easterly from north-westerly. Whenever there is a change in wind direction, it impacts the air quality as winds turn calm for a while and do not allow dispersion. The night temperature is also below normal, which again is not favourable for dispersion. Also, there was increased moisture because of easterly winds, which further traps pollutants close to the ground resulting in deterioration in air quality,” said an IMD scientist.He added any improvement is likely after December 7 when north-westerly winds are likely to return. “From December 7-9, there may be an improvement in air quality as winds speed is expected to remain on the higher side,” he said.On Friday, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 8 degrees C, a notch below normal. The maximum settled at 28.8 degrees C, four notches above normal.The System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said the share of stubble burning to the city’s PM 2.5 levels was just 1%. “The air quality is likely to deteriorate further over the next couple of days because of reduced ventilation and increase in moisture. However, it is likely to recover around December 6-7 with the return of good wind speed,” the SAFAR said. After the annual peak pollution in November, which is mostly attributed to stubble burning, bad air episodes are seen towards December-end and early January. This is mainly because meteorological conditions are even more unfavourable during this time while the baseline pollution (local emissions from Delhi and neighbouring regions) stays the same. This includes local waste burning, industrial fumes, vehicular emissions and dust suspension.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-402-delhi-aqi-breaches-severe-category-again/story-l2lZR3z5nQxZJhOexYImAL.html
05-12-2020||Bhopal||Retired MP school principal made, sold synthetic milk; residents shocked||A chemistry teacher who retired as a Madhya Pradesh government school principal was booked by police on Friday for making and selling synthetic milk in Morena district, 465 km north of Bhopal. The accused is absconding, said police. The act of the 65-year-old retired principal Deendayal Sharma, a resident of Khadiyahar village under Ambah tehsil in Morena district came to light during a raid conducted by a joint team of police, food safety department and district administration personnel on Thursday. The team seized 200 litres of synthetic milk, palm oil and chemicals from the house of the accused, said police. The FIR was lodged on Friday evening on a complaint filed by food safety officer in the district, Avinash Gupta, under sections 272 (Adulteration of food or drink intended for sale), 273 (Sale of noxious food or drink) and 420 (Cheating) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 51, 57, 58 and 59 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, according to the police.As per the FIR, the retired principal was found in possession of synthetic milk and he tried to mislead the raiding team by claiming to collect 250-300 litres of milk daily but he couldn’t show any licence or registration for any such business. “During the raid, 10 kg of maltodextrin powder and 8 kg of refined palm oil was seized, besides the milk samples, which were sent to the State food laboratory for examination. The materials seized suggest that Deendayal Sharma prepares synthetic milk and sells it to others, which is harmful for the health of people,” said the complainant in the FIR. Sihonia police station in charge Rajkumar Singh said, “A police team went to arrest the accused Deendayal Sharma after the FIR was lodged against him but he was found absconding. We will arrest him soon.” Also Read: MP home minister volunteers for Covid-19 vaccine trialA local social activist and former student of Deendayal Sharma, Jayant Tomar, said, “When Sharma joined girls’ higher secondary school in Khadiyahar almost 15 years ago, the passing percentage of the girls’ students was just 17% but he helped improve it to 70% in just a few years. He also made efforts to improve the quality of education. That’s why we can’t believe that he may be involved in a crime like adulteration.” A state-wide campaign is going on across the state against adulteration of food. In Morena, National Security Act (NSA) was invoked against a dairy owner Dharmendra Sharma on Wednesday for making synthetic milk.(With input from Shivpratap Singh Jadon in Morena)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/retd-mp-school-principal-made-sold-synthetic-milk-residents-shocked/story-z5jx5jrzBFtnwCv3lWkvCJ.html

05-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai is Hindi film industry’s heart and soul: IMPPA in letter to Uddhav Thackeray||The Indian Motion Picture Producers’ Association (IMPPA) on Friday wrote a letter to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, stressing that the film industry will continue to stay in the city.The letter comes days after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath proposed an alternate film city in UP.  Adityanath had recently unveiled an ambitious plan to set up the film city in Noida and rolled out an open offer to film fraternity to come to Uttar Pradesh.Ahead of his Mumbai visit recently, ruling Congress in Maharashtra had alleged a conspiracy to snatch away the film city to UP, and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had vowed not to allow anybody to “forcibly” take away businesses.In a letter addressed to Thackeray, IMPPA said they were “happy to note” that the chief minister had “vocally and clearly stated that Maharashtra is the birth place of the film industry.”  “Mumbai is the heart of the Hindi film industry and nobody can take it anywhere because the industry consists of its people, which are producers, directors, artistes and other technicians are the ones who form the core of the industry.“We can assure you that our members will definitely not lose out on opportunities made available to them by other states and countries but they will never shift their base,” the IMPPA said in the letter.The film body further asserted that Mumbai is the “heart and soul” of the industry. “It is noteworthy that Mumbai produces majority of films in Hindi language which is the one language in the country which has kept Indians all over the world connected to each other due to the entertainment and drama provided to them by Hindi films which are the main source of saluting our culture and social fabric and keeping national integrity alive and intact.“In the present economic scenario as the lockdown pandemic continues to wreak havoc, the birth place of Hindi cinema is gradually becoming the graveyard and we have repeatedly pleaded that necessary steps need to be taken to save the Hindi film industry,” IMPPA added.It said that the Maharashtra government has a responsibility to ensure the film industry’s survival.“The Hindi film industry is also a business which needs to be nurtured and looked after and hence all benefits available to other industries have to be made available to films and entertainment industry if they are going to be a sustainable and viable proposition,” the letter added.During his visit, Adityanath met experts from Bollywood, including directors, producers and actors, to seek their suggestions for the upcoming film city in Noida which will be spread across 1,000 acres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-is-hindi-film-industry-s-heart-and-soul-imppa-in-letter-to-uddhav-thackeray/story-bc85J0ixpyn7ysXLP787JI.html
05-12-2020||Chandigarh||Manesar land scam: Court slams CBI for ‘pick and choose’ probe||Special CBI judge Jagdeep Singh, who had on December 1 summoned five additional accused in the Manesar land scam, has come down heavily on the central agency for conducting investigations in a pick and choose manner. The judge said conduct of investigators, especially in sensitive matters, needed to be scrutinised with reference to their movements and calls records of the relevant time. “Reasons may be two fold — the investigating officer (IO) was either adamant to extend benefit to the persons arrayed as accused or to extend benefit to the persons against whom there are clear cut and prima facie circumstances but have not been arraigned as accused,” said the special judge in his 176-page order. The order said such isolated instances are enough to bring the “sobriquet of caged parrot to the agency”. The special judge, who had on December 1 ordered framing of charges against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and 32 other accused chargesheeted by the CBI, said the court is not supposed to act as a mere post office or a mouth piece of the prosecuting agency and act as a mute spectator. In his reaction sought by HT, Hooda had said that framing of charges was a part of the process. “I have got full faith in judiciary. As far as this case is concerned, it is politically motivated,” the former chief minister had said. The court said despite unambiguous statements of witnesses and documents on record, the IO has chosen to turn a blind eye to the role of some important public servants whose acts and omissions can be prima facie termed to be more culpable than the persons arrayed as accused in this case. ‘IO’s narrative contradicted by material on record’ The court said sporadic instances of the biased and tainted investigations of a few investigators cannot dent the image of this agency. The IO has sought to introduce narrative which on the face of its gets contradicted vide documents and material on record. It apparently appears that IO has done investigation in an apparent pick and choose manner, for the reasons best known to him. The court had also summoned five additional accused, including former HSIIDC managing director Rajiv Arora, former industries director DR Dhingra, former HSIIDC chief town planner Surjit Singh, former chief town planner of town and country planning Dhare Singh, and former town and country planning deputy superintendent Kulwant Lamba. From the documents on record, it needs no forensic skills to find out that the foundations of making the acquisition proceedings to lapse was laid down by the functionaries of industries department and HSIIDC, in cahoots with each other. Prima facie culpability of the then industries director, DR Dhingra, is further reflected from the statement of witness, the court said. ‘Law does not permit mini trial at this stage’ Dismissing the discharge application of the accused, the court said it is required to evaluate the material and documents on record with a view to find out if the facts emerging therefrom, taken at their face value, disclose the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offences. The law does not permit a mini trial at this stage, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/manesar-land-scam-court-slams-cbi-for-pick-and-choose-probe/story-Tg07B4X7PKs7bhJeU5VkKM.html
05-12-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana civic body polls: JJP to bargain hard, will seek lion’s share in seats||The Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), the ambitious alliance partner of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana, is unlikely to accept anything less than its already decided pound of flesh in the state government while hammering a seat-sharing formula for the upcoming municipal bodies’ elections. The BJP, which depends heavily on the support of the JJP to stay in power in Haryana, will hold the seat-sharing talks with its ally in next two days. And, ahead of the meeting the JJP has been giving final touches to the survey being done by the party legislators to ascertain its pockets of strength and the possible candidates, sources in the JJP-BJP said. The general elections for the seats of mayor and members of all the wards municipal corporations (MCs) of Ambala, Panchkula and Sonepat, president and members of municipal council of Rewari, and municipal committees of Sampla (Rohtak), Dharuhera (Rewari) and Uklana (Hisar) will be held on December 27. The results will be declared on December 30 and the six days’ window of filing nominations will open on December 11. The seats of mayor in corporations and president in council and committees will now be filled up through direct elections. All three MCs have 20 wards each, while the Rewari council has 31 wards, and committees of Sampla, Dharuhera and Uklana have 15, 17 and 13 wards each, respectively. Hence, hard bargaining is likely during the talks between the alliance partners before fielding over 140 candidates, including mayor in corporations. “The JJP will field its candidate for the mayor’s post in at least one MC. The seat-sharing arrangement will be decided within two to three days,” Digvijay Singh Chautala, senior JJP leader and younger brother of deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, said. Another key JJP leader, refusing to be identified, indicated that the JJP would seek more seats in rural wards of the three MCs, Rewari council and three committees. “The BJP has presence in urban belts, while we are very good in rural areas, including the rural pockets of Panchkula MC,” the JJP leader said. Sources in the JJP say the party will demand either Sonepat or Ambala mayor’s seat, besides staking claim on wards of the corporations, council and committees on the lines the alliance was stitched to form the government in October 2019.

05-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air very poor, may turn severe: IMD||Delhi’s air quality plunged to the far end of the ‘very poor’ zone on Friday as the wind speed and pattern changed, resulting in the slow dispersion of pollutants. At least 17 of the 35 monitoring stations had turned deep red, reaching the ‘severe’ zone on Friday. The air quality index (AQI) is likely to deteriorate further over the next two days and may touch ‘severe’ by Saturday, government agencies have forecast. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4 pm bulletin, the AQI was 382, higher than 341 on Thursday. It was 373 on Wednesday. Most monitoring stations that are in ‘severe’ category include hot spots such as Anand Vihar, ITO, Vivek Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela and Mundka, among others.According to weather scientists at the India Meteorological Department, with stubble burning incidents being negligible at present, local pollutants that have accumulated in the atmosphere have not been able to disperse because of unfavourable weather conditions.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the wind speed was just around 6-7 kmph during the day, which is not favourable for dispersal. “Besides, the wind direction changed to easterly from northwesterly. Whenever there is a change in wind direction, it impacts the air quality as winds turn calm for a while and do not allow dispersion. The night temperature is also below normal, which again is not favourable for dispersion. There was increased moisture because of easterly winds, which traps pollutants close to the ground,” Srivastava said.He said the air quality may turn ‘severe’ over the weekend and any improvement is likely only after December 7 when northwesterly winds are likely to return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-very-poor-may-turn-severe-imd/story-zhtoLVZzJrEXozfVqUnlhM.html

05-12-2020||Lucknow||Families keep low profile as cops stop interfaith wedding||The families of an interfaith couple confined themselves to their respective houses through Thursday and Friday after police did not allow them to conduct the couple’s wedding in Lucknow on Wednesday night, according to people familiar with the matter.Police intervened in the matter on a complaint by activists of a hardline Hindu outfit, though it was a consensual union acceptable to the families of the 21-year-old Hindu woman and the 24-year-old Muslim man, citing violation of a new law in Uttar Pradesh against forced and dishonest religious conversions.Before the police intervention, the families had mutually agreed to solemnise the wedding with Hindu rituals first and later conduct it in accordance with Muslim practices. The families were asked to apply for permission to conduct an interfaith marriage from the district magistrate.On Thursday and Friday, the families avoided talking to the media and social activists approaching them. A friend of the groom’s family, requesting anonymity, said the two lower-middle-class families stayed in the same colony developed by the district urban development agency (DUDA) in Narpatkheda locality under Para police station limits.“Their houses are barely at a distance of 15 metres in the same colony and love blossomed between them, while they were living there for the past few years and they decided to get married. Their families also agreed recently, after which the marriage was scheduled on Wednesday night,” he stated.“Everything was going well till Wednesday night. The groom was following each and every ritual done in Hindu marriages, like tying turmeric beads on the wrists. The bride’s family had made arrangements for the wedding feast. They had invited their relatives and friends. But suddenly the police intervention halted the rituals. The two families were then summoned to the Para police station and told about the new law,” he added.He also said the two families had discussed the matter but had not applied for the marriage permission yet. He said they were planning to engage a lawyer and apply together for the permission next week.Another local said the bride’s family had spent around ₹85,000 to make all the arrangements, but all of it went in vain.Madhu Garg, state president of the All India Democratic Women Association (AIDWA), criticised the incident and stated that the country’s constitution allowed everybody to follow any religion. She said police intervention in private affairs amounting to violating the rights and privacy of the two families.Garg said AIDWA workers visited the two families on Friday, but they were not ready to interact.“After much reluctance, the woman’s family stated they have sorted out the issue and there is no pressure from police or administration to cancel the marriage. But it seemed that they had fear of some local activists on whose complaint the police had halted the marriage,” she added.However, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), South, Suresh Chandra Rawat had earlier said the police had not intervened in anybody’s personal affair, but the two families had been suggested to proceed according to the new law to avoid any inconvenience in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/families-keep-low-profile-as-cops-stop-interfaith-wedding/story-bVv9d9xWznJxSXFdUVM31H.html

This panel includes health officers from rural areas, various municipal corporations and municipal councils within the district.Manish Renge, District Health Officer, Thane District, said, “We have prepared a strategy for immunisation, a list of 55,000 health workers from across the district has been made till now.

We are awaiting guidelines from the state government. Moreover, health officers have been asked to make necessary preparations within their jurisdiction.”Dayanand Katke, Health Officer, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, said, “We have the capacity to store vaccines between two degrees Celsius and eight degrees Celsius. For temperatures lower than that, we will have to make arrangements. Hence, we are waiting for guidelines from the state government to know if we need additional provisions for storing the vaccines. At present we are in the process of collecting and making a database of health workers who will be a priority for the immunisation process.”A meeting of the district task force committee was held on Thursday. Kailas Pawar, civil surgeon, Thane district, said, “We have given time till December 15 for all municipal corporations to submit their list of health workers. The number of health workers may reach one lakh by then. Based on these figures, we have to make provisions for vaccine storage and immunisation. The vaccines from different countries will require various temperatures and different kinds of cold storage. We are prepared with the basic ones but we will need additional provisions in case temperatures have to be less than minus-17 degrees.”Thane district had conducted Measles Rubella vaccination last year. The basic provisions made for the same includes vaccinators and cold storage facilities. The district has kept the same facilities for Covid-19 vaccines as well for now.Meanwhile, the TMC has claimed that they can immunise the whole city within seven days. “We have made provisions for cold storage and deep freezers at health centres, where we can store around one lakh vaccines per day. As the vaccine will arrive in batches, we won’t need huge spaces, if there are any guidelines from the state Government regarding the same, we will surely implement them. However, as of now, we have made arrangements to provide area-wise vaccinations,” said Dr Raju Murudkar, TMC health officer.The TMC is currently making arrangements for vaccination centres in various wards such that they can easily reach out to the entire city population and complete the immunisation process at the earliest.Meanwhile, the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has prepared a list of 4,572 health workers from 413 private and government hospitals within its jurisdiction. Provisions of around 242 people who will indulge in the vaccination process have been made already by the civic body.Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC, said, “We are still in the process of conducting meetings and planning for the vaccination. As soon as we get guidelines from the state government we will implement it as per needs and provisions within KDMC jurisdiction.”Thane district notices a drop in active cases In the last one week, Thane district has seen a slight dip in active cases from 16,066 on November 28 to 15,140 on December 3.

Noida’s Amardeep Malik and Gurugram-based Veer Ahlawat played a card of four-under-68 each for the second day in succession to be placed at tied second.Eighteen-year-old Delhi-based rookie golfer Harshjeet Singh Sethie struck a fine 67 to be placed fourth at seven-under-137. Pre-tournament favourite Anirban Lahiri moved up five places into tied fifth at six-under-138.Sharma made five birdies and a bogey on his action-packed back nine and missed out on a hole-in-one by a foot on the 11th. He also made a good chip-putt for birdie on the 17th and followed that up with an exceptional approach on the 18th, which had a tight flag, to set up a birdie.“Four-under is a great score considering that I started in the morning when the conditions are tougher due to a lower temperature. My target was to hit the first five greens and I succeeded in doing that playing two-under on the stretch in the process,” said Sharma, 30.Anirban Lahiri (70-68), who is playing in India after a long gap, did well by picking up five birdies and a bogey. The highlight of his round was the massive 330-yard drive on the seventh hole where he pocketed a birdie.After playing a four-over-76 in the first round, Chandigarh’s Karandeep Kochhar bounced back with the day’s best score of 66. The effort placed him tied 18th at two-under-142. “In round one, I was nervous playing in the same group as Anirban for the first time. I was more at ease today.

05-12-2020||City||School education department not authorised to grant fee relief under Disaster Management Act: Institute to Bombay high court||In what can be deemed as a setback for the Maharashtra government, a petitioner has argued that the state’s decision to restrain private unaided schools and permanently unaided schools from hiking school fees for the academic year 2020-21 on May 8, is invalid. The petitioner submitted that while the legislation has appointed the revenue and forest department as the sole authority to implement the DM Act, the May 8 government resolution (GR) was issued by the school education and sports department, and was hence ultra vires (beyond one’s legal power or authority). A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the GR issued by the school education and sports department on May 8 restrained the fee hike and forcing parents from paying fees during the lockdown, was informed by advocates Prateek Seksaria and Saket Mone for Global Education Foundation that the impugned GR was not valid. Seksaria drew the attention of the bench towards the various notifications, circulars and resolutions pertaining to implementing various reliefs for the citizens of the state issued since March 23 and said that all of them had been issued by the revenue and forest department. Seksaria also pointed out to the fact that the state had also violated Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution by issuing the May 8 GR, as it had singled out private unaided schools. “The state, as per a circular issued soon after the lockdown was implemented, had said that it wanted to provide a source of income or reduce the expenses of the people. However, by asking private institutions not to hike or collect fees, it was violating the constitutional rights of the institutions,” submitted Seksaria. He added that the restriction on collecting fees was only restricted during the lockdown period. Hence, the GR could not have been enforced after June 8, when ‘Mission Begin Again’ was implemented and lockdown restrictions were eased. He also submitted that in light of the fact that the schools were regulated by the Fee Regulation Act, 2011, further restrictions could not be forced upon the private institutions. After hearing the submissions, the court sought clarity on the applicability of section 6 (1) A of the Fee Regulation act which was introduced last year in September, and deals with parents consenting to schools hiking fees annually from Class 1 to Class 10 or in two parts: from Class 1 to Class 5 and Class 6 to Class 10 at the time of admission. Seksaria submitted that the GR restrictions were applicable for such fee increases too, as students took transfers from one school to another or from one state to another. Arguments by other petitioners will continue on Wednesday, December 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/school-education-department-not-authorised-to-grant-free-relief-under-disaster-management-act-institute-to-bombay-high-court/story-R4xyy82V4KWfFvlkU9TUgL.html

Our main aim is to make them aware about the fine and the rules they had broken,” added Patil.In 2019, Thane traffic police started the e-challan system, doing away with paper receipts and enabling transparency in the penalisation of errant motorists.Last year, 6,30,232 e-challans were issued with a fine of ₹21Cr, while this year, from January to October end, 5,52,453 e-challans were issued with a total fine of ₹22Cr.Traffic police claimed that these fines can be paid on their website www.mahtraffic.gov.in or the Maharashtra or Mum traffic app. Payment can also be made through Paytm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-police-collect-30l-fine-from-traffic-violators-for-not-paying-e-challan/story-X0lW95QBtUy9KOGfnZpb8L.html

05-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai joins C40 cities to fight climate change||Mumbai has become the sixth Indian city to be chosen as a member of the C40 cities – a global network of cities committed to tackling climate change. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray made the announcement on Twitter on Friday. “Happy to inform all the climate change action believers that I have received a confirmation mail on a unanimous vote to accept Mumbai as a C40 member city. We had applied to be a part of this group as we believe that our cities can lead the climate change initiative,” read his tweet. Later he spoke to HT about the development and said, “Mumbai as a city is committed towards climate change mitigation and adaptation action. We’ll propose other cities such as Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, and Thane too, which have the potential to be member cities.” C40 connects 97 of the world’s largest and most influential cities. C40 membership encourages cities to develop and implement a climate action plan compatible with the Paris Agreement goal. The leaders of these cities use a science-based approach and there is an exchange of best practices to take effective action for keeping the global average temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius and reducing emissions by 2030 as per the Paris Agreement. Apart from Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, Jaipur and Kolkata are also in the C40 member cities’ list from India. According to state government officials, Maharashtra drafted a state climate change action policy in 2017 with detailed plans to address climate change impacts and the sea-level rise for coastal areas that is regularly upgraded.As per the action plan’s climate vulnerability index, Mumbai, Nandurbar, Dhule and Buldhana from Maharashtra were identified as the most vulnerable districts to climate threat. These cities face a likely risk of a 22%-32% rise in extreme weather events by 2030. For the coastal cities in Maharashtra, the plan identifies a rise in annual mean temperatures ranging from 1.19 degrees Celsius to 1.33 degrees Celsius by the next decade and up to 15 degrees Celsius increase in heat index (measure of rising temperatures incorporating humidity). The sea-level rise is projected to be 24-66cm along Maharashtra’s coastline by 2030. According to an independent analysis report by McKinsey & Company Inc, almost three million people living within a kilometre of Mumbai’s coastline are under threat from coastal flooding, storm surges and sea-level rise. Environment groups campaigning against climate change said Mumbai’s inclusion as C40 city had happened at a time when the world is entering the post-Covid-19 pandemic phase. “This will provide an opportunity to consciously think of future developments in Mumbai, keeping climate change in mind. In the post Covid-19 era, Mumbai needs to focus on green recovery and push for reforms to help fight climate change,” said Bhagwan Kesbhat, founder and chief executive officer, Mumbai-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) Waatavaran. Kesbhat added that the initial steps should be to strengthen cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, focus on mass transit transport systems, provide protection to open and green spaces and encourage all new constructions to be green and low-energy consumption. Meanwhile, C40 measures the level of participation of its member cities annually. Its 2019 annual report recognised Delhi NCT, Dubai and Dhaka as the most active cities in the South and West Asia region. State climate action policy: Measures for coastal zones The state’s climate change action policy detailed plans to address climate change impacts and sea-level rise for coastal areas. Some of the key points of the plan include:•No new constructions across low lying areas along the coast (especially for Mumbai). Wherever permission has to be given for residential complex, climate resilient construction should be done on elevated zones, keeping in mind the distance from the high-tide line and probable tide water ingress •Natural ecosystem protection measures: Mangroves, wetlands, salt pans, natural forests to be protected as per existing environmental laws and ensuring natural beach restoration measures are in place to avoid erosion •Revise existing development plans for cities by including climate change policy and avoiding future construction along low-lying zones close to the coast through sustainable development •No permissions for polluting ‘red category’ industries in low-lying areas and ensuring water quality along the coast is in check •Ensuring proper height and structural stability for linear infrastructure projects, especially coastal bridges, to withstand extreme rainfall and floods •Developing anti-sea erosion bunds along the coast wherever natural solutions are not available to avoid natural erosion •Effective implementation of coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms for all projects. Reclamation of CRZ-1 (first 500m of land from high tide line and not till the hazard line, includes mangroves and 50m buffer zone) areas banned completely• Considering and developing alternate livelihood schemes and skill development for coastal communities moving away from fishing to other activities such as horticulture, farming etc. All departments of the Maharashtra government to prepare their own climate change policy using examples from the state’s action plan and implement the same district and region-wise.

05-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai University students of Thane centre threaten protest for not receiving mark sheets||Students of Mumbai University’s Thane sub-centre in Balkum threaten to go on a protest as they have not received their mark sheets since the last four years. Around 36 students pursuing integrated law and management courses are part of this fight to get their mark sheets. Such protests were conducted earlier and the university had promised to issue the mark sheets at the earliest. However, it was not done.“We are part of the integrated law course. It’s been four years and not once have we received our mark sheets. The results are put up on the notice board. If we want more details, we have to pay around ₹1,000 and get a re-evaluation done or can check our answer sheets. However, they are not giving us our mark sheets and there is no authority present at the sub-centre to answer our queries,” said Jayesh Desai, 21, a law student here. A five-year integrated course in Management and Law is being conducted since 2014 within the campus. These students will soon begin their final year and will require their mark sheets for further education or job prospects.“In between, when we had a similar protest, they distributed mark sheets but most of them was riddled with errors. So we had to return them. We will soon have a meeting with cabinet minister Jitendra Awhad to discuss our issues,” said Bhavin Kamyani, 20, another student.“We will have to find out the problems faced by the centre and understand the technicalities involved in this before we respond to the students,” said Leeladhar Bansode, Deputy Registrar in-charge of Mumbai University’s Public Relations.In July 2018, more than 40 students and parents had gathered in protest outside the Mumbai University sub-centre at Balkum in Thane as the university had failed to give mark sheets of six semesters to around 130 students.The students gathered at the campus at around 11am and did not budge till the officials went to the university campus in Kalina and got the mark sheets of four semesters at around 6pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-university-students-of-thane-centre-threaten-protest-for-not-receiving-mark-sheets/story-rGTlEI99CWySnZx4z0HqjN.html

However, of the 127 deaths, 57 were from the past 48 hours, 27 from the past week and 43 were from the period before last week. The state also recorded 5,229 new cases to take its infection tally to 1,842,587. Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 813 new Covid-19 cases and 14 deaths, taking the city’s tally and toll to 284,509 and 10,945. Also read: Mumbai hospital continues to wait for Covaxin to begin clinical trialsWith the daily caseload “under control” in the state, authorities have now decided to focus on districts with high number of cases and positivity rate. “Districts with high positivity and fatality rates have been directed to go for more testing and aggressive contact tracing to keep the spread in control. Although the daily caseload hasn’t risen drastically, it can still gradually increase from the last week of December. As projected and conveyed to local authorities, we have to be prepared for the second wave, or another peak, in January or February. The districts that have poor health infrastructure have been directed to ramp it up,” said a health department official, on condition of anonymity.In the past 10 days, the state has reported an average of 5,279 infections daily, contrary to the projection of a surge in cases after Diwali. The weekly growth rate, too, has dropped to 0.31%; doubling period has risen to 225 days; and case fatality rate (CFR) has fallen to 2.58% as on December 1, according to the state health department presentation made before the cabinet. Weekly CFR has also fallen to 1.44% between November 25 and December 1 from 3.72%, highest in the recent past, between November 4 and 10. Also read: BMC aims to vaccinate 1 crore Mumbaiites within a monthThe state’s per million cases, however, are still high in Pune, Thane, Nagpur, Mumbai and Raigad.

As many as 17 districts in the state have CFR more than the state’s 2.58%, with highest being in Mumbai (3.83%), followed by Akola (3.68%) and Parbhani (3.57%). In districts like Nashik, Gondia, Ratnagiri and Palghar, the weekly positivity rate is more than 10%, against state’s weekly positivity rate of 7.57%. Dr Avinash Bhondve, Maharashtra president, Indian Medical Association, said the state machinery is lagging in contact tracing and daily testing. “As per what we have gathered from patients at clinics, the state machinery has not been able to trace contacts of infected patients. The number of tests, too, should increase, if the state really wants to restrict the spread. Government has been talking about tracking the super-spreaders, but on the ground, no such drive exists. On the other hand, people, too, are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour by maintaining social distancing and wearing masks at public places,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/100-deaths-reported-for-third-consecutive-day-in-maharashtra-covid-19-toll-rises-to-47-599/story-NkyrQ8RFQxBCKDGDSvwv6M.html
05-12-2020||City||Passengers claim mandatory RT-PCR tests at Mumbai airport leading to chaos, delay||Within 10 days of the state government mandating the gold standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for arrivals from Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Goa, passengers have raised concerns over the manner in which these tests are being conducted at the city airport. Passengers have been complaining about chaos, violation of social distancing norms and delay in getting test reports from two to five days. Malad resident Urvi Vora, who flew out of Mumbai for a week to celebrate her wedding anniversary, waited for three hours before her test was conducted on Thursday night. The couple decided not to get themselves tested from the source airport because of a higher cost and scepticism over the report’s authenticity. “The (Mumbai) airport authority needs to ensure that they deploy adequate number of people around the testing counters to assist the entire RT-PCR process. We were all by our own for hours and there was utter chaos and confusion when we reached the arrivals area,” said Vora, adding, “Only one of the five desks were operational and no kits were available with the staff, leading to considerable delay.” Airport sources said a group of passengers from Goa wanted to leave without the test. “As this group was standing in queue for a long time, they decided to leave the airport without getting tested. They created a ruckus, after which the local police were called to pacify them. They were allowed to leave the airport only after undergoing the test.” Airport security officers said there have been instances where passengers have manhandled airport staff on the issue of testing. An airport spokesperson said that the registration counters and the sample collection booths at the airport have been increased. “Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) is continuously working to reduce the queuing time for the test. CSMIA has also introduced an additional testing facility to reduce the waiting time for the arriving passengers,” said the spokesperson. CSMIA officials said passengers can scan quick response (QR) code (which is used for online registration) or take the assistance of the counter staff to fill-in the self-declaration form and proceed towards the testing facility at the government-approved rate of Rs1,400. “BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) officials stationed at the airport are ensuring that all arriving domestic passengers comply with the guidelines laid down by the state. Further, airlines have been requested to make available the QR code for the RT -PCR test before boarding the flight. Airlines have also been requested to ensure that in-flight announcements in this regard are mandatorily made,” said a CSMIA official. Following Thursday’s chaos at the airport, Suburban Diagnostics, which is conducting the testing, had a meeting with CSMIA officials on Friday. Sushant Kinra, chief executive officer of Suburban Diagnostics, said, “Usually, our waiting time for each passenger is 25-30 minutes. But the delay on Thursday could have been because of the change in the staff’s duty time. To avoid such a situation, we have now displayed QR codes more prominently and asked our staffers to give the options of filling passenger detail forms using tablets apart from the physical forms.” He added, “Starting Friday, we have increased our counters from five to eight, and 32 people will be working in three shifts to ensure that sufficient staffers man the counters and help passengers. Instead of daily passes, we also have weekly airport entry passes in place now. This will save time by allowing the staffers to be at their work station on time.” Passengers have claimed that these problems have been existing since the past few days. For instance, Navi Mumbai resident Roshan Negi, who landed in Mumbai from Goa on November 30, said he and his wife voluntarily got themselves tested for Covid-19. But when they landed, testing counters were set up at places where they went unnoticed, owing to which many of their fellow passengers escaped the tests. “Though we landed on Monday, we are yet to get our online report. We have been following up with pathology lab but it has been of no use. As a precautionary measure, we haven’t stepped out of our homes since Monday, but how long can we be at home?” asked Negi, adding, “Won’t the purpose of testing an arriving passenger for Covid-19 get defeated if a passenger is allowed to leave the airport without the report?” Kinra did not comment on the delay in generating the test reports of passengers. Mumbai’s CSMIA handles 150 departures and an equal number of arrivals each day. Top airport sources confirmed that only 3,355 passengers have undergone the RT-PCR test in the past eight days. Airport sources revealed that passengers are trying to escape tests. “There have been instances where passengers trying to sneak out have been asked to get the tests before leaving the arrivals area. However, this happens when passengers of only one flight are in the arrival area. In the situation where more than two flights land at a time, it gets difficult to keep an eye on every passengers’ movements and they are successful in leaving the airport without undergoing the RT-PCR test. Some passengers do not want to pay, while some others claim they can’t afford the test,” said the source.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/passengers-claim-mandatory-rt-pcr-tests-at-mumbai-airport-leading-to-chaos-delay/story-hW8AVopjTR5z39R4eggmUO.html
05-12-2020||City||Maharashtra Legislative Council elections: BJP loses seats in strongholds Nagpur and Pune||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suffered a setback in elections to six seats of the Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC). The ruling three-party coalition, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) won four seats, while the BJP won one. An independent candidate is leading in the sixth seat and is likely to win. To make it worse for the BJP, it lost Nagpur graduates’ constituency which was its stronghold for decades. The constituency was represented by Union minister Nitin Gadkari as well as former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ father, late Gangadharrao Fadnavis. Congress’ Abhijit Wanjari won the seat comfortably by defeating Sandeep Joshi, former Nagpur mayor and a close aide of Fadnavis for whom it was a prestigious election. Three graduates’ constituencies from Aurangabad, Nagpur and Pune (in which graduates who had enrolled themselves as voters for these elections voted), two teachers’ constituencies from Pune and Amravati (in which teachers enrolled as voters) and local bodies constituency in Dhule-Nandurbar (which has elected representatives in local government bodies voted) went to polls on November 1. Out of six seats, four are bagged by the MVA. An independent candidate, Kiran Sarnaik, is leading in Amravati teachers’ constituency. The result in the constituency is not announced yet. Of these seats, Nagpur and Pune seats were considered a stronghold of the BJP. The defeat in Nagpur, the hometown of both Fadnavis and Gadkari, is considered significant for the party. All the pre-poll arithmetic, organisational strength, meticulous campaign and the party’s stronghold did not help BJP candidate Sandip Joshi as he lost to Abhijit Wanjari (Congress) by 18,910 votes. This is for the first time a candidate from BJP or its previous avatar, Jansangh, is defeated in this constituency since its inception. A sizable section within the BJP, on conditions of anonymity, pointed out that Nitin Gadkari group didn’t work whole-heartedly for Joshi, as the sitting legislator from the constituency, Anil Sole, a protégé of Gadkari, was replaced by Sandip Joshi at the eleventh hour. Joshi had worked as chief election co-ordinator for Fadnavis in his Assembly elections from Nagpur south-west assembly constituency and the former chief minister made it a prestige issue to get Joshi the ticket and his victory. However, neither Fadnavis nor Joshi succeeded to convince the rank and file the reasons for the denial of ticket to Sole, an ex-college teacher. Moreover, Sole, who knows the constituency well as a sitting MLC and being a campaigner for Gadkari when he represented the region, was not visible during the campaign. He was even not entrusted any election responsibility during the campaign. Besides, Wanjari of Congress also managed to polarise the OBC voters against Joshi, a Brahmin candidate.Both Fadnavis and Gadkari were camping in Nagpur for a week to campaign for Joshi. Sole, however, said that the defeat of the BJP candidate was shocking for them. “Late announcement of the candidate may be one of the reasons. Anyway, we will certainly analyse the reasons and consolidate our base in the constituency in next elections,” he said. Nagpur city BJP chief and party legislator, Pravin Datke said that they could not guess the undercurrent among the voters this time. “The Congress candidate succeeded to polarise the OBC votes against us and it led to the defeat,” he added. The defeats of Pune and Nagpur Graduate Constituencies were an outburst of rank and file of the BJP against the two top BJP leaders of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis and the state BJP chief Chandrakantdada Patil, who have marginalised party leaders, like union minister Nitin Gadkari, Eknath Khadse, Vinod Tawde and Sudhir Mungantiwar said Dilip Deodhar, along-time RSS observer, based in Nagpur. The former editor of Tarun Bharat, the mouthpiece of RSS, Vinod Deshmukh, felt that the entire election was polarised on caste-basis. “In Nagpur, the election was virtually Joshi versus OBC,” he pointed out and claimed that even some Congress leaders, including a cabinet minister, openly said during the election campaign that why people should vote for Joshi, a Brahmin, and appealed to vote for Wanjani, an OBC. Moreover, delay in announcing the candidate by the BJP was another reason for the defeat of Joshi, who could not cover all the six districts in a short period of 20 days. On the other hand, the Congress had given a node for the candidature of Wanjari two years ago, Deshmukh further pointed out.In 2014 elections, Sole of BJP had defeated Baban Taywade of Congress with a margin of 31,259 votes. From 1988 to 2014, the constituency was represented by BJP’s Nitin Gadkari, who later won the Lok Sabha polls from Nagpur, to become Union Transport Minister in the Narendra Modi-led NDA Government at the Centre. Gadkari had emerged victorious from Graduates’ constituency for five times in a row. Before Gadkari, Gangadharrao Fadnavis, father of Devendra Fadnavis was elected from the constituency as Jansangh initially and later as BJP nominee. Following the death of sitting member Gangadharrao Fadnavis, the vacancy was caused and Gadkari was elected in 1988. Both Pune seats were bagged by NCP (Arun Lad in graduates’ constituency) and Congress (Jayant Asgaonkar in teachers’ constituency) defeating BJP candidates on their turf.NCP’s Satish Chavan won from the Aurangabad graduate constituency for the third time in a row. He defeated BJP’s Shirish Boralkar.The lone seat the BJP won was Dhule-Nandurbar local bodies constituency. Party candidate Amrish Patel defeated Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi’s Abhijit Patil by 234 votes. Patel polled 332 votes, while Patil got 98 votes. Congress leaders expressed surprise over defeat as MVA has 213 members in local bodies, while BJP’s strength is 199. Patel had changed sides to join BJP by quitting Congress ahead of Assembly polls last year.In Amravati teachers ‘constituency, independent candidate Kiran Sarnaik of Washim was ahead of his nearest rivals Shrikant Deshpande of Shiv Sena with a comfortable majority.Thursday results are seen as a significant victory for the ruling MVA which has announced to contest all the elections including that to the local bodies together in the future.Ruling party leaders said it is a token of the acceptance of the leadership of MVA. “BJP has been decimated in 24 districts in the state during the council elections which were fought directly from the people. This is ‘Maharashtra Express’ of MVA,” said former chief minister, public works department minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan.“The results are not as per our expectations as we were expecting more seats to win. We miscalculated the combined power of the three ruling parties under MVA,” said the leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi’s (MVA) candidate Arun Lad’s victory in the elections to the Pune graduate constituency on Friday has brought much confidence to the MVA camp - leaders and workers - and has forced the BJP on the backfoot.Chandrakant Patil, BJP Mumbai’s unit president, who earlier represented this constituency, said, “Three parties come together and contested against a single party. Shiv Sena is helping the Congress and NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) but is getting nothing in return. Sena must think about it.”NCP leader Ajit Pawar said, “The victory of Arun Lad is the answer to the Opposition party leaders making allegations. Now it is proved that graduate voters also support the MVA.”Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “We failed to estimate the power of the three parties unitedly.” BJP’s member of Parliament (MP) Girish Bapat accepted the defeat of the BJP candidate and said, “We must do an analysis.”NCP leader Sharad Pawar said, “The results show that the citizens are expressing confidence in the MVA. The climate is changing in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-legislative-council-elections-bjp-loses-seats-in-strongholds-nagpur-and-pune/story-PyiZZdLhnepEZ2iPW33rUK.html
05-12-2020||Chandigarh||Year after 26-year-old’s death, 6 engineering students booked for murder in Ludhiana||Over a year after a 26-year-old man was found dead on his scooter at Barota Road near Sidhwan Canal, six engineering students were booked for murder on Friday. The accused Amandeep Singh of Badar Dod village, Moga; Harsimran Singh of Rama village, Moga; Harry of Sandor village, Sangrur; Naman of Chandigarh; Kashyap of Phillaur ;and Sumit of Patiala were engineering students. They lived in the same paying guest accommodation in Bachittar Nagar near Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Gill Road as the victim, Daya Singh of Randhirgarh village of Jagraon, who was found dead on the intervening night of October 8 and 9, 2019. Daya’s family filed a case against the six men after they got ahold of CCTV footage from the area where Daya was found dead and spotted the accused roaming in the vicinity. The victim’s father, Balwinder Singh, in his complaint told the police that his son’s body was found lying on the scooter, his clothes were disorderly and there were scratches on the top of his feet which suggested he was dragged to the spot.Police recommend narco-analysisInitially, inquest proceedings had been initiated under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Investigating officer sub-inspector Sukhwinder Singh said, “The post mortem report had found that Daya had suffered a cardiac arrest. However, his clothes were dishevelled and his feet were scratched, which prompted further investigation. I have recommended narco-analysis (truth serum test) of the accused.” A case has been registered under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the accused.Hard road to justice: Victim’s father “I had filed complaints on February 7, 2020 and June 11, 2020 and also handed over the CCTV footage to the police, but the cops kept putting of the matter and did not lodge an FIR against the accuse. We kept persisting and finally the accused were booked,”said Balwinder Singh.However, police say they had to investigate the matter from different angles before booking the accused as the postmortem report did not indicate that the victim was murdered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/year-after-26-year-old-s-death-6-engineering-students-booked-for-murder-in-ludhiana/story-JvSkFBuJpBjmXYEdsB5bYI.html
05-12-2020||City||Maharashtra government to take punitive action against blood banks for malpractices||After receiving several complaints over malpractices by blood banks, such as charging exorbitant prices for blood and plasma, the Maharashtra government’s health department on Friday announced that it will take punitive action against such blood banks if they are found guilty. The action will be taken by the director of the state blood transfusion council. In case of a repeated violation, the department of the food and drug administration will be informed to revoke the licence of such blood banks. A press statement from the state government’s public health department on Friday read, “We have received complaints of malpractices by blood banks from various sources, on many occasions recently. The state has decided to take punitive action against such blood banks.” The statement said if the processing fee charged is found to be more than the fee prescribed by the Blood Transfusion Council, the blood bank will be charged five times the actual processing fee and the patient will be refunded the excess amount, while the remaining penalty amount will be transferred to the Council’s account. If the surged processing fee is charged for thalassemia, sickle cell, anaemia or haemophilia patients, the banks will be fined three times the processing fee. If thalassemia patients are refused blood by the banks, an additional penalty of Rs1,000 will be levied on the blood banks. If the banks do not update the website daily on the availability of the daily stock of blood and plasma, they will be fined Rs1,000 per day. Banks will be given a notice and an opportunity to present their case before punitive action is taken. The development comes amid a shortage of blood in the state. Blood banks in Maharashtra currently have enough blood only to last for five to seven days. At present, there are 19,059 units of blood and 2,583 units of platelets across 344 blood banks in Maharashtra, and 3,239 units of blood and 611 units of platelets in 58 blood banks in Mumbai. Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Friday urged citizens to voluntarily come forward in large numbers to donate at their nearest blood banks. The CM also urged political, religious, social organisations and housing societies to organise blood donation camps. He pointed out that blood donation has decreased during the lockdown months, as colleges are closed and work from home has affected organising such camps at workplaces and institutes across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-to-take-punitive-action-against-blood-banks-for-malpractices/story-7VJGfSEFUkbUnZWhozGu8K.html

05-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Students raise objection to TISS’ qualifying criteria for upcoming entrance exam||The latest notification released by the administration of Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) regarding the admission to master’s courses at the institute, has met with criticism from students. The notification released on December 3 mentions the two-stage process— TISS national entrance test (TISSNET) followed by the TISS programme aptitude test (TISS-PAT) along with an online personal interview. It further states that TISSNET will shortlist candidates for stage-two, therefore the institute will not apply any reservation rules for the qualifying exam. The institute’s Progressive Students Front (PSF-TISS) has called this move unjust to students from the marginalised section. “TISS-NET is conducted to shortlist candidates to stage two based on TISS-NET marks and the ratio on the number of seats announced for individual programmes under each category. Hence, for the shortlisting process, no reservation rules will be applied. All rules related to reservation of seats under different categories and priorities will be applied only at the time of final seat allocation through merit/wait list,” states the admission notification. PK Shajahan, dean of academics, TISS told HT that admission rules and reservation policy this year remain the same as the last. “The same ratio of candidates from each separate category is shortlisted at stage one, hence there’s no prejudice. In addition to this, candidates from all categories are considered in the open merit list before being considered for each of their respective categories, thereby giving everyone an equal opportunity in admissions,” said Shajahan. “There is no change in the admission rules and reservation process this year from previous years. The same ratio of candidates from each category separately is shortlisted at this stage as in previous years and hence no prejudice is caused to anyone,” he added.In an Instagram post late on Thursday, members of PSF-TISS called this move ‘unconstitutional’. “Even if the institute makes separate lists at the last stage of the admissions process, students from the weaker sections have a good chance of getting eliminated in the first round itself if there is no reservation applied. Our concern is, with this move, candidates will be filtered in stage one and this will leave seats in reserved categories vacant during the admission process as there won’t be any takers,” said a member of PSF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-students-raise-objection-to-tiss-qualifying-criteria-for-upcoming-entrance-exam/story-D6XC0AUbkYRyk08NBMrhpM.html
05-12-2020||Chandigarh||Toddler’s kidnapping: Primary accused, aide held in Moga||The primary accused in the kidnapping of the two-year-old son of the Keys Hotels owner was arrested along with an accomplice in Moga on Friday. The main accused, Harjinderpal Kumar, had been in the employ of the family for two years and had kidnapped the child when he took him for a spin in the car on December 1 and demanded ₹4 crore ransom to secure his release. Fearing capture after the police launched an intensive search, the accused had abandoned the child in a car and informed his parents of his whereabouts the next morning. Five people had hatched a conspiracy to adduct a member of the hoteliers’ family and extort money from them, of them Harjinderpal, Sukhdev Singh Sukha and former sarpanch Rachhpal Singh have been arrested, while one Sukhdev Singh and Lal Singh are still absconding. The police only learnt of the involvement of Sukhdev Singh on Friday. Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harmanbir Singh Gill said after arresting the accused near Moga the accused were handed over to the Ludhiana police on Friday evening.Gill said after returning the boy on December 2, the accused had fled to Ferozepur and taken shelter in the house of Sukhdev Singh’ sister. The accused told her that they had met with a minor accident and needed to stay at her house for a night. On December 1, Sukhdev Singh and Lal Singh had come to Ludhiana on a bus. After kidnapping the child, Harjinderpal had doubled back to Hotel Keys, owned by the boy’s father Pankaj Gupta, where Lal Singh was already waiting for him. Since the boy was familiar with Harjinderpal, he did not create a fuss.After reaching Mullanpur, Sukhdev Singh Sukha joined the party and the trio headed towards Moga. They wanted to reach Ferozepur but abandoned the plan upon learning that the police had already initiated a search operation. The accused abandoned Pankaj Gupta’s Maruti Swift, on the state highway Kot Isse Khan village in Moga, where Rachhpal provided them with a Volkswagen Polo.Accused tempered with engine, chassis numbers The police are still trying to trace the owner of the Volkswagen used to commit the crime. The accused had installed a fake number plate and efforts to trace the owner using the engine and chassis number did not garner any fresh leads. The police suspect the accused had tempered with the numbers.Harjinderpal was wanted in three states: Police Additional deputy commissioner of police Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said all the accused were habitual offenders. Harjinder is already facing trial in multiple cases, including robbery, kidnapping and murder. He was wanted by the Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab Police in many cases. Embarrassed by his criminal proclivities, his family had disowned him a long time ago. The accused have confessed that they had been planning to kidnap a member of Gupta’s family for two years. They had initially planned to kidnap the toddler’s father but had to abandon the plan as he did not venture out much due to his medical problems. It was then that the accused decided to kidnap the child.Credit war After the arrest of two of the accused in Moga, the local police took credit for the arrest and held a press conference claiming that the Moga police had arrested the accused, while the Ludhiana police claimed that it was a joint operation. Teja said, “It was a joint action. A team of the Ludhiana Police had accompanied Moga Police. Earlier, on December 2, too, after recovering the child from an abandoned car in Dagru Railway crossing in Moga Jagatpreet Singh, superintendent of police (SP, Detective) Moga held a press conference and claimed that they had recovered the child with help of the Ludhiana police after a long operation. The SP had handed over the child to his parents in front of the media. Hours later, the Ludhiana police had held a press conference in Ludhiana and handed over the child to his parents again. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/toddler-s-kidnapping-primary-accused-aide-held-in-moga/story-FhgenA3WYaMbeW2FhD10jI.html

05-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Legislative Council polls: MVA wins 4 of 6 seats||The first experiment of the three ruling parties – Congress, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) – in Maharashtra to contest as a coalition against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) proved successful as the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) won four of the six seats in biennial and by-elections to the state legislative Council. This is likely to pave the way for the MVA to contest the upcoming local body polls together to regain ground lost to the BJP since 2014. In a major setback, the BJP lost Council seats in its citadels of Nagpur and Pune. Three graduate constituencies from Aurangabad, Nagpur and Pune, two teachers’ constituencies from Pune and Amravati and local bodies’ constituency in Dhule-Nandurbar went to polls on December 1. Of the six seats, four were bagged by the MVA, one by the BJP and one by an independent candidate. Political analysts and leaders from the ruling parties termed the results “a turning point” in state politics, in the wake of the united show by the MVA. The victory in Council polls is being projected by the MVA as the acceptance of the three-party alliance by the voters spread across 24 districts as elections were held in five revenue divisions of the state. The BJP could bag the local bodies’ seat from Dhule-Nandurbar constituency represented by Congress defector Amrish Patel. Abhijit Wanjari of Congress defeated BJP’s Sandip Joshi, with a huge margin from Nagpur graduate constituency. The BJP had retained the constituency since its inception and was represented by Union minister Nitin Gadkari five times since 1989 and also by the late Gangadharrao Fadnavis, father of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. A BJP leader said that giving a Brahmin candidate by replacing the sitting MLC Anil Sole was a mistake made by the party leadership, as voters were divided on caste lines. Both the seats in Pune division were won by NCP (Arun Lad in graduates’ constituency, with a margin of more than 50,000 votes) and Congress (Jayant Asgaonkar in teachers’ constituency) defeating the BJP candidates on their home turf. NCP’s Satish Chavan won from the Aurangabad graduates’ constituency for the third time in a row. His margin was more than 57,000 votes and he defeated BJP’s Shirish Boralkar. In Amravati teachers’ constituency, independent candidate Kiran Sarnaik defeated his nearest rival Shrikant Deshpande of Shiv Sena with a comfortable majority. In the outgoing six seats, two were with the BJP (Nagpur and Pune graduates’ constituencies), one each with the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP (Amravati teachers, Dhule-Nandurbar local bodies and Aurangabad graduates, respectively) and one with the independent (Pune teachers). “This is the victory of the united front put up by three ruling parties and is an indication that people have accepted the alliance and its performance. The picture has changed in Maharashtra,” said NCP chief Sharad Pawar after the results. Pawar said the result of Dhule-Nandurbar by-election was as per the expectations and because of the hold of the candidate (Amrish Patel) in the constituency. “The results are not as per our expectations. We miscalculated the combined power of the three ruling parties under the MVA. It was our strategic mistake which will be rectified in future,” said leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Ruling party leaders said it is a token of the acceptance of the leadership of the MVA. “The BJP has been decimated in 24 districts in the state (where the voters were spread) during the Council elections, which were fought directly from the people. This is ‘Maharashtra Express’ of MVA,” said former chief minister, public works department minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan. “Today’s results show that autorickshaw defeated the bullet train. We lost the Amravati seat, but this was never our seat traditionally. The seat is traditionally won by an independent candidate. Instead of telling us, the BJP should introspect as they have lost a seat that they held for decades,” said Sena minister Anil Parab.“Voters got alternatives to hard-core Hindutva of the BJP and also to Congress’s secularism after the formation of the MVA. If the three ruling parties read the political meaning out of the results, this could have a long-lasting effect, which could dent the BJP significantly in the state. The Hindu votes, which were the monopoly of the saffron alliance of the BJP-Sena over the past few decades, have now been divided,” said Prakash Pawar, political analyst from Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra. The Shiv Sena, however, lost the Amravati teachers’ constituency. The party headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray scored a nought in the election, while other two ruling parties won two seats each. Sena deputy leader and spokesperson Neelam Gorhe said the party won’t be surprised if the BJP helped an independent candidate defeat the Sena, as it had done in the past in Konkan. “We will get information and analyse what led to the loss in Amravati. We will not be surprised if the BJP helped the independent candidate win against the Shiv Sena,” said Gorhe. Sena leaders argued the seat was always won by an independent candidate. Deshpande won in 2014 as an independent candidate, who extended support to the Sena subsequently. He was given a ticket by the party in 2020, a senior leader said. Sarnaik, the winner from the seat is a relative of home minister Anil Deshmukh and could lead to discomfort over the results between two ruling parties, according to an insider in Congress. He is also likely to support the ruling MVA on the floor of the Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-legislative-council-polls-mva-wins-4-of-6-council-seats/story-b88KceawRGQuF7ZzAZNsWI.html
05-12-2020||City||At 119, Mumbai saw fewest dengue cases in 5 years in 2020: Civic body||The city has recorded the lowest number of dengue cases and deaths in the last five years. Dengue cases year have dropped by 86.3% in Mumbai this year compared to 2015. The death rate has also dropped, with only two deaths from dengue reported this year so far. According to data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), 873 dengue cases were reported between January and November 2015, which increased to 1,130 during the same period in 2016. In 2017, Mumbai witnessed a slight drop in cases when the number fell to 1,102 in the those eleven months. In 2018 and 2019, the caseload further dropped to 884 and 881 respectively. This year, the city has recorded the lowest caseload — 119 — for the corresponding period. Civic officials said the fall in numbers is due to preventive measures taken during the pandemic. “Since the starting of the pandemic in March, we initiated disinfection work in public places. On a larger scale, we carried our sanitation and fumigation work. We also oiled the stagnant water to destroy breeding grounds of mosquitoes,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC. According to data procured from the insecticide department, compared to last year, more breeding grounds of aedes mosquitoes, which spread dengue, were destroyed this year. While 51,509 breeding grounds were destroyed in 2019, BMC increased its tally to 62,872 this year. The most breeding grounds were found in E (Byculla) and G/South (Elphinstone) wards. A senior officer from the insecticide department said, “Our whole department was given the responsibility of disinfection and sanitisation in societies with infected patients. Despite working round the clock, we paid equal attention to take precautionary measures for mosquito-borne diseases, which helped to control the [number of] cases.” Another reason for lower numbers may be the restricted movement due to lockdown. Dr Manjusha Agarwal, general physician at Global Hospital, Parel said, “During this ongoing pandemic, people have tried to maintain a clean environment and focus on improved sanitation. Also as people are spending less time outdoors due to the restrictions imposed in the lockdown, it could have resulted in fewer dengue cases.”Dr Om Srivastava, an epidemiologist from Khar said, the pandemic had helped to diagnose patients early, which in turn may have prevented fatalities. “As the symptoms of dengue are similar to Covid-19, many dengue patients were diagnosed early at fever camps. This helped to provide treatment without delay,” said Dr Srivastava. Despite the improved figures for dengue, doctors advised that the authorities should not let down their guard. “On a regular basis, the civic body should keep removing the scrap materials and tyres which turn into breeding grounds,” said Dr Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-119-mumbai-saw-fewest-dengue-cases-in-5-years-in-2020-civic-body/story-du5OeXxl1h6rSjGvbMfW4M.html

05-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: FYJC second merit list to be out today; Mumbai colleges expect marginal dip in cutoffs||Nearly two months after admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC) were stayed owing to the Supreme Court’s (SC) interim stay on Maratha quota, the education department will finally release the second merit list for admissions at 11am today (November 5) without the 12% reservation. After the first admission round, which completed in September, nearly 2.42 lakh seats remained vacant for admissions in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). Principals of coveted city colleges said they were expecting a marginal dip in their cut-offs. “We already had a considerable number of admissions in the first round, so the dip in cut-offs should not be a lot,” said Ashok Wadia, principal, Jai Hind College, Churchgate. The college closed its first merit list at 89.4% for science and 92.6% for both commerce and arts streams. Most prominent colleges also said they only had about 30-40% seats vacant after the first round of admissions which can be filled in this and the upcoming rounds. “Since we had already completed minority admissions and general admissions in the first round, nearly 70% of the total seats were taken up. We hope that the remaining seats will be filled in the days to come so that online lectures for FYJC can begin soon,” said Satram Verhani, vice-principal of CHM college in Ulhasnagar. Some principals said students are likely to prioritise getting into a college and beginning the new academic year soon. “Due to the delay, students are now looking forward to the year to begin. Many students might also be willing to compromise on their college preferences as the mode of learning is going to be online at least for the current year,” said the principal of a South Mumbai-based college.On September 9, in line with the Apex court’s interim stay on Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) quota in jobs and education, the state education department had stayed the admission process for FYJC until further orders. While the state government has revealed that admissions to all courses will now take place without the quota, it has also clarified that students whose admissions in the first merit list were confirmed under the quota will remain intact.Total intake capacity 3,20,830Total seats confirmed by students in the first round 78,596Vacant seats up for grabs in second round 2,42,234||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-fyjc-second-merit-list-to-be-out-today-mumbai-colleges-expect-marginal-dip-in-cutoffs/story-VVGRwjjQNZOqYhzGfw1drL.html

Police inspector and investigating officer Jamil Shaikh confirmed that the charge sheet has been filed. Alibag police arrested Goswami, Shaikh and Sarda on November 4 from their residences in Mumbai. They were produced in the Alibag court on same day and sent to judicial custody. Goswami was in jail for eight days and walked out of Taloja jail on November 11 after the Apex court granted him bail.The police filed a charge sheet of around 1,900 pages which includes statement of 65 witnesses. There are statements of Naik’s family members and staff members. The charge sheet also includes statements of the accused’s staff and call data records and retrieval of information from electronic devices.Goswami had filed an application on December 3 before the Bombay high court (HC) urging the court to stay any further probe into the suicide abetment case registered against him. He has also sought an interim order to restrain Alibag police from filing a charge sheet in the case and to transfer the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or some other independent agency beyond the purview of Maharashtra government.Advocate Niha Raut, who represents Shaikh, said, “The police has filed charge sheet today. However, my client, Feroz Shaikh, was called by Alibag crime branch for interrogation on December 4. Shaikh reached at 10am to Alibag crime branch office and he was asked to go at 6pm”. Naik, architect and managing director of Concorde Designs Private Limited, and his mother Kumud died by suicide at his Alibag farmhouse in Raigad on May 5, 2018. In his suicide note, police said, Naik alleged he was being forced to take this step as he was not paid his dues — ₹83 lakh by Goswami, ₹55 lakh by Sarda of Smartworks and ₹4 crore by Shaikh of IcastX/Skimedia. Acting on a complaint by Naik’s wife, Akshata, police registered an offence booking the trio on May 5, 2018.

05-12-2020||Mumbai||PNB fraud case: CBI court refuses to grant bail to former VP of Gitanjali Group||The special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Friday refused to grant bail to Vipul Chitalia, vice-president of Gitanjali Group of Companies, arrested in connection with the multi-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam. Chitalia was arrested on March 6, 2018 while he was returning from Bangkok. While arresting him, CBI had claimed that he was instrumental in preparing applications seeking Letter of Understanding (LoU) from PNB in connivance with key accused Gokulnath Shetty, who was posted as deputy manager at the mid-corporate branch at Brandy House. The agency also claimed that Chitalia, in connivance with another key accused Mehul Choksi and other accomplices, had fraudulently shown liability in the books of accounts towards two Hong Kong-based firms — 4C’s Diamond Distributors and Shanyang Gong SI Limited — and not towards PNB which had issued the LoUs. Further, it is claimed that Chitalia was an authorised signatory for Gitanjali. This was Chitalia’s second bail plea filed through Vijay Agarwal and Rahul Agarwal on the grounds of delay in conducting trial. The first plea was filed on the merits of the case claiming that he had no role in the fraud and had resigned from the company long back. After it was rejected in 2018, they approached the high court. However, the plea was later withdrawn and they filed a fresh plea citing the merits and delay in trial. The plea was not accepted by the special court. Chitalia is now likely to approach the high court for bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pnb-fraud-case-cbi-court-refuses-to-grant-bail-to-former-vp-of-gitanjali-group/story-LiT1fisRFQaKmpgb60J2ZL.html

Officials said that the head of departments have been asked to maintain an adequate faculty ratio required to deal with any urgency related to Covid-19.A communication sent to the department heads states that while forwarding the vacation roster of respective departments they should ensure that the adequate faculty is available for smooth functioning due to Covid-19 pandemic. The Covid hospital at PGIMER is one of the biggest facilities in the region to treat moderate to severe cases of Covid-19. Besides, patients from Chandigarh, it caters to patients from Punjab and Haryana as well.Since March, more than 2,000 Covid-19 patients have been treated here. As more healthcare services have been diverted to Covid services, the routine healthcare services have been affected however, emergency services are being provided to patients.“I have received intimation from various faculty members that they won’t go on vacations, but there should be a system under which they can avail their leave, “ PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said.Usually, a 15-day long winter vacation is provided to around 600 faculty members, during which the departments function at 50% capacity.The department heads have also been asked for strict compliance with the order, and if any faculty is not able to avail the vacation, their leaves will be credited to their accounts as earned leaves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/winter-vacation-amid-covid-pgimer-department-heads-directed-to-ensure-adequate-faculty-available-for-emergencies/story-d5oRODP5sxBUqN6JUX3LxI.html
05-12-2020||Gurugram||‘He would steal, but can’t believe he killed’, says Gurugram serial killer’s ex-colleague||Mohammad Ghufran, the receptionist at guest house ‘Just For You’ — located near Jama Masjid in the heart of Delhi — finds it hard to believe that his former colleague Mohammad Razi stands accused of being a serial killer. Razi, who was arrested by Gurugram Police on Thursday, Ghufran says, can be many things, including a thief. But Razi being a serial killer is something he finds hard to believe.“After quitting his job here, he stole my mobile phone and then went on to call me on another phone number to say that he was the thief and that he wouldn’t return it,” said Ghufran.Among the many places the alleged serial killer worked since the lockdown, was this two-storey guest house located in a narrow bylane, populated with motor spare parts shops, near Jama Masjid. Mohammad Salman, the owner of the guest house, said Razi had come asking for a job sometime in October. “He said he had no home in Delhi. He would sleep in the staff quarters of the guest house,” said Salman. Razi was given a housekeeping job on a daily wage of around Rs 300. Salman said that Razi had been hired through a “reference” and his police verification was never carried out.“I never noticed anything suspicious, else I would have kicked him out ,” said Salman. But Razi himself quit the job, 10 days after joining it, around October 15. “He spoke less and was usually polite. But he would sometimes smoke marijuana outside the hotel premises. He once mentioned to me that he had done many ugly things back in his hometown of Bihar’s Araria. He never shared details though,” recounted Ghufran. Ghufran said Razi had also mentioned about his father having disowned him. But this aspect of his relationship could not be verified. What stuck in Ghufran’s mind was Razi having mentioned that his maternal uncle back home was a police officer.That was one of the reasons Ghufran didn’t file a complaint when Razi allegedly stole his mobile phone. “On November 22, I was out scouting for customers and had left my phone at the hotel’s reception. When I returned, the phone was gone,” said Gufran. That very day, Ghufran received a phone call on another number from Razi. “He confessed that he had taken my phone and that he will not return it. I begged and pleaded, even offered him Rs 5,000, but to no avail,” alleged Ghufran. Since he is a college student and needs a mobile phone for the online classes, Ghufran went on to purchase a new phone. The other details of Razi given by his former employer and colleague are sketchy.“Before working at the guest house, he mentioned that he was employed at a cement and steel rods shop somewhere near Gurugram,” Ghufran recounted. While Ghufran too belongs to Araria in Bihar, it was only on reading news reports of Razi’s arrest that he got to know that their villages are just four kilometres apart. “He has brought shame to our district,” Ghufran said, still unwilling to believe that he had worked with an alleged serial killer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gurugram-serial-killer-s-ex-colleague-says-can-t-believe-he-murdered/story-TVN5muvrIWVDYvOnHuRLYL.html
05-12-2020||Delhi||Will stay put, join R-Day in tractors, say protesting farmers||Reiterating their stance that they will not settle for anything but a complete rollback of the three new laws that seek to open up farm trade, farmers protesting on the Ghazipur border said they will stay put and participate in the Republic Day parade on their tractors in Delhi, if their demands are not met. Rakesh Tikait, farmer leader and spokesperson, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said, “Since talks with the government have not yielded any results so far, we are going to camp at the border at least till January 26.” “We have enough ration to camp here till January end. If the situation remains the same, we have planned to march up to the India Gate in our tractors to participate in the [Republic Day] parade. We want the country to see the real farmers,” said Tikait.He added, they will cross the border and March towards Delhi on the night of January 25. “We will respond if the government tries to stop by force.”Thousands of farmers are sitting in protest against the new farm laws on four borders of Delhi --- Singhu, Tikri, Chilla and Ghazipur. Their representatives have held two rounds of talks with the Centre so far, with the third round scheduled for Saturday. On Thursday, farmer leaders had said that they were hopeful of a resolution but will not settle for anything less than the complete revocation of the new laws enacted by the Parliament in September. Mangeram Tyagi, chief secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (NCR Unit), said the ball is in the Centre’s court. “It depends on the government for how long we will stay here”. “We are not going to move an inch unless our demands are met. We have been staying here for the past one week, we are strong enough to spend months,” Tyagi said.At Ghazipur, farmers have deployed a volunteer group of 50-60, who are going around the protest venue and registering the names, addresses and contact numbers of the protesters to keep an eye on what they claim were “anti-social elements, who were coming to the protests to disrupt the movement”. A senior police officer deployed at Ghazipur said the security forces are ready to handle any situation. Even as some groups of farmers who had joined the protest in Ghaziabad from Hapur, Bulandshahr, Meerut and Moradabad returned on Friday, a large group of protesters were still camping at the site. Meanwhile, traffic towards Delhi from Haryana and UP continued to be diverted, causing jams on the border points and on the nearby roads. However, the situation was relatively better on Friday as the motorists were aware about the closure of the borders and diversions.Like the last three days, when at least two more borders connecting Delhi to Noida and Ghaziabad, were partially closed, no new blockage was reported on Friday at any border. Gagan Chawla, 41, an IT professional who travelled from Noida to Delhi and back, said due to closure of Chila border the available routes witnessed heavy traffic. “I heard it was even worse on Thursday. However, on the way back to Noida, traffic is relatively smoother,” he said.Vipul Garg, who was travelling from Ghaziabad to Delhi also said traffic on Friday was relatively better than Thursday. “Yesterday, I had to take alternative routes to reach Delhi via Apsara border but today since I was aware I avoided traffic jams,” said Garg, a businessman. The Chilla border (Delhi-Noida Link Road), which was closed completely for at least 22 hours between Tuesday and Wednesday, was partially opened on Thursday. Even on Friday, one carriageway connecting Noida from Delhi remained open while the opposite carriageway towards Delhi was closed. The police diverted the traffic towards DND, Kalindi Kunj, Dallupura, Khoda, New Ashok Nagar, and Kondli. Although heavy traffic was witnessed in the morning and evening hours on Friday, the situation was slightly better than what it was on Thursday.Delhi police issued advisories regarding diversions and road blockages. Anil Mittal, additional spokesperson, Delhi police, said in an advisory, the Chilla border on Noida Link Road is closed for traffic from Noida to Delhi due to farmers protests near Gautam Budh Dwar. “People are advised to avoid Noida link road for coming to Delhi and use DND,” Mittal said.He added, due to the ongoing farmers’ protest, Ghazipur Border on NH 24 and NH 9 are also closed for traffic from UP to Delhi. “People are advised to avoid NH 24 and use Apsara/Bhopura/DND flyover to enter Delhi,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-say-ready-to-wait-till-january-join-r-day-parade-in-tractors/story-vjjKJW3qmwPP3SIVwD7eTO.html
05-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers blocking essential services, increasing Covid-19 threat, says petition before SC||A public interest petition before the Supreme Court on Friday has sought the immediate removal or dispersal of farmers gathered at Delhi borders in order to ease the movement of traffic and prevent a possible spread of Covid-19 among protesters, as the ongoing agitation against the Centre’s new farm laws entered its ninth day on Friday.The petition, filed by law student Rishabh Sharma, also cited the October 7 judgment of the Supreme Court, on the months-long protest at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh against the amended citizenship rules, in which the apex court had said that while the right to protest and dissent against governments is a fundamental right, it is not an absolute one and public places cannot be occupied indefinitely to stage protests. The court had also held that such protests ought to take place in designated areas and not on public roads.Sharma pointed out that despite farmers being allotted the Nirankari grounds in central Delhi’s Burari to peacefully protest, lakhs of farmers were still gathered at the borders of the capital city, blocking traffic along arterial roads connecting the city with the National Capital Region.“This protest is causing lot of trouble to the citizens of India,” the petition stated and demanded the opening of the borders and a direction to protesters to move to the designated place.Sharma also said such massive gatherings have the potential to become Covid-19 hot spots besides blocking essential medical and emergency services. “The protest is blocking the roads for all the emergency/medical services which are very much required to be supplied within the territory of Delhi in order to stop the spread of coronavirus as the cases of coronavirus are increasing rapidly in Delhi,” stated the petition filed through advocate Om Prakash Parihar.The petition also expressed concern over the health of elderly farmers protesting at the border points. “The coronavirus is affecting mainly elderly people and the protest at Delhi border is mostly consisting of elderly men and women. The petitioner is seeking urgent direction to shift them (protesting farmers) to the place already allotted by the Delhi police in view of immediate threat of coronavirus infection and spread.”Security personnel continued to remain deployed at Singhu, Tikri, Chilla and Ghazipur border points.

05-12-2020||Delhi||Journalist arrested in espionage case granted bail by high court||The Delhi high court on Friday granted bail to journalist Rajeev Sharma, who had been arrested for allegedly leaking confidential information to Chinese intelligence officers, while stating that he is entitled to default bail because the charge sheet had not been filed within 60 days of arrest.Justice Yogesh Khanna set aside an earlier order of the trial court — which had said that charge sheets in cases where the suspects had been charged under the Official Secret Act — can be filed within 90 days. The court granted Sharma bail on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and a surety of like amount.Sharma, 61, was arrested on September 14 by the special cell of Delhi Police and investigators claimed several articles and some sensitive/confidential documents related to Indian defence department were recovered from him.The prosecution said that during investigations, it was revealed that suspect Rajeev Sharma has been indulged in procurement of secret/confidential/sensitive documents/material information and conveying them to his handlers (foreign intelligence officers) based in China.“In lieu of that, he was getting remuneration/money through illegal means i.e. hawala transactions/funds routed through shell companies being run/operated by Chinese nationals, in Delhi, India. During further investigations, it was found that suspect Sharma was in contact with these officers — namely Michael, Xou and George — through email platforms — like Telegram, WhatsApp — and was conveying the information to these Chinese intelligence officers,” the police had alleged.On November 14, Sharma moved a plea in trial court alleging that he should be allowed default bail because the police had not filed a charge sheet even after 60 days of his arrest. However, that plea was dismissed by a judge stating that the period of 60 days had not yet expired.Sharma, through his counsel, Adish C Aggarwala, filed a revision plea before the Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) challenging this order which is pending. In the meantime, on November 15, Sharma filed another similar plea seeking release on account of non-filing of the charge sheet within 60 days, before the duty metropolitan magistrate of Patiala House Court, who dismissed it on November 16 and ordered that the time period of filing charge sheet in this offence can be 90 days.However, the high court, in a 10-page judgment, said that under the Official Secrets Act, under which Sharma is being charged, entails punishment which may extend to 14 years. But the section does not talk of a minimum period of punishment.“... as such the period of challan in this case would be 60 days and thus the impugned order passed by the metropolitan magistrate being illegal is set aside and the petition is allowed,” it said, while adding that Sharma is entitled to bail as the charge sheet has not been filed within 60 days.The police had opposed the statutory bail plea on the grounds that the offence where there is no minimum punishment prescribed and the maximum punishment is more than 10 years, the charge sheet can be filed beyond 60 days but before 90 days from the date of arrest.The court asked Sharma to provide his contact number and address to the concerned police official and keep the location app on his mobile open at all time, and not to leave Delhi without seeking permission of the trial court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/journalist-arrested-in-espionage-case-granted-bail-by-high-court/story-lCLtPdzeMd25601umabTzN.html
05-12-2020||Delhi||Decide on reopening of spas, HC tells govt||The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Delhi government to take a fresh decision on the reopening of the spas, while seeking to know as to why these facilities can’t be opened at a time when salons are operating.Justice Navin Chawla said there is prima facie merit in the submission made by the counsel for various spa owners that if salons, which are offering similar services, can be allowed to function, then why not spas.The court was hearing two pleas moved by multiple people running spas, which have been shut since the first lockdown was enforced in Delhi. They said when businesses such as salons, gyms, restaurants and bars have been granted permission to reopen, and even Delhi Metro has restarted, then spas should also be allowed.The petitioners said spas in other states are running with full safety measures but are not permitted in Delhi.The Delhi government’s standing counsels Anjum Javed and Anupam Shrivastava told the court that spas are not allowed because of the surge in Covid-19 infections.The government said a final decision on the reopening of spas is awaited from the ministry of home affairs (MHA). It said even the lieutenant-governor (LG) had declined to grant the permission as cases are increasing and no physical distancing is possible in spas. The counsels for spa owners said guidelines issued by the Centre permit spas to open, subject to maintenance of social distancing and other Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.But they said the Delhi government was not permitting them to operate even though salons, restaurants and every other business has been allowed in the national capital.“Even salons are open. They have similar work as that of spas. Everything is open. Even today, they said there would be no night curfew because cases have come down,” they said. The spa owners argued that the six-feet distance norm cannot be maintained even in salons but they are allowed. The Centre, who was represented by advocate Anjana Gosain, clarified that all activities that have not been specifically prohibited under its guidelines are allowed to operate outside containment zones. It said now states have to decide what should be allowed.After hearing the arguments, the court said it found merit in the submissions made by the petitioner and asked the Delhi government to file an affidavit within a week, taking a fresh decision on the reopening of spas.The matter would be now heard on December 16.There was no response from the Delhi government spokesperson on the queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/take-a-fresh-decision-on-reopening-of-spas-delhi-hc-to-govt/story-90oEMRgBFmk4kCZsaOUVTJ.html
05-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt calls out to clinics to enrol their staff for Covid vaccination||The Delhi government on Friday made a public call to all small and independent clinics, both registered and unregistered, to enrol their staff for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccination drive. The clinics have been given a day to register their staff for the nationwide drives that will happen once a vaccine is approved. The government has already collected human resources data from the registered hospitals and nursing homes in the city. There are over 57,000 hospitals, nursing homes and maternity centres across the city as per Delhi’s latest Economic Survey 2020. HT had reported In October that the state government, on the Centre’s directive, had started creating a database of 13 categories of health care workers covering both private and government hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics. According to the draft prioritisation plan of the national expert group on vaccine administration for Covid-19, 30 million front-line workers will be the first to receive the vaccine once it becomes available. The Delhi government’s notice comes two days after the United Kingdom approved the Covid-19 vaccine developed by the Pfizer and BioNTech. UK is the first country to do so and the vaccine will be available in Britain from next week, according to a statement from the UK government. “Health care workers includes medical, paramedical, supporting, security, sanitation, and administrative staff of all allopathic, dental, AYUSH, physiotherapy clinics, diagnostic laboratories, radiology centres and other health care settings,” the public notice read. The clinics – as yet exempt from registration with the government under any rules or regulations – can upload data of their staff by requesting a Login ID on the Delhi state health mission website (dshm.delhi.gov.in). “This data will not be used for any other purpose apart from Covid-19 vaccination,” the notice assured. The government already has cold storage networks, vials, syringes and other logistical requirements needed for a vaccination drive available under the universal immunisation programme. Currently, vaccines under the universal immunisation programme are given at 640 “fixed points”, or delivery centres such as government dispensaries. The government is also looking to create a cold storage centre at the Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital in Tahirpur, where a 5,000 square metre facility has been earmarked for it and is being retrofitted with freezers and power backup. This is in addition to an existing cold storage facility available at Civil Lines that can store up to 5 million doses of any drug at a temperature ranging between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius – the temperature requirement for most vaccines given under the universal immunisation programme. “We have the infrastructure to roll out the vaccine to the entire population of Delhi in a few weeks. We have facilities like mohalla clinics, poly clinics and dispensaries to dispense the vaccine. The road map for vaccination will be developed by the Centre. However, most of the vaccines can be stored in thermocol boxes filled with dry ice; so storage will not be a problem,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a press briefing on Friday. “A vaccine essentially injects a form of the virus in a small quantity into your body to fight the virus. For people who have already recovered from Covid-19, their body has produced antibodies naturally so they do not have to be vaccinated in the first phase,” he said.Delhi has been battling a surge in infection and on Friday reported 4,067 fresh cases, taking the tally of total cases to 586,125. Of these, 28,252 are active cases, while 548,376 have recovered, and 9,497 have lost their lives, according to the Delhi government’s health bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-calls-out-to-clinics-to-enrol-their-staff-for-covid-vaccination/story-BktlDmdB2Tu6fNOrEZLDDM.html
05-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s Covid positivity rate below 5% for second day in a row||Delhi’s positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – remained below 5% for two days in a row, for the first time since mid-May, before the first surge in the daily number of cases. The daily positivity rate as per Friday’s bulletin stood at 4.78%, which is the lowest in 218 days, since a positivity rate of 2.08% was recorded on April 30. In April, about 3,600 samples were being tested in a day in comparison to 85,003 samples tested on Thursday, which is the highest number of tests ever conducted in a day in the city so far. On Friday, Delhi reported 4,067 new cases of Covid-19 and 73 deaths. So far, the viral infection has affected over 586,000 people in the city and killed at least 9,497, since it was first detected on March 2. “The positivity has reduced to below 5%. This is a very good sign. The bed occupancy in Delhi has also gone down, over 12,000 beds are vacant. If we look at ICU beds, there are a total of over 5,000 beds and over 2,000 are vacant; meaning over 40% beds are vacant. The situation is slowly improving. I had said earlier that November 7 was the peak of the third wave,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a press briefing on Friday. “Let us see for how long this stays below 5%. If this can be sustained for least a week, then the situation will be comfortable. There has been aggressive testing and contact tracing because of which the positivity rate has reduced from over 15%,” he said. Experts believe that the spread of the infection has been controlled when a positivity rate of 5% or less is maintained for over two weeks. “The best way to prevent the infection is to wear a mask, maintain social distancing, and wash hands regularly. The waves of infection are likely to continue just as we had seen during the 1918 Spanish flu. This happens as people get fatigued with following precautions,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, head of the department of pulmonology at Fortis hospital, Shalimar Bagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-covid-positivity-rate-below-5-for-second-day-in-a-row/story-9xg0W6UCX4zEzy1VHoBTEN.html
05-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt announces common forum to discuss electric vehicle policy||The Delhi government on Friday announced the launch of an “EV forum”, a common platform for multiple stakeholders to hold discussions on the government’s electric vehicle (EV) policy. The first virtual meeting under the forum is scheduled to be held on December 18, the government said in a statement.“The focus of Delhi’s EV forum would be to enable engagement of a wide range of stakeholders in the EV ecosystem for successful implementation of the EV policy. Delhi EV Forum will be the first such forum in India for continuous dialogue and engagement of stakeholders in the implementation of EV policy. The first meeting will be held virtually on December 18,” Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson of the dialogue and development commission, which advises the Delhi government on policy matters, said.The stakeholders would include e-vehicle manufacturers, fleet operators and charging point operators, the government said.The statement said the focus of the discussions in the first meeting would be on-ground challenges on the deployment of EVs and charging infrastructure and identifying potential solutions, providing clarity related to concerns and questions regarding provisions of the policy, gaining commitments from private players to help achieve the EV and charging infrastructure targets defined in the policy.The forum is supposed to organise quarterly meetings and workshops too.“The forum may conduct additional meetings that focus on specific issues and subjects related to policy implementation. The discussions through the forum workshops will identify measures to establish Delhi as the EV capital of India,” said Shah.For the initiative, RMI India, an independent think tank working in the clean energy transition sector, will support the Delhi government. “Delhi’s ambitious EV targets are a signal of its strong commitment to clean mobility. EV policy formulation has benefited from extensive stakeholder consultations. Delhi’s policy is being hailed as one of the strongest sub-national EV policies globally,” said Akshima Ghate of RMI India.Delhi’s EV policy – notified on August 7 – aims at ensuring at least a 25% share of electric vehicles among all vehicles registered in the capital, by 2024 . The objective of the policy is to combat air pollution in Delhi. In September, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had listed the EV policy in his action plan to tackle air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-announces-common-forum-to-discuss-electric-vehicle-policy/story-N4e8CxVQPeJkal43F4lvZL.html

Any official allowed to work from home may be called to office, if required,” said the latest circular that was issued to departments such as women and child development and social welfare.The departments also asked those working from home to not leave the city unless prior permission is granted by the competent authority in writing, except in case of emergencies.Senior government officials, however, did not comment on specific incidents, if any, which may have prompted these circulars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/wfh-employees-must-remain-on-call-should-not-leave-city-says-fresh-delhi-govt-circular/story-RoXTTOAJA3ve4fmeFtKlzO.html
05-12-2020||Delhi||BJP councillor arrested for accepting bribe, AAP says it shows deep-rooted corruption in MCDs||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday arrested the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillor from South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Vasant Kunj ward, Manoj Mahlawat for allegedly taking bribe of Rs 10 lakh for allowing construction work in his area, people familiar with the development said. He was produced before a court in Delhi and sent to judicial custody. A team of the central agency had laid a trap to arrest Mahlawat after it received a complaint that he had demanded bribe from person for allowing construction. The agency didn’t reveal further details but officials, who didn’t want to be named, said the construction was not legal. Mahlawat was elected councillor from ward number 69, Vasant Kunj of SDMC in 2017.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday hit out at the BJP after Mahlawat’s arrest with the party’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj saying that the action against the councillor showed how people have to bribe civic officials and councillors for construction.“Another new feather is being added to the crown of BJP ‘s corruption. The councillor from Vasant Kunj ward number 69 of SDMC, Manoj Mahlawat was caught red-handed by the CBI for bribery. The AAP believes that the top BJP leadership knew about such illegal transactions in civic bodies,” Bharadwaj alleged.He alleged that the BJP-ruled MCDs have designed the building bylaws in such a manner that it is almost impossible for the residents to get construction done legally. “Due to such complex bylaws even the honest people have to bribe the MCD to build a house because there is no other option,” he added.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta on Friday suspended Mahlawat from the primary membership of the party. “Following its policy of zero-tolerance towards corruption, the Delhi unit of Bhartiya Janata Party suspends you (Mahlawat) from the primary membership of the party due to serious allegations of corruption against you,” Gupta said in the suspension letter to Mahlawat on Friday.Responding to Bharadwaj’s allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the BJP has zero-tolerance towards corruption and it has suspended Mahlawat from the primary membership of the party.“We do not hesitate in taking action against the corrupt unlike the AAP, which is yet to take any action against jailed MLA Prakash Jarwal, who was accused of water tanker scam and provoking a doctor to suicide,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-councillor-arrested-for-accepting-bribe-aap-says-it-shows-deep-rooted-corruption-in-mcds/story-9sQsNHZ5ly0Bp83gWvzzyL.html
05-12-2020||Delhi||CPCB tells Delhi govt to quickly redress pollution complaints||The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) wrote to the Delhi government on Friday, asking various civic agencies to act immediately on emissions from open burning of waste; improper handling of construction waste; industrial emissions; dust from unpaved roads and open spaces which have been reported by citizens on Centre’s Sameer app.CPCB also shared a November 20 notice issued to Delhi government under section 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. As per the notice, of the 3,094 complaints lodged on Sameer app between October 7 and November 18, only 34% have been redressed and of the 784 complaints lodged on social media during the same period, only 24% have been addressed.In its letter, the agency also shared a list of “hot spots”, where CPCB teams spotted several polluting activities such as open dumping of garbage. These spots are Narela, Anand Vihar, Mundka, Dwarka and Punjabi Bagh in Delhi and Faridabad, Jhajjar, Noida and Bhiwadi in NCR.“Delhi’s pollution levels are still high. Stubble burning has stopped but pollution levels are still in very poor category. CPCB’s 50 teams are monitoring polluting activities in Delhi and NCR and have been informing various agencies but they are yet to act on all complaints. Delhi government agencies should get their act together,” said Prakash Javadekar, union environment minister addressing media on Friday.Reacting to the letter, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai’s office said prompt action is being taken on all the complaints. “Between October 27 and November 30, of the 12,000 complaints received on the Delhi green app, 10,000 have already been resolved. The redressal rate of complaints is around 85%. The complaints redressal is being reviewed from time to time. The app that was launched in October has been a success. Besides, 23 anti-smog guns have been installed at key stretches to suppress dust. Also, intensive campaigns against dust emissions as well as vehicular emissions such as Red Light On, Gaadi off have been taken by the Delhi government to fight local sources of pollution. We have been making all efforts to control emissions on the ground and strict monitoring is being done. Action is also being taken against violators,” the minister’s office said in a statement.CPCB has issued three directions to Delhi government under section 5, which gives the anti-pollution agency powers to issue directions in writing to any person, officer or any authority who shall be bound to comply with such directions. It has said the Delhi government should ensure immediate action for complete redressal of complaints on Sameer app and social media; closely monitor actions taken on polluting events; ensure regular surveillance and strict action against illegal industrial activities, including tyre burning and dumping of construction waste, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cpcb-tells-delhi-govt-to-quickly-redress-pollution-complaints/story-nBsQq8hXYqT9w4Gxz9Oh6N.html
05-12-2020||Pune||Stretch was on land owned by MIT in Pune, says Dr Vishwanath Karad||Dr Vishwanath Karad, founder president and director general, World Peace Centre (Alandi) MAEER’s MIT, Pune, tells Hindustan timesthe reason behind building the road on Vetal tekdi slope that is facing opposition from neighbourhood residents. Karad says that the stretch will help students and public walk up the road and it has no commercial purpose. What are you building on the Vetal hill slope? We are building an alternative road for students and public to reach the top of the hill. The stretch is built on the land owned by MIT and we are doing it from our budget, so no reason for permission arises. What is the reason for building this alternative road? Our campus has over 15,000 to 20,000 students and, over the years, the main road has become crowded and traffic congested with cases of accidents being reported. This alternative road will ease traffic on the main stretch and can be used by both students and public to walk up the hill. PMC states that this road on hill slope is illegal and residents have raised objection? It is unfortunate that our institution is being pulled into shaming and bad names. I think there seems to be vested interest of some political parties to create this kind of stir. MIT has 28 acre in yellow zone and almost 25 acres in green zones, including hill slope. We want to build a road which is of no commercial value, but for public interest. Have you applied for permissions and why build one now? We have already submitted a letter of intent of building a road leading to the Vishwashanti hill atop, where since 1996 we have build a small meditation temple. In 1995, there was a plan to build a Vishwashanti park where we had planted several trees, but due to technical problems and shortage of funds, we had to put the project on hold. Now that we have the funds, we want to complete the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/the-stretch-is-built-on-the-land-owned-by-mit-karad/story-dRWbQ9idMvd1qj6iXa6dxH.html

Full Circle Book Store and Café Turtle set to make a comeback to their beloved Khan Market||One of the city’s most-beloved bookshops is going to be back at its original location. In June this year, Full Circle Book Store had announced the closing down of its Khan Market outlet owing to mounting bills and thinning revenue. But now, along with Café Turtle, the store plans to begin the new year with new tidings.  A post shared by Mayank Austen Soofi (@thedelhiwalla)“We didn’t want to move out in the first place, but had to given the circumstances. The people and various landlords in Khan Market approached us to come back. Both the associations of Khan Market — Traders’ and Welfare — were very helpful. And even though we are not going back to the same location, we hope to recreate our signature look with the blue and green theme, wooden flooring, and a balcony. We will have the café on the second floor and are hopeful that outdoor seating would be permitted,” says its director Priyanka Malhotra. The new bookstore would be at shop number 24, right next to its original shop number 23.Read: Full Circle in Khan Market shuts its 20-year old legacy as it suffers collateral amid the coronavirus pandemicStrict adherence to SOPs and safety protocols is of priority and they are ensuring sanitisation just like it’s done in their other outlets. “We will install a pedal sanitiser at the door and do thermal scans. We will allow people only in sets of four and ensure six feet distancing is practised. The tables at the cafe will be sanitised after every order, and the bookshop will be sanitised every hour. We would be maintaining a register of everyone coming in so that we have a record. It would be mandatory to wear masks,” she explains.She promises that there will be certain new additions to the café as well, so that patrons can have meals on the go. “We will open an extended pantry with the café that will have artisanal products like preserves, natural juices, wholewheat breads and pizza bases. Our hummus and pestos were very popular with the guests, so we will bottle them for takeaway,” she shares. The physical aspect of browsing through bookshelves, getting personalised recommendations and settling in a corner to read is nudging bibliophiles to venture into bookstores. “Even though we were delivering books from our other outlet, we realised that people were choosing to walk-in. There is an increased awareness about supporting local businesses,” she says.

Gorhe said, “Vetal tekdi is known for its biodiversity and its greenery is now under threat for trees on this hill are being cut and a road is being constructed there. The intensity of the anger amongst Punekars caused by this illegal work has raised an issue about keeping the hill safe.
