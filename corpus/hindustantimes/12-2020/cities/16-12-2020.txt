The court also directed the state to serve notice to the other party before approaching the court and granted similar liberty to Republic TV and its employees. The HC had granted interim relief to the channel and its employees on December 15. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik also continued an interim relief, through which it directed the Mumbai Police to summon employees of Hansa Research Group, the complainant in the case, for inquiry only two days a week for a “reasonable time” until the next hearing. The company had asked for the probe to be transferred to the CBI. On Tuesday, the bench, while hearing the pleas of Republic TV and ARG Outlier against the probe was informed by senior counsel Aabad Ponda that Mumbai Police had reached Delhi and there was an apprehension that they would arrest him, hence they sought a restraining order against Mumbai Police till the next hearing. He had further submitted that clause 12 of the charge sheet wherein the police had filed form 5 (c) giving them the right to arrest any employee of Republic TV was not valid as the Apex court had deemed the form to be illegal, hence the court should grant them relief. On Wednesday, senior counsel Kapil Sibal for the state government sought time to file a response to the plea, and on instructions, submitted that the statement made on Tuesday that no coercive steps would be taken, will continue till January 6. The court accepted the statement and also permitted parties to the case, to approach the court in case of any urgency. Anvay Naik abetment of suicide case In the abetment of suicide case of an Alibag-based architect Anvay Naik and his mother, the court permitted Goswami to amend the petition to include the aspects mentioned in the charge sheet filed by the Alibag police, which has been taken cognisance of, by the Alibag magistrate on Wednesday afternoon and posted the matter for hearing on January 6, 2021, through video conferencing. After allowing senior counsel Aabad Ponda the liberty to amend the petition, the court also directed the Alibag court to expedite the issuance of charge sheet to the petitioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trp-case-no-coercive-steps-against-republic-tv-and-its-employees-till-january-6-2021-hc-says/story-8GwKoZ5qxIMP9OogAYCCCO.html

16-12-2020||Chandigarh||EWS admissions: Private schools to get reimbursement for only 10% students, Chandigarh admn tells HC||The Chandigarh administration has told the Punjab and Haryana high court that private schools are to get reimbursement under the economically weaker section (EWS) category for only 10% admissions made each year. The response came on the plea by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Chandigarh, which runs Bhavan Vidyalaya, Sector 27. The school had approached the high court in August, alleging that the UT administration was dilly dallying on reimbursements since 2012. It had demanded that the UT be restrained from compelling the school to admit students under the EWS category till the previous dues are reimbursed. Almost ₹2.5 crore are due since 2011-12, it had claimed before court. However, in its reply, the UT has told court that these educational institutes have been allotted land on leasehold under a 1996 scheme, according to which they were required to admit 5% of students as part of social responsibility from EWS category without charging any dues. Subsequently, the 5% limit was enhanced to 15% in 2005, and it covered all schools that got land prior to this policy or after the notification of the policy, it told court. As per data available with the UT education department, for 2019-2020, 56 private schools had reserved 730 EWS seats under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. The UT told court that the Act was implemented in 2010, according to which schools were to admit 25% students from EWS category, for which reimbursements were to be made by the respective governments or administrations. However, the law said it clearly that where the school is already under an obligation to provide free education to a certain number of children for getting land on concessional rate, then to the extent of that obligation no reimbursements would be made under the Act, court was told, adding that in view of this, schools are entitled for reimbursement for only 10% students and not 25% students admitted by them each year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ews-admissions-private-schools-to-get-reimbursement-for-only-10-students-chandigarh-admn-tells-hc/story-Ect40wXqDkb2zNevD1ybBK.html

16-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Housing Board set to launch group housing scheme at IT Park||Finally, Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) is all set to launch its group housing scheme for the general public at Rajiv Gandhi Chandigarh Information Technology Park (IT Park). UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has already given the go-ahead to its design in July this year, but due to the pandemic, the project could not take off. The project report will be placed before the board of directors in its meeting scheduled on Friday. CHB will develop the project on two plots, measuring 10.51 and 6.43 acres. In all, there will be 728 flats of three categories (4, 3 and 2 BHK) in seven-storey towers. The towers will have two basements with provision of parking of two cars for each flat in addition to surface parking for visitors. UT adviser Manoj Parida, who is also the CHB chairman, said: “Everything has been finalised for the launch of the scheme. The date will be decided on Friday.”Though the exact rates of flats are yet to be decided, tentative cost ranges between ₹1.5 crore and ₹2.75 crore, said another senior CHB official.There is a seasonal drain passing through the site, which is to be channelised. An agency is being appointed to conduct a survey to assess its catchment area and channelise it along the Haryana and Chandigarh border before its final disposal into the Sukhna choe, said the official.A long-delayed projectThe project land is part of 123 acres that CHB got back from Parsvnath Developers after a long-drawn legal battle.It was far back in October 2006 that CHB had decided to develop residential, commercial and other infrastructure with Parsvnath Developers at IT Park. The amount deposited by allottees was to be shared in the ratio of 70:30 between the developer and CHB. Thereafter, CHB transferred 123 acres as freehold to the builder, but the project could not materialise due to various issues. As applicants started demanding their money back, the builder approached court. In January 2015, the arbitrator appointed by the apex court directed the board to refund ₹567 crore to the builder.CHB had decided to launch the scheme on its own after it failed to sell 18 residential and commercial sites at an e-auction in 2018. Due to the high reserve prices, not many developers showed interest in the auction. High-end flats for government officials of the Chandigarh administration, Haryana and Punjab are also planned in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-housing-board-set-to-launch-group-housing-scheme-at-it-park/story-UmaIhElTfZ6Udr5XfiXRkK.html
16-12-2020||Gurugram||DTCP seeks report on status of unauthorised colonies in Bhondsi||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has sought a report from its Gurugram office regarding the development of unauthorised colonies in an area of around 500 acres in Bhondsi village between 2009 and 2017. The department has sought details such as the action taken against such unauthorised colonies and their developers, the criminal complaints registered against violators, the status of investigation of these cases, the officials who were posted in the area and the details of registries that were carried out in violation of the rules. The department has sought the details following a probe by the state CID department, which took up the matter in 2018. The department has now asked the officials in Gurugram to prepare a report in this matter and submit it to the headquarters so that action can be taken against officials, who have shown negligence in curbing the development of unauthorised colonies. The department also aims to form a strategy to ensure that illegal colonies are curbed not only in Bhondsi but also in others parts of the district as well, said a DTCP official. Between 2009 and 2017, a large number of illegal colonies have come up in Bhondsi. Some of these include Shriram Enclave, Bhajan Park, Mohan Nagar, Shyam Kunj, Lakshmi Kunj, Shanti Kunj, Shani Enclave, Krishna Kunj, Sneh Vihar, Kesar Nangla, opposite BSF colony, Defence Colony, Defence Enclave, Bhavani Enclave, RBS Colony and Prem Kunj, among others.Sanjiv Mann, senior town planner, said that directions have been issued to enforcement wing to compile a report in this matter. “We are keeping a strict vigil in this area and neither construction of houses nor carving of colonies is being allowed . Large number of demolition drives have also been carried out and, by next month, a drone survey would also be conducted to know the exact status of such colonies not only in Bhondsi but also across the city. The report in this matter will be sent to the headquarters at the earliest,” said Sanjiv Mann, senior town planner. The enforcement wing officials, meanwhile, said that there has been considerable check on illegal constructions and also on the sale of plots in these areas after they started a concerted drive against such colonies in the last one year. “The decision to bar registries of small plots by increasing the area and insistence of an NOC from DTCP will also help in curbing illegal colonies. A number of FIRs have also been lodged against the developers of illegal colonies” said a senior enforcement wing official, who wished anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-seeks-report-on-status-of-unauthorised-colonies-in-bhondsi/story-26LeoRiEkra27zVAdPvI6N.html
16-12-2020||Gurugram||Two held for running fake call centres on Sohna Road||The chief minister’s Flying Squad on Wednesday raided two fake call centres, which had been operating out of Spaze IT Park, a commercial mall on Sohna Road, for the past two months. Two people were arrested, and the police also recovered ₹8.5 lakh from a suspect’s possession. The Flying Squad has busted six such call centres over the last two months and has also carried out a mapping of the areas from where illegal call centres have been found to be operating across the city. The officials involved in the raid said several fake call centres have sprung up in the city over the last six years and people have been duping US and UK citizens of hundreds of dollars. Many suspects involved in such call centres have been arrested several times before, the police said. Most of them know each other and not even a single person has been convicted for such crimes, said the police. On Tuesday night, Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police, crime investigation department, said that he received a tip-off that two call centres were operating from Sohna Road. A team of five officers was formed and a raid was conducted. Yadav said, with the help of cyber police and local police station, a raid was carried out on the fourth floor of the complex. “In the first office, we found six men and four women making calls and entering details on their computers and laptops. In another office, 10 men and two women were busy making calls. They had a script in front of them and were speaking in English in an American accent using their headphones,” he said. The police said the telecallers were explaining the victims, who were US nationals, that they were providing government grants like loans at zero percent interest. They used to offer them grants between $1,000 and $5,000 and duped them by deducting $100 to 500 dollars from their Google cards. Harish Budhiraja, inspector, chief minister’s Flying Squad, said that two brothers were running one of the call centres and their friend was running another one. They have worked in call centres in Gurugram four years ago and used to earn hefty incentives, following which they planned to star their own business. “They took one year to understand the concept of duping and met lot of people who had knowledge of operations. They used to be present in the call centres and used to monitor calls. In November, they had earned ₹15 lakh after deducting all salaries and office expenses,” he said. The police also seized four laptops and hard disks from both call centres. A case under sections 420 (cheating), 120B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and sections 66D and 75 of the IT Act was registered at Cyber Crime police station on Wednesday. Budhiraja said the suspects did not possess any valid OSP(Other Service Providers) licences from the Department of Telecommunications or any other agreement or MoU related to their work. The suspects were identified as Anshul Mehta (33) and Akshay Mehta (34), residents of Meera Bagh in Delhi, and Ansh Saxena, a resident of Indirapuram, Ghaziabad. The latter managed to flee from the spot. The suspects, during questioning, revealed that they had duped more than 800 US citizens so far.“The telecallers used to collect information such as names, mobile numbers, e-mails and later sent them a voice mail. They trapped them after offering them a grant. They used to ask victims to purchase Google cards and then redeemed 100 to 500 dollars from their cards. Through this, they managed to dupe more than ₹1 crore from over 800 people,” said Budhiraja. The suspects were under the process of hiring more than 50 employees who were scheduled to join from January 1. The police said the new executives had to pose as officials of the US law enforcement agencies, threatening to cancel the social security numbers of victims if they failed to pay a fine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-held-for-running-fake-call-centres-on-sohna-road/story-mmxQyHojor1H3HwdKFpXUL.html
16-12-2020||Gurugram||Cold wave to persist, mercury set to dip further||The ongoing cold wave conditions in the city are likely to persist till at least Friday, while shallow to moderate fog in the early hours is likely to persist well into the weekend, experts and officials said on Wednesday. With no major weather systems expected to pass over north India for the time being, the minimum temperatures across most monitoring stations in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR are expected to drop below 5 degrees Celsius in the coming week.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) declares a cold wave in north India’s plain regions when the minimum temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius for two consecutive days, or if the minimum temperature remains at least 4.5 degrees below the normal for two consecutive days. While the IMD’s automatic weather station in Gurugram did not record the minimum temperature on Wednesday, it had recorded 4.5 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, the coldest day this season.Meanwhile, Delhi’s Palam Observatory (which is the closest AWS to Gurugram) recorded a minimum temperature of six degrees Celsius on Wednesday. Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of regional forecasting at IMD, said, “In Delhi, the Safdarjung observatory is recording minimum temperature that is five degrees below normal and is expected to fall further in the next two days. Corresponding dips in mercury will be felt even in Gurugram.”This is a sudden dip from Gurugram’s minimum temperature of 10.5 degrees Celsius on Sunday and marks a perceptible nip in the atmosphere.Navdeep Dahiya, a Rohtak-based meteorologist who has been tracking weather systems in Haryana and Delhi-NCR, attributed this to a combination of two factors. “One is a recent western disturbance, which did not affect Gurugram much but deposited isolated rainfall in other parts of the plains. This has caused temperatures to dip across Delhi-NCR and adjoining states. It has also increased the level of atmospheric moisture, which is why we can see moderate fog taking place in the morning,” Dahiya said.Moreover, northwestern winds originating in the Himalayas are blowing cold drafts into the plains. “Even though Gurugram has been seeing clear skies during the day, we are not seeing an increase in the daytime temperature because of these cold winds,” said Dahiya.Wednesday’s maximum temperature in Gurugram, as per IMD data, was 16.6 degrees Celsius, the lowest of the season.According to experts, minimum and maximum temperatures will continue to dip over the next few days. “There is no significant weather activity forecasted for the next week. With cold winds blowing from the north, and with increased moisture content, foggy conditions will continue till at least the weekend. There is presently a buildup of fog in Punjab, where some weather stations have recorded minimum temperature as little as two degrees Celsius on Wednesday. This will likely spread to Haryana and Delhi as the week progresses,” said Dahiya.According to the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Gurugram, the minimum temperature is expected to dip to four degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature is expected to hover in the range of 15 to 16 degrees Celsius. Cold winds of speeds up to 12kmph are expected to exacerbate cold wave conditions during the day time.Despite the dip in mercury, pollution levels remained relatively low in Gurugram, recording 221 on the CPCB’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin on Wednesday. “We typically see a buildup in pollutants when the temperature dips so drastically, but fortunately there are strong winds blowing over Delhi-NCR. This is expected after a western disturbance. When the temperature falls even more in coming days, it will coincide with a slowdown in wind speeds. This will trap both pollutants and humidity and we may see very poor to severe air once again, after the coming weekend,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cold-wave-to-persist-mercury-set-to-dip-further/story-mWHxnBY6qAJhP783P44axJ.html

This is a special drive organised by the MCG that started Monday and work on tracking more violators is underway,” said Kuldeep Singh, assistant engineer, advertisement wing, MCG.Singh explained that police complaints are lodged only in cases of repeated offences or failure to pay the fine.“We emailed the police stations, depending on the area jurisdictions, following which the FIRs have been registered. We are aiming to carry out the drive throughout December,” said Singh.He, however, declined to give specific details about the violators.The MCG had removed 600, 550 and 450 illegal hoardings on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.Besides registering an FIR against 70 people, the civic body also levied fines amounting to Rs 4 lakh against at least 150 violators, under the Haryana Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 1989. The Act allows MCG to levy penalties up to Rs 10,000 and imprisonment for up to six months, or both.As per MCG officials, hoardings and posters were removed from Golf Course Road, Galleria Road, Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road, Sohna Road, MG Road, Southern Peripheral Road, New Railway Road and the underpasses at Rajiv Chowk, Iffco Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk and Bajgehra flyover.In the run-up to the 2019 state elections, the MCG had issued notices to political parties for putting up posters in undesignated areas. In a notice, the MCG had informed political parties that there were over 200 designated spots in the city where political advertising was permitted and hence, advertisements in other areas would be considered illegal and lead to action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-clears-1-600-illegal-hoardings-posters/story-iGuYJ8dZQ717nQYSyRl5yK.html

The health minister has multiple co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, thyroid and heart disease,” said a senior doctor with the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, who is privy to the matter. A team of doctors, including Dr Deepak Govil, director, critical care, and Dr Sushila Kataria, senior director, internal medicine, of Medanta, along with Dr Virender Yadav, Gurugram’s chief medical officer, are monitoring his condition. Vij, 67, had tested positive for Covid-19 on December 5 and was admitted to the Civil Hospital in Ambala. On December 12, he was shifted to PGIMS, Rohtak, where he was diagnosed with moderate Covid-19 bilateral pneumonia, leading to infection in lungs. He was put on convalescent plasma therapy. After three days of treatment, Vij was shifted to Medanta. In November, a fortnight before he tested positive, the minister had received one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine candidate, which was part of a two-dose trial. It was a fortnight before he tested positive for the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/vij-remains-in-intensive-care-condition-stable-on-oxygen-support-says-health-dept/story-oRUJDtAVoP5ReXCd87ILsK.html
16-12-2020||Gurugram||Experts included in Covid-19 adverse event committee||Senior doctors in the fields of neurology, cardiology and pulmonology have been included in the district-level Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) committee, which has been reconstituted for the Covid-19 vaccination programme. It is for the first time that the committee will have experts to monitor and study the adverse health events after inoculation.An AEFI is an untoward medical occurrence following immunisation, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine, as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO).Before the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, the AEFI committee existed only to check adverse events in routine universal immunisation programmes, mostly limited to child and maternal health care.Due to Covid-19, the committee had to be revamped, considering that the vaccination drive will include a larger section of the population in different phases of vaccination. This may lead to increased reportage of adverse events.The district-level AEFI committee was revamped on December 7 and is likely to hold its first meeting next week, said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.“The committee has been extended to 15 members from the existing 12 members. Medical officer, a representative from WHO, Indian Medical Association (IMA), chief medical officer and paediatricians are the existing members. Doctors with expertise in cardiology, pulmonology and neurology from two private hospitals are also included in the committee to examine the patients who will report severe or serious adverse events related to Covid-19,” said Singh.Singh said that some cases might need confirmation and planned study if there is a sign of an unexpected adverse event.As per the Covid-19 guidelines, there are three categories of adverse events — minor AEFI, which includes common reactions like pain and swelling at the injection site, fever and irritability; severe AEFI, which can be disabling and rarely life threatening but do not lead to long-term problems; serious AEFI, which can require hospitalisation and death.Serious cases are extremely rare, pointed out Singh, as vaccines are introduced only after stringent safety guidelines followed during the vaccine trials. In AEFI, cases that will show symptoms even after a few days of inoculation will be included.“As per the guidelines, vaccine beneficiaries are to be observed at the session site for 30 minutes post vaccination to detect, manage and treat immediate adverse reactions, if any. The committee will work on the management of such cases as to how they can be immediately reported and handled,” said Singh.For handling such cases, an AEFI management centre has to be identified in each block, which will be linked with the session site. At the session site, the vaccine beneficiaries will be counselled about these events.Recently at the state-level, health department officials have been imparted training on infection prevention and control practices during vaccination. Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, state nodal officer for Covid-19 management and co-principal investigator on the Covaxin trials at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, said, “AEFI is a pharmacological intervention to ensure the vaccine is administered safely. Sometimes in normal immunisation, people develop pain, swelling or fever which are common and varies in people. Through AEFI management, vaccinators will be trained to handle and record such cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/experts-included-in-covid-19-adverse-event-committee/story-wtmeYraunEKMJ2hA7v26zN.html
16-12-2020||Gurugram||Farmers to increase strength before taking a call on entering Gurugram||Farmer unions of Haryana and Rajasthan formed teams on Tuesday to reach out to other farmers and urge them to join the ongoing protest against the new farm laws passed by the Centre. They are visiting villages and meeting sarpanchs to get a large number of farmers and their family members to join them in Rewari and Rajasthan border, where they have been sitting in protest since the last Sunday. Protesters said they would decide if they should move towards the city or not only after they gather up to 3,000 people. Farmers protesting in Bawal in Rewari and Shahjahanpur on Delhi-Jaipur highway at the Haryana-Rajasthan border set up more than 30 tents on Wednesday. Traffic movement slowed down as only one side of the carriageway was operational. The police since Monday have set up barricades to stop the protestors from crossing the border. Members from some opposition parties also reached the protesting sites and extended their support to the farmers. However, the protestors said they do not want any political interference in their protest and denied taking any help from any of political parties. More than 20 tractor trolleys from Gujarat and Maharashtra also joined the protest at the two protest sites and started langar (community kitchen) for the farmers. One of the protestors said that local villages are sending up to 300 litres of milk and fresh vegetables along with flour every day. Satnarayan Nehra, president of Nehra Khap of Haryana, said that they are expecting more farmers and their family members to join the protest. “The strength is yet to increase and once we touch 3,000, we will move towards Delhi to support our fellow farmers. We are in touch with other farmers at the Singhu and Tikri borders in Delhi and we have planned to move forward after they give consent for the same. We have in store a month’s ration. We will take a decision by Thursday regarding our next step,” he said. The agitation staged by more than 1,000 farmer bodies on the Delhi-Jaipur highway has entered its fourth day. The protesters clashed with the police at Banipur chowk in Bawal on Monday, after which the police detained at least 10 protestors under the Preventive Detention Act. They were released after four hours. Ram Krishan Mehlawat of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Indian Farmers’ Union) from Bawal, said that the police can only stop them from protesting on highway. As such, they are protesting on the service lanes and are trying to increase their strength. “More farmers from various parts of Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra will be joining us on Thursday and Friday. If need be, we shall enter Gurugram forcefully,” he said. Tej Bahadur Yadav, a former constable of the Border Security Force (BSF), who was earlier sacked from service and who contested the election from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Varanasi Lok Sabha seat last year, also joined the protest and said that he was taking care of the logistics and administrative work related to the protest. “The number of protesting farmers is still below our expectations. We are waiting for more farmers to join us so that we can block the highway till the new farm laws are repealed. We will go on hunger strike if police do not allow us to cross the border,” he said, adding that he plans to visit more than 500 villages to convince farmers to join their protests. Abhishek Jorwal, superintendent of police (Rewari), said that farmers were not allowed to occupy the National Highway-48. “They are protesting on the service lanes where they have stationed their tractor-trolleys, cars and motorbikes. The traffic is being managed by the police personnel. Anyone who breaks the law will be arrested. We have deployed enough force to maintain the law and order situation. However, till now there has been no untoward incident,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-to-increase-strength-before-taking-a-call-on-entering-gurugram/story-YdYY092ReaSQ4iAx0yjmgL.html

The cases have been lodged against the realtors for cheating and criminal breach of trust, among others, the police said. While final closure report has been submitted in one of these cases, investigation has not been completed in other 10 cases. The GB Nagar additional commissioner of police, Love Kumar, said that these cases have been lodged against altogether 26 developers and their associates, who have reportedly duped many innocent people in the district. “On the basis of the complaints, cases have been lodged against the developers under various sections of IPC, including 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 471 (using a forged document as genuine) and 467 (forgery of valuable security). It has also been found during the investigation that non-delivery of possession on time is the main reason of conflict between the developers and the buyers,” he said. The additional CP further said that while four of these cases have been lodged at sector 20 police station, two each have been lodged at sector 58, phase-3 and beta 2 police stations and one at sector 39 police station. “In a case lodged at sector 20 police station, the police have submitted final report in one of the cases, involving five persons. The police have yet not completed its investigation in the remaining 10 cases,” he said. It can be mentioned that in 2019, the GB Nagar police had lodged seven cases of similar nature against the developers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-police-register-11-cases-against-builders-this-year-so-far/story-w7nDUVBX501mnvAaHfFpyO.html
16-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Aqua Line records highest ridership since resuming services after lockdown||Noida: The Aqua Line of Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) on Monday recorded a ridership of 9,822, the highest since it resumed services on September 7 after the lockdown. On September 7, the Noida Metro’s ridership was only 600 when services were available in the morning (7am to 11am) and evening (5pm to 9pm) hours at an interval of 15 minutes. The Aqua Line started its full fledged operations running trains throughout the day from September 12 when 2,148 passengers used the services.Thus the ridership has increased by more than 4.5 times in three months of resuming services, NMRC officials said. However, the post-lockdown ridership is significantly low if it is compared to that of pre-lockdown period, the officials said. Before the lockdown, on an average around 18,000 riders would use the Noida Metro services daily. For example, the Aqua Line had recorded a ridership of 19,064 and 17,720 on March 16 and 17, respectively.Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager of NMRC, said that the Aqua Line has been recording steady rise in ridership since resuming its operations after the lockdown. “On September 12, the Aqua Line had recorded a ridership of 2,148 and since then the ridership has seen a steady rise,” she said.Sharma said that the rise in the ridership this month could be due to winter season and farmers’ protest. “It is believed that motorcycle users prefer to use metro during winter. We also feel that due to farmers’ protest, people commuting from Noida, Greater Noida to East Delhi and vice versa are using metro to evade traffic jam,” she said. Rohan Kumar, a commuter from Greater Noida, said that he uses metro for commuting to Mayur Vihar in Delhi. “Farmers’ protests have affected the traffic on roads. Metro facilitates a hassle-free commuting,” said Rohan, a law student. Meanwhile, NMRC has also planned to restart its citizen friendly initiatives. Sharma said that NMRC had planned to rent out Aqua Line metro’s coaches for birthday celebrations and pre-wedding shoots in February this year, but due to Coronavirus outbreak and the lockdown, the initiative could not take off. “We have again started seeking applications from interested candidates to book the metro coaches for such celebrations. They will have to follow the social distancing norms and wear masks,” she said. “The initiative gives residents a unique destination for photo shoot. It also generates non-fare revenue through short term licensing of NMRC’s coach/ train for sustainable development,” Sharma said.As per the policy, an undecorated coach in a regular running metro train for an event would cost Rs 8,000 while an undecorated coach in static metro train would cost Rs 5,000. A decorated coach in a regular running metro train for an event would cost Rs 10,000 and a decorated coach in static metro train would cost Rs 7,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-aqua-line-records-highest-ridership-since-resuming-services-after-lockdown/story-AW7KRQPClrLb5Jcge3yjWK.html
16-12-2020||Noida||In Ghaziabad, 25,000 to get Covid-19 vaccines under phase 1||GHAZIABAD: At least 25,000 people in Ghaziabad will get Covid-19 vaccine in the first phase of the immunisation programme in the state, district officials said. Also, out of these 25,000 beneficiaries, about 20,500 (82%) will be frontline health workers, the officials said.Giving the information, Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, who took stock of the preparations for the Covid-19 vaccination in the district, said that Ghaziabad has one district-level vaccine depot and 29 block-level cold chain points. A vaccine depot is a place where vaccines are stored in freezers. The state government has collaborated with UNICEF for construction of these vaccine depots and evaluation of the existing cold storage chain points, the officials said. The DM said that the target Covid-19 population in the district has been calculated in proportion to the state’s Covid-infected population. “It is roughly equal to 20% of the district’s population and seven times the number of beneficiaries for routine immunization. The renovation work of all the cold chain points and vaccine depot have been completed. The vaccines sent from the state headquarters will directly be stored in the refrigerators, with 225-litre capacity, kept at MMG hospital,” he said. Pandey further said that all the cold chain points in the district have been provided ice-lined refrigerators (ILRs). “The vaccines will be sent from the depot to the cold chain points in proper vaccine boxes. From there, the vaccines will be delivered to different immunization points for the first phase of the Covid-19 vaccination. At these cold chain points, the temperature is maintained between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius,” he said. The officials said that as many as 82 spots have been identified for the first phase of immunisation in the district. “The targeted number of health workers, who will be immunised in this phase, is 20,456. We expect to provide Covid-19 vaccination to at least 25,000 people in the first week of its commencement. Out of 29 ILRs, we have so far received four ILRs and the rest will also be delivered to MMG hospital very soon,” Pandey said. Meanwhile, a senior official of the state health department said that the government is aiming to create 2.03 lakh litre capacity of storage for Covid-19 vaccination, of which 80,733 litre of space has been created so far. “The first phase of Covid-19 vaccination is expected to immunise over four crore people in the state with the focus on frontline corona warriors, including health workers,” he said, preferring anonymity. In a draft standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the Union health ministry to all states and Union territories, as many as 100 people should be vaccinated per day at a site and if sufficient resources are available, then up to 200 people can be vaccinated. “If in any case, more than 200 people are being vaccinated within a session, then a whole team of five people will have to be deployed separately (one vaccine officer and four vaccination officers),” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/in-ghaziabad-25-000-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-under-phase-1/story-KgvBaUNP66kIQYt6fg4aOK.html

The move comes after NIAL received complaints that some realty firms are misusing the logo to promote their housing projects located along the Yamuna Expressway. NIAL has also decided to issue a public notice warning the developers, individuals and companies to stop misuse of the logo. Recently, NIAL had received a complaint that realty firm Gaursons was misusing the logo to promote its housing project. NIAL let off Gaursons after the realtor apologized for the “error”, officials said.“We came to know via a complaint that Gaursons is misusing the airport logo. The developer apologized for the mistake. Now, we have decided to issue a public notice to make sure that no other developer, individual and company misuse the logo in their promotional campaign,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, NIAL.The realty firm said that they will remove the airport logo from all of their advertisement boards or banners. “We have apologized for the error. We will make sure the logo is removed from all posters and banners, wherever it is printed unintentionally,” said Manoj Gaur, promoter of Gaursons.NIAL said that if any developer is found misusing the logo even after the warning via public notice, then FIR will be filed and strong legal action will be initiated for the violation.“No developer or company can be allowed to use the logo to influence consumers into their product,” said Singh.Zurich International AG, the Swiss company selected to develop the airport project, will start work on this project by mid-2021. The airport is expected to become operational by 2023-24, said officials of NIAL. Zurich will invest Rs 30,000 crore on the initial development work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/face-legal-action-for-misuse-of-jewar-airport-logo/story-0KvopFkjr56rH9cXX378EL.html
16-12-2020||Delhi||10 Sadhus at Singhu border continue Monday’s hunger strike against farm laws||A group of 10 sadhus (ascetics) from across states have continued to fast at the Singhu border in protest against the Centre’s three new farm laws, even after the planned day-long hunger strike of leaders of all farmer organisations at the four Delhi borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate and Chilla – culminated on Monday evening itself. The men, affiliated with the Bharatiya Sadhu Samaj, said they have given the central government a 10-day-ultimatum to decide on the protesting farmers’ demands to roll back the three new laws, after which they will begin a “fast until death.”“If the government fails to fulfil the demands of the farmers in these 10 days, we will begin our indefinite fast until death. This is our fourth day of the hunger strike. We are only surviving on water and lemon juice. After the 10-day deadline, we will quit that as well,” said Mahant Jasveer Das, general secretary of Bharatiya Sadhu Samaj, from Punjab.Claiming that their hunger strike is to stop cases of farmers’ suicides, Das said, “More farmers, mainly the younger generations, will die by suicide if the three new farm laws are not scrapped.”Wearing a green headscarf and sitting next to Das in the tent, Mahant Arjun Arya from Madhya Pradesh said none of the members of the organisation knew each other when they had first arrived at Singhu border for the protest around a fortnight ago.“Our meeting was a coincidence but our objective behind coming here was the same. Although we call ourselves sadhu, all of us are first the children of farmers. If our parents (farmers) are fighting a battle for their existence, how could we remain silent?” said Arya.According to Yogender Singh Panwar from Uttarakhand, initially, only five people began the hunger strike in the tent on Sunday (December 13) but the number has been increasing every passing day.“Apart from the 10 people who are present here, there at least 15 others who are farmers and are on the hunger strike with us. They visit us once or twice in a day and return to their respective tents or tractor trolleys,” said Panwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/10-sadhus-at-singhu-border-continue-monday-s-hunger-strike-against-farm-laws/story-4mxGi3iInmL5YJJusYT3LJ.html
16-12-2020||Delhi||Illegal call centre busted, 54 people who cheated over 4,500 US citizens of ₹90-100cr arrested||In one of its biggest crackdowns on illegal call centres in Delhi, police on Wednesday arrested 54 people, nine of them women, operating a call centre from west Delhi’s Moti Nagar Industrial Area and said the gang had cheated about 4,500 foreign nationals of nearly ₹90-100 crore. The arrested employees used to pose as the social security officials of the United States and dupe Americans of money after accusing them of being involved in criminal cases, police said. “They would ask their intended victim to transfer all his/her money to an e-wallet or be arrested and have their accounts frozen. The money, in the form of bitcoins, would then be siphoned off by the gang,” said a senior police officer involved in the investigation.Police said the total amount defrauded thus from over 4,500 foreign nationals, mostly from the USA, is estimated to be around ₹90-100 crore, . Deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy said police have also found that the man who ran the call centre is an Indian based in Dubai. He has been identified only by his first name, Ashwani , and was known among his employees as Munshi.Police have also found that Ashwani has a criminal history of betting in Delhi and had long ago fled to UAE. “Efforts are on to extradite him with the help of the ministry of external affairs,” Roy said.With the arrest of the 54 employees of the call centre, Roy said they have also seized 89 desktops along with a server and more than 50 mobile phones. An elaborate written script that was used to dupe the foreigners has also been recovered,” the DCP said.“Among the arrested employees, four are team leaders, identified as Gurmil Singh, Raunak, Jyotika and Yashpal. They disclosed that they would contact Americans in the US and other countries impersonating as officials from government agencies such as the social security administration, the drug enforcement administration (DEA), and the US Marshal Service. They would inform the targeted persons that their bank accounts and other assets are being frozen as their details have been found at a crime scene,” Roy said.“Some of the targets were also told that there were bank accounts being used in their names through which illegal transactions have been made to drug cartels in Mexico and Colombia. They then threatened the targets that they could either get arrested and face legal action or go for an alternate dispute resolution (ADR) which would be faster and simpler,” he said.“In the second option, which all the targets fell for, they were asked to share details of their assets, including bank accounts and the amount of money in those accounts. They were told that the only way to safeguard their assets is to buy bitcoins or gift cards and transfer the same to e-wallets in India. The bitcoins and gift cards once received were encashed here in India,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/illegal-call-centre-busted-54-people-who-cheated-over-4-500-us-citizens-of-90-100cr-arrested/story-yPrAw26PxWtl3KNm2P3jEK.html

A bench of chief justice D N Patel and justice Prateek Jalan issued a notice to the Union health ministry on a petition by the Surgical Manufacturers and Traders Association (SMTA). The association has argued that notifying the devices as drugs will result in a substantial hike in their prices, which would make them unaffordable for a large section of society. SMTA has also contended that representations made by it and other stakeholders were not considered at the time the decision was taken. The court listed the matter for hearing with a petition moved last year by SMTA challenging a notification which declared blood monitoring devices, digital thermometers, nebulizers and glucometers as “drugs” under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. Both the matters would be now listed on January 29, 2021. The association has submitted that the notification is unreasonable, arbitrary, and would cause undue hardship to stakeholders on the supply and demand side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/centre-s-response-sought-on-plea-against-its-order-notifying-medical-devices-as-drugs/story-kiE8L6vyvUnGKoLhZk76RP.html

16-12-2020||City||J&K DDC polls: Parties keeping doors open for return of defiants, say analysts||As polling for the penultimate round of the eight-phase district development council elections was held in Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday, all the major political parties, especially in the valley, seem to be keeping their doors open for the members who broke away to contest as independent candidates.The last phase of voting will be held on Saturday, while the counting is scheduled on December 22.Though dozens of political workers and office-bearers of various parties contested the elections as independent candidates, no disciplinary action has been initiated against them by the respective leaderships.Political analysts believe that the big parties may be planning to pull the winning independent candidates back to the fold.“If the candidates emerge victorious, the parties will own them and use their crucial votes to bargain for the post of chairman in the DDCs. Not initiating action against such candidates by now indicates that the party leaders have kept doors open for their return,” said Asim Bhat, journalist and political analyst.PDP patron Muzuffar Beigh, who claimed to have resigned from the party, and his wife Safeena Beigh contested from the Wagoora seat in Sangrama in Baramulla as independent candidates. Safeena is still the president of the PDP’s women wing as the party has officially not taken any action against her.Beigh even deferred his press conference which could be an indication that they could be owned by the party after polls. Moreover, half a dozen PDP workers contested from different places as independent candidates. Similarly, several Congress, National Conference and the People’s Conference workers and leaders also contested as independents from various DDC constituencies. Even the BJP had to face rebellion from half a dozen workers and leaders in Kashmir, but it too didn’t act against them.However, the parties have denied these projections.When asked, the spokesperson of PDP said the party president had already made it clear that those candidates who defied PAGD were no more its part. “Beigh has left the party and his wife also contested against the PAGD candidate, so they are automatically out.” He added that the same rule applied to all other workers and leaders who went against the main fold.People’s Conference spokesman Adnan Ashraf said the party leadership would wait until the elections are over to deliberate on this issue.NC spokesman Imran Nabi Dar claimed that none of their prominent leaders or workers had defied the party. “There may have been an odd case, but overall, our party workers remained loyal to the leadership,” said Dar.BJP state spokesman Altaf Thakur said that action has been already taken against the leaders or workers who defied party directions...“We have taken action. Even if some of them win they won’t be taken back in the party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-ddc-polls-parties-keeping-doors-open-for-return-of-defiants-say-analysts/story-kQBhAwTqjWGl6RIWLVq0VL.html

Bhushan said his wife was receiving treatment for eye disease and complained of breathing problems after which she was rushed to IGMC on October 30. “She died on October 31 due to negligence of the hospital staff as during the 12 hours she did not get any treatment and no senior doctor came to check her. “Also, while she was rushed to the hospital we were forced to share the ambulance with two other patients,” he added. He said, “The oxygen cylinder was out of order in the ward where his wife was admitted and power plugs to provide steam to the patient was also not working. Toilets were in poor condition. Her X-ray, ultrasound, ECG were also not taken by the hospital staff,” “Even though her Covid-19 report was negative, she was declared positive six hours after her death. Such incidents are being reported almost every day. Therefore, stern action should be taken against the hospital authorities,” he said.

It was around 4am when he started travelling from home and reaches Barnala town by noon. “I want to remind (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi that despite the barricades put up on the roads, we can reach Delhi even by foot through fields. Our Gurus will bless us in tough times,” said Singh. The elderly man claimed that he was never associated with any farmer organisation.“A farmer likes the winter because it is a blessing for crops. For me, reaching Delhi on foot is like going to my fields. We work in our fields even during winter nights. I will spend the nights wherever I get a chance,” added Singh.“I have no idea when I will return. But I appeal to all youths and others to join this struggle. We cannot just sit back at a time when the government is eyeing our mother (land). It is not a battle of Punjab farmers only, but also those from other states,” he said.He also advised the youngsters not to panic and hold the protests peacefully.“The central government tried to portray the Punjabi youth as drug addicts. But the Punjabis proved that they are not that. The Modi government will have to pay price for these black laws,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/60-year-old-jagraon-farmer-sets-journey-to-national-capital-on-foot-to-join-agitation-against-contentious-laws/story-gQPGsYjaTWSHA0vf71OkZN.html

16-12-2020||Delhi||With positivity rate on decline in Delhi, Covid-19 testing unlikely to be scaled up||With the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positivity rate – the proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – dipping below 2 per cent, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain indicated on Wednesday that the city is unlikely to scale up testing.“The World Health Organisation says that the tests should be scaled up till the positivity rate of less than 8 per cent is achieved. The positivity rate of 5 per cent is considered to be optimum, which means that a sufficient number of tests is being performed. Delhi has had a positivity rate of less than 3 per cent for five days in a row and less than 5 per cent for 15 days in a row. Right now, the positivity rate is about 2 per cent in Delhi. Let us wait and watch how long the positivity rate of 2 per cent is maintained,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, implying that the Delhi government is unlikely to increase the number of tests further.After a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in mid-November, when Delhi was going through the third and the worst surge in Covid-19 cases, the government had decided to scale up the number of tests to between 100,000 and 120,000 a day.On Tuesday, Delhi reported the highest number of tests conducted in a day – 85,105. Of these, almost half the tests were conducted using the more accurate RT PCR method. The daily number of tests has gone up from an average of 52,617 tests a day in the first week of November to 71,803 on average a day in the last seven days, as per the data shared by the Delhi government.Also read: WHO’s team to go to China in January for Covid-19 origin probeThe proportion of RT PCR tests has also gone up from 27.6 per cent in the first week of November to 47.9 per cent on an average during the last seven days.As for hospitalisations with the viral infection, the minister said that around 50 per cent of the ICU beds were available in Delhi. However, in some of the big private hospitals, the occupancy of ICU beds remained at 80 per cent.As per the Delhi government’s Corona app, on average only 34.8 per cent of the ICU beds – with or without ventilators – were occupied across hospitals as on Wednesday evening. The Delhi high court had asked the government to review its order reserving 80 per cent of the total ICU beds in 75 private hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19.The HC had initially imposed a stay on the September 12 order reserving 80 per cent of ICU beds in 33 big private hospitals but later withdrew the stay with the surge in cases in November. Subsequently, the government ordered another 42 hospitals to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-positivity-rate-on-decline-in-delhi-covid-19-testing-unlikely-to-be-scaled-up/story-sqYv2ne7NFUoVOHwByBAcL.html

Mitra was adamant that the state’s ruling party had not lost ground despite the departure of one of its stalwart leaders. “I personally feel ultimately Suvendu Adhikari will lose. I am ready to take charge of Midnapore district and if party wants I will stay there for three months at a stretch.TMC hasn’t lost its ground,” he said as quoted by ANI. Suvendu Adhikari resigned from TMC on Wednesday after several days of discontentment with the party. He spearheaded the Nandigram movement that helped chief minister Mamata Banerjee win power from the CPI(M) in 2011. He represented the Nandigram constituency from the Purba Medinipur district. Adhikari is still a largely influential figure in the areas of West Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia, Jhargram, parts of Birbhum and Murshidabad, all of which constitute about 40-45 assembly seats The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are optimistic of Adhikari joining their party, which would bolster their chances of coming to power in West Bengal. Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said, “It was bound to happen. Many MLAs left TMC earlier too and joined our party. There is no democracy or respect for people in TMC. Those who want to join in the change in Bengal and contribute to its development are leaving TMC and joining us.”BJP vice-president Mukul Roy welcomed the news of Adhikari’s resignation. “The day Suvendu Adhikari had resigned from the ministerial post, I had said that I will be happy if he leaves TMC and we will welcome him. Today he has resigned from the membership of the West Bengal legislative assembly and I welcome his decision.”Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, on the other hand, pulled no punches. “Some dacoits of Chambal and goons from outside have entered Bengal. At times they threaten police and sometimes they threaten TMC. Today TMC is as deep-rooted as a Banyan tree. Two-three people who know they won’t get a ticket from the party are going away,” she said. The West Bengal Assembly Election is scheduled to be held during April-May in 2021 with the BJP and the ruling TMC as the two main rivals to fight for power. The BJP had bagged only three out of the 294 seats in the previous assembly election but won 18 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/personally-feel-suvendu-adhikari-will-lose-tmc-leader-madan-mitra/story-uK1Efhvpmy0EdsACKpO8jL.html

Thakur said the state government is committed for the welfare of its brave soldiers and many schemes are being implemented for ex-servicemen. He said all dependents of 52 martyrs were given an amount of Rs 5 lakh and employment was provided to dependents of 48 families. “An ex-gratia grant amount of Rs 20 lakh was being provided to the next of kin of the soldiers and paramilitary forces who laid down their lives during the war and Rs 5 lakh to the soldiers belonging to defence and paramilitary forces who have over 50% physical disabilities during war and military operations,” the CM said. Not only this, a provision has also been made by the ministry of petroleum and natural gas to provide petrol pumps and gas agencies for the dependents of the soldiers killed in various military operations, he added. Thakur said the state government has also released an amount of Rs 45.63 lakh to ARTRAC Shimla for opening CSD Extension Centre at Sundernagar in Mandi and Jhanduta in Bilaspur.

16-12-2020||Dehradun||‘Uttarakhand faced loss of around Rs 4,000 cr during lockdown’: Govt committee||A committee formed by the Uttarakhand government to ascertain losses faced by the state government during the Covid-19 lockdown period has revealed that the state had to bear losses around Rs 4,000 crores. The committee, headed by cabinet minister Subodh Uniyal, is preparing a report about the different types of losses borne by the state and will soon be submitting it to the higher authorities. “We have learnt from the finance department that the state government has faced direct losses of approximately Rs 4,000 crores during the lockdown period (March-end till June), but maximum part of this amount is being covered by the compensation being given by the Centre for Goods and Services Tax. The collection from GST amounts to over Rs 2,000 crores,” said Uniyal. Uttarakhand has six major sources of revenue generation which includes earnings through GST which amounts to around 60 per cent of monthly revenue. The other sources are excise (around Rs 250-300 crores per month), vehicle registration (Rs 100-150 crores per month), vehicle tax (Rs 80-90 crores per month), mining activities (Rs 50-60 crores per month), revenue from forests (Rs 40-50 crores per month). Also read: India may blacklist some telecom equipment vendors for securityHe added that the state also faced many indirect losses, the amount for which is being calculated. “Due to the lockdown, the state government gave many relief measures to the tourism sector, registered labourers, started various employment schemes; these can be considered as indirect losses, which would not have happened otherwise. These would also amount to something between Rs 500-Rs 1000 crores,” added Uniyal. Based on the findings of the report, the committee is now working to give suggestions to the state government on how to turn crisis into opportunity in the state, the method followed by the state during the Unlock process. The minister further said that the agriculture sector in the state did not face much loss during the lockdown as alternative methods of livelihood like honey rearing, cash crop cultivation were adopted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-faced-loss-of-around-rs-4-000-cr-during-lockdown-govt-committee/story-Ozeg8LuOLtBkdHyjyx3lUO.html

16-12-2020||Mumbai||Setback for MVA in shifting carshed out of Aarey Colony as HC stays Kanjurmarg shed work||In a setback to the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s plan to shift controversial Metro 3 car shed out of Aarey Milk Colony, the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday ordered an interim stay on the Mumbai collector’s order to transfer 102 acres of land to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for constructing the carshed. Metro 3 is proposed to be an underground line linking Colaba-Bandra-Seepz. Thackeray government had scrapped Devendra Fadnavis government’s decision to build carshed at Aarey Colony despite opposition from environment activists and citizen groups who had insisted that Aarey wad one of the last green spots in Mumbai. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Wednesday tweeted, “Hon’ble HC has granted a stay to Kanjurmarg work. We await the detailed written order to decide the future course of action.” He added, “This land is crucial for Metro Line 6, 4 and 14, apart from 3, as it will save almost Rs5,500 crore of Govt and be a nodal point for 1 crore citizens.”In a major decision, the MVA government had announced shifting the carshed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg in order to save the green lung. It was further decided that the land at Kanjurmarg will be utilised for Metro 6 (Swami Samath Nagar-Vikhroli), 4 (Wadala-Kasarwadavali) and 14 (Kanjurmarg-Badlapur). However, in a letter dated October 15 to the Maharashtra chief secretary, the Central government’s department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) stated that the 102-acre plot for the carshed in Kanjurmarg was handed over by the state to MMRDA “without following extant procedure”.According to DPIIT, the Centre had filed a writ petition against several salt department lands — including the Kanjurmarg plot — and the decision was pending before the HC. The letter, signed by DPIIT secretary Dr Guruprasad Mohapatra, went on to say, “Improper and unilateral action of the collector and MMRDA has caused severe loss to DPIIT. I would request you to take necessary steps and restrain MMRDA from taking any further steps and to direct [the] collector to withdraw the orders passed in this regard in order to protect the interests of the Government of India.”The state, however, continued to maintain that the land belongs to Maharashtra and the work continued on site. It pointed out that the revenue authority had ruled that the land belonged to the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/setback-for-mva-in-shifting-carshed-out-of-aarey-colony-as-hc-stays-kanjurmarg-shed-work/story-yRgOEhDRrUZL7dZ8lBuOCN.html

16-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Now, a library-cultural centre comes up at Singhu border||A group of young, working professionals, students, and farmers from Punjab and Haryana has set up a cultural space-cum-library at Singhu border to serve as a platform for artists as well as engage with the street children around the area amid the farmers’ protest.On Tuesday afternoon, a day after they set up the Sahitya Chaupal near the Kessel Grand Mall at the protest site, several children were huddled around a volunteer in the 30 x 30 feet enclosure, sketching. Few others were busy reading. At another enclosure, set up by the same group, children were doing basic arithmetic.“We saw these children moving around from one langar to another, collecting food, playing among themselves. So we thought we could engage them in drawing or just conduct regular activities for them,” said Sonu Chahal, who has pursued his postgraduate degree in music and hails from Manochahal village in the Tarn Taran district of Punjab.Also read | Farm unions slam Centre, say govt lacks sympathyChahal is among nearly a dozen organisers and around 40 volunteers who have set up the initiative. The larger enclosure, near the Kessel Grand Mall, was set up on Monday by Navdeep Singh -- the young farmer who became an internet sensation after turning off a water cannon during the agitation in Haryana last month.“There are a lot of young farmers who have gathered around the area and they speak their minds. So, we wanted to create a space for reading, discussion and engage the younger generation here in a constructive manner,” he said. When asked if he knew the organisers from earlier, Singh said, “No. Most of us came together on this protest site and only had one or two acquaintances here. Since we share the same idea, we’re all working on this project.”His friend and fellow organiser Gurinder Singh said, “We wanted to create literary chaupals (community space) where people could come, read, and have a dialogue on issues.” Singh, who hails from Patiala and has a postgraduate degree in business administration (MBA), said, “The titles present at the library include a biography on Fidel Castro in Punjabi, Paash’s poetry, books by writers like Arundhati Roy and Khushwant Singh as well as journalist Ravish Kumar.”The team has also created a WhatsApp group and has asked people to donate whatever books they want to so that those can also be added to the library. “We want our elderly protesters to have a space to read and rest and discuss, like we do back home,” said Singh, pointing towards a farmer who slept in the enclosure with a book by his side on Tuesday afternoon. The group will also be holding regular poetry and song sessions inviting artists, musicians, poets, and filmmakers to share their work.“From the looks of it, the protest will continue for a long time. The chaupal is an attempt to maintain discipline here and hold meaningful conversations among the young people,” said Dinesh Chaddha, a lawyer from Barwa village in Ropat.Several other makeshift libraries have been set up at the spot since the earlier days of the agitation. However, this is the first time a group of young professionals is bringing in diverse forms of art like music and poetry into the mix.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-protest-now-a-library-cultural-centre-comes-up-at-singhu-border/story-KFOFpfF1CUcM4cfUDnpokO.html

16-12-2020||Mumbai||Maha: Opposition leader attacks govt on Covid-19, farm distress, quota||BJP leader Pravin Darekar on Tuesday sought to put the Maharashtra government on the mat over its Rs 10,000 crore relief package for flood-hit farmers by claiming provision of only Rs 2,181 crore had been made so far.Speaking during the debate on supplementary demands in the Legislative Council, Darekar, who is Leader of Opposition, also sought to know what steps the Uddhav Thackeray government was taking to the ensure the Maratha quota decision, currently being heard in the Supreme Court, remains intact.He said the state government, at the same time, will also have to “assure the OBCs that their quota will not be touched”.“Of the Rs 10,000 crore package announced by the state government, farmers will get only Rs 5,500 crore. The rest is allocated for rural development, road and bridge construction, and repair works. This is going to benefit only contractors,” he said.Darekar said the MVA government announced the package on October 23, while a formal decision on it was made only on November 7, which “rubbed salt into the wounds of farmers” as only help of Rs 2,181 crore was earmarked.“Only 20% farmers are going to benefit from this. The government should immediately give Rs 7,820 crore as relief to farmers,” he said.Taking a swipe at Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who took out protest marches in 2019 to ensure farmers get crop insurance claims, Darekar sought to know “how many claims from farmers have been settled till now”.Darekar listed several steps taken by Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, all ruled by the BJP, to give relief to farmers, adding that the Maharashtra government was lacking on this front.Speaking on the Covid-19 situation, Darekar said the Maharashtra government had mishandled the outbreak and the number of tests per million population was less when compared to several other states.He said private laboratories had “looted” patients in the name of tests when a Central government firm, HLL Lifecare Limited, was offering coronavirus tests at lower rates.Darekar said the state health department, on September 2,informed him only 72 ventilators had been purchased, while the Centre had given 4,434 ventilators amid the outbreak.“It is observed that some 5 per cent Covid-19 patients need ventilator support. This means, at the time (early September), 14,560 ventilators were required. But the state government bought only 72 ventilators. Even face masks were priced higher in the state,” he alleged.The BJP leader said the Uddhav Thackeray government shifted the metro rail car shed work from Aarey to Kanjurmarg “out of arrogance and ego”.He said the current dispensation had slowed down the progress of metro works as well as the Dharavi redevelopment plan in the metropolis.He took a swipe at the state government on the issues connected to Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and actor Kangana Ranaut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-opposition-leader-attacks-govt-on-covid-19-farm-distress-quota/story-a5KaQurHaM474zEaVfvGHK.html

It’s back to business for scores of pony owners, who were rendered jobless with the decline in tourism this year. Kufri has been seeing a steady rush of tourists over the past five days since the latest spell of snow. The local economy is largely dependent on the tourist influx. Kufri was a sleepy hamlet till Bollywood films shot here in the’60s and ’70s made its snow-covered slopes a popular tourist destination. At present, there are an estimated 1,200 ponies engaged in giving joy rides to tourists. They make their way to Kufri from adjoining villages daily. WORKED IN FIELDS FOR A LIVING During the lockdown, most of the pony owners worked in fields and grew vegetables. “The last nine months have been tough in Kufri. There was no work and it had become difficult to even buy fodder for the ponies,” says Kedar Kanwar, who heads the Ashwa Palak Pratyatak Sangh, a local group of 20 horse owners. The summer months of May and June are the peak tourist season in Kufri followed by the winter months of November, December and January amid snowfall. “The peak summer months went for a toss due to the lockdown. We hope to see better days now,” says Om Parkash, who hails from Jahu, a nearby village. The owners who bought horses last year are the worst affected as they have not been able to repay loans raised for buying the ponies. “I bought a pony for Rs 50,000 last year and I’ve not been able to pay the loan instalments as our source of income dried up. We hope business picks up now,” says Sohan Singh Thakur, the president of the Paryatan Ashv Malik Sudhar Sabha. Photographers in Kufri too hope that the tourist influx will help revive their business. NIGHT CURFEW A STUMBLING BLOCK The pony owners say that the Himachal Pradesh government’s decision to impose night curfew to check the spread of Covid-19 has hit business. “Not many tourists come to Kufri and those who do are in a rush to leave due to the night curfew. The government should lift the restrictions,” says Sanjay Sharma, who owns two horses and belongs to Munda Ghat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/it-s-back-on-track-for-kufri-s-pony-owners-as-snow-draws-tourists-to-himachal/story-CElO0kq0atolBWFEY6R9wO.html
16-12-2020||Chandigarh||In ‘ground-level feedback’ to high command, BJP’s Punjab unit stresses need to resolve farm stir soon||The BJP’s Punjab unit has conveyed to the party high command to make efforts to end the farmer agitation as soon as possible citing its repercussions on the state’s communal harmony. A delegation of leaders led by state BJP chief Ashwani Sharma and party affairs in-charge Dushyant Gautam met Union ministers Amit Shah (home), Rajnath Singh (defence), Narendra Singh Tomar (agriculture) and Piyush Goyal (industry and commerce) and provided them “ground-level feedback” about the protest in Punjab and its possible aftermaths, it was learnt.“We categorically told the home minister that communal atmosphere is getting vicious on the ground. Our topmost concern is the campaign run by pro-Khalistan elements who are hellbent on ruining the peaceful atmosphere of the state,” said a party general secretary.The delegation apprised Shah that the BJP has lost in perception among the Sikhs who now see the saffron outfit as their enemy. Discussions were also held on the role of some Punjabi singers in instigating the people against one community through their songs.The state leaders also accused the farmer leaders from Punjab of shifting their stands after reaching Delhi, it is learnt.“Discussions started between the farmers and the Union government only after the Punjab unit gave feedback that unions had reservations on certain provisions of the laws. The state unit was in a constant touch with the farmer leaders. But suddenly after reaching Delhi, these leaders started demanding complete repeal of the laws,” said Ashwani Sharma.A range of issues, including the attempts to disrupt the communal harmony in Punjab by certain elements in the garb of the agitation, was also discussed, he said. “We sat with each of the Union minister. They know who is doing what. We have requested them to find out solution to the issue as soon as possible,” said Sharma.All the state unit leaders are learnt to have blamed the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab for providing logistics to the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-ground-level-feedback-to-centre-punjab-bjp-stresses-need-to-resolve-stir-soon/story-OVY9nwch2VoGly2V9YAYEL.html
16-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: It’s a dog-love-cat world||More than 70 years after gaining their freedom, India and Pakistan are still hostile towards each other. But they aren’t the only countries with such a tradition. Turkey and Greece, too, continue to be mutually suspicious. As do Azerbaijan and Armenia. Some would argue the same about China and Japan, Russia and the US, Israel and Iran. And if, God forbid, you are on Twitter, you know that in this world everyone is against everyone.But away from all these conflicts, there is a lane beside Delhi’s Golcha Cinema (the single-screen closed long ago) where a stray dog and a stray cat are being best friends.This afternoon, the dog ambles towards the cat, who is lying on the pavement. Anticipating the dog’s approach, the cat doesn’t slink away, as cats are meant to do in such situations. Instead, the cat lies on the ground and looks at the dog, who starts pressing his nose playfully on the cat’s tummy. The cat gets up after a while, and gazes towards the dog. The dog returns the gaze, looking calm. Now the cat walks about in a circle and the dog follows the cat, as if they were playing a game.At no point does the dog bark, nor the cat mew.Nearby, a few diners enjoying lunch at Suvidha Shakahari, a pavement eatery, watch the marvellous sight in silent wonder. The eatery attendant confirms that the dog and the cat always hang out together, and that they surfaced in the area about a month ago.The dog has his tail missing, however. Can it be that these two creatures experienced cruelty or trauma in the past, and are finally finding affection in each other despite the fact that cats and dogs traditionally don’t co-exist harmoniously? The eatery attendant has no answer.Now the dog looks a little tired, and he crosses the lane to drink water from a pitcher kept just outside Clove :) Dental clinic by the local shopkeepers. Once his thirst quenched, the dog sits by a bowl filled with bones — again the doing of the kind shopkeepers. The cat sits in front of the dog and patiently watches his friend eat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-it-s-a-dog-love-cat-world/story-upYmaLyvtMkAIWYcAkGrMM.html

Classes are also being offered to the children who have come to the protest site along with their parents. The initiative was helmed by screenwriter Surmeet Maavi with the help of some young farmers. Maavi, who wrote the screenplay of the movie ‘Punjab 1984’ that won the 62nd National Film Award, has been at the site since the beginning of the agitation. The team has roped in volunteers to teach the kids. The classes are running for the last four days with nearly 90 students in attendance, they said. Kanwaljeet Kaur, who works with an Amritsar-based NGO, is leading the five-member team of volunteer tutors comprising professional teachers, activists, dentists and young farmers.The farmers are planning to extend the facility to more sites along the Kundli and Tikri borders. “We are focusing mainly on basic and activity-based education like painting and storytelling besides teaching as per the kids’ needs. Most students are from slums. We urge others to join us as the number of children is growing each day,” said Jassi Sangha, one of the volunteers.“Now we have got white boards, markers, sheets and other material needed for teaching and learning,” she added. Maavi said, “We are ready for a long haul against the government. These children are the future of this country. So, we want to invest in the country’s future by imparting education to them. We will continue to provide education to these children as long as the agitation is on.”Kanwaljeet Kaur, a teacher trainer, said, “In view of an increase in the number of students, we have divided classes into morning and evening batches. Presently, the classes are being conducted near ‘Jangi library’, but we are planning to shift the school near ‘Sahitak centre’ at the border.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/protesting-farmers-start-makeshift-school-for-underprivileged-children-at-kundli-border/story-ajo1s8nw2Gvns204sH8WdL.html

16-12-2020||City||Two Mansa docs, volunteers to set up medical camp at Tikri||Bathinda With the cold wave intensifying, a team of volunteers from Mansa, including two government doctors, have decided to hold a regular voluntary medical camp to assist farmers at the Tikri border in Delhi.Dr Vishavjeet Singh Khanda and Dr Arshdeep Singh, both posted at the Mansa civil hospital, said colleagues and friends had offered to donate to buy medicines and other logistics.They plan to check the health of protesting farmers, especially those with diabetes and hypertension. Volunteers have decided to take turns to visit the protest site from this week. They have opted for Tikri for its accessibility from Bathinda via Rohtak in Haryana.Khanda, an ayurvedic medical officer in Mansa, said he conducted a recce of the Tikri border with four others two weeks ago. Now, a group of 25-odd persons, including colleagues of Mansa civil hospital, will provide medical assistance to elderly villagers protesting against the contentious farm laws, he added.Khanda, who also has the charge of district covid surveillance officer, expressed concern that the gathering at Tikri needed to be monitored for those who were suspected to be infected with the coronavirus. “In August, Arshdeep and I was infected with coronavirus and were admitted at a super-speciality hospital in Gurugram. After recovering fully, we thought we must be socially resposible. We are procuring multivitamins, zinc tablets and facemasks for free distribution among farmers to boost their immunity,” said Kanda.“We spent three nights there, and attended to nearly 300 persons who had suffered minor injuries, during their journey to Delhi from villages in Punjab. With some protesters unable to get alcohol, something that they might be habituated to, complaints of indigestion were very frequent from a section of elderly persons,” he added.Arshdeep, who is a district epidemiologist in Mansa, said glucometer and thermal forehead thermometers were a must to monitor health of so many people.“Temperature has started hovering below 10°C and farmers are staying under temporary arrangements. They need constant medical support and back-up. Volunteers have held a meeting to chalk out their presence at the dharna site. Farmers are determined to ensure their demand is met, so we think it is our duty to be with them at such a critical time,” added Arshdeep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-mansa-docs-volunteers-to-set-up-medical-camp-at-tikri/story-ac5vHTsQMn4GMBcNagS70I.html

The accused, identified as Lakhbir Singh @ Lakha and Bachittar Singh, were arrested by Amritsar (Rural) police and further investigations are required to track their associates, including four drug smugglers currently lodged in Amrtisar Jail, said director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta on Tuesday. He said that one quadcopter drone with a full supporter stand and one SkyDroid T10 2.4GHz 10CH FHSS transmitter, along with mini receiver and camera support, have been seized, along with one .32 bore revolver and a Mahindra Scorpio SUV (HR-35M-3709), as well as some cartridges and drugs. The DGP said main suspect Lakhbir Singh of Chak Mishri Khan village was nabbed from near Gurdwara Tahla Sahib, Chattiwind, on Monday. During investigations, Lakhbir said he had procured the quadcopter drone from Delhi about four months ago and the drone was currently at the house of his associate Bachittar Singh at Guru Amardas Avenue, Amritsar. He said further investigations revealed that Lakhbir Singh was in close and frequent contact with four drug smugglers of Ajnala, who are currently lodged in Amritsar jail. A search in the prison led to the recovery of a touch smartphone from the possession of Lakhbir’s associate Surjit Masih, a drug smuggler. Lakhbir’s father is a sub-inspector (SI) in the Punjab Police. Assistant superintendent of police (ASP), Majitha, Abhimanyu Rana confirmed this and said he is posted in Chandigarh. Gupta said investigations show that Lakhbir had established an extensive communication network with foreign smugglers and entities, and was in close and frequent contact with a notorious Pakistan-based smuggler namely Chishti. “Chisthi is also in touch with Pakistan-based Khalistani operatives, and has been responsible for pushing consignments into India,” he added. He said Simranjit Singh, currently lodged in Amritsar jail, who persuaded Lakhbir to purchase a drone for cross-border smuggling of narcotics and weapons, had also been nominated as an accused in the case, said Gupta. An FIR has been registered against Lakhbir Singh and Bachittar Singh, Gurpinder Singh Khapar Kheri and some unidentified persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-bust-drone-module-engaged-in-drug-gun-smuggling-two-held/story-OsmeG5LQhvFAMYNKSWWKaJ.html

The lawmaker was scheduled to arrive at Damla and Khurdi villages to inaugurate community halls. However, the protesters reached before him and allegedly vandalised the site. “We protested against Saini’s presence in the village and inaugurated the halls before his arrival amid the presence of police force,” BKU district president Sanju Gudiana said. Saini, however, inaugurated the projects and reached several other villages in Radaur block. Later, the MP, along with former state minister Karndev Kamboj, addressed the locals. Saini claimed that the protests were instigated by the Congress. “I can’t call them farmers who disrupted the events in these two villages. This shows that the Congress has misguided the peasants about the farm laws. I addressed the farmers at another event and there is no doubt amongst them about these laws that are made to change the farming sector,” Saini said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-disrupt-kurukshetra-mp-s-event-in-yamunanagar/story-e82W7bdyyHDaEFWXNejjDL.html
16-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: How smartphones help Covid patients in hospital||The smartphones distributed by the civic body have helped at least 10,000 Covid-19 patients at jumbo centres and major hospitals as they could speak to their families daily, leading to faster recovery, according to the doctors. Fears of re-infection and feeling disconnected from their children are prime reasons for anxiety among patients, claim doctors. Till December 15, the civic body has distributed 200 smartphones to Covid-19 jumbo centres and all the four major hospitals. The civic body provides free calling services to patients. Also, these patients are given counselling through the smartphones. NESCO jumbo centre has tied up with an organisation called Prafulta that offer voluntary service. Sudhir Mehra, 44-year-old resident of Borivli, was diagnosed with Covid-19 on November 14. Soon, his 67-year-old diabetic mother, wife and son, too, tested positive. Considering his mother was above 50 years of age, she was hospitalised at the NESCO jumbo centre as a precautionary measure. But she would keep pleading with the doctors to discharge her as she was experiencing anxiety because of staying alone. When she started talking to her son on a daily basis on the phone, she became less aggressive and began to take the medicines. “I would talk to her twice daily. The doctors would call us and connect with my mother. She was too scared as she was staying alone. We used to counsel her on the phone which helped improve her health both mentally and physically,” said Mehra. “We have seen that patients who talk regularly with their family members show faster recovery. Along with physical health, we also have to look at the mental health of the patients,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. Mona Barbhaya, one of the counsellors, said patients often felt disconnected from their children. “We always try to understand the cause of anxiety among patients. For younger mothers, they worry about their children, so we suggest they get engaged with their children online including games. This helps elevate their mood,” said she. However, a section of the psychiatrists believes counselling through telecommunication is ineffective. Dr Vani Kulhalli, psychiatrist at Bandra-Kurla Complex jumbo centre, which has provided face-to-face counselling to over 4,000 patients, stated in an email response to HT that outsourcing mental health care to teleconsultation is not adequate. “We provide a complete range of treatments from acute delirium, stress management, psychiatric care, personal counselling and family support…(sic). This is the ideal method of providing mental health services at Covid-19 hospital. I would bring your attention to the case in Kerala where patient’s suicide couldn’t be prevented through teleconsultation,” she wrote in her email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-how-smartphones-help-covid-patients-in-hospital/story-kgBRWgUcOnITWJwit6umVO.html

A heritage walk was organised by a group of historians inviting BMC officials of the K West ward (Andheri) to inform them about the historic significance of the 61-metre monolith column.Historians shared some factual insights and the historic significance Gilbert Hill has which is known to be more than 66 million years old. The hill is said to be the one among three such monuments in the world and is a rare formation of thousands of hexagonal basalt columns, born of ancient volcanic lava.“The idea to invite BMC officials and politicians was to make them understand the rich history of this place. There are tons of places in the corners of this city that have historic significance. These places can be turned into tourist spots that could also generate employment and business for the locals there,” said Bharat Gothoskar, a city historian and founder of Khaki tours. The visit was organised under BMC’s ‘Know Your Neighbourhood’ initiative.Civic officials said that the trust of the famous Gaondevi Temple, located on the top of Gilbert Hill, will be involved in the upkeep of the hill.Vishwas Mote, assistant municipal commissioner of K West ward, said, “We will ensure public participation and upkeep by involving locals.”“I discussed with BMC officials to identify similar places that have a historic significance, located in and around Andheri-Juhu area that we could bring up as a model project. I requested the ward officers to prioritise cleaning. We can also focus on putting up boards and signages,” said Shiv Sena’s member of Parliament Priyanka Chaturvedi who also participated in the visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-plans-to-preserve-gilbert-hill-a-61-meter-monolith-column-at-andheri/story-aved8YhxlGzUep337pngRM.html
16-12-2020||Chandigarh||Addict enrolment jumped from 2.8L to 6L after virus outbreak: Punjab minister||The coronavirus pandemic, which has redefined the new normal across the world, is serendipitously responsible for bolstering drug addicts’ enrolment at outpatient opioid assisted treatment (OOAT) clinics so much so that the Punjab government has formulated a policy to open more psychiatric nursing homes and de-addiction centres across the state to tackle the patient influx. Health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, who was attending a World AIDS Day on the outskirts of the city in Dakha, said, “Before the Covid outbreak, enrolment at different centres across the state was 2.87 lakh, which has increased to 6 lakh.”Sidhu said, “In the wake of the increased patient enrolment, psychiatrists have been allowed to run pharmacies from clinics to facilitate counselling and treatment. A small set-up is enough to run a centre. It could be a small clinic with an attached room with beds.”To ensure detoxification drugs are not misused, private doctors have been asked to maintain a daily record of stock, bills and invoices. Nearly, 5.43 lakh drug abuse prevention officers (DAPOs) have already been registered, of which 88,710 are officials and 4,54,332 are private citizens, the minister added.Special secretary health and family welfare-cum-project director Punjab State AIDS Control Society (PSACS) Amit Kumar said that increasing incidence of drug abuse and drug-related HIV in Punjab was a matter of great concern. “The problem is grave as a large number of people are getting into the habit of drug use, particularly injectable pharmaceutical drugs,” he said. “It has been observed that the drug intake pattern has changed over the last four to five years. Drug users are shifting from oral to injecting mode that has resulted in increasing incidences drug-related HIV in the state,” he said.He said, “At present 35 opioid-substitution therapy (OST) centres are functional in 18 districts of the state. It has helped injecting drug users overcome their habit.” Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Kumar Bagga said parent-to-child transmission was preventable through prompt HIV testing and anti-retroviral treatment.On why there was increased enrolment after the outbreak, Bagga said, “ Enrolment surged at opioid substitution therapy (OST) centres amid the pandemic as the lockdown had led to serious paucity of drugs.” “Drug substitute medicines were only available at the government institutions. The number of patients seeking help with private psychiatrists and government institutions kept increasing after lockdown was lifted, which is a healthy trend,” said Dr Bagga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/addict-enrolment-jumped-from-2-8l-to-6l-after-virus-outbreak-punjab-minister/story-C41FElsF5El1lVpk1YljQN.html

Still, we cannot say that the situation is improving as there is no decline in the number of cases, but at the same time cases are not going up as well. In my view, we will have to wait for another one and half months (till January end) to come on to a conclusion,” said Dr Salunkhe, who is also a public health expert.

16-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park reopens for visitors after 9 months with strict Covid-19 guidelines||The Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in Borivli was reopened on Tuesday after a gap of nine months with strict guidelines in place and several activities still restricted.While tourists can enter the park from 8.30am to 6.30pm, attractions of the park such as the lion and tiger safari, mini train, boat rides over Dahisar River, and access to Vihar and Tulsi Lake areas will remain shut for tourists, according to SGNP guidelines. Also, Kanheri caves will not be accessible to visitors, as tourists are only allowed to go as far as the Trimurti Road Tumnipada gate. On Tuesday, around 300 people visited the park after its reopening. “There were around 28 two-wheelers, seven four-wheelers, and 70 cycles apart from morning walkers. There are approximately 3,000 morning walkers visiting the park daily. Thus, we have opened up additional routes in the tourism zone for morning walkers,” said G Mallikarjuna, director and conservator of forest, SGNP, adding that by next week they will take a call on opening up all areas of the park. “In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, we do not want to rush and take any risks and ensure citizens maintain a safe distance while coming to the park. We will be reviewing the situation carefully, and accordingly ease further restrictions in the future,” said G Mallikarjuna. The park had been shut since March 18 but was opened up for morning walkers from October 14 onwards.The guidelines further stated that private vehicles will not be allowed inside SGNP, and will need to be parked at a dedicated paid parking space near the main entrance at Borivali. “The facility of Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses have been provided at the entrance, which will ferry passengers to and for the park,” said Mallikarjuna.Meanwhile, the use of face masks and sanitisers is a must, and persons entering the park without masks will be denied entry, the guidelines said. “Those feeling unwell should avoid coming,” said Mallikarjuna adding that any person having symptoms associated with Covid-19 are requested to avoid entering the park and if they do, their details will be shared with the nearest Covid-19 centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-sanjay-gandhi-national-park-reopens-for-visitors-after-9-months-with-strict-covid-19-guidelines/story-GtYCTvSrovgHKD8riohjWP.html
16-12-2020||Chandigarh||Property tax default: 5 properties sealed on Day 2 of MC’s drive||The municipal corporation is tightening the noose around property tax defaulters who have either not paid their dues or attempted to evade tax by filing inaccurate tax returns. The properties of five such defaulters and evaders were sealed on the second day of the civic body’s drive on Tuesday. The Zone C team fined two property owners on GT Road ₹8 lakh. The officials said sealing notices had been served to the owners of around six properties to recover ₹31 lakh dues. In the meantime, the Zone B team sealed five commercial and industrial properties. Three of the properties were unsealed after they submitted ₹1.9 lakh with the civic body. Officials said a door-to-door survey was being conducted to identify defaulters. As part of the drive, officials are verifying the tax due and actual payments made. Superintendent, property tax, Vivek Verma, said, “As a lot of people submit incorrect information on their tax returns, a door-to-door survey has been initiated. Apart from their dues, evaders will have to pay 100% penalty on the same.” ₹59 crore recovered against ₹130 crore target So far, only ₹59 crore has been recovered against the annual recovery target of ₹130 crore. Over 80,000 property owners failed to pay the tax between 2014-15 to 2019-20. Last week, Zone B officials had served notices to 83 property owners and on December 14, six properties were sealed, following which owners of five properties submitted ₹2.7 lakh in dues. Zonal commissioner Swati Tiwana said action will also be taken against those who have failed to pay water and sewer charges.Verma said the MC teams were also cross checking payment of water and sewer charges during the door-to-door survey . The teams have so far caught three factories on GT road, whose owners had not applied for water-sewer connections, though the factories had been running for decades. Notices are being served to the owners. Civic body to use UID number The MC’s Zone D officials have decided to use unique identification (UID) numbers issued against the properties to identify defaulters. Officials will compare the number of properties with the UID number in an area with the actual number of properties against which tax is being paid. Superintendent Rajeev Bhardwaj said,”There are around 1.18 lakh properties in areas falling under Zone D, while tax is only being submitted against around 75,000 properties.”Bhardwaj said it is suspected that many of the properties may be exempted but the residents must pay ‘nil’ property tax returns in the case. Civic body to catch defaulters using UID numbers The MC’s Zone D officials have decided to commence a drive to catch defaulters using unique identification (UID) numbers issued against the properties.

The CCTV footage of the adjacent society showed the girl falling into the water tank.According to the police, Nikita Rajesh Sigh was playing inside the compound of an apartment at Sector 9 at around 8.30pm. All of a sudden, she went missing. Her father works as a security guard in that society and they stay in a room in the society compound.“Her parents looked for her in the entire neighbourhood but to no avail. Finally they approached us at night. We registered a kidnapping case following the guidelines of the government and had been looking for her since then,” said an officer from Rabale police station.“On Tuesday morning, a foul smell was emanating from the underground water tank of an adjacent apartment. Some residents of that building checked the tank and found the girl’s body in it,” he said.The girl’s body was handed over to her family after post-mortem was conducted at the NMMC hospital at Vashi.Yogesh Gawde, senior inspector of Rabale police station, said, “We are now investigating why the tank was open. If we find negligence on their part, they will face legal action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-5-days-on-2-year-old-found-dead-in-water-tank-in-airoli-building/story-WVSjfknakUYkuBekfb6mfL.html
16-12-2020||Mumbai||Act that provides for capping private hospital rates will be adopted soon in Maharashtra, says health minister||Almost a decade after the Central government enacted the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, the Maharashtra government has now said that it is serious on implementing the Act, which is aimed at streamlining healthcare services in the state. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the government will begin implementation of the Act, which provides for capping treatment rates in private hospitals, at the earliest.After the Central government enacted the Act in 2010 and notified it in 2012, 11 states and almost all union territories have adopted the law. States needs to have their own legislation as public health is a state subject. Tope said on Tuesday, “I have asked my department to convene the meeting immediately after the winter session. There were three committees appointed so far to deliberate on the adoption of the Act. We will study the reports of all these committees and take a decision for immediate implementation of the Act. It is true that had the Act been in place, the government would not have been compelled to invoke provisions in the Epidemic Diseases Act or the Disaster Management Act to cap the rates of treatment and procedures in the private hospitals.”According to state health officials , the adoption of the Act has been delayed because of resistance from the private sector. “Private sector practitioners and hospitals have been opposing the Act on two issues. They do not want rates for the treatment and surgeries to be fixed under the Act and have also opposed the compulsory condition of treating patients in emergency,” said an official.The Act has provision of registration and regulation of all clinical organisations — including therapeutic and diagnostic — with the view to prescribe minimum standards of facilities and services. The Act has guidelines specified for 227 diseases and hospitals are supposed to abide by minimum standards in terms of infrastructure, services, staff, equipment, among others. Technical committees appointed by the state at various levels decide charges for treatment of diseases and procedures. Health facilities are mandated to display charges for each procedure and facility to ensure that patients are well-informed before admissions.Meanwhile, private doctors have welcomed the move, but also warned that if the law is enforced without taking associations into confidence, they will protest against it.“The initiative will be beneficial to streamline health infrastructure. But it shouldn’t be used with the aim just to punish doctors. It shouldn’t turn into a draconian law, which will further discourage people from taking up medicine as a profession. In West Bengal, doctors are imprisoned directly based on this law. The law should focus on regulations without threatening doctors,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president, Association Medical Consultants (AMC). Activists have welcomed the move. Jeetendra Tandel, a health activist, said that at present hospitals aren’t covered under the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC). So, the apex regulating body can’t take any action against any hospital. “However, with this act, not only private hospitals but diagnostic centres, clinics, nursing homes will come under its umbrella. This will make them responsible for their patients,” he said.Despite repeated attempts, Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra branch, couldn’t be reached for a comment.

16-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai local trains for all: Railways, state prepare for services from early 2021||Railways have begun preparations to resume suburban train services for all from early 2021, officials said, attributing it to the recent decline in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai and neighbouring areas. However, officials said a decision will only be taken after completing discussions with the government.Mumbai’s suburban train services were suspended in March this year, under the coronavirus-enforced lockdown. From July 15, local trains resumed for those working in essential services, the specially abled and cancer patients. Women commuters and lawyers are also currently allowed to commute during stipulated time slots.Currently, Central Railway (CR) operates 1,580 local train services daily on its main, harbour and trans-harbour lines. The Western Railway (WR) operates 1,201 local trains. During normal operations, CR ran 1,774 services, while WR operated 1,367. “We are already operating local train services up to 90%. Discussions regarding operations of trains are on internally,” said a senior WR official.“There has not yet been any finalisation on resumption of train services for the general public. Discussions regarding this are going on. Only after complete discussion with the state government and following coronavirus protocols, local train services will be resumed.” said a senior CR official, who did not want to be named. Significantly, state’s minister for relief and rehabilitation Vijay Vadettiwar told the media that the state government was considering allowing suburban trains after December 31. Passenger associations have welcomed the move and have asked railway and state authorities to resume local train services in January with implementation of change in office timings.“Citizens are now fed up. They have to put in extra money from their pocket to travel to their workplace. Local train services should resume from January, but only after changing office timings. The earlier crowding during morning and evening rush hours cannot be repeated. Both the state and railways should work together and implement changes in office timings to avoid crowding.” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.The Railways has also started resuming phase-wise Automatic Ticket Vending Machines (ATVM) on its suburban railway stations to prevent crowding at ticket booking counters. Meanwhile, passengers who are travelling on outstation trains will soon be able to travel by local trains to commute in the city, on both CR and WR. The Maharashtra government on Tuesday asked both zonal railways to permit outstation train passengers that arrive in the city to travel by local trains and reach their final destination.Similarly, those passengers who will be travelling by outstation trains from the city will be allowed to travel by local trains and reach the train’s originating station.The railways have sent the request for approval to the railway board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-local-trains-for-all-railways-state-prepare-for-services-from-early-2021/story-gsXRt1nm4egTOG67pVkZJL.html
16-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cut-offs stay high in third list for FYJC||The cut-off percentages at prominent colleges in the city remained high even in the third merit list for admissions to first-year junior colleges (FYJC) which was declared on Tuesday. While cut-offs for the science stream saw a marginal dip, those for commerce and arts mostly remained the same or increased marginally. Of the 1.16 lakh applications, 45,402 students were allotted seats, with 6,179 students getting their first preference. Students who have been allotted seats in the round can secure their admissions online by December 18. Colleges can surrender the remaining seats under various quotas such as minority and management after completing the third round of admissions. In prominent science colleges, cut-offs for the stream saw a dip of up to two percentage points from the second list. Commerce and arts however, did not see a significant dip, with some colleges recording up to one percentage point rise. “There is hardly any difference in the cut-offs compared to the previous lists. It could be because more students scored well this year and the competition is tough. Also, some students who might have sought admissions in their respective boards like ICSE, CBSE for Class 11 or for diploma courses might not have withdrawn their seats in the portal,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of Jai Hind college, Churchgate. Several colleges did not release the third list on Tuesday as their seats were filled in the first two rounds. While RA Podar college in Matunga did not release a third list for commerce, same was the case with St Xavier’s at Dhobi Talao which had no list for arts. Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal of VG Vaze college, Mulund, said, “With students changing their college preferences, cut-offs might have remained the same or increased in some cases.” Colleges said they are now planning to start online classes soon. “We have already completed orientation for two batches of students and we will do one more round for the students who are admitted in the third and fourth rounds,” said Joshi. As per guidelines of the education department, colleges can start their academic year after completing 75% admissions. After the third admission round, over 2.04 lakh seats in the MMR are vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-cut-offs-stay-high-in-third-list-for-fyjc/story-kw7q6kd8nW7DzW1HMYvFEK.html
16-12-2020||Mumbai||Telugu poet P Varavara Rao’s stay at Nanavati Hospital extended till December 21 by Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday extended the interim order allowing 82-year-old Telugu poet P Varavara Rao, an accused in the Bhima Koregaon case, to be kept at Nanavati Hospital till the three petitions and appeals filed by Rao and his wife are heard on December 21. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik, while hearing the appeal of Rao against the rejection of his bail application on health grounds by the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court and the applications seeking permanent bail on health grounds and as per the guidelines issued by the high-power committee (HPC), was informed by additional solicitor-general Anil Singh on behalf of NIA that the investigating agency had a preliminary objection to the three petitions.Singh submitted that while the appeal against the special sessions court order has been served, and Rao was healthy again keeping the appeal pending would not serve any purpose, hence Rao should be sent back to Taloja jail. He further submitted that the application of Rao’s wife for shifting Rao to Nanavati Hospital and given proper bail was not following proper procedure, as she had directly approached the HC without first applying before the lower court. Responding to the objections, advocate Anand Grover and senior counsel Indira Jaising submitted that Rao was suffering from inherent ailments before his arrest and being kept at Yerwada jail and then at Taloja jail. The rejected application before the special NIA court was based on the apprehension that he could contract the Covid-19 and should be granted interim bail. However, after his application was rejected and he approached the HC, he was found to have contracted the virus. Though he was moved to Sir JJ Hospital, St George’s Hospital and then Nanavati Hospital, as per the HC order and received treatment, his condition was such that he needed constant medical care. This constant medical care was not available in the hospital attached to Taloja jail, nor did it have personnel or facilities to treat or oversee Rao’s condition, hence the applications and appeal for permanent bail should be allowed.Grover further submitted that Rao was not averse to standing trial and would not abscond, hence there was no harm in allowing bail, so that he may go home and be taken care of. “Rao has been tried in 24 cases in his lifetime and had been acquitted in all of them. He knows he had no role in the current case, hence he is willing to stand trial,” said Grover.Further referring to the HPC guidelines, he submitted that Rao was eligible for bail even though he was booked under the UAPA (Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act). After hearing the submissions, the court observed that the objections of Singh about Rao appearing directly before HC and seeking bail were valid as a Supreme Court judgement had permitted HCs to hear interim and bail applications when article 226 or 482 were invoked. The court, however, added that it would want to hear the arguments of NIA and the state against the application by Rao and his wife P Hemlatha before passing orders, hence posted hearing for Monday. When the court sought to know the current health status, it was informed that there was no new report submitted by Nanavati Hospital, hence it would have to go by the report submitted in the earlier hearing. The court accepted the same and said that the earlier interim order of letting Rao be in Nanavati Hospital and the state or NIA would not discharge him without informing the court would continue till Monday, December 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/telugu-poet-p-varavara-rao-s-stay-at-nanavati-hospital-extended-till-december-21-by-bombay-hc/story-yvqmsQxXpOKCcLn2zLvpcI.html

16-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: 24-year-old rape accused who escaped from custody in 2019 arrested from West Bengal||A 24-year-old rape accused, who had escaped from police custody in 2019, was arrested by Colaba police from a village in West Bengal, on Monday. Colaba police officers who got an intelligence input stating the accused was planning to escape to Bangladesh, stayed in the village disguised as locals for four days before arresting the accused. Shivaji Fadtare, a senior police inspector, said that the accused Mohammed Badshah Salim Shaikh was arrested by the Antop Hill police for raping a minor girl and was charged under sections of the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children against Sexual Offenses Act (Pocso). Shaikh, however, had escaped from the court premises in February 2019, as he was being produced before it, following which a case was registered at Colaba police station. After the high court order of arresting all absconding accused, the Colaba police initiated contact with police officers of Pandua town of Hooghly district in West Bengal, but could not find Shaikh in his village. In November 2020, police officers received information that Shaikh had gone to his village to meet his relatives. “A team of officers left from West Bengal immediately, but before they could reach his house, Shaikh’s relatives helped him escape,” said a police officer. The team of officers then stayed in Shaikh’s neighbourhood disguised as locals, waiting for Shaikh to show up. On Sunday, the police officers learnt that Shaikh was returning to his house to take some money to cross the border and to get to Bangladesh. “Our officers laid a trap near Shaikh’s house and arrested him when he went to his house,” said Fadtare. Shaikh will be produced before a court tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-24-year-old-rape-accused-who-escaped-from-custody-in-2019-arrested-from-west-bengal/story-EkihJu2sSmIBR7pk70iDmI.html

Subsequently, the two were arrested for obtaining narcotic substances from a Nigerian national.Prasad was arrested on September 26 by NCB in the Rajput case. During the investigation, NCB discovered a connection between Prasad and the Nigerian national for the supply of cocaine. NCB took his custody in the said case in November. After taking custody of Prasad, the next day the bureau took custody of Demetriades in the same case.Demetriades’s lawyer Kushal Mor argued that the only evidence available against him were statements of the co-accused, which, given the recent landmark ruling of the Supreme Court (SC), decided that statements made to NCB officers were not admissible. Prasad’s lawyer used the same argument while seeking bail.The two had already been granted bail in the case linked to Rajput. However, after obtaining bail in the second case, they will be released from prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/narcotics-case-mumbai-s-ndps-court-grants-agisialos-demetriades-and-kshitij-prasad-bail/story-ubnDxm4m51oBvJq2E0kbQK.html
16-12-2020||Chandigarh||Date for admission of EWS candidates in Chandigarh schools extended to January 31||Due to holdup in getting income certificates and the last date of admissions for entrance classes being December 16, the education department has taken a call to extend the last date for students of the economically weaker sections (EWS) upto January 31.Director school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “The last date for EWS admissions has been extended to January 31. The last date for general admissions, however, will remain December 16.” Brar had earlier said that EWS students could be adjusted later when the admission schedule for private recognised schools was announced.For EWS admissions, an income certificate issued by the office of the deputy commissioner and attested by the concerned SDM of the area needs to be supplied. The annual income of the family of an EWS candidate needs to be less than ₹1.5 lakh as per the Right to Education Act.The admission of anyone who supplies fake information is terminated and a case can also be registered against the parents.DC Mandip Singh Brar confirmed that the administration had started issuing income certificates. “On receipt of the letter regarding EWS admissions from the education department, we started issuing income certificates from Monday this week and will finish it in a time-bound manner.”Some schools have already given students some room when it comes to income certificates. Director of Strawberry Fields High School in Sector 26, Atul Khanna, said, “In cases where EWS students weren’t able to procure income certificates, we asked them to give an undertaking that they will supply the same at the time of admission when we hold a special draw of lots.”Meeting of private schools, education authorities inconclusiveMeanwhile, the Independent Schools Association (ISA) held a meeting with the UT education department officials regarding EWS admissions, but the meeting remained inconclusive. President of ISA, HS Mamik, said, “Before we provide seats to EWS students, the government schools must first try to adjust them within their own schools. They need to reimburse us for EWS admissions going back nine years. Mapping of the children needs to be done and proper documents need to be supplied to make sure that the student applying really qualifies for the EWS quota.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/date-for-admission-of-ews-candidates-in-chandigarh-schools-extended-to-january-31/story-G9tCR4JCmoBYCEzNKMG3yJ.html
16-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC frees man convicted for raping six-year-old||Bombay high court (HC) on Monday set free a 29-year-old Dahisar resident who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping and raping a six-year-old girl in August 2014, at Kandivli.The bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik found it unsafe to convict the accused solely based on the survivor’s testimony, after noticing contradictions in her evidence.“We find that the evidence of PW-5 (survivor) creates a doubt regarding the identity of the accused,” said the bench. “In these circumstances, it would be highly unsafe to convict the appellant solely based on the testimony of the victim,” it added.The 29-year-old was accused of raping the minor and then brutally thrusting a broom in her private parts. The incident, according to police, took place in wee hours of August 20, 2014, when the girl was sleeping with her mother, a destitute, outside a temple in Kandivli, (West).In the morning, when the mother woke up, she found her daughter missing. Later, she was shocked to find her daughter crying in a neighbouring lane, with a broom thrust in her private parts, resulting in bleeding injuries.The girl was taken to a civic hospital where medical examination revealed that she was raped and sodomised by the culprit, before inserting the broom in her private parts.The accused was arrested in connection with the crime, primarily on the suspicion of the survivor’s mother, who claimed he was following them for a few days before the incident and had also tried to initiate a dialogue with her.He was tried for the heinous crime. The prosecution examined 11 witnesses and relied on 30 documents to bring home his guilt. A special court under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, accepted the prosecution evidence and convicted the man for the crime, primarily based on the survivor’s testimony, and had sentenced him to life imprisonment.He had moved in appeal before HC where advocate Tanveer Khan argued on his behalf that it was unsafe to convict the Dahisar resident based on available evidence, especially, as DNA fingerprinting had ruled out his complicity in the crime.Additional public prosecutor Dr FR Shaikh, on the other hand, supported the conviction. He asserted that the findings recorded by the trial court were based on correct appreciation of evidence on record and did not call for any interference by HC.HC, however, refused to accept the prosecutor’s argument, noticing that the survivor’s testimony was inconsistent with regards to the identity of the accused.The bench noted that when the accused was shown to the survivor in the trial court, she identified him as a friend of her father. She said he used to come to meet her father and, therefore she knew him well. However, in cross-examination, she claimed that she had not seen him before the incident. Besides, her mother had also revealed his name to police as “Anand” and this, the court said, adds to serious doubt about his identity.Besides, the bench noted that there was no corroboration in the form of medical or forensic evidence. On the contrary, the DNA of the swabs found on the clothes of the survivor did not match with that of the accused, and thus had ruled out his complicity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-frees-man-convicted-for-raping-six-year-old/story-ggdTxuAvGxZfpkUUWJM2uI.html
16-12-2020||Mumbai||Hema Upadhyay-Haresh Bhambani murder case: Father of accused given last chance to bring tempo before court||The sessions court on Tuesday granted Ramadhar Sukhai Rajbhar, father of Vijay Rajbhar, one of the accused in Hema Upadhyay-Haresh Bhambani murder case, a final chance to produce before the court either the tempo used in the crime or photos of it. Artist Upadhyay and her lawyer Bhambani were allegedly smothered with a chloroform-laced cloth at absconding co-accused Vidhyadhar Rajbhar’s warehouse on December 11, 2015. The killers packed their bodies in cardboard boxes and dumped them in a Kandivli sewer. The prosecution has alleged that Vijay’s tempo was used to transport the dead bodies. During the investigation, police seized the tempo in front of independent witnesses. On October 21, 2016, Vijay’s father Ramadhar was allowed to take custody of the tempo. However, when the court asked Ramadhar to produce the tempo, he could not and said that it had been sold by Vijay’s wife. After the submission, Ramadhar also failed to appear before the court for subsequent hearings. The court had issued a bailable warrant against him. Earlier this month, Ramadhar appeared before the court, and the warrant against him was cancelled. He had assured the court that he would bring the tempo or its pictures before the court. On Tuesday, when the case came up for hearing, Ramadhar could not bring tempo or get its pictures. Hence, the court has now given him a final chance to provide the same. Meanwhile, special public prosecutor Vaibhav Baghade examined a close aide of Vidhyadhar who had accompanied him to Bengaluru in August 2016 to buy chloroform. “The witness has identified Vijay as the person working with Vidhyadhar,” Baghade said. As per the prosecution’s case, the accused had conspired to first sedate the victims with chloroform before killing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hema-upadhyay-haresh-bhambani-murder-case-father-of-accused-given-last-chance-to-bring-tempo-before-court/story-u9CCK8A3PbmbWgp5hPsNMO.html
16-12-2020||Mumbai||No coercive action against Republic TV editor, employees till Wednesday: Maharashtra government to Bombay HC||Following an assurance by the state and Mumbai Police that they would not take any coercive action against the editor-in-chief of Republic TV Arnab Goswami and other employees of the channel till Wednesday, the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday said it would hear applications seeking quashing of the first information report (FIR) and charge-sheet filed against Goswami and the applications filed by the Hansa group on Wednesday.While hearing the applications and petitions filed in the TRP (television rating points) manipulation case by Republic TV, Arnab Goswami and others, the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik was informed by senior counsel Aabad Ponda that they were apprehensive of Mumbai Police arresting Goswami and other employees of Republic TV, and hence sought an interim order restraining the Mumbai Police from doing so.Ponda further said that as per clause 12 of the charge-sheet, the form 5(c) filed by the police seeking to arrest any employee of Republic TV was not valid as the Supreme Court had deemed the said form illegal.However, chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare opposed the submissions and said that the channel could not seek a blanket order to restrain the police from arresting any of their employees. He further said that the demand of the channel was not valid as the persons from the channel who Mumbai Police intended to arrest were not parties in the petitions, hence the court could not grant them any relief.However, Ponda drew the attention of the court to the charge-sheet filed by the police wherein apart from the name of the channel and editor-in-chief, it also mentioned ‘sambhandit vyakti’ (other employees). As the application sought quashing of the charge-sheet and FIR, all employees of the channel were a party in the application. Ponda further added that it was informed that Mumbai Police had reached Delhi to arrest Goswami and hence, there was an urgent need for the court to issue a restraining order till both sides had argued.Thakare, however, sought time and said that as senior counsel Kapil Sibal was not available till January, Ponda’s contentions could not be allowed as they would hamper investigations.After hearing both sides, the bench observed that it would hear the matter through a virtual hearing on Wednesday and Sibal could also appear. The court then asked Thakare to take instructions as to whether the police would restrain from taking any coercive steps against the employees of Republic TV till Wednesday. After Thakare confirmed the same, the court posted the applications for Wednesday to be heard through virtual hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-coercive-action-against-republic-tv-editor-employees-till-wednesday-maharashtra-government-to-bombay-hc/story-oOGxPapFdEsKSyD6qKT25H.html

16-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray hits back at BJP, says central agencies are being used as ‘servants’||In response to the attack by the Opposition over various issues and political cornering, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying that central investigating agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) are being used like “domestic servants” out of political perversion. Thackeray also appealed to the BJP not to play politics over development projects like the Metro car shed and act “in the interest of people of the state”.The second and concluding day of the two-day winter session of the state legislature saw verbal exchanges between treasury and opposition benches over various matters including farmers’ issues, Maratha reservation, action against Kangana Ranaut and Arnab Goswami, Metro car shed at Kanjurmarg and handling of the Covid-19 pandemic among others. Besides the allegations of corruptions in various schemes including Covid-19 related projects, BJP leaders Devendra Fadnavis, Sudhir Mungantiwar, Ashish Shelar and Chandrakant Patil also cornered the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government with political potshots.CM Thackeray tried to turn the tables on the BJP, and said that the central investigating agencies were being used like “domestic servants”, and their “self-respect” is being crushed. “Opposition has been talking about the undeclared emergency in the state, citing examples of the actions against their loved ones [Kangana Ranaut and Arnab Goswami], but what about the verbal attack on the protesting farmers? The farmers protesting at the borders of Delhi against farm laws have been termed as anti-nationals, terrorists and alleged to be getting assistance from China and Pakistan. Is it our culture and is it not a declared emergency? Action against our legislator Pratak Sarnaik by ED for moving breach of privilege against your loved ones [Ranaut and Goswami] is a misuse of power. Why are the central agencies being used as the servants in the houses of the ruling party,” he questioned.The CM said that the state government would not tolerate such attempts to suppress them. Thackeray also appealed to the Opposition to treat the state’s interest over politics while dealing with key projects like the Metro car shed. “The issue of the car shed is in the court, where its fate will be decided, but you [Opposition] should not play spoilsports by raising non-issues. You [Fadnavis] have been talking about the court remarks, but the same high court has stated that ‘the ownership of the land is not important, but ownership of the project is key’. The project belongs to the people of Maharashtra and nobody should stand against it. We are not opposing central projects like the bullet train or Wadhwan port despite the fact that they are not in the interest of the people of Maharashtra and being pushed through by the Centre. Ultimately, development is important, but we will not let it happen at the cost of the environment,” he said.Before Thackeray, his other cabinet colleagues replied to the allegations levelled by the Opposition over schemes being implemented by the state government. Opposition had accused the MVA government of mishandling the reservation issue. Public works department minister Ashok Chavan, who also heads the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, questioned why the previous Fadnavis-led government failed to make the law full-proof, which would have stood legal scrutiny in the Supreme Court (SC). He also questioned why the Fadnavis government had not tried to put the Maratha reservation in schedule 9 of the Indian Constitution on the lines of the reservation given in Tamil Nadu to safeguard it. Chavan said that the SC, while staying the Maratha reservation, has pointed at the state backward commission’s report which was prepared during the Fadnavis government.“The issue is very close to the hearts of the people in Maharashtra. Instead of indulging in politics over the issue, ruling and opposition parties need to put in efforts to ensure that the Marathas get their reservation back. The Apex court has asked the Central government to clarify its stand on reservations in various states. We should all approach the Centre with the request to take a positive approach regarding Maratha reservation,” Chavan said while replying to the debate on supplementary demands.Thackeray added that some anti-social elements were purposely spreading confusion over the reservation issue through lies that the quota to Marathas will affect the reservation to other backward classes (OBCs). “It is my word as a chief minister, that not a single percent of the reservation to the OBCs will be affected,” he said.Addressing allegations of corruption in the Covid-19 schemes, deputy CM Ajit Pawar said that there was no substance in the allegations of corruption in the erection of Covid care centres and procurement of medicines. “The allegations about the expenditure of ₹90 crore on the repair and renovation of the ministers’ bungalows too is baseless. We have spent only ₹17.88 crore, and the outstanding of ₹20 crore is against repairs and renovations done during the Fadnavis government,” he said.State health minister Rajesh Tope, while replying to allegations by the Opposition that the Covid-19 pandemic was mishandled by the MVA government, said that the state’s growth, mortality and positivity rates have dropped significantly. “In terms of these key parameters, Maharashtra is not even among the top 14 states identified by the Centre. Our weekly growth rate has dropped to 0.21%, while the doubling rate has improved to 323 days. Maharashtra is the only state to reduce the cost of the RT-PCR test five times and cap prices of masks. We have brought the minimum RT-PCR test cost to ₹780 from ₹890,” he said.Thackeray said that the Opposition was targeting the MVA government for political reasons. “We have been handling the pandemic very carefully. Our Dharavi model and transparency were appreciated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and newspapers like the Washington Post. Our death rate is high, perhaps because we did not hide anything. It was our stand to maintain transparency as we wanted to handle the pandemic honestly. I do not know if this transparency is being maintained by other states,” he said.Thackeray also announced a scheme for the preservation of ancient temples in the state. He said that adequate budgetary allocation will be done for the development, restoration, upkeep of these temples. Thackeray said that the development plan would include facilities for pilgrims, renovation of structures and cleanliness around the premises. “This proves that we have not given up our Hindutva,” Thackeray said after the announcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-hits-back-at-bjp-says-central-agencies-are-being-used-as-servants/story-g2kdX6eYud8muHiWuRUfWN.html
16-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Council passes proposal to not respond to court notice, summons over Arnab Goswami breach of privilege proceedings||Maharashtra Legislative Council unanimously passed a proposal on Tuesday to not take cognisance of any notice or summons issued by high court or Supreme Court if Republic TV’s managing director and editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami challenges the breach of privilege proceedings initiated against him by the Upper House of the state Legislature. The pre-emptive move came after Goswami moved SC in September, urging it to issue a notice to Maharashtra Assembly speaker to clarify stand on the claim of a House official who said he sent a letter to the journalist in a matter of alleged breach of privilege motion at the Speaker’s direction. Breach of privilege motions have been moved against Goswami separately in both Houses of Maharashtra Legislature. Shiv Sena legislator Manisha Kayande had moved a breach of privilege motion against Goswami on September 8 in the legislative Council.On Tuesday, Council chairman Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar said no response should be given to the notices, summons and any other correspondence by Goswami through his lawyers. Nimbalkar said Goswami challenged the privilege motion moved by the Assembly in SC. “In this background, the possibility of Goswami challenging the breach of privilege motion of Legislative Council in SC cannot be ruled out. If Goswami challenges the breach of privilege motion raised in Council in high court or Supreme Court, then, with all due respect to the HC and SC, no response should be given to the notices, summons and any other correspondence by Goswami through his lawyers as per the provisions of the Article 194 and 212 of the Constitution to maintain the sovereign position of the Legislature,” the chairman said.Moving a proposal to this effect, Nimbalkar said responding to the notices would mean the judiciary can keep a check on the legislature and that would be inconsistent with the “basic structure of the Constitution”. The chairman said earlier the Council had passed a similar proposal to not respond to HC or SC in a particular case in 2010. “So, if Goswami challenges motion in HC and SC through a writ petition, then the Council Chairman, chief of privilege committee, members of the House, secretaries and other officials should not give any response to correspondence by the court and also should not appear in HC and SC,” he said.According to Nimbalkar, if Goswami challenges the proceeding in courts, then the legislature secretariat must communicate the “legislature’s functioning and well-established customs and traditions to the minister for Parliamentary affairs and Advocate General to bring it to the notice of SC.”The SC on November 6 had issued a show-cause notice to an assistant secretary of Maharashtra legislative Assembly, asking him to explain why contempt proceedings should be not initiated against him for his letter to Goswami which seems to “intimidate” him for approaching the Apex Court on the issue of alleged breach of privilege motion.HT made several attempts to contact leader of Opposition in the Council Pravin Darekar, but he was unavailable for a comment. Darekar had not responded to messages till the time of going to print.Pune-based constitutional expert Ulhas Bapat said that move by the Chairman is in line with the powers that rest with him. “The position is very clear, if a notice is issued to an individual, he or she has to respond. Under the separation of powers, members of the legislature are only responsible to the Chairman [of legislative Council] or the Speaker [of legislative Assembly]. They, anyway, cannot respond to notices issued unless permitted [by them]... We are a Parliamentary democracy in the state as well. Legislature is supreme as far as the administration is concerned. Entire power rests with the Speaker or the Chairman. The staff is under the Chairman and Speakers. Whatever position Nimbalkar has taken is correct,” Bapat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-council-passes-proposal-to-not-respond-to-court-notice-summons-over-arnab-goswami-breach-of-privilege-proceedings/story-4Tj4absJmn7izeqEu8ih7M.html

16-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government refers Shakti bill to panel of legislators after Opposition, women’s rights activists raise objections||The Maharashtra government on Tuesday sent the Shakti bill that aimed to increase the penalty for crimes against women and children to a joint select committee for review, after members of the opposition and several women’s rights activists opposed sections of it.Members of the opposition Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) demanded a thorough discussion on the provisions of the bill, which they said would have far-reaching ramifications. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis moved the motion demanding the bill be sent to a joint select committee. “This is an important bill and it needs to be deliberated upon at length. It will lose its effectiveness if passed in haste. Since the detailed discussion was not possible in this session due to curtailment of the duration, we demanded the bill to be sent to joint select committee, or else table it in the next session. The state government has not taken us into confidence on such key bills,” said Fadnavis.More than 90 women’s rights groups, activists, lawyers and academics wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last week stating that the newly introduced law would “completely deny women any hope of justice” and sought “a larger consultation with activists, lawyers and academicians who are working on these issues”.Accepting the demand, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said, “The joint select commitee will have 15 members from the Assembly and six from the council and will conduct meetings to review the bills over next two months. We will try to accommodate maximum women members in the committee. The bill will be reintroduced in budget session in February-March after the review by the committee.” The Maharashtra Legislative Council also gave its approval to refer the draft bill to committee on Tuesday. The committee comprising 21 legislators of both houses is expected to submit a report on it.In its current version, the bill provides for the death penalty for rape and gang rape and penetrative sexual assault against women and children, and introduces an amendment to Section 375 to allow for the presumption of consent, which goes against the clarity provided by the central law.On Monday, the state home minister Anil Deshmukh tabled the Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 2020, and the Maharashtra Exclusive Special Courts (for certain offences against women and children under Shakti law) Act, 2020, which propose amendments to criminal laws in the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act), and seek the establishment of special trial courts to fast track such cases.The bills hike the punishment for certain crimes to death penalty and fines to up to Rs 10 lakh. They also make it mandatory to complete the investigation and file a charge sheet within 15 days as well as complete the trial within 30 days of filing the charge sheet.Once passed, the bills will also require the Centre’s nod. The bills were drafted by the home department after forming a committee of police officials, studying the Andhra Pradesh Disha Act passed in February. A team of the government and police officials led by Dehsmukh visited Andhra Pradesh last year, and a cabinet sub-committee of senior ministers deliberated upon the draft prepared by the home department before both bills were tabled in the legislature earlier this week.Veena Gowda, a women’s rights lawyer said, “We really appreciate the fact that the government has referred it to the joint committee. We believe this bill needs a lot more deliberation and debate. We are opposed to bringing in the presumption of consent, providing punishment for false complaints, and introducing the death penalty… [These] do not stand the test of constitutionality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-refers-shakti-bill-to-panel-of-legislators-after-opposition-women-s-rights-activists-raise-objections/story-wPfS4JlGwFiVgpk4hW7ryJ.html
16-12-2020||Chandigarh||₹8cr to light up tracks, ₹50 lakh to repair them to promote cycling in Chandigarh||Laying out new cycle tracks, repairing damaged ones and lighting up dark areas: The UT engineering department is gearing up to complete pending projects to motivate more people to take to bicycling even as the public bicycle sharing project was rolled out here on December 10.Unlit tracks will be lit up at a cost of more than Rs 8 crore and the entire track network across the city overhauled at a cost of more than Rs 50 lakh. New tracks will be laid out at a cost of around Rs 37 lakh. “While nearly 200 km of cycle tracks have been created in the city, there are some patches where the distinctive tracks are yet to be created. We are now planning to fill in these gaps. We have invited tenders for the construction of cycle tracks of paver blocks from junction 63 to junction 53 (from the direction of Sector 47C); and metalled road from junction 53 to junction 38 (from the direction of sector 31 B and C) along Purv Marg,” said a senior department official. 6,000 streetlight polesActing on people’s complaints that some areas are not well lit at night, installation work of nearly 6,500 street light poles has started along some tracks. “The work will be completed in another month and a half. The stretch leading to the Sector 42 lake has already been covered and speeded up elsewhere. Poles are being erected alongside a cycle track near Sector 19,”said the official. Lights of low intensity will cover the tracks but not disturb people in the neighbourhood, he added.Repair and design fixesAs complaints have come in from cyclists about poor design of tracks, and damages, the department will overhaul these too, and complete the work in a month’s time. “For this, work has been divided in zones. In zone 1, repair of Rs 22 lakh will be taken up, while in the zone 2, the department will spend another Rs 28 lakh to repair the track and correct the designing elements. This will also make the tracks much safer,” the official said. About 140 stands for 250 bicycles will be built from sectors 6 to 36 and in different parts of the city including Rock Garden, prominent markets, etc. “We have already installed a cycle stand at Sukhna Lake which can accommodate around 250 cycles at a time,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/8cr-to-light-up-tracks-50-lakh-to-repair-them-to-promote-cycling-in-chandigarh/story-Yl72RyGZnlE4PhfOhwMFXO.html
16-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi airport’s cargo terminal puts in place a cold chain network to handle Covid-19 vaccine||Cargo terminals equipped with special temperature controlled areas, sufficient availability of cool dollies on the airside (where an aircraft lands), and dedicated loading areas along with entry and exit gates for smooth flow of vehicles -- the authorities at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) said they are all set to receive, store and transport the Covid-19 vaccines as soon as they become available in India.Officials aware of the development told Hindustan Times that the Delhi airport’s two integrated cargo terminals, which have an annual cargo handling capacity of 1.8 million metric tonnes, have been equipped with temperature-controlled chambers that can maintain temperatures from 25°C to -20°C. This will help in storing the vaccines at the optimum temperature at the airport, for further transport to other parts of the country, said one of the officials, on condition of anonymity.Also Read| India bucking global trend but must keep its guard up in Covid fight: OfficialsFurther, both cargo terminals have been provided with an adequate number of charging points to handle these temperature-controlled containers.The official quoted above said that they have cooled dollies -- specifically designed containers with a closed temperature controlled system -- for the movement of the temperature sensitive vaccines to the special chambers at the terminals for storage as soon as they arrive on the airside. The same dollies will be used to load the vaccines onto an aircraft for further transport to other parts of the country. “This will ensure an unbroken cold chain, which will be maintained at all times,” the official said.Delhi airport has also set up a dedicated “transshipment excellence centre”, spread over an area of 6,500 square metres on the airside, for convenient and efficient movement of transshipment cargo. “This facility will help in fast movement of vaccines through transshipment,” a second official said.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage In order to ensure the seamless transportation of the vaccine out of the airport by road, separate dedicated gates have been set up at the cargo terminals for fast movement of vehicles carrying the Covid-19 vaccines. “There is a truck slot management system at the cargo terminals, where a pre-booking facility will be available for trucks to make the process smooth. The newly launched “QR code-based e-gate pass facility” for delivery of vaccines will also be in use, thereby making the documentation process automated, and reducing human interface,” the second official added.Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), which runs IGIA, said because the airport has the best air connectivity to other parts of the country, it will play a critical role as a transshipment hub. “We are also working with other stakeholders in the supply chain, including pharma companies, airlines, temperature controlled facility suppliers and with the temperature controlled transport service providers, to ensure an efficient, reliable and uninterrupted service to the people of India,” a DIAL spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-airport-s-cargo-terminal-puts-in-place-a-cold-chain-network-to-handle-covid-19-vaccine/story-wFSkjritQwO7bvHpOfxBDM.html
16-12-2020||Delhi||On bone-chilling night, farmers huddle under tarpaulins and plastic sheets to stay warm||With traditional braziers lit using wood, copious amounts of tea and fistful of almonds, farmers protesting at Delhi’s Singhu border huddled among the mattresses stacked against the wheels of trolley, and layers of tarpaulin and plastic sheets spread out over the 6km-long protest site to brave the coldest night of the season so far.On Tuesday, the minimum temperature in Delhi dipped to 4.1 degrees Celsius, 4 notches below normal. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the minimum temperature is expected to remain below normal throughout week, with the minimum temperature ranging between 4 and 7 degrees Celsius. The effect of the biting cold was quite visible at the protest site in Singhu on Tuesday. Out came blankets, plastic sheets, and empty fertilizer bags, stitched together to form makeshift curtains that covered the tractor-trolleys, which have been converted into temporary farmer homes. Usually, these “curtains” are lifted in the morning. Those who were unable to catch some shut-eye at night due to the cold were seen dozing inside the trolleys during the day. Several non-government organisations (NGOs) workers and even langars (community kitchens) also distributed almonds among farmers on Tuesday.Gurtej Singh, 26, a young farmer from Jatana Kalan village in Mansa district of Punjab, said youngsters mostly slept under the tractor-trolleys while the elderly slept inside. “We tied multiple layers of plastic and tarpaulin sheets around the trolleys to keep the cold away. While one end of the trolley is lined with mattresses, the open end was covered with plastic sheets that acted like a thick curtain to keep the draught out,” he said.But sleeping on the road when the temperature is just 4 degrees Celsius, he says, was by no means easy. “We had stacked mattresses on both sides of the trolley and used two blankets. Since the langars are open till 2am, we kept sipping on hot tea and warm water,” Singh said.Amninder Singh, 26, another young farmer from Raikot in Ludhiana district, said, “Tea is the Indian antidote to the chilly weather. We also made bonfires at various places and set up chairs around them so that those feeling too cold could warm themselves. Many also slept in cars or night shelters set up by the NGOs.”Several farmers, a few of them elderly, slept in temporary makeshift structures erected using bamboo and tarpaulin sheets beside their trucks. Jaspal Singh, 70, a resident of Kalour village in Fatehgarh Sahib district of Punjab, was among those who sheltered thus. He slept on the road with at least five others of his family with nothing but a tarpaulin covering them from all sides.“Farmers are used to harsh weather. While waiting for our turn at sugarcane factories, we spend our nights out in the cold. Here, we at least have mattresses, foam, blankets, and a space to lie down. I don’t sleep inside the tractor because a lot of men from our village sleep more comfortably inside. We have been eating things like almonds and jaggery to keep our bodies warm,” he said.Security personnel stationed at the barricades also had to brave the cold night with just braziers for company. Two enclosures have also been created for personnel as a protection against the chill.“We only have our jackets and the iron braziers to fight the cold. We stayed up all night having tea made by either our own people or farmers,” said a police personnel, requesting anonymity.Additional deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Jitendra Kumar Meena said two waterproof tents have been pitched at Singhu border for security personnel. “Another tent is being placed towards the rear of the protest venue. Apart from the tents, we have arranged braziers for the personnel to use at night. We have also installed a public address system that has a reach of nearly two kilometres to address personnel deployed at the protest venue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/on-bone-chilling-night-farmers-huddle-under-tarpaulins-and-plastic-sheets-to-stay-warm/story-2XuKNu2oLuPyip4B2CYa9H.html
16-12-2020||Delhi||Days after reopening, Chilla border to be blocked today||Two days after protesting farmers cleared the blockade at Chilla (Delhi-Noida link road) border, another faction of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) called BKU(A) on Tuesday announced that they will “completely block the Chilla border” on Wednesday to press their demands for repealing the three farm laws.BKU(A) national president Rishipal Ambawata said that they would block the road at 11am on Wednesday. “We will block the Chilla border again at 11am tomorrow [Wednesday] and press for our demands,” Ambawata said on Tuesday while addressing a press conference at the Singhu border.The announcement has prompted the police to revise their security arrangements at the border and plan the deployment of security and traffic personnel on alternate routes through which traffic between Delhi and Noida will be diverted if the blockade takes place.Also Read: Farm unions slam Centre, say govt lacks sympathy“We are coordinating with our counterparts in Uttar Pradesh (Noida) Police and discussing the matter. Our deployment at the border is still in place. If required, security arrangements will be beefed up and the traffic may be diverted onto alternative routes,” said joint commissioner of police (eastern range) Alok Kumar.The call for a complete blockade of the Chilla border came on a day when nearly 100 farmers in cars arrived from Noida and tried to march towards Delhi through the carriageway that had been cleared on Sunday morning.Security personnel from Delhi and Noida police immediately responded to the situation and blocked the road using iron barricades and deployment of personnel, leading to a traffic jam. However, senior police officers had a quick discussion with the farmers and convinced them not to block the traffic. After nearly 10 minutes, the barricades were removed and traffic was restored. The protesters parked their vehicles and sat on one portion of the road, which has been barricaded and dedicated to the protesting farmers.On Saturday night, farmers had cleared the Chilla border, citing inconvenience to commuters, but vehicular movement was restored on Sunday. Satish Tomar, in-charge of the IT cell of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Bhanu), said “Police and senior officers requested us to clear the road... Our leaders took a decision, and keeping in mind the problems caused to the commuters and locals, we have cleared both the roads. We, along with police personnel, together removed the barricades and reopened the road.”On Tuesday, various farmers groups said they would intensify their agitation and would submit a written rejection of the government’s proposal. Jagjit Singh Dallewal, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur), said that the farmers will negotiate with the government only when they talk about the repealing the laws instead of making amendments. “We are also making adequate arrangements for women protesters. As soon as that is done, they too will join the protest in huge numbers in the coming days,” he said.The number of farmers at Ghazipur border also saw an increase on Tuesday. The tractor-trolleys, trucks and four-wheelers have occupied 400-500 metres of the carriageway between Indirapuram and the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border. As many as 15 tents to serve free meals throughout the day have also been set up at the protest site.Hundreds of farmers were seen sitting on the blocked Delhi-Meerut carriageway (going towards Delhi from Ghaziabad) and listening to speeches by various farmer leaders criticising the central government for not scrapping the three farm laws and asserting that their protest will not end until the government accepted their demands.“The Uttar Pradesh government has been stopping farmers from proceeding to Delhi. Many representatives of farmers are under house arrest. We will not tolerate this. If the government continues harassing farmers, we will have no choice but to escalate our agitation to Lucknow and at local levels in Uttar Pradesh. If required, we may block the entire Delhi-Meerut Expressway again,” said Rajveer Singh Jadhon, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (UP unit).At the Singhu border, the death of four farmers in two separate road accidents in dominated the speeches from the stage. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said his government would provide assistance to the families of the deceased farmers.Farmers also objected to the allegations of being misled by Opposition leaders or the protests being hijacked by other groups. Teja Singh, 70, a farmer from Nabha in Patiala district, said, “The government thinks of us as fools. The talks will just serve as an excuse for them to trick us into believing that the new farm laws are for our own good. But that is not the case. We know that these laws will cost us our land eventually, and that is why we are protesting here. Nobody is guiding us. The farmers know the impact these laws can have on us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-announce-complete-blockade-of-chilla-border-on-wednesday/story-0JZxK8cI2gwmrhbAJm3FjP.html
16-12-2020||Delhi||Group detained, released for protesting attack at Jamia Millia||A group of protesters — who had assembled for a candlelight march at Batla House — were briefly detained by police and released on Tuesday evening. Police said the protesters had assembled to mark the first-year anniversary of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CCA, protests held in Jamia Nagar last year. On December 15, 2019, a protest led to clashes between police and students. Later in the evening, police entered the Jamia university campus, alleging that some rioters had entered the varsity.Delhi Police were heavily criticised for entering the university and using disproportionate force against students. The HC is hearing a bunch of pleas seeking action in the matter. Former JNU student Umar Khalid’s father, Sayed Qasim Rasool Ilyas, said that his wife and daughter were detained. “They were participating in a peaceful march organised to condemn the attack on Jamia Millia Islamia. They were detained by the police and taken to an unknown location. SHO Lajpat Nagar later told us that they will reach home within half an hour. We are still waiting for them,” he told HT around 9.30pm on Tuesday. Khalid has been arrested for his alleged role in planning and orchestrating the 2020 Delhi riots. He has denied the all allegations. Deputy commissioner of police (south east) RP Meena, said, “The police team removed the agitators from the spot, counselled them regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour and asked them to return home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/group-detained-released-for-protesting-attack-at-jamia-millia/story-kgawwucRt0HZSlluJOuyGP.html
16-12-2020||Delhi||AAP calls for one-day special assembly session to debate ‘Rs 2,400 crore MCD scam’||The Delhi government has called a one-day special session of the legislative assembly on Thursday to discuss the alleged misappropriation of Rs 2,400 crore by the north and south Delhi municipal corporations (MCDs) that are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia announced about the one-day Delhi assembly session on Twitter.“A special session of the Delhi Assembly on misappropriation of Rs 2400 crore in MCD will be held on Thursday,” he said in a tweet in Hindi. Leaders of the ruling AAP have sharpened their attack on the BJP-ruled municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) over the alleged misappropriation of funds ahead of civic polls due in 2022.AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj held a press conference on Tuesday and said the BJP has become so desperate that now the MCD officials are pulling down the hoardings put by the AAP across the city on the scam done by the MCDs. The AAP also attempted to protest outside the L-G’s and Union home minister Amit Shah’s residence on Sunday demanding a CBI probe into the alleged scam but were stopped by the police.“On one hand, the BJP-led north MCD constantly claims they do not have money and are incapable of paying salaries to the doctors, nurses, sanitation workers, and other staff. On the other hand, they are ready to waive Rs. 2,400 crore, which was payable to them by south Delhi civic body,” Bhardwaj said. AAP leader Atishi said the accounts of south MCD of the last many years, clearly state that Rs. 2,400 crore was the payable rent for the SDMC office at Civic Center, which is owned by the North MCD. “But in this year’s budget, the rent payable is shown as 0. The question that now arises is where did the Rs. 2400 crore go? Where has this money been appropriated? Which North MCD BJP leader and South MCD BJP leader received money to turn these Rs. 2500 crores into 0,” she said.The BJP has all the allegation and said there was no corruption or manipulation in settling of dues between two government bodies as reportedly done by North and South Delhi municipal corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-calls-for-one-day-special-assembly-session-to-debate-rs2-400-scam/story-WmDDquTvk4oPbQvfmsJjLO.html
16-12-2020||Delhi||Prove North MCD scam claim or resign: BJP hits out at AAP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday challenged the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government to prove the allegations levelled by them of a Rs 2,400 crore scam in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly, said that he will resign if the allegations are found correct. Else chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy, Manish Sisodia, should resign for levelling baseless allegations.On Tuesday, Sisodia took to Twitter to announce a day-long special session of the Delhi assembly on Thursday on the alleged Rs 2,400 crore scam by the municipal corporations.BJP leaders said that the ruling party in Delhi doesn’t understand the difference between “dispute” and “scam”. Bidhuri said, “There is a dispute between the north and south corporation over the payment of rent of the Civic Centre. The two corporations are working on resolving the dispute; there is no scam in it. I challenge the CM and his deputy to prove it. If a CBI inquiry finds a scam, then I’ll resign from the post of Leader of Opposition, else the CM and his deputy should resign.”Bidhuri said that the AAP is politicising the issue at a time when the city is battling the coronavirus pandemic. He said that the special session should have been called for more serious concerns. “Instead of calling a special session to just politicise meaningless issues, the government should have called the session to discuss issues such as pollution, lack of public transport, Covid management, condition of Delhi government hospitals, non-payment of salaries to Covid warriors. The government has got its priorities wrong.”Responding to the allegations, senior Aam Aadmi Party leader and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said the the BJP has become so desperate after its failed sit-in protest outside the CM’s residence that it is now violating orders of the Delhi high court by allegedly threatening to not pay salaries to its sanitation workers if they do not join the mayors’ protest. “In the name of a sit-in protest outside the CM’s residence, the mayors of the three corrupt BJP-ruled MCDs are enjoying themselves with shahi paneer and butter naan from Taj Hotel. The citizens of Delhi do not care about their drama because the BJP ruled MCD has never worked for them and is incompetent. Hence, people have no expectations from them,” he said, Bhardwaj said since nobody is paying any heed to their fake protest, the BJP is now becoming “restless and desperate”. “To seek attention, yesterday a top leader of the BJP met representatives of the Safai Karamchari union of Delhi and threatened them. The BJP has threatened the safai Karamcharis that if they do not join the protest of the mayors and sit outside the residence of Kejriwal, then the BJP ruled MCD will not clear their due salary. There are high court orders dated 27.05.2016 and 11.07.2016 which clearly direct the MCD to pay the regular salaries to sanitation workers,” he said. On Tuesday, mayors of the three corporations also conducted public dealings from outside the CM’s residence. “We met people who had come to us with their problems related to non-payment of salaries and pension or lack of sanitation in their area. While we have directed the officials to address a majority of concerns, the issue of salaries is still unresolved as we have got no assurance from the Delhi government regarding payment of our dues even after nine days,” said Jai Prakash, mayor of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.On the issue of the scam alleged by the AAP, mayors of south and north corporations said that the municipal officials are looking into the matter. “This issue pertains to the time when the corporation was trifurcated. We have to see what were the terms and conditions for revenue sharing of the Civic Centre. Our officials are examining the matter. But the allegations of corruption or scam are all baseless,” said Anamika Singh, mayor of south Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/prove-north-mcd-scam-claim-or-resign-bjp-hits-out-at-aap/story-g3jqveYLm84fUkpe7EbbRN.html
16-12-2020||Delhi||High court order, 5-hour meeting broke AIIMS deadlock||It took the Delhi high court’s intervention and a marathon five hour meeting with the AIIMS administration and representatives of the Union health ministry to get around 3,000 nurses of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to call off their strike — which was threatening to derail health care services at one of the country’s premier health institutes — late on Tuesday night.On Tuesday, the Delhi high court restrained the nurses from continuing their strike and asked them to resume work. Justice Navin Chawla, while issuing notice to the nurses’ union on the plea of the hospital, said the stay is being granted after the AIIMS gave an assurance to the court that it is looking into the grievances of the nurses. The nurses claimed that they had given a one-month strike notice to the administration, which was to start from Wednesday but was advanced to Monday, when the hospital started the process to hire contractual nurses — newspaper advertisement was released on Tuesday for walk-in interviews for the three-month nurse’s position. “AIIMS administration is callous towards the demands of nurses which are longstanding and genuine. They had planned to secretly recruit nurses on a contract basis who are unskilled, inexperienced, and who are not able to give quality care which is the standard of our premiere institute,” said a letter, written in response by the nurses’ union appealing to citizens. “When the nurses planned on going on an indefinite strike, we hired contractual nurses. We cannot let patients suffer. These hiring will not be done if nurses do not go on strike,” said a senior official from the hospital administration, on condition of anonymity. As per the contingency plan prepared for the strike, the emergency services were curtailed with focus on taking care of patients already admitted to the department. Patients in need of emergency surgeries were taken up, whereas routine surgeries or even the semi-urgent ones were delayed. The contingency plan said that semi-emergency or planned surgeries could be taken up only if resident doctors filled in as scrub nurses and floor nurses in operation theatres. The senior doctors were also asked to curtail their clinics depending on the number of resident doctors available. Resident doctors from every department were posted to the wards to take care of admitted patients. “No matter how many resident doctors you post in a ward, when a huge proportion of the staff of any hospital goes on a strike, there is an impact on the services,” said a senior doctor from the hospital, also on condition of anonymity. Another doctor said, one of their relatives — who was scheduled to undergo a thyroid surgery — was asked to go back home. “They got the date for the surgery after running around a lot and now they have to return because the surgery was cancelled. In fact, most planned surgeries for the day were cancelled,” said the doctor. The hospital usually performs about 100 to 150 surgeries a day, before the Covid pandemic. After the high court restrained the nurses from continuing with the strike, the nurses union were called for a meeting by the hospital administration around 5.30pm. “We had given a list of 23 demands and no concrete action has been taken on any of them. As for our main demand, the anomaly in the sixth pay commission’s recommendations, we have been given the same assurance as before -- that the demand will be looked into. After the court order, however, we have no option but to call off the strike. We will present our problems to the court in response to the petition,” said Fameer CK, general secretary of the nurses union. Dr Randeep Guleria, director of AIIMS, said, “Whatever can be resolved at the level of the institute, we will try to do. Whatever needs to be done at the level of the health ministry will also be looked into within the next few days. However, there are certain matters involving other ministries, which will also be looked into. We are one family so we must resolve our own issues.”As per officials present in the meeting, no promises were made on the demand for increase in salary as per the alleged anomaly in the implementation of the sixth pay commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/high-court-order-5-hour-meeting-broke-aiims-deadlock/story-0qhxbmJITGPGFGy8i4V6UK.html

16-12-2020||Pune||C-section operations high at Pune district government facilities in five years: NFH Survey||According to the National Family Health Survey 5 (NFHS) carried out by the ministry of health and family welfare, the data for Pune district shows that the overall number of Caesarean section or C-Section operations in the district has gone up in the last five years. While the number of such operations in public health facilities has gone up, those in private health facilities have dipped in the last five years. In addition, the overall out-of-pocket cost for C-Section operations have increased by about Rs 1,550 from 2015-16 to 2019-20. The institutional births in the district have also gone up from 93% in 2015-16 to 98% in 2019-20 and the number of institutional births in public facility also went up by 5% in these four years with improved health facilities and the number of births attended by skilled health personnel also increased by 3% in the same time period. The survey showed that more mothers now have access to skilled health professionals during childbirth and also more have opted for institutional births. The overall increase in the number of births delivered by caesarean section has also gone up in the district from 31.9% in 2015-16 to 34.6% in 2019-20. Increased caesarean section operations are discouraged by medical experts across the globe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), since 1985, the international healthcare community has considered the ideal rate for caesarean sections to be between 10-15%. However, caesarean sections have become increasingly common in both developed and developing countries. The average out-of-pocket cost for institutional birth in public facilities has also gone up, found the survey. The cost went from Rs 2,231 in 2015-16 to Rs 3,677 in 2019-20 in the district. In Pune, the number of such operations has gone up especially in public health facilities where such operations are discouraged. The survey said although the number of such operations went down in private health facilities in 2019-20 as compared to 2015-2016 by about 6%. However, the number of C-section operations in public health facilities has gone up a whopping 13.2%. Dr Madhuri Rokade, a resident medical officer at PMC’s maternity hospital, Sonawane hospital said, “Usually we get mothers who have had their first delivery through C-section operation in a private hospital and then for the second delivery we have to opt for a C-section again. The reason to avoid C-section operations is as it is a surgery and so the surgical risks and risks due to anaesthesia are involved which are not involved in a natural birth process. In addition, the scar which is caused due to Caesarean operation is a permanent scar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/c-section-operations-high-at-pune-district-government-facilities-in-five-years-nfh-survey/story-A25zCGssvxYC6C6kdqOk7L.html
16-12-2020||Pune||Parents fume as Pune schools stop online classes to protest non-payment of fees||Some private schools in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad have shut down online education for three days, starting Tuesday. As per the Federation of Schools Association in Maharashtra, the response of English-medium schools to the call to shutdown, because of a problem with fees, has been satisfactory.However, parent associations in the city have responded by calling the move an act of “blackmail by schools”. Rajendra Singh, state president, Federation of Schools Association in Maharashtra, said, “A lot of schools have joined the protest and even parents have called us to show their support.”“Parents should understand that the school cannot function on only 30 per cent fees paid by parents. We do not want children to suffer. There are a lot of parents who are misinformed about payment of fees. We have tried to clear that confusion too,” said Singh.Anubha Sahai, president, India Wide Parents Association, said that this three-day shut-down is “blackmail and extortion by schools”.“Many schools are charging 100 per cent fees. Some schools have clubbed all the fees under the tuition fee. Our demands are simple, there should be transparency and schools should be audited. By protesting like this, schools are blackmailing parents. It is important to ask why other states are not protesting. Fees should be charged only for tuition. And the fees should be capped,” said Sahai.P Suresh, a parent with two school-going children, said, “The school is charging full fees under the tuition fee. This includes transport and other fees. By definition, what they are doing is right, but the fees they are charging is huge and unjust in this pandemic.” The education of his younger child is hampered as he has not yet paid the full fee. “Online content that the school publishes on their website cannot be accessed by the child as they keep asking us to pay the fees,” said Suresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-fume-as-schools-stop-online-classes-to-protest-non-payment-of-fees/story-U7G3QH4XnYPEW7yPnJPRcM.html
16-12-2020||Pune||Vintage photographs of veteran cine star Gajanan Jagirdar donated to NFAI||A vintage collection of photographs of veteran actor, director and producer Gajanan Jagirdar is now part of the collection at the National Film Archive of India (NFAI). Ashok Jagirdar, son of Gajanan Jagirdar, handed over 130 photographs and other memorabilia from his personal collection to Prakash Magdum, director, NFAI in Pune. A major highlight of the collection is the original sketch of Gajanan Jagirdar as the protagonist of the 1953 film “Mahatma”, drawn by late Shiv Sena chief and veteran cartoonist Bal Thackeray. Jagirdar had played the lead in the movie written by PL Deshpande, and directed by Datta Dharmadhikari.There are several images of Jagirdar from this film, along with veteran artist David Abraham and actress Rekha, in the collection. Jagirdar was to play the role of Lokmanya Tilak in a Prabhat Studio production that did not take off. His black and white photograph in costume and make-up as Tilak is part of the collection. This iconic image of Jagirdar as Tilak has passed off for an original Tilak image on many occasions. “We are really delighted to receive this rare collection of photographs of a major artist of Indian cinema. Having started his career in the iconic Prabhat Studio, Gajanan Jagirdar also served as the first principal of the Film Institute of India in 1961-62,” said Magdum. One of the oldest photographs from the collection is from a 1935 film “Asire Havis”, apart from an image of a 1938 film “Meetha Jahar”, where Jagirdar is seen appearing with Naseem Banu. “I was in touch with Ashok Jagirdar for the past few days and I am really grateful to him for this wonderful gesture of donating these photographs. We will now digitise these photographs so that it can be accessed by researchers of Indian cinema,” said Prakash Magdum. As part of NFAI’s research programme this year, a monograph on the life and works of Jagirdar is being written by Prof Milind Damle, head of TV Direction at FTII.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vintage-photographs-of-veteran-cine-star-gajanan-jagirdar-donated-to-nfai/story-2Yi62QVqtVaMvSjxxVtFiM.html

We were reassured to know that the PMC will not be giving any permission to MIT to carry out construction activity on the hill and that the PMC’s demolition work of the built-up portion will resume as soon as the court lifts the status quo,” said Sushma Date, one of the members of the Deccan Gymkhana Parisar Samiti. The residents are also confident that MIT will remove the debris soon. “We trust that the debris removal work will be carried out quickly and all the rubble cleared soon. Currently the rubble piled up there is hazardous to residents of the societies of Rambaug Colony at the foothills,” said Date. Yuvraj Deshmukh, superintending engineer, Building department, PMC, said, “The copies of the notice by PMC denying permission to MIT to construct on a hill slope will be shared with the residents tomorrow.” On December 8, 2020, the Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT), was issued instructions by PMC officials to excavate the “internal road”, on the Vetal tedki hillslope, survey no 123, Kothrud, and clear the debris collected.A stop-work notice was issued to MIT citing unauthorised work on the hill slope at survey number 123 in Kothrud, and on December 4, 2020, the PMC had dug up the road being constructed and ordered the institute to clear the debris within two days.Meanwhile, Deshmukh said that they cannot comment on the court hearing as the matter is subjudice and MIT officials were unavailable for comment despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civic-commissioner-assures-vetal-tekdi-area-residents-of-no-road-on-hill-slope/story-ABg0GxIWP7Vgm10kWQZPkJ.html
