The ‘travel corridor list’ includes countries from where people need not self-isolate after arriving in England.The reduced quarantine period also applies to those in the UK who come in contact with any person who has tested positive. People who test positive should continue to self-isolate for 10 days from onset of symptoms or 10 days from point of taking a positive test if asymptomatic, they added.The reduced quarantine is the latest relaxation for arrivals announced in recent days in moves welcomed by the travel and tourism industries.From December 5, the quarantine period has been removed for individuals arriving in England for business activity that delivers significant benefit to the UK economy. From December 15, the quarantine period will be further reduced to five days if a test taken five days after arrival proves negative.Scheduled international flights are currently suspended, but a limited number of flights are operating between the UK and India under a bilateral agreement. Such flights are subject to eligibility criteria and details may change at short notice, the Foreign Office said.Individuals are only exempt from quarantine requirements when undertaking the specific business activity and will only be able to meet with others as required by that specific activity, the announcement said.Exemptions also came into force on December 5 for domestic and international performing arts professionals, TV production staff, journalists, and recently signed elite sportspersons, to ensure that industries which require high-talent individuals who rely on international connections can continue to complete their work.Health officials at Public Health England do not anticipate that the exemptions will raise the risk of domestic transmission, due to the protocols being put in place around these exemptions, but add that all exemptions will remain under review.From December 15, under the plan called ‘Test to Release’, passengers arriving in England by plane, ferry or train should book their test before they travel; must complete a passenger locator form; and will still need to self-isolate for five days before taking the test.The test will need to booked at the traveller’s expense from an approved list of providers. Those choosing not to take a test when arriving from a non-exempt country must continue to follow the current self-isolation requirements.The plan has been put in place based on advice from a consortium of expert representatives from the aviation, maritime, international rail, tourism and hospitality industries to boost international travel for all modes, whilst safeguarding public health in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-cuts-quarantine-time-to-10-days-for-foreign-arrivals/story-xtDDlqFGrsQjsyZsta0i1H.html
11-12-2020||World||Iran protests to Turkey over alleged ‘meddling’ by Erdogan||Iran’s Foreign Ministry summoned Turkey’s ambassador on Friday over what it said was “meddlesome” remarks by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan during a visit to Azerbaijan.Erdogan recited an Azeri-Iranian poem about the division of Azerbaijan’s territory between Russia and Iran in the 19th century. Tehran appeared concerned his remarks could fan separatist tendencies among Iran’s Azeri minority.“The Turkish ambassador was informed that the era of territorial claims and expansionist empires is over,” the Foreign Ministry said on its website. “Iran does not allow anyone to meddle in its territorial integrity.”Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted earlier: “President Erdogan was not informed that what he ill-recited in Baku refers to the forcible separation of areas...from (the) Iranian motherland.” “NO ONE can talk about OUR beloved Azerbaijan,” Zarif said, referring to the northwest region of Iran where many of its ethnic Azeris live.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-protests-to-turkey-over-alleged-meddling-by-erdogan/story-5vQiD7PmR6zK3YjiPs4UOM.html
11-12-2020||World||US FDA ‘working rapidly’ on Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine decision||The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Friday it was working rapidly to issue an emergency use authorization for Pfizer Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine, setting the stage for the first Americans to be immunized as soon as Monday or Tuesday.The FDA’s decision making follows one of the last steps of its regulatory process: a panel of outside advisers on Thursday evening endorsed emergency use of the vaccine to help stem a pandemic that has killed more than 285,000 US residents.US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, which oversees the FDA, told ABC News that regulatory authorization should come within days and the federal government would work with the company to get the vaccine shipped out.Pfizer has asked that the two-dose vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, be approved for use in people aged 16 to 85.The companies last month said that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing illness from Covid-19, and detailed data released in the FDA’s documents showed the vaccine began showing some protection even before volunteers received a second dose.The vaccine is already approved in Britain, and people there began receiving the shots on Tuesday. Bahrain and Canada have also authorized the vaccine, and Canada expects to start inoculations next week.The FDA has notified the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Operation Warp Speed so that they can execute their plans for timely vaccine distribution, it said in a statement. (https://bit.ly/2W47i9l)Healthcare workers, first responders and nursing home residents are expected to receive the first doses, but a wider rollout faces significant logistical challenges.Another 2,902 US deaths were reported on Thursday, a day after a record 3,253 people died, a pace projected to continue for the next two to three months until the vaccine can be widely distributed.For months, US President Donald Trump had pressured the FDA in tweets and press conferences to move more quickly, accusing staff and Pfizer of dragging their feet.Shortly after the FDA’s statement, the outgoing president criticized the agency for what he said was its slow handling of the vaccines and criticized FDA Commissioner Steven Hahn.Trump said his “pushing” the agency had speed up new vaccine approval, but that the FDA was “still a big, old, slow turtle. Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr. Hahn @SteveFDA. Stop playing games and start saving lives!!!”Pfizer shares rose 1% before the opening bell, while BioNTech US shares were flat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-working-rapidly-on-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-decision/story-9NSAtx0w6Zs0gBlNchq3yL.html
11-12-2020||World||No deal on Brexit trade ‘very very likely’, British PM Johnson says||Britain is likely to complete its journey out of the European Union in three weeks without a trade deal, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday.Britain quit the EU in January but remains an informal member until Dec. 31 - the end of a transition period during which it has remained in the EU single market and customs union.Both sides say they want to agree arrangements to cover nearly $1 trillion in annual trade but negotiations are at an impasse, with Britain standing to lose zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the huge European single market.“It’s looking very, very likely we’ll have to go for a solution that I think will be wonderful for the UK, we’ll be able to do exactly what we want from January 1, it will obviously be different from what we set out to achieve,” Johnson told reporters.“If there’s a big offer, a big change in what they’re saying then I must say that I’m yet to see it,” said Johnson, the face of the “leave” campaign in Britain’s 2016 Brexit referendum.Von Der Leyen was quoted by an EU official as telling leaders of the bloc’s 27 member states attending a summit in Brussels on Friday that prospects for a deal had worsened.“The probability of a no deal is higher than of a deal,” the official said on condition of anonymity.Johnson and von der Leyen have given negotiators until Sunday evening to break the deadlock over fishing rights and EU demands for Britain to face consequences if in the future it diverges from the bloc’s rules.Johnson must decide whether the deal on offer is worth taking or the future freedom and domestic political benefits afforded by leaving without one outweigh the economic costs.A Brexit without a trade deal would damage the economies of Europe, send shockwaves through financial markets, snarl borders and sow chaos through the delicate supply chains which stretch across Europe and beyond.No deal?As EU leaders lined up to warn of the failure of talks, investors started to price in the risk of a chaotic finale to the five-year Brexit crisis. British stocks fell, euro zone government bond yields fell and sterling fell about 1% against the dollar and euro. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said there were still fundamental issues unresolved in the trade talks. “Time is running out and we need to prepare for a hard Brexit,” he said, referring to an abrupt rupture in trade arrangements.EU leaders rejected a proposal from Johnson for a Brexit call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, EU officials said.Johnson is under pressure from Brexit supporters in Britain not to cave to any EU demands that they say could undermine his promises to regain Britain’s sovereignty.Macron also faces domestic pressure, with French fishermen urging him to ensure the EU defends their fishing rights. Asked by a reporter about an EU proposal for a one-year contingency plan, under which EU fishermen would keep access to Britain’s fishing waters, he said: “I’m not asking to have my cake and eat it, no. All I want is a cake that’s worth its weight. Because I won’t give up my share of it either.”The Bank of England said it had taken steps to keep banks lending through 2021 as Britain prepares for any market disruption from a big change in the trading relationship with the EU, while also dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-deal-on-brexit-trade-very-very-likely-british-pm-johnson-says/story-dfzodpeCQYzKuT1vdvVyeK.html
11-12-2020||World||US Covid-19 vaccine near, but deaths rising by 9/11 proportions each day||A mounting US death toll has tempered enthusiasm about a coming Covid-19 vaccine with 9/11-like fatalities projected every day for the months ahead, even with a rapid rollout of inoculations, which could start as soon as Monday.Another 2,902 U.S. deaths were reported on Thursday, a day after a record 3,253 people died, a pace projected to continue for the next two to three months until the vaccine can be widely distributed.Those daily tolls are roughly equivalent to the 2,996 killed in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and greater than the 2,403 killed in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor - traumatic events that reshaped the United States for years.“Probably for the next 60 to 90 days, we’re going to have more deaths per day than we had on 9/11 or we had at Pearl Harbor,” Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told the Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday.“The reality is the vaccine approval this week is not going to really impact that, I think, to any degree for the next 60 days,” Redfield said.Moving with unprecedented speed, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday was on the cusp of approving emergency use of the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc with its German partner BioNTech.“The FDA informed Pfizer that they do intend to proceed towards an authorization for their vaccine,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told ABC News on Friday.“We will work with Pfizer to get that shipped out so we could be seeing people getting vaccinated Monday or Tuesday,” Azar said.Britain, Bahrain and Canada have already approved the Pfizer vaccine, and the U.S. advisory panel is due to review a second vaccine, from Moderna Inc, next week. Other vaccine candidates are in the works.While most vaccines take years to develop, the Pfizer vaccine arrives less than a year after the illness was traced to a market in Wuhan, China, in December of last year.Chinese officials shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus with the World Health Organization on Jan. 12, triggering the international race toward a vaccine. A US rollout faces significant logistical challenges to meet President-elect Joe Biden’s goal of inoculating 100 million people within 100 days of his inauguration on Jan. 20.“It’s not going to be like a light switch on and off. It’s going to be more like a dimmer switch,” said Dr. Mark Mulligan, director of NYU Langone Health Vaccine Center and a lead investigator for the Pfizer trials.But any American who wants a vaccine should be able to get one by May or June, Assistant US Health Secretary Brett Giroir told Fox News on Friday.States will determine who gets the vaccine first and were likely to focus on healthcare workers and people in long-term care facilities, followed by the elderly, people with chronic conditions and first responders, Giroir said.Then there is the American skepticism about vaccines, with only 61% saying they are open to getting vaccinated, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.In the meantime, grim statistics continue to pile up as the United States recorded more than 200,000 cases per day for four straight days with another 220,815 cases on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally of official data.The United States has so far reported about 15.6 million cases and 292,642 deaths by Thursday.Deaths are projected to reach 502,000 by April 1, according to an influential model by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The institute revised that number down by about 37,000 on Thursday with the release of more detailed information about the vaccine and other factors.By comparison, heart disease killed 655,381 people in the United States and cancer 599,274 in 2018, according to CDC data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-vaccine-near-but-deaths-rising-by-9-11-proportions-each-day/story-Te9OiNE0tbIqa3YrXqqAPM.html
11-12-2020||World||Where are we in the Covid-19 vaccine race?||Britain became the first country to roll out the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech on Dec. 8 after final late-stage trial results showed it was 95% effective in preventing the disease.The following is what we know about the race to deliver vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic that has killed 1.6 million people worldwide:Who is furthest along?US drugmaker Pfizer and German partner BioNTech are the vaccine trailblazers. They were the first in the world to release full late-stage trial data on Nov. 18 and Britain was the first to approve the shot for emergency use on Dec. 3, followed by Canada on Dec. 9.Advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endorsed its emergency use on Dec. 10, paving the way for the agency to authorize the vaccine in days. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is due to complete its review by Dec. 29 and India is accelerating its review.Who will be next?US pharmaceutical company Moderna is ahead of the pack at this point. It was next to release full data analysis for a late-stage trial on Nov. 30, with its vaccine showing a 94.1% efficacy rate. FDA advisers are due to review it on Dec. 17 and the EMA will do so by Jan. 12.Who else is in the running?Britain’s AstraZeneca is seeking approval for its vaccine in Britain after announcing interim late-stage trial data on Nov. 23. It had an average efficacy rate of 70% and as much as 90% for a subgroup of trial participants who got a half dose first, followed by a full dose.However, it is not clear how the regulator will deal with the different dosages in the efficacy data in its assessment. While India is conducting an accelerated review, it has asked for more data. AstraZeneca is also in discussions with the EMA, which is conducting a rolling review of the vaccine.US drugmaker Johnson & Johnson plans to deliver trial data this year, or early in 2021, teeing it up for US authorization in February if its shot is effective. It reduced the enrolment target for its clinical trial to 40,000 volunteers from 60,000 on Dec. 9, potentially speeding results which are tied to how quickly participants become infected.US firm Novavax is running a late-stage trial in Britain with data due in the first quarter of 2021. It expects to start a large-scale trial in the United States this month.France’s Sanofi and Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline , however, announced a setback on Dec. 11 in their attempts to develop a vaccine. The drugmakers said it showed an insufficient immune response in older people in mid-stage trials and that they would start a new study in February.What happens in the trials?The companies typically test their vaccines against a placebo - typically saline solution - in healthy volunteers to see if the rate of Covid-19 infection among those who got the vaccine is significantly lower than in those who received the dummy shot.How are volunteers infected?The trials rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with Covid-19, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where trials are being conducted. Each drugmaker has targeted a specific number of infections to trigger a first analysis of their data.How well are the vaccines supposed to work?The World Health Organization ideally wants to see at least 70% efficacy. The FDA wants at least 50% - which means there must be at least twice as many infections among volunteers who received a placebo as among those in the vaccine group. The EMA has said it may accept a lower efficacy level.What about Russia and China?While Pfizer’s shot was the first to be rolled out following the publication of full Phase III trial data, Russia and China have been inoculating their citizens for months with several different vaccines still undergoing late-stage trials.Russia said on Nov. 24 that its Sputnik V vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya Institute, was 91.4% effective based on interim late-stage trial results. It started vaccinations in August and has inoculated more than 100,000 people so far.AstraZeneca said on Dec. 11 that it would test a combination of its vaccine with one of Sputnik V’s two components to try to boost the efficacy of the shot it is developing with Oxford University.China launched an emergency use programme in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection. It has vaccinated about one million people as of mid-November using at least three shots - two developed by the state-backed China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and one by Sinovac Biotech.Sinovac said on Nov. 18 that mid-stage trial results showed its CoronaVac shot triggered a quick immune response and interim data from its late stage trial could come this year.The Butantan Institute, a Brazilian biomedical centre, is producing CoronaVac and aims to make 1 million doses a day ahead of a vaccine campaign to be launched late January.The United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, said on Dec. 9 that one of the CNBG vaccines was 86% effective based on interim results from a late-stage trial in the Gulf Arab state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-are-we-in-the-covid-19-vaccine-race/story-r6NITq3XWzo4wIggIxa3EO.html
11-12-2020||World||Putin orders public officials to declare digital assets||Russian public officials will have to declare any cryptocurrency holdings and digital assets from Jan. 1, 2021, according to an order signed by President Vladimir Putin, published on Friday.Lawmakers this year approved a bill giving cryptocurrencies legal status, but banned them from being used as a means of payment. The central bank is considering issuing a digital rouble it says would eventually make Russia’s payment systems more robust.Any public official or person seeking to hold public office must disclose their digital assets, as well as those of their spouse and children, before June 30, 2021, the order said.Failure to declare digital currency transactions above 600,000 roubles ($8,211) in one year could result in a fine, according to draft proposals for changes to Russia’s tax code by the finance ministry. A jail term of up to three years is also under consideration, the RBC daily newspaper has reported.The central bank first floated the idea of a digital rouble in October, saying it may issue it on top of existing cash and non-cash roubles to facilitate payments for individuals and businesses.Russia had initially declared cryptocurrencies illegal on the grounds that they could be used in money laundering or to finance terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-orders-public-officials-to-declare-digital-assets/story-acbhlwog6nh4e5rhxQkEsL.html
11-12-2020||World||What are the concerns for people involved in now-abandoned Australia’s Covid vaccine trials?||Australia has hit a major roadblock in its attempt to secure millions of doses of a promising vaccine candidate against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after trial participants returned false HIV positive results. The Australian government had agreed to buy 51 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine developed by biotech firm CSL Ltd and the University of Queensland (UQ).The government had struck a deal with CSL Ltd to manufacture two potential coronavirus vaccines - one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and the other by CSL’s own labs in collaboration with the UQ. However, CSL will not progress the vaccine candidate to Phase 2/3 clinical trials as the Phase 1 data showed the generation of antibodies that interfered with “certain HIV tests.”What are the concerns for people involved in the trial?CSL and the University of Columbia said in a joint statement that there is no possibility the vaccine causes infection, adding that the routine tests confirmed there is no HIV virus present. CSL stated that the generation of antibodies was directed towards fragments of a protein (gp41), which is a component used to stabilise the vaccine.“Trial participants were fully informed of the possibility of a partial immune response to this component, but it was unexpected that the levels induced would interfere with certain HIV tests,” it added.Also Read | Adverse effects of Covid vaccines to be reviewed by national agencies: WHOWhat are the implications for vaccine rollout?Australia had ordered 51 million dosed of the UQ/CSL vaccine and the firm was working towards Phase 2/3 clinical trial and large-scale manufacture of the vaccine. CSL and the Australian government have agreed to not proceed to Phase 2/3 trials. The government is increasing the purchase of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from 33.8 million doses to 53.8 million doses. The doses of the Novavax vaccine have also been increased from 40 million to 51 million.How the researchers reacted?Professor Paul Young, UQ vaccine co-lead, said that though there were no guarantees, the core technology approach used in the development of the vaccine has passed the major clinical test. Young added that it was possible to re-engineer the vaccine, but the team did not have the luxury of time needed.“Doing so would set back development by another 12 or so months, and while this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone’s priority,” he stated.Dr Andrew Nash, chief scientific officer for CSL, said that the outcome highlights the risk of failure associated with early vaccine development. He also informed that CSL has agreed at the request of the Australian government to manufacture an additional 20 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-are-the-concerns-for-people-involved-in-now-abandoned-australia-s-covid-vaccine-trials/story-KMbD1G51FmTuqHcdn1KtVJ.html
11-12-2020||World||Faced with US, EU sanctions, Erdogan calls for dialogue||Faced with the prospect of sanctions from both the United States and the European Union, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that economic penalties would be detrimental to all sides and that Turkey’s disputes with its allies can be resolved through dialogue and cooperation.Erdogan’s comments came hours after the EU gave the green light for the expansion of sanctions against Turkey over its exploration of gas reserves in eastern Mediterranean waters claimed by EU members Greece and Cyprus.Turkey also faces US sanctions over its purchase of a Russian air defense system, which has already resulted in the NATO-member being kicked out of the US F-35 stealth fighter program.“We have deep-rooted political and economic relations with both the United States and the European Union, which neither side can ignore or certainly risk losing,” Erdogan said in a teleconference address to his ruling party’s officials. “There is no issue that cannot be solved through dialogue and cooperation.”The EU leaders said early Friday that Turkey — which is a candidate to join although its membership talks are blocked — has “engaged in unilateral actions and provocations and escalated its rhetoric against the EU.” This was despite the fact that they had offered trade and other incentives to Turkey to halt its activities during their last summit in October, they said.The leaders tasked EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell with drawing up a report on the state of EU-Turkey political, economic and trade relations and with suggesting how to proceed, including on widening sanctions. Borrrell was asked to submit the report to the leaders by the time they hold a summit in March.Turkey’s Foreign Ministry slammed the EU decision, saying Ankara rejects the 27-member group’s “biased and unlawful attitude.” It added that the decision was approved out of solidarity with Greece and Cyprus.But Erdogan, speaking to reporters earlier on Friday, suggested that the decision was less severe than what Greece and Cyprus had hoped for.”(The decision) did not meet the expectations of some countries, because their demand was not just,” Erdogan said. “Some reasonable countries within the EU asserted their positive stance and spoiled their game.”EU countries are split over how best to handle Turkey. France and Cyprus have pushed for tougher measures such as economic sanctions, but other countries are concerned about further undermining the country’s already ravaged economy and destabilizing the region.French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking in Brussels after the EU summit said Europe “remains obviously always open to dialogue but won’t accept a policy destabilizing its member states as well as its regional environment.”He praised the EU decision and the prospect of US sanctions as a response to “Turkey’s inconsistencies within NATO.”“It shows we are right, sometimes, to be clear and vocal when attitudes are unacceptable.”Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the EU took a strong step warning Turkey to “change behavior.”He said that, for Greece, sanctions were not a goal in and of themselves.“But the threat of sanctions in case Turkey continues its provocative action is the best tool we have at our disposal,” he said. “We don’t want Turkey to be a provocative and aggressive neighbor. And I don’t believe this is to the benefit of Turkey or of Greece or of Europe.”Tensions between NATO allies Turkey and Greece escalated over the summer with a military build-up after Turkey sent its seismic survey vessel Oruc Reis, escorted by navy frigates, into disputed waters. The move prompted Greece to also send its warships, and both countries conducted military exercises to assert their claims.Late last month, Oruc Reis returned to port, as it had done before October’s EU meeting. However, another research ship, the Barbaros Hayreddin Pasa, remains off Cyprus’ southwestern coast.Turkey says it is standing up for its energy rights, as well as those of breakaway Turkish Cypriots, while Athens and Nicosia call Turkey’s actions an illegal incursion into areas where they have exclusive offshore exploitation rights.Last year, the EU set up a system for imposing travel bans and asset freezes on people, companies or organizations linked to contested drilling activities. Two Turkish Petroleum Corporation officials are already on the list, and the leaders say those sanctions should be broadened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/faced-with-us-eu-sanctions-erdogan-calls-for-dialogue/story-MfQPQgdUeUS2aFPduJ0WKO.html
11-12-2020||World||How a homeless high school dropout became CEO of a $1 billion company||Taihei Kobayashi has gone from sleeping on the streets of Tokyo to heading a technology startup whose market value topped $1 billion.His rags-to-riches story is among the most remarkable to emerge from a small-cap stock boom that’s minting fortunes in Japan. Kobayashi’s company, which helps startups and other firms to design and create new businesses and products, went public in July and its shares have since more than tripled.It’s an outcome that few could have imagined two decades ago. As Kobayashi tells it, his parents kicked him out at 17 when he quit a prestigious high school to focus on his band. He played music during the day and mostly slept outdoors, using cardboard boxes to keep warm during freezing winter nights. He was homeless for a year and a half.A series of encounters got him off the streets and eventually into a job as a software engineer. He was one of the core members in establishing the predecessor to the company now known as Sun* Inc., pronounced Sun Asterisk, in Vietnam in 2012. He’s now Sun*’s chief executive officer.“The winters were cold,” Kobayashi, 37, said of his experience on the streets. “There may have been times when things felt like hell. But I’ve overcome those times.”According to Kobayashi, his parents wouldn’t accept his decision to drop out of high school. They had made financial plans to allow him to get a university education, he said. Attempts to contact Kobayashi’s parents were unsuccessful.“They told me to leave, so I left, and that was that,” he said. “I wanted to live my life doing what I enjoyed.”Kobayashi ended up spending two winters on the streets of the Shinjuku and Shibuya districts of Tokyo.Mostly Outdoors“I might have died,” he said. “I slept anywhere I could,” he said. “About 80% of the time it was somewhere outside.”Yushi Fukagawa, a close friend since Kobayashi’s school days who currently works at Sun*, recalls the time the entrepreneur became homeless.“I didn’t think too much of it,” Fukagawa said. But “my parents seemed worried.”At 19, a manager of a live-music club took pity on Kobayashi, offering him a job and saying he could crash at the club. He did so for about six years.Eventually, Kobayashi decided it was time to move on. First, he made some money trading music records online. Then he came across a job advertisement that didn’t require any qualifications or experience. All you had to do was take a test, it said.The six-hour examination tested applicants on areas including mathematical skills, logical thinking and IQ. Koyabashi passed and started working at the firm, which trained him to become a software engineer.Start CompanyThat’s how he met Makoto Hirai, one of the founders of Sun*. The two agreed there were many software engineers who excelled in programming, but few who could use those skills to come up with working business models. They decided to start a company to bridge the gap.Kobayashi moved to Vietnam in 2012 to hire staff from the country’s pool of young engineers. In March 2013 the founding members incorporated Framgia Inc. in Japan, which changed its name to Sun* in 2019. The idea was to deploy the engineers to help Japanese startups that were struggling to build a viable business.“Our stance was to commit ourselves to the growth of those startups, regardless of whether it left us mired in losses,” Kobayashi said.Over the years, Sun* grew its business, and now has more than 70 clients. The company listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s Mothers market for startup firms in July. Its shares rose almost sixfold to a high in September, taking its market value above $1.4 billion. They’ve since dropped 37%, with the company’s market capitalization dipping back below $1 billion. Kobayashi’s 7.9% stake is worth about $74 million.Sun* posted net income of 649 million yen ($6.2 million) on revenue of 3.97 billion yen for the nine months ended September.Stiff CompetitionMitsushige Akino, a senior executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co., said there’s good demand for the firm’s services but sales and profit are still low and competition could be stiff.“Things could be difficult,” Akino said. “You have to see whether the company is able to sustain its pace of growth. This is especially so for its revenue, which isn’t much right now.”Kobayashi, who returned to Japan from Vietnam in 2019, said the company is winning business from bigger firms, including those in the blue-chip Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Its customers include Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Corp., according to the Sun* website.“We want to be aggressive in offering our services to big corporations,” he said. “That’s why we went public.”Sun* is seeking to increase earnings by at least 20% to 30% a year, and doubled staff in its Tokyo office to about 130 people this year, he said. Vietnam continues to be the firm’s biggest office with about 1,300 employees.Sun* is one of many companies in the TSE Mothers Index whose shares surged this year as investors bet on technology companies amid the pandemic. The startup gauge hit a 14-year high in October before paring some of its gains. Despite more than tripling, Sun* isn’t even in the index’s top 10 performers this year. The company’s shares trade at about 200 times earnings and about 20 times book value.“It’s what you’d call a momentum stock,” said Tomoichiro Kubota, a senior market analyst at Matsui Securities Co. in Tokyo, noting its “extremely high” price-to-earnings ratio. “It’ll be impacted by how long the positive trend for the startup Mothers gauge will persist.”Kobayashi said he’s aware of the risks but not daunted by them.

11-12-2020||World||EU drug regulator endorses changes to remdesivir marketing for Covid-19 use||Europe’s drugs regulator on Friday recommended changing some terms of the conditional approval given to antiviral drug remdesivir as a Covid-19 treatment, to make clear the conditions under which it can be used.Doubts over remdesivir’s effectiveness were raised after the World Health Organization (WHO) last month said the drug should not be used for Covid-19 patients, regardless of how ill they are, just months after Europe and the United States approved the treatment.The new terms of the conditional marketing authorisation in Europe add that a patient could need “low- or high-flow oxygen or other non-invasive ventilation at start of treatment,” according to the European Medicines Agency. The drug, made by US drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc , is already indicated for use in Europe in patients aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg, who are also suffering from pneumonia and require oxygen support.The European Union (EU) in October agreed to pay more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to Gilead for a six-month supply.Research by British scientists showed remdesivir’s benefits, but a WHO-lead trial found there was no evidence the drug improves survival or reduces the need for ventilation, a claim Gilead has questioned.The top U.S. infectious disease medical association had backed remdesivir for Covid-19 treatment days after the WHO warning.A EU conditional marketing authorisation allows a treatment to be sold for a year in the 27-nation bloc before all necessary data on its efficacy and side-effects are available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-drug-regulator-endorses-changes-to-remdesivir-marketing-for-covid-19-use/story-DmVSWcSiIiwpgoJZjtuISP.html
11-12-2020||World||Adverse effects of Covid vaccines to be reviewed by national agencies: WHO||Any adverse effects from Covid-19 vaccines are for national authorities to review, the World Health Organization said on Friday in response to questions about Britain warning people with a history of anaphylaxis to avoid the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. “But people should not be too anxious. Remember there are a number of vaccine candidates coming online at the same time,” WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told a UN briefing in Geneva.“One vaccine may not be suitable for particular individuals, but you may well find another vaccine is.”On Tuesday, Britain became the first country to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. Its medicine regulator subsequently said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a medicine or food should not get the shot, after two reported incidents of the reaction.A panel of outside advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to endorse emergency use of the vaccine, paving the way for the agency to authorize the shot for a nation that has lost more than 285,000 lives to Covid-19.The WHO is reviewing data from phase 3 trials of many Covid-19 vaccine candidates, Harris said. The agency has not yet issued emergency use authorisation for any vaccines, but “the primary thing we look at is safety”, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/adverse-effects-of-covid-vaccines-to-be-reviewed-by-national-agencies-who/story-fA1dvhaIISFCHGbNShsTsN.html
11-12-2020||World||World in denial on climate action 5 years after Paris accord: Thunberg||Five years on from the Paris Agreement on climate change, the world remains in denial over the actions needed to prevent catastrophic warming, Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg said on Friday.The deal was adopted on December 12, 2015 by 196 countries but, so far, global leaders have failed to deliver on its promises, she said in a video that urged her 10.5 million Instagram followers to #FightFor1point5.That w as a reference to the ambition set out in the accord to hold the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels.The video showed images of politicians and bureaucrats hugging and cheering when the Paris Agreement was signed.Yet the five years subsequent years have been the hottest years ever recorded, Thunberg said in the video, which mixed her sober address to camera with dystopian images of fire and flooding.Pledges so far to reduce greenhouse gas emissions put the world on track for a dire 3C or more of warming this century, with countries planning to produce double the amount of fossil fuels needed to hit the 1.5C target in the next decade alone, the United Nations and research groups said last week.“Hypothetical targets are being set and big speeches are being given, yet when it comes to the immediate action we need, we are still in state of complete denial,” Thunberg said.“We are still speeding in the wrong direction.”Now 17, Thunberg rose to fame in 2018 when her school strike for climate change campaign became a viral sensation online, turning her lone protest into a global movement. Since then she has become a thorn in the side of the world’s political elite.She ended Friday’s video on an optimistic note, saying the solution was in making people - rather than simply policymakers - aware of the extent of the climate crisis.“Let’s make this our main priority. Let’s unite and spread awareness... We are the hope. We the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-in-denial-on-climate-action-5-years-after-paris-accord-thunberg/story-BFpwIgEXcV3e5KxqT0RZVL.html
11-12-2020||World||Leading pro-China news channel in Taiwan ends broadcasts||A leading pro-China cable news channel prepared to halt its broadcast operations at midnight Friday after Taiwan’s government refused to renew its license, citing accuracy issues.The National Communications Commission cited repeated violations of rules on accurate reporting in rejecting CTiTV’s license renewal. The station has been fined 25 times in the past six years for spreading inaccurate information.The station is owned by the Want Want China Times media group, which also publishes one of Taiwan’s main newspapers. It has long been associated with a Beijing-friendly political view, attributed partly to its extensive business interests in China. It tried unsuccessfully to appeal the denial and accused the Taiwanese government of endangering media freedom.In its ruling in November, NCC Chairperson Chen Yaw-shyang made no specific allegations of a pro-China bias, but said the channel appeared susceptible to outside influence.“The biggest problem is external interference into the TV station’s news production and broadcasts,” Chen said in announcing the denial of the license renewal.Reporters without Borders, a media watchdog group, said in a statement that the decision did not go against press freedom, but expressed regret over its impact on the station’s staff.While it will stop its broadcast operations, the company is expected to focus on mobile and web operations, where it already has a sizable following.“We must have limitless support for media freedom,” a banner on the news channel’s home page said Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leading-pro-china-news-channel-in-taiwan-ends-broadcasts/story-33f4lJOPOOBOpnaZ3YEhhI.html
11-12-2020||World||Donald Trump has raised $20S7.5 million since election day to fight lawsuits||President Donald Trump and his party raised $207.5 million in a less than three-week stretch after the US election, fueled by outrage-filled solicitations to donors as he waged an unsuccessful challenge of the results.Money flooded into Trump’s coffers at a much higher rate after he began to seek contributions to fight widespread voter fraud and election rigging, despite no evidence of either, after his loss to President-elect Joe Biden, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).The bulk of the cash -- $121.7 million -- came to the Trump Make America Great Again (TMAGA) Committee via WinRed, the Republican platform for gathering smaller donations online. In the 20 days leading up to and including Election Day, those donors gave $44.8 million.The TMAGA fundraising was spurred in part by an endless stream of text messages and emails insisting that the vote was marred and asking for help contesting the results of elections in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin among other states.“I trust you know that I’m fighting every second of every day to Make America Great Again and DEFEND the integrity of this Election,” began one recent pitch from the president to his supporters, despite a dismal record in the courts for his lawsuits.The fine print in those solicitations says that 75% of money given to TMAGA will go to Save America, a political action committee (PAC) Trump set up that allows him to spend the money on political activity, including holding rallies, advertising, fundraising, travel, and supporting other candidates. The balance goes to the Republican National Committee (RNC).The PAC is an alternative to raising money for the campaign directly, which is limited in what it can do with the cash in its coffers. Unless he officially files as a candidate running for president in 2024, Trump’s campaign can only raise money to pay down debts, fund his legal challenges or pay for modest wind-down expenses, said Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the FEC.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump’s campaign reported owing $11.3 million to vendors, but had $18.4 million cash on hand, more than enough to pay its bills.Very little of the money raised by TMAGA will cover Trump’s legal expenses. Trump is funding those through the campaign, which attributed $4.3 million of the $37.5 million it raised after Election Day to its recount fund. The campaign also listed $8.8 million of recount expenses, with the biggest line item the $3 million paid for a partial recount in Wisconsin.“They have a limited number of things they can do with the surplus,” Noble said of the campaign, including donating the money to charity or the RNC, or continuing litigation over the 2020 election.The post-election pitches have not only raised more money than Trump’s closing argument for a second term, they’ve been far more cost effective. TMAGA spent $22.4 million on fundraising expenses after the election, compared to $43.5 million in the weeks leading up to and including Election Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-has-raised-20s7-5-million-since-election-day-to-fight-lawsuits/story-309DxDsQwKmWwxFu5qflXM.html

The change followed the recent verdict of the Islamabad High Court barring un-elected advisers and special assistants from heading the Cabinet committees.Khan appointed Sheikh Rashid Ahmed as interior minister and Dr. Abdul Hafeez Sheikh as finance minister.State-run Radio Pakistan reported that Ahmed was already a part of the Cabinet working as minister for railways, while Hafeez Sheikh was serving as advisor on finance and revenue.Hafeez Sheikh is not an elected member and he could not lead several committees. He was appointed as minister under Article 91 (9) of the Constitution and can serve as a minister for six months. He must be elected as a member of the National Assembly or Senate to continue after that.Brigadier Retired Ijaz Ahmad Shah who was serving the interior minister was appointed as minister for narcotics control, while Azam Khan Swati was appointed as minister for railways.It is believed that Hafeez Sheikh would be made a senator in March when the election for the upper house is scheduled to be held.The most notable elevation in the new Cabinet is that of Ahmed, who despite failing to improve the functioning of the railways, was given the charge of the interior ministry, a key portfolio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-reshuffles-cabinet-on-court-s-directive/story-l9A6afYHo6LsUQJhRMOqaJ.html
11-12-2020||World||One year on, Wuhan market at epicentre of Covid-19 outbreak remains barricaded and empty||For over six years, 38-year-old Wuhan restaurant owner Lai Yun started most days the same way - with a trip to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, just ten minutes walk from his house.“I’d send the kids to school, have breakfast and then walk over to the market. It was very convenient,” he said.That changed on December 31, 2019, after four cases of a mystery pneumonia were linked to the market and it was shuttered overnight. By the end of the month, the city had begun a gruelling 76-day lockdown that came with just hours notice and barred people from leaving their homes.Almost a year since the outbreak began, Covid-19 has claimed more than 1.5 million lives, and the Wuhan wet market where it was initially detected stands empty even as the city around it has come back to life. It’s become a symbol of the fierce political and scientific battle raging around the origin of the virus with Beijing continuing to spar with the United States and other countries, accusing them of bias.A team of World Health Organization (WHO) experts has yet to visit Wuhan, let alone the market. Health authorities in China and abroad have warned that origin tracing efforts could take years and yield inconclusive results.In Wuhan, where the stigma of being the first coronavirus epicentre hangs heavy, over a dozen residents and business owners told Reuters they don’t believe the virus began in the city.“It certainly couldn’t have been Wuhan... surely another person brought it in. Or surely it came from some other product brought from outside. There were just certain conditions for it to appear here,” said a wet market vendor in the city’s centre who gave his name as Chen.In recent months, Chinese diplomats and state media have said they believe the market is not the origin but the victim of the disease, and have thrown support behind theories that the virus potentially originated in another country.Restricted AccessExperts say the market still plays a role in the investigation and is therefore unlikely to be demolished, though much of that research will rely on samples taken immediately after the outbreak began.“The first cluster of cases was there, so at least it would be of interest to find out the origin of those and put forward a few hypotheses, like whether it’s more likely from the wild animals or perhaps points to a human superspreader,” said Jin Dong-Yan, professor of virology at the University of Hong Kong.Access to the area remains heavily restricted. People who visited before the lockdown remember a bustling building with hundreds of stalls divided into sections for red meat, seafood and vegetables.Recently, the local government has added leafy green plants and traditional Chinese paintings to the semi-permanent blue barricades encircling the area. Inside, wooden boards line the stalls and windows.On the second floor above the empty market, shops selling glasses and optometry equipment reopened in June. This week, a guard at the entrance to the eyeware market took temperatures and warned journalists not to take videos or photos from inside the building.“Maybe some people have some bad feelings about it, but now it’s just an empty building, who feels anxious about an empty building?” said a shop assistant selling contact lenses, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject.While Wuhan hasn’t reported any new locally transmitted cases of Covid-19 since May, for some who relied on the market making ends meet is still a struggle.Lai, who reopened his Japanese restaurant in June, says the market’s closure and subsequent public panic about the safety of imported seafood has increased the cost of procuring some ingredients five-fold.“Our goal for the next year is to just survive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-year-on-wuhan-market-at-epicentre-of-covid-19-outbreak-remains-barricaded-and-empty/story-FlCvn5ugYbGFFxdc5E0RLJ.html

The company was notified that if it wished to carry out work they would need to first obtain the appropriate mitigation and a Natural England European Protected Species licence.All bats within the UK are covered under the European Protected Species (EPS) regulations and receive full protection under the Conservation of Species and Habitats regulations 2010, which makes it an absolute offence to deliberately capture, injure or kill any of the EPS, or to deliberately disturb them, or to damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place.The company had not applied for licence from Natural England and following the police investigation, the company was charged on in November 2019. It pleaded guilty this week of carrying out the construction activity and destroying/damaging the breeding site in March 2018.Inspector David Hawtin of the Greenwich Safer Neighbourhoods Team said: “The success of this case has been the result of diligent investigation…With the expert assistance of colleagues from specialist units within the Metropolitan Police Service, the officers constructed evidence to prove that the company had indeed committed an offence by carrying out work at a site where bats were known to inhabit”.“Bellway Homes has admitted responsibility for this and I hope it reinforces the message that this legislation is there for a reason and should be adhered too,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-builder-destroyed-breeding-site-of-bats-fined-600-000/story-a4Nf3wfJz8dP17zuxd3IWM.html

Brandon Bernard, 40, was given the death penalty for his involvement in the murder of a religious couple from Iowa in June 1999.According to the US Department of Justice, Bernard and his accomplices robbed the two ministers, Todd and Stacie Bagley, and forced them into the trunk of their car in Texas. The couple were shot by 19-year-old accomplice Christopher Vialva before Bernard set the car alight.Several high-profile individuals, including Kim Kardashian West, had appealed to Trump to commute the death sentence to life in prison. Five of the nine surviving jurors on the case had also urged Trump to grant clemency to Bernard, who was in his teen when the crime was committed. Bernard received a lethal injection of phenobarbital at a US prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. He was pronounced dead at 9.27pm local time on Thursday at the penitentiary.Also Read | US carries out rare execution during presidential transitionPresident Donald Trump resumed federal executions in July and four more executions are planned before president-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on January 20, 2021.

Federal minister of public services and procurement Anita Anand echoed that mood in the House of Commons. “This has been a wonderful week for Canadians. We are going to have vaccines in this country on Monday.”The news has been a welcome relief for Canadians, with provinces recording new highs in infections during the second wave of the coronavirus crisis in the country. The death toll has reached 13,109, taking just 11 days to add more than 1,000 fatalities. The total infections number at 441,705.The outlet Global News reported that the advantage the Moderna vaccine has over the Pfizer version is that it can be stored at – 20 degree Celsius, where normal refrigeration systems could suffice, whereas the latter requires ultracold –70 degree C conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-nod-to-pfizer-canada-likely-to-approve-moderna-s-covid-vaccine-by-year-end/story-gfvFCUFLvc7hHkmGlnIWRO.html
11-12-2020||World||No-trade deal Brexit now more likely than a deal: EU chief||Britain is now more likely to leave the European Union’s orbit on Dec. 31 without a trade deal than with an agreement, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the bloc’s 27 national leaders on Friday, an EU official said.The United Kingdom quit the EU in January but remains an informal member until Dec. 31 when it will finally leave the bloc’s orbit after 48 years. Both sides say they want a trade deal but negotiations are deadlocked.After British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday there was “a strong possibility” a deal would not be clinched, von der Leyen said the probability of a no-deal had risen.“The probability of a no deal is higher than of a deal,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity about the message von der Leyen gave leaders at an EU summit in Brussels.Johnson and von der Leyen have given negotiators until Sunday evening to break the impasse over fishing rights and allowing Britain to be punished if in the future it diverged from the bloc’s rules.“Situation is difficult. Main obstacles remain,” the EU official said of von der Leyen’s message. “To be seen by Sunday whether a deal is possible.”Sterling tumbled, stocks fell and implied volatility surged as investors started to price in the risk of a chaotic finale to the five-year Brexit crisis. The pound fell 0.8% against the dollar to $1.3190 before recovering somewhat.A no-trade deal Brexit would damage the economies of northern Europe, send shockwaves through financial markets, snarl borders and sow chaos through the delicate supply chains which stretch across Europe and beyond.Most major investment banks still say a deal is their central prediction, but some investors recall that Wall Street and the City of London were poorly prepared for the 2016 referendum as few believed Britain would vote to leave.Theatrics?While some EU diplomats have cast Johnson’s rhetoric as theatrics intended to wrench out a deal and please his domestic Brexit supporters, British officials say London cannot accept the EU’s demands and caution that a no-deal is on the cards. British Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said there was still a chance of an agreement but added that no British leader could accept the EU’s demands. “Still, I think, there is a significant possibility that we could get that deal,” Dowden, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum, told Sky News. “That deal cannot come at any price.”British and EU negotiators seeking a new arrangement on nearly $1 trillion in annual trade have been stuck on two main issues for weeks: how much fish EU boats can take from British waters and how far the EU can tie Britain into its rules in the future. Trucks heading towards the English port of Dover were stacked up for miles on Thursday.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said there was a limit to the central bank’s ability to avoid all disruption or volatility in financial markets after Britain’s Brexit transition period - during which it has remained in the EU single market and customs union - ends on Dec. 31.“I don’t want us to be in a situation, were it to occur, where people say ‘well you haven’t done this and you haven’t done that’ but I have to say there is a limit to what we can do,” Bailey told a news conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-trade-deal-brexit-now-more-likely-than-a-deal-eu-chief/story-H4lwDYIpX5oVEPysrmnfyO.html

The United States leads the tally with 16,039,393 cases reported so far. There are some who have reported one or less than 20 cases of the respiratory disease.Here are the top 10 countries with the lowest number of Covid-19 cases:VanuatuVanuatu has reported only one coronavirus disease case till date, a 23-year-old American tourist who tested positive on November 10. Vanuatu imposed domestic and international travel restrictions after the American national tested positive and extended the necessary quarantine period from 14 t0 28 days.According to the island nation’s English newspaper the Daily Post on Wednesday, Vanuatu’s Prime Minister Bob Loughman said the nation has contained its first Covid-19 case after test results from the first Covid-19 patient sent to Australia for further examination came back negative.SamoaThe Pacific nation of Samoa reported its first case of coronavirus disease in November according to The Guardian, after reporting zero cases for 11 months since the pandemic started. The Samoan national who tested positive had been brought back home on a repatriation flight from Australia and the second case was detected within days. It was another sailor who had travelled on a repatriation flight from New Zealand. Both have since recovered, according to worldometer.Wallis and FutunaThe French Polynesian nation of Wallis and Futuna officially reported its first case of Covid-19 in October. Patient zero was reported to be asymptomatic by state media. On November 12 and 24, the second and third cases were reported taking the total to three. Patient zero has since then recovered, according to worldometer. The state authorities moved swiftly and imposed restrictions on travelling. Only travellers who can prove that entry is for urgent family/work reasons were allowed to enter Wallis and Futuna. They were expected to complete a travel certificate, stating that they do not have any coronavirus disease-related symptoms or have been in contact with anyone who has exhibited said symptoms.Marshall IslandsLike most Pacific islands the Marshall Islands too closed its borders in March to protect its population from the coronavirus disease. In October, two cases were detected in a US military base after a man and a woman tested positive. They flew in from Hawaii on a military plane and were asymptomatic, according to the BBC.AnguillaAnguilla reported its first cases of Covid-19 as early as March when an American woman and an Anguillan man who had been in contact with each other tested positive. Since then, 10 coronavirus disease cases have been reported, and seven people have recovered so far, according to worldometer. Anguilla’s health infrastructure is terribly underfunded hence the Caribbean island has been on high alert since March.Western SaharaWestern Sahara has reported 10 cases of Covid-19 so far and one fatality. Eight people have also reportedly recovered, according to worldometer.MontserratThe Caribbean island of Montserrat reported 13 cases of Covid-19, with the first case reported as early as March. So far, 12 cases have witnessed a full recovery and one death, that of a 92-year-old woman, has been recorded in the island, according to worldometer.Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Pierre and Miquelon reported 14 coronavirus disease cases and all 14 have successfully recovered, as per data provided by the worldometer.Solomon IslandsThe Solomon Islands reported 17 cases of coronavirus disease and the first was reported on October 3 after a student repatriated from the Philippines tested positive. The islands have witnessed five recoveries so far and no fatalities, according to worldometer.Falkland IslandsFalkland Island reported 17 cases of Covid-19 and all of them have successfully recovered, as per worldometer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-here-are-10-least-affected-countries-in-the-world/story-POuoRv7L4BDSOgpNdMjY9N.html
11-12-2020||World||EU leaders agree to reduce emissions after night-long discussions||European Union leaders reached a hard-fought deal Friday to cut the bloc’s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by the end of the decade compared with 1990 levels, avoiding a hugely embarrassing deadlock ahead of a UN climate meeting this weekend.Following night-long discussions at their two-day summit in Brussels, the 27 member states approved the EU executive commission’s proposal to toughen the bloc’s intermediate target on the way to climate neutrality by mid-century, after a group of reluctant, coal-reliant countries finally agreed to support the improved goal.“Europe is the leader in the fight against climate change,” tweeted EU Council president Charles Michel as daylight broke over the EU capital city. “We decided to cut our greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% by 2030.”Five years after the Paris agreement, the EU wants to be a leader in the fight against global warming. Yet the bloc’s heads of state and government were unable to agree on the new target the last time they met in October, mainly because of financial concerns by eastern nations seeking more clarity about how to fund and handle the green transition.But the long-awaited deal on a massive long-term budget and coronavirus recovery clinched Thursday by EU leaders swung the momentum.Large swaths of the record-high 1.82 trillion-euro package are set to pour into programs and investments designed to help the member states, regions and sectors particularly affected by the green transition, which are in need of a deep economic and social transformation. EU leaders have agreed that 30% of the package should be used to support the transition.Still, agreeing on common language was not an easy task. Negotiations were punctuated throughout the night by intense discussions in the plenary session and multiple chats in smaller groups on the sidelines.Another delay in revising the EU’s current 40% emission cuts objective for 2030 would have been particularly embarrassing before the virtual Climate Ambition Summit marking five years since the Paris deal, and leaders worked to the wire to seal a deal.The event on Saturday will be co-hosted by the UK with the United Nations and France. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week he wants the UK to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% from 1990 levels by 2030 — a more ambitious goal than the EU’s.Poland, which last year didn’t commit to the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality goal, and other eastern countries, including the Czech Republic and Hungary, largely depend on coal for their energy needs. They considered it unfair that all member states should be submitted to the same ambition without considering their respective energy mixes.To win their approval, member states agreed that the new target should be delivered collectively. According to the Belgian Prime minister’s office, “leaders agreed that the cuts will be first achieved in sectors and countries where there is still plenty of room for improvement.”In addition, the European Commission will take into account specific national situations when drawing up the measures. A progress report will be submitted to the European Council in the spring.The accord also left the door open to member states to use gas or nuclear power as they drop fossil fuels. EU leaders agreed last year that nuclear energy would be part of the bloc’s solution to making its economy carbon neutral, and they reiterated Friday that they would respect member states’ rights to decide on their energy mix and to choose the most appropriate technologies to reach the goal.According to a French official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the meeting, Poland also obtained guarantees that the EU’s Emissions Trading System — a cap-and-trade scheme for industries to buy carbon credits covering about 40% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions — would be revamped. Poland wants the reform of the system to redirect more revenues to the poorer EU countries.World leaders agreed five years ago in Paris to keep the global warming increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) by the end of the century. Under the Paris accord, countries are required to submit updated climate targets by the end of this year.Greenpeace and other environmental groups have said the improved EU target is insufficient to properly tackle climate change.“To increase the chances of limiting global heating to 1.5°C and avoid the worst effects of climate breakdown, Greenpeace is calling for at least a 65% cut in EU emissions from polluting sectors by 2030,” the NGO said.Climate Action Network Europe regretted that the revised “net” target includes carbon sinks like reforestation, meaning that emitting sectors will need to decarbonize less to reach the new goal.“As the Commission indicates itself in its 2030 Climate Target Plan, if the EU is successful in implementing the Commission’s biodiversity, carbon removals could represent up to 5% of emissions. In this case the real emissions reduction target would be as low as 50%,” the NGO said.EU leaders also encouraged the commission to propose a carbon tax at the bloc’s borders for countries that did do not regulate CO2 emissions as strictly as the EU does.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-leaders-agree-to-reduce-emissions-after-night-long-discussions/story-BIDTREmqAo4ssIkFNvMmxH.html
11-12-2020||World||AstraZeneca and Russia announce collaboration on Covid-19 vaccine trials||Britain’s AstraZeneca said on Friday it would investigate combining its experimental Covid-19 vaccine with Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine candidate, a move Russian scientists have suggested could sharply boost efficacy.The developers of Sputnik V suggested on Twitter last month that AstraZeneca try the combination.“Sputnik V is happy to share one of its two human adenoviral vectors with AstraZeneca to increase the efficacy of (the) AstraZeneca vaccine. Using two different vectors for two vaccine shots will result in higher efficacy than using the same vector for two shots,” they said on Nov. 23.Click here for complete coverage on Covid-19In its statement on Friday, AstraZeneca said it was considering how it could assess combinations of different vaccines, and would soon begin exploring with Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, which developed Sputnik V, whether two common cold virus-based vaccines could be successfully combined.Data published in a journal this week showed that AstraZeneca’s vaccine, being developed along with The University of Oxford, has average efficacy of 70.4%, based on a pooled analysis of interim data from late stage trials.Also Read | US should not wait too long on AstraZeneca vaccine, Oxford’s Hill saysRussia has claimed Sputnik V is 92% effective at protecting people from Covid-19, according to interim trial results.Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which has funded Sputnik V, said: “This shows the strength of Sputnik V technology and our willingness and desire to partner with other vaccines to fight against Covid together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-and-russia-announce-collaboration-on-vaccine-trials/story-nknyP4In6vPLwLkoNEGGeM.html
11-12-2020||World||South-East Asia Region: WHO, regulators and manufacturers discuss fast-tracking of Covid vaccine roll-out||The World Health Organization (WHO), national regulatory authorities and vaccine manufacturers in WHO South-East Asia Region on Friday discussed fast tracking of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine rollout in member countries. “The vaccine manufacturing and regulatory sectors have a critical role to play in equitable and efficient deployment of vaccines,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia Region, at the two-day virtual meeting that ended today. The meeting deliberated processes and timelines to fast-track registration of Covid-19 vaccines in countries using the Emergency Use Listing procedures while comprehending the landscape of Covid-19 vaccine production in the region. Aimed at strengthening collaboration between national programmes, vaccine producers and regulators in the region for Covid-19 vaccine deployment, the meeting provided a platform for interaction and experience sharing for vaccine registration, deployment and regulation. Also read | India’s daily Covid tally falls below 30k for second time in 3 days, recoveries nearing 9.3 millionAmong the vaccine manufacturers, from India Bharat Biotech International Ltd, Biological E Ltd, Cadila Healthcare Ltd, Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Wockhardt Limited; from Indonesia Bio Farma Limited, and from Thailand Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO), Bionet Asia Co.Ltd and Siam Bioscience, participated in the meeting. The regional director said all countries in the region are now developing and finalising national deployment and vaccination plans for Covid-19, of which regulatory preparedness is a core component. Establishing expedited regulatory pathways for vaccine approval and adjusting regulatory pathways to the type of vaccine that is developed and filed for approval remains critical as emergency use authorisation will precede full licensure, Dr Khetrapal Singh said. While vaccine licensure systems may need to be modified, having standard operating procedures and stipulated timelines for emergency use authorisation would be vital, she said. The regional director emphasised on effective coordination, collaboration and information-sharing. From R&D to production, and from information on country readiness to post-marketing surveillance, manufacturers, regulators, policy-makers and planners must continue to work together to optimise and refine vaccine deployment. “Countries in our region are among the world’s largest vaccine manufacturers, and the vaccines produced here are likely to be administered to billions of people globally. I am certain that together, in solidarity with all people of the region and the world, you will effectively contribute to health and well-being of all,” Dr Khetrapal Singh said. Key global and regional partners such as GAVI and UNICEF participated in the meeting. This was the second such meeting with vaccine manufacturers and regulators organised in WHO South East Asia Region, with the first held in April. WHO has been supporting member countries of the region prepare for COVID-19 vaccines. A special session of the WHO South-East Asia Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group was organised in November. The expert group made a series of recommendations, including a fast tracking of the development of national deployment and vaccination plan, the application of guidelines provided by the ‘Values framework for the allocation and prioritisation of Covid-19 vaccines’ and the prioritisation roadmap to identify priority populations and ensuring equity in delivery of Covid-19 vaccines, especially during the early stages when vaccine supply is expected to be limited. The expert group also recommended that all countries should ensure availability of high-quality, complete and timely Covid-19 surveillance data on all risk groups, including migrants and remote or displaced populations, for decision-making related to vaccination. While establishing collaboration with other health programmes and sectors for optimum delivery of vaccine, countries should also leverage their experience in vaccine delivery platforms for adults, including experience with seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination and measles and rubella and Japanese encephalitis vaccination campaigns, to find effective ways to reach eligible adults with Covid-19 vaccines. Adjustments should be made to vaccination strategies in accordance with the Covid-19 prevention measures and plans developed for demand generation, community engagement and risk communication, with special consideration for overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Countries should leverage the use of existing networks, including those for polio, to support the deployment of Covid-19 vaccines where appropriate. The expert group highlighted the need for all countries to assess available cold chain space and meticulously plan cold chain requirement, including necessary improvements in storage, stock management, vaccine delivery strategy and waste management. Earlier, WHO organised a meeting of cold chain managers of countries of the South-East Asia Region to help assess cold chain needs, identify gaps and plan for appropriate measures. At the global level since April, the ACT-Accelerator partnership, launched by WHO and partners, has supported the fastest, most coordinated, and successful global effort in history to develop tools to fight Covid-19. Its vaccine pillar -- COVAX -- is co-led by WHO, Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. It aims to accelerate the development and manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines, and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-national-regulators-and-vaccine-manufacturers-in-south-east-asia-region-discuss-fast-tracking-covid-vaccines/story-thk4e4GMqYLyaj6hUISMVJ.html
11-12-2020||World||US carries out rare execution during presidential transition||The Trump administration Thursday carried out its ninth federal execution of the year in what has been a first series of executions during a presidential lame-duck period in 130 years, putting to death a Texas street-gang member in the slayings of a religious couple from Iowa more than two decades ago.Four more federal executions, including one Friday, are planned in the weeks before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration. One was carried out in late November.The case of Brandon Bernard, who received a lethal injection of phenobarbital at a US prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, was a rare execution of a person who was in his teens when his crime was committed.Several high-profile figures, including reality TV star Kim Kardashian West, had appealed to President Donald Trump to commute Bernard’s sentence to life in prison.With witnesses looking on from behind a glass barrier separating them from a pale-green death chamber, the 40-year-old Bernard was pronounced dead at 9:27pm Eastern time.He directed his last words to the family of the couple he played a role in killing, speaking with striking calm for someone who knew he was about to die.“I’m sorry,” he said, lifting his head and looking at witness-room windows. “That’s the only words that I can say that completely capture how I feel now and how I felt that day.”As he spoke, he showed no outward signs of fear or distress, speaking lucidly and naturally. He spoke for more than three minutes, saying he had been waiting for this chance to say he was sorry — not only to the victims’ family, but also for the pain he caused his own family.Referring to his part in the killing, he said: “I wish I could take it all back, but I can’t.”Bernard was 18 when he and four other teenagers abducted and robbed Todd and Stacie Bagley on their way from a Sunday service in Killeen, Texas, during which Bernard doused their car with lighter fluid and set it on fire with their bodies in the back trunk.Federal executions were resumed by Trump in July after a 17-year hiatus despite coronavirus outbreak in US prisons.Todd Bagley’s mother, Georgia, spoke to reporters within 30 minutes of the execution, saying she wanted to thank Trump, Attorney General William Barr and others at the Justice Department.“Without this process,” she said, reading from a statement, “my family would not have the closure needed to move on in life.” She called the killings a “senseless act of unnecessary evil.”But she stopped reading from the prepared text and became emotional when she spoke about the apologies from Bernard before he died Friday and from an accomplice, Christopher Vialva, the ringleader of the group who shot the Bagley’s in the head before the car was burned. He was executed in September.“The apology and remorse ... helped very much heal my heart,” she said, beginning to cry and then recomposing herself. “I can very much say: I forgive them.”Earlier inside the death chamber, Bernard lay on a cross-shaped gurney with IV lines running into both arms. He looked back when a U.S. marshal picked up a phone and asked if there were any reasons not to proceed. Bernard reacted calmly as the marshall put down the phone and said the execution could proceed.Bernard didn’t exhibit the labored breathing and constant twitching of others executed previously had. A minute after the lethal injection, his eyes slowly closed and he barely moved again.About 20 minutes later, faint white blotches appeared on his skin and someone entered from a chamber door, listened to his heart, felt for a pulse, then walked out. Seconds later, an official said Bernard was dead.Alfred Bourgeois, a 56-year-old Louisiana truck driver, is set to die Friday for killing his 2-year-old daughter by repeatedly slamming her head into a truck’s windows and dashboard. Bourgeois’ lawyers alleged he was intellectually disabled and therefore ineligible for the death penalty, but several courts said evidence didn’t support that claim.Before Bernard’s execution, Kardashian West tweeted that she’d spoken to him earlier: “Hardest call I’ve ever had. Brandon, selfless as always, was focused on his family and making sure they are ok. He told me not to cry because our fight isn’t over.”Just before the execution was scheduled, Bernard’s lawyers filed papers with the Supreme Court seeking to halt the execution, but the high court denied the request, clearing the way for the execution to proceed.Bernard had been crocheting in prison and even launched a death-row crocheting group in which inmates have shared patterns for making sweaters, blankets and hats, said Ashley Kincaid Eve, an anti-death penalty activist.Federal executions during a presidential transfer of power also are rare, especially during a transition from a death-penalty proponent to a president-elect like Biden opposed to capital punishment. The last time executions occurred in a lame-duck period was when Grover Cleveland was president in the 1890s.Defense attorneys have argued in court and in a petition for clemency from Trump that Bernard was a low-ranking member of the group. They say both Bagleys were likely dead before Bernard set the car on fire, a claim that conflicts with government testimony at trial.The case prompted calls for Trump to intervene, including from one prosecutor at his 2000 trial who now says racial bias may have influenced the nearly all-white jury’s imposition of a death sentence against Bernard, who is Black. Several jurors have also since said publicly that they regret not opting for life in prison instead.The teenagers approached the Bagleys in the afternoon on June 21, 1999, and asked them for a lift after they stopped at a convenience store — planning all along to rob the couple. After the Bagleys agreed, Vialva, the oldest of the group at 19, pulled a gun and forced them into the trunk.The Bagleys, both of whom were in their 20s, spoke through an opening in the back seat and urged their kidnappers to accept Jesus as they drove around for hours trying to use the Bagleys’ ATM cards. After the teens pulled to the side of the road, Vialva walked to the back and shot the Bagleys in the head.The central question in the decision to sentence Bernard to death was whether Vialva’s gunshots or the fire set by Bernard killed the Bagleys.Trial evidence showed Todd Bagley likely died instantly. But a government expert said Stacie Bagley had soot in her airway, indicating smoke inhalation and not the gunshot killed her. Defense attorneys have said that assertion wasn’t proven. They’ve also said Bernard believed both Bagleys were dead and that he feared the consequences of refusing the order of the higher ranking Vialva to burn the car to destroy evidence.The first series of federal executions over the summer were of white men. Four of the five inmates set to die before Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration are Black men. The fifth is a white woman who would be the first female inmate executed by the federal government in nearly six decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-carries-out-rare-execution-during-presidential-transition/story-PL5NGhQ0flVe1qwoThEFoI.html
11-12-2020||World||Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai charged under security law||Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under the city’s national security law, amid a widening crackdown on dissent, according to local media reports.Lai, who founded the Apple Daily tabloid, was charged on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security, local broadcaster TVB reported Friday. He is the most high-profile person out of more than two dozen charged under the law since it was implemented in June.He is scheduled to appear in court on Dec. 12, and could face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.Police said in a statement that they arrested a 73-year-old man under the national security law, but did not name him.Lai was arrested under the national security law in August. He and two executives of Next Digital, the company that operates the Apple Daily newspaper, were later charged with fraud over accusations that they violated lease terms on office space the company. He was denied bail earlier this month.Beijing imposed the national security law in response to protests in Hong Kong that began in June 2019 over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.The legislation outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong’s internal affairs. In certain cases, those charged under the national security law could also face trial in mainland China, where the legal system is highly opaque.The sweeping legislation prompted more public protests and led to complaints that Beijing is violating the autonomy promised to Hong Kong when was handed over to China from Britain in 1997. Critics have said the law is also damaging Hong Kong’s status as a business center.Apple Daily criticized the law on its front page on July 1, calling it the “final nail in the coffin” of the territory’s autonomy.Lai has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and last year he traveled to the US to meet with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to discuss the proposed extradition bill.He was also arrested in February and April on charges of taking part in unauthorized protests. He also faces charges of joining an unauthorized vigil marking the anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-charged-under-security-law/story-f09yyXYWTsg4eEUbFNZ17N.html

Over 10,000 servicemen have already been vaccinated and around 100,000 servicemen should receive the vaccine by the end of the year.“Doctors planning to leave for military service, crews of the Navy’s vessels, flight personnel of the Russian Aerospace Forces, combat crews of the Strategic Missile Forces and command posts of all levels, and commanders of the armed forces’ units are the first in line to receive the vaccine,” Konashenkov said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-navy-aerospace-forces-to-be-vaccinated-first-says-defence-ministry/story-ZtJNSEiF2r6oVPgqkWTUaO.html
11-12-2020||World||US plans to sanction Turkey for purchasing Russian S-400 missiles||The US plans to impose sanctions on Turkey over its purchase of S-400 missiles after years of drama that began with the NATO ally’s decision to buy the air-defense system from Russia in 2017.President Donald Trump has signed off on a package of measures recommended by Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, according to two people familiar with the matter. The people didn’t say what the sanctions would include.The sanctions would be imposed under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, known as CAATSA. Trump, who has long highlighted his personal rapport with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had resisted bipartisan calls from Congress to punish Turkey for the deal with Russia.The White House National Security Council didn’t respond to a request for comment. Officials at the Treasury Department and State Department also didn’t respond.The lira fell after Reuters earlier reported that the sanctions would likely target Turkey’s defense officials, including the chief of the top defense procurement agency. The currency was trading 0.2% lower at 7.9011 per dollar at 9:33 a.m. in Istanbul.Ankara has argued that the air defense system is an urgent need given the military conflicts surrounding the country, and said allies including the US failed to offer it any alternatives -- such as the Patriot missile defense system -- on terms acceptable to Turkey.Turkey’s decision to buy the S-400 did have one cost: the country was essentially expelled from the US-led F-35 program. The country, a member of NATO, had planned to buy about 100 of the next-generation fighters built by Lockheed Martin Corp., and while Turkey continues to manufacture some key components for the fighter jet, that is expected to wind down in 2022.A chief US concern is that the S-400 could be used to collect intelligence on the stealth capabilities of the F-35.The relationship between Washington and Ankara has been fraught over a number of problems that go well beyond Turkey’s decision to buy advanced military hardware from Russia. The two nations are also at odds over US support for Syrian Kurdish militants who Turkey considers to be terrorists. Turkey has also clashed with the US in its conflict with Cyprus and Greece over maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-plans-to-sanction-turkey-for-purchasing-russian-s-400-missiles/story-vTXO6r45DhsqINZXw6HtUL.html
11-12-2020||World||Australia ends Covid-19 vaccine trials due to HIV antibody positives||Australia on Friday stopped the further development of a Covid-19 vaccine candidate as several participants in the early-stage trials generated antibodies for HIV after receiving the potential therapeutic. There were no serious adverse events or safety concerns reported in the 216 participants of the phase 1 trial of the v451 Covid-19 vaccine candidate being developed by the University of Queensland (UQ) in collaboration with biotech company CSL, according to a statement. However, data showed that some patients developed antibodies towards fragments of a HIV protein (gp41), which was used to stabilise the vaccine, it said. Following consultation with the Australian Government, UQ and CSL decided not to progress the vaccine candidate to phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The vaccine was one of four candidates that Australia had committed to buy and accordingly agreements were made to secure 51 million doses of the experimental vaccine. UQ said the trial participants were fully informed of the possibility of a partial immune response to this protein component, however, it was unexpected that the antibody levels induced would interfere with certain HIV tests. The university said there is no possibility the vaccine causes infection, and routine follow up tests confirmed there is no HIV virus present. The decision was taken after the makers consulted experts who worked out the “implications” that this issue presents to rolling out the vaccine into broad populations, it said. Reacting to the announcement, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said abandoning the trial should show Australians the Government and researchers were proceeding carefully. “What happened today is not a surprise to the Government. We are moving swiftly but not with any undue haste,” he said, adding the system’s working as it should and Australians are protected, as always. The University of Queensland commenced the phase 1 trial of v451 in July 2020, to assess its safety and immunogenicity in healthy volunteers. It said the vaccine candidate has shown that it elicits a robust response towards the novel coronavirus and has a strong safety profile. However, significant changes would need to be made to well-established HIV testing procedures in the healthcare setting to accommodate rollout of this vaccine, according to the statement. Although the makers have abandoned further trials, the university said the phase 1 trial will continue to assess how long the HIV antibodies persist, adding studies so far show that the levels are already falling. The University of Queensland also plans to submit the full data for peer review publication. UQ vaccine co-lead, Professor Paul Young, said that although it was possible to re-engineer the vaccine, the team did not have the luxury of time needed. “Doing so would set back development by another 12 or so months, and while this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone’s priority,” Young said. “I said at the start of vaccine development that there were no guarantees, but what is really encouraging is that the core technology approach we used has passed the major clinical test. It is a safe and well-tolerated vaccine, producing the strong virus-neutralising effect that we were hoping to see,” he said. Andrew Nash, Chief Scientific Officer for CSL noted that this outcome highlights the risk of failure associated with early vaccine development, and the rigorous assessment involved in making decisions as to what discoveries advance. Reacting to the announcement, Sanjaya Senanayake, a specialist in Infectious Diseases and Associate Professor of Medicine at The Australian National University, said while it is disappointing that an Australian vaccine candidate has been taken off the table, it is not surprising that one of the many COVID-19 vaccines has failed. “In general, about 90 per cent of vaccines never make it to market. As a global community, we have been spoilt with the unprecedented swiftness and success with which the development of COVID-19 vaccines have taken place,” Senannayake said. Diego Silva from Sydney Health Ethics in the University of Sydney School of Public Health noted that although the development might seem counter-intuitive, from a research ethics viewpoint, this is a success. “Science cannot be all about producing positive results; negative results will and must occur. Negative results are also as important as success in science, since they, too, form part of the evidence base for future research,” said Silva. “The researchers at UQ did the right thing by prioritising the safety of participants and the soundness of science by stopping when they did,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-ends-covid-19-vaccine-trials-due-to-hiv-antibody-positives/story-zpxw50w41tFvZmetL2bawM.html
11-12-2020||World||Sanofi, GSK Covid-19 vaccine to be ready only at the end of 2021||France’s Sanofi and Britain’s GSK said Friday their Covid-19 vaccines will not be ready until the end of 2021, after interim results showed a low immune response in older adults.The announcement is a huge setback in efforts to fight the pandemic, which first emerged in China last December and has killed over 1.5 million people worldwide.Sanofi and GSK said the delay in their adjuvanted recombinant protein-based Covid-19 vaccine programme was to “improve immune response in older adults.” The vaccine’s potential availability had been pushed back “from mid-2021 to Q4 2021,” they said in a statement.American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have said their vaccine had proven 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials involving more than 40,000 people.US experts voted Thursday to recommend granting emergency approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, paving the way for America to become the next country to move ahead with mass immunisation after the UK. Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have also approved it.The Sanofi-GSK candidate is based on technology that Sanofi has used to produce seasonal influenza vaccines and on immunological agents developed by GSK.“Phase 1/2 study interim results showed an immune response comparable to patients who recovered from Covid-19 in adults aged 18 to 49 years, but a low immune response in older adults likely due to an insufficient concentration of the antigen,” the statement said.It said a recent study in non-human primates using an improved antigen formulation demonstrated that the candidate could “protect against lung pathology and lead to rapid viral clearance from the nasal passages and lungs, within 2 to 4 days.” “These results increase the companies’ confidence in the capacity of the adjuvanted recombinant platform to deliver a highly efficient vaccine for all adults,” it said.The hunt for a vaccine brings up questions like whether unexpected safety issues may arise when the number of people vaccinated grows to millions and possibly billions of people.‘More than one vaccine needed’ Also unknown is whether more side effects will emerge, how long the vaccine remains effective, whether it will limit transmission and how it will work in children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised patients.“We care greatly about public health which is why we are disappointed by the delay announced today, but all our decisions are and will always be driven by science and data,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Head of Sanofi Pasteur.“We have identified the path forward and remain confident and committed to bringing a safe and efficacious Covid-19 vaccine,” he said.“There is no question of abandoning the vaccine,” he told AFP.Both Russia and China have already begun inoculation campaigns with domestically produced vaccines despite far less vetting, while several other vaccines are being developed in the West.Japan has formalised a deal with UK drugmaker AstraZeneca to receive 120 million doses of its coronavirus vaccines, the health ministry said Friday. Tokyo has also secured Covid-19 vaccines for 60 million people from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, and for a further 25 million people from biotech firm Moderna. Vaccination could start as early as March 2021, Kyodo News agency reported this week.“No single pharma company can make it alone; the world needs more than one vaccine to fight the pandemic,” Triomphe said.Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added: “The results of the study are not as we hoped. Based on previous experience and other collaborations, we are confident that GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system, when coupled with a Covid-19 antigen, can elicit a robust immune response.”The companies plan a Phase 2b study expected to start in February. If the data is positive, a global Phase 3 study could start in the second quarter of next year.“Positive results from this study would lead to regulatory submissions in the second half of 2021, hence delaying the vaccine’s potential availability from mid-2021 to Q4 2021,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sanofi-gsk-covid-19-vaccine-to-be-ready-only-at-the-end-of-2021/story-L0UN1IqKMWcn3noBkjT1KN.html
11-12-2020||World||Boris Johnson asks UK to prepare for no EU trade deal after Brexit||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned business and the public to prepare to leave the European Union’s (EU) single market without a trade deal as negotiations with the bloc falter.Speaking a day after crisis talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ended without a breakthrough, Johnson said Britain will continue to seek a deal. But he also warned that the bloc’s demand that the UK follow future changes in the EU’s rules is a major obstacle.“There’s now the strong possibility we will have a solution that’s much more like an Australian relationship with the EU than a Canadian relationship with the EU,” Johnson said in a pooled TV interview Thursday.“Looking at where we are, I do think it’s vital that everybody now gets ready for that Australian option,” he said. Under that option, the UK would fall back on the rules of the World Trade Organization and face tariffs as well as quotas when the transition ends on December 31.Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull later told the BBC’s “Question Time” program that his country doesn’t have a “satisfactory” trade relationship with the EU.“Be careful what you wish for: Australia’s relationship with the EU is not one, from a trade point of view, that Britain I think would want,” he said. “There are very big barriers to Australian exports, agricultural products in particular. There’s a lot of friction in the system in terms of services. So there’s a lot to aim for.”The pound extended its decline after Johnson’s intervention. His remarks couldn’t come at a more delicate time as EU leaders meet in Brussels after seeing off a threat by Hungary and Poland to block a $2.2 trillion stimulus package. At the same time, a much-touted UK trade deal with Canada has hit delays.Atmosphere SouredWith the mood in the Brexit negotiating room suddenly turning pessimistic, any deal with the UK is now likely to depend on a last-minute intervention by either German Chancellor Angela Merkel or France’s Emmanuel Macron. Both are in the middle of an EU summit in Brussels and are in a position to make a difference as the two major powerbrokers in the bloc.One EU official close to the Brexit discussions said that Johnson’s words are more conciliatory than they might look at first glance: the Prime Minister could have chosen to end the negotiations, but he didn’t. Another official in Brussels brushed off the Prime Minister’s statement, saying it wasn’t a surprise and leaders have other things to talk about.And another European diplomat who’s following the negotiations closely said gloomy warnings are to be expected at this point in the process. He said that while the outcome is clearly hanging in the balance, he’s still predicting a deal either on Sunday or in the following days.It’s been more than four years since the UK voted to leave the EU, and both sides have dealt with their fair share of drama and brinkmanship. This time, it feels different and they’ve had almost a year to settle the same old stubborn sticking points.Moving On?One EU diplomat said the bloc had mentally moved on. It is possible that the two sides could agree on a “friendly no-deal,” allowing trade talks to resume later in 2021, another EU official said.Indeed, the bloc unveiled its contingency plans, first reported by Bloomberg, that show in actions that there is very much a Plan B in place. They include keeping flights in the air and trucks on the road, with the idea that the talks will resume.The negotiations have long been dogged by the disagreements over the EU’s right to fish in British waters and the so-called level playing field rules for fair competition for business. There is still no sign of how the differences over the fair competition issue can be bridged, an EU official said earlier in the day.Johnson argues that, for reasons of sovereignty, Britain must not be forced to follow the EU’s competition rules as they evolve in future years.Johnson’s Red LineThe EU’s demand “basically means that whatever new laws they brought in, we would have to follow or else face punishment,” Johnson said. “Clearly that’s not a sensible way to proceed.”The EU says the UK must keep up with its changing regulations to protect the integrity of the bloc’s single market. Johnson likened that to treating the UK and the bloc like twins, with Britain “locked into the EU’s regulatory penumbra.”“If the EU decides to have a haircut, then the UK has got to have a haircut or else face punishment,” he said. “Or the EU decides to buy an expensive handbag, then the UK has to buy an expensive handbag too or else face tariffs and punishment.”He also rejected EU proposals on fisheries that would mean the UK still wouldn’t have control of its waters, many years after people voted to leave the EU.Both sides appear to be coming to terms with the fact that it may be impossible to reach a compromise. Failure to do so would deliver a major blow to pandemic-struck economies and disrupt supply chains for businesses.In another Brexit development, the UK published a document Thursday outlining how trade will work in Northern Ireland, and committed to covering the paperwork costs for businesses moving food into the province from Great Britain. Supermarkets had previously warned they may withdraw from Northern Ireland if they had to pay the costs.Johnson emphasized the UK hasn’t stopped trying.“What I’ve said to our negotiators is that we’ve got to keep going,” Johnson said. “And we’ll go the extra mile. And we will, and I will go to Brussels, I’ll go to Paris or go to Berlin, or wherever, to try to get this home and get to a deal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-asks-uk-to-prepare-for-no-eu-trade-deal-after-brexit/story-BhxTDIIsQw1eSMDrDuLzeL.html
11-12-2020||World||UN backs Afghan peace talks in resolution, Russia votes ‘no’||The UN General Assembly (UNGA) approved a resolution over Russian objections Thursday commending progress in peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban while urging stepped-up efforts to tackle terrorist attacks by the Taliban, al-Qaida, the Islamic State extremist group and their affiliates.The vote in the 193-member world body was 130 in favour, Russia against, and China, Pakistan, and Belarus abstaining. Fifty-nine countries did not vote.The 15-page resolution titled “The Situation in Afghanistan” covers a wide range of issues including peace and reconciliation, democracy, the rule of law, good governance, human rights, counter-narcotics, social and economic development and regional cooperation.While welcoming progress in the intra-Afghan talks, including the December 2 agreement on rules of procedure for negotiations, the resolution “condemns the high rate of continued violence.” It says this “is contributing to an unacceptable number of casualties” and calls for an immediate cessation of violence and strongly encourages the Afghan government and the Taliban “to pursue confidence-building measures and to reduce violence.”,The resolution reiterates the General Assembly’s “serious concern” about the security situation in Afghanistan and stresses the need to continue to address the threat to the country’s stability from violence committed by the Taliban, including the Haqqani Network, as well as al-Qaida, Islamic State, their affiliates “and other terrorist and criminal groups.”Afghanistan’s UN ambassador, Adela Raz, expressed regret that despite her government’s strong support for the resolution it wasn’t adopted by consensus, saying the measure reflects “developments that are taking place on the ground and particularly the progress in the peace process.”Raz said the goal of the government, Afghanistan’s neighbours and the General Assembly is to incorporate the Taliban as a political party. “It is our utmost aim to see the Taliban as a constructive political party in the country, without the relationship with al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, working for prosperity and peace in Afghanistan,” she said.Noting that UN experts monitoring sanctions against the Taliban say it “maintains ties to terrorist groups such as al-Qaida,” Raz said the resolution is balanced regarding “the Taliban’s willingness to take firm steps towards peace and reconciliation” and its continuing attacks and terrorist ties.German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, whose country led negotiations on the resolution, said that “out of all the `special years’ for Afghanistan declared in the past two decades, 2020 was indeed singular.” Most important was the start of Afghan peace negotiations in September, he said after detailing all the events leading to the talks, starting with the US-Taliban agreement in February.Heusgen also pointed to pledges of more than $13 billion in foreign aid and stabilization for Afghanistan at a donors conference in Geneva just over two weeks ago as evidence that “the international community stands firmly behind the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and its ongoing quest to achieve self-reliance.”He said the resolution is “constructive and forward-looking” and the vote signals that the General Assembly “stands behind the Afghan people in a very difficult period of the country.”Russia’s deputy UN ambassador, Anna Evstigneeva, sharply criticized Germany’s role in the negotiations, saying there was “blatant disregard” for Moscow’s concerns. She also said it is “an attempt to conceal the true scope” of threats from the Islamic State extremist group and drug issues threatening the country’s security.She accused Germany of having “a pre-established biased position favouring one group of states,” which she didn’t name, and said it should no longer facilitate negotiations on the Afghanistan resolution in the General Assembly.Nonetheless, Evstigneeva said, “we continue to support Afghanistan during this crucial period.”Germany’s Heusgen responded by saying Russia’s “no” vote sends the message that “Russia today let down the Afghan people.”“All of us should have voted in favor and should have sent a strong signal to the Afghan people: In these difficult times, we stand behind you,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-backs-afghan-peace-talks-in-resolution-russia-votes-no/story-fKuXBuAVw1m0U564AskMyK.html
11-12-2020||World||Joe Biden, Kamala Harris named Time ‘Person of the Year’||US President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have been chosen as Time magazine’s 2020 “Person of the Year,” the publication announced Thursday.The Democratic pair were chosen ahead of three other finalists: frontline health care workers and Anthony Fauci, the racial justice movement, and President Donald Trump who Biden defeated in November’s election. Time’s magazine cover has a picture of Biden, 78, and Harris, 56, with the subtitle “Changing America’s story.”Biden beat Trump by 306 electoral college votes to Trump’s 232 to end the real estate tycoon-turned-politician’s presidency after one term.Biden received roughly seven million more votes than his Republican adversary, who is yet to concede, claiming widespread fraud of which there is no evidence. Time magazine’s award -- handed out annually since 1927 -- honors the person or people who most impacted the news, for better or worse, during the calendar year.Earlier Thursday, Time named basketball superstar LeBron James Athlete of the Year for his achievements on and off the court.The 35-year-old Los Angeles Lakers player was honored for battling voter suppression among Black citizens in a year when he won his fourth NBA title. K-Pop sensation BTS was named Entertainer of the Year.Teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg was Time’s Person of the Year last year, while Trump won in 2016..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-kamala-harris-named-time-person-of-the-year/story-Eb6SpdTEkqDK6NEi7EnhxN.html
11-12-2020||World||US closer to Covid-19 vaccine as cases surge again||The US regulator of food and drug safety could grant emergency authorisation for Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine within hours or days now, after its advisers voted on Thursday to recommend its use for people over the age of 16, bringing hope to a country hit the hardest by the pandemic.The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory board voted after a day-long meeting that was streamed live to address concerns and scepticism about this vaccine and inoculation generally. “Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 16 years of age and older?” was the question put before the board for a vote.Seventeen members voted yes, four voted against and one abstained.The advisory team will take a similar vote on pharmaceutical company Moderna’s vaccine next week.Pfizer has said its vaccines, which have to be stored and transported at extremely low temperatures, will be ready to ship from storage facilities with 24 hours of getting the formal approval. They will be administered first to those at the highest risk: frontline healthcare workers and residents of nursing homes, and the elderly, who have borne the brunt of the deadly virus.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been approved already for use by the United Kingdom, which started administrating it Tuesday — with a man called William Shakespeare among the first recipients, and Canada. The US will be the third, but probably the most relieved given the scale of the devastation.The United States accounts for 15.5 million of the 69 million infections worldwide and more than 291,000 of the 1.5 million fatalities. With the onset of winter, it is experiencing a new surge in cases and deaths as people spend more time indoors. Over 221,000 new cases and 3,000 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours.Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has warned it will get worse: more people will die every day of Covid-19 than the toll of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 — a 9/11 every day, is how commentators are reporting his warning — for the next two or three months.President-elect Joe Biden welcomed the FDA development as “a bright light in a needlessly dark time” but pointed to the challenges ahead. “Vaccines don’t equal vaccinations,” he said. “Our challenge now is to scale up manufacturing and distribution to distribute 100 million shots in the first 100 days of my administration.”There had been no word from President Donald Trump on the development. From the string of his tweets, he appeared more focused on his efforts to overturn his election defeat and rallying Republican elected officials behind around his efforts, that include a long shot lawsuit in the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-closer-to-covid-19-vaccine-as-cases-surge-again/story-sJ91PabxxOmmFRBZO8QAbM.html
11-12-2020||World||Australia halts local Covid vaccine development due to HIV false positives||Australia abruptly halted the production of a home-made vaccine against Covid-19 after trials showed it could interfere with HIV diagnosis, the developers said, with its makers instead agreeing to produce additional doses of a rival vaccine.The inoculation being developed by the University of Queensland and vaccine maker CSL, one of four candidates contracted by the Australian government, was halted after “certain HIV diagnostic assays” returned false positives.While there were no serious adverse effects seen in the Phase 1 trial of 216 participants, data showed antibodies that had developed interfered with HIV diagnosis and led to false positives on some HIV tests, CSL said.Given the results, CSL said it had come to a decision with the Australian government to stop Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials of the vaccine.“This outcome highlights the risk of failure associated with early vaccine development, and the rigorous assessment involved in making decisions as to what discoveries advance,” said Andrew Nash, CSL’s chief scientific officer.The government had made a final decision “that the University of Queensland vaccine will not be able to proceed based on the scientific advice, and that will no longer feature as part of Australia’s vaccine plan,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Friday.CSL will instead produce an extra 20 million doses of a vaccine developed by Britain’s AstraZeneca Plc, on top of the 30 million it is already producing, while the government has also secured more doses of Novavax vaccines, with whom it already has supply contracts.Australia also has an agreement with Pfizer for 10 million dozes of its Covid-19 vaccine, with the country’s regulator expected to approve it by January 2021.All up, Australia has secured 140 million vaccine units to inoculate its 25 million people, one of the highest ratios of vaccine purchases to population in the world, officials said.Morrison said the government had not expected all four of the vaccine candidates it had chosen to come into production.“If that had occurred that would have been truly extraordinary,” he said. “So that’s why we spread our risk.”Australia is on track to start vaccinations in March and expects to have its whole population inoculated by the end of the year.Its tally of 28,000 Covid-19 infections is far fewer than many other developed countries, and until Thursday Australia had gone nearly three weeks without any local transmission of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-halts-local-covid-vaccine-development-due-to-hiv-false-positives/story-nEHq30COwHmXrU09s35uDM.html

Cases are rising – and in many areas, already high…We must not wait until the review which will take place on the 16 December. We need to take targeted action immediately”.There were 20,964 new cases across the UK as of Thursday evening, and 516 deaths. London recorded 4,144 new cases and 40 deaths, some of the highest figures in recent days. The first phase of vaccination in 73 hospitals across the UK includes those over 80 and healthcare professionals. It will be expanded to 10 more centres from Friday, with more due to be opened before Christmas.Hancock said: “The fall in the number of cases has flattened off – and is rising in some parts of the country...It shows us this fight is far from over and how we must all play our part and stay on our guard, now and through Christmas”.“We’ve got help on the horizon and we can all see that with the vaccine – so don’t blow it now…As more vaccines come on stream, we will open vaccination centres in larger venues, like sports stadia and conference halls next year and that’s when most people can expect to get their jabs”, he added.Urging Londoners to follow rules, Khan said: “None of us want our city to move into Tier 3. Please continue to follow the rules - lives and livelihoods truly are dependent on it”.Health officials are bracing for a spike in new cases over the Christmas period, when the government said rules will be relaxed for families to meet between December 23 and 28.Hancock said: “We’ve got to remember, in this battle, that we’re all on the same side. And, especially with Christmas coming, there’s something we all can do which is to respect the rules, and all of us, at all times, do all that we can to stop the spread of the virus”.“This is a marathon, not a sprint. We’ve got to keep going. The finish line is in sight”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/concerning-rise-in-covid-19-cases-puts-london-on-the-brink/story-akzTxkwmuYyJIHQwGxfbsL.html

Pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca among many others have developed vaccines to combat the disease and governments are opting for emergency approvals to administer shots to frontline workers, senior citizens and those most vulnerable to Covid-19. Pfizer’s vaccine is already approved for use in the United Kingdom, Bahrain and Canada while Moderna has started a study of its vaccine in adolescents as the United States begins to distribute the first shots among adults.Here are the latest updates on the coronavirus vaccine:1. An advisory panel of the United States government has endorsed widespread use of Pfizer’s vaccine, which puts the country just one step away from launching a vaccination drive to combat Covid-19. Shots might be administered within days, depending on how quickly the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) signs off on the panel’s recommendation. The country remains to be worst affected by the pandemic with over 16 million cases and nearly 300,000 deaths.2. Egypt on Thursday received its first shipment of a vaccine from China’s Sinopharm, which was tested in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and is said to be 86 per cent effective. Khaled Megahed, the health ministry spokesperson, stated that the government would first vaccinate health care workers, particularly those who are dealing with coronavirus cases adding they would receive two doses of the vaccine over a period of 21 days.Also Read: Survey identifies most vulnerable for Covid shot3. Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited, India’s largest hospital chain, said that it is ready to administer one million vaccine doses per day but said that the central government is not clear on how vaccines will be distributed and whether the private sector would be involved. The company, through its digital app, has told its clients that a shot should be available in 60-120 days and customers will be the first ones to know about the vaccines. Apollo has held talks with Adar Poonawalla’s Serum Institute of India (SII)- which is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer.4. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the government is scheduled to start a mass vaccination campaign on December 27 and added that the country is ready to make 60,000 vaccinations per day. The country has so far made deals with Pfizer, Moderna and other vaccine makers. Netanyahu over several months has faced criticism over his handling of the pandemic with citizens demanding his resignation.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic5. The Japanese government will purchase 10,500 deep freezers for storing vaccines. Japan has agreements to buy a total of 290 million doses of the vaccines from Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc. Nearly 169,000 people have been infected and 2,465 have died till now.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-updates-us-inches-towards-approving-pfizer-for-emergency-use-egypt-receives-1st-shipment-of-doses-from-china/story-xDs6pSjv67WDPlGDJwBheJ.html
11-12-2020||World||US set to execute 1st of 5 inmates before Joe Biden’s inauguration||The Trump administration is planning an unprecedented five more federal executions before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, starting with a Texas street-gang member set to be put to death Thursday for his role in the 1999 slayings of an Iowa religious couple whose bodies he burned in the trunk of their car.Brandon Bernard was 18 when he and four other teenagers abducted and robbed Todd and Stacie Bagley on their way from a Sunday service in Killeen, Texas. He would be the ninth federal inmate put to death since July, when President Donald Trump ended a 17-year hiatus in federal executions.If Bernard, now 40, receives a lethal injection as planned at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, it would be a rare execution of a person who was in his teens when the crime occurred.But there has been a growing groundswell by celebrities including Kim Kardashian who were pushing for the execution to be halted.Kardashian tweeted that she’d spoken to Bernard earlier. “Hardest call I’ve ever had. Brandon, selfless as always, was focused on his family and making sure they are ok. He told me not to cry because our fight isn’t over.”And just before the execution was scheduled, Bernard’s lawyers filed papers with the Supreme Court seeking to halt the execution. The legal team expanded to include two very high-profile attorneys: Alan Dershowitz, the retired Harvard law professor who was part of Donald Trump’s impeachment defense team and whose clients have included O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bulow and Mike Tyson; and Ken Starr, who also defended Trump during the impeachment and is most famous as an independent counsel who led the investigation into Bill Clinton.Bernard has been crocheting in prison and even launched a death-row crocheting group in which inmates have shared patterns for making sweaters, blankets and hats, said Ashley Kincaid Eve, an anti-death penalty activist.Eve forwarded to The Associated Press Bernard’s latest communication with her on Wednesday, in which wrote, “I feel good today!” Eve, who is an Indianapolis-based lawyer but has not represented Bernard, said he was not as resigned to dying as others executed this year have been.“He desperately wants to live,” she said.Federal executions during a presidential transfer of power also are rare, especially during a transition from a death-penalty proponent to a president-elect like Biden opposed to capital punishment. The last time executions occurred in a lame-duck period was during the presidency of Grover Cleveland in the 1890s.Defense attorneys have argued in court and in a petition for clemency from Trump that Bernard was a low-ranking, subservient member of the group. They say both Bagleys were likely dead before Bernard doused their car with lighter fluid and set it on fire, a claim that conflicts with government testimony at trial. Bernard, they say, has repeatedly expressed remorse.“I can’t imagine how they feel about losing their family,” Bernard said about surviving Bagley relatives in a 2016 video statement from death row. “I wish that we could all go back and change it.” He also described taking part in youth outreach programs and embracing religion, saying, “I have tried to be a better person since that day.”The case has prompted calls for Trump to intervene, including from one prosecutor at his 2000 trial who now says racial bias may have influenced the nearly all-white jury’s imposition of a death sentence against Bernard, who is Black. Several jurors have also since said publicly that they regret not opting for life in prison instead.Kardashian is among those who have asked Trump to stop the execution, saying in a series of recent tweets that Bernard’s “role was minor compared to that of the other teens involved.”The Justice Department refused to delay Thursday’s execution of Bernard, another inmate on Friday and three more in January, even after eight officials who participated in an execution last month tested positive for the coronavirus. The eight federal executions in 2020 already is more than in the previous 56 years combined.One of Bernard’s co-defendants, Christopher Vialva, was executed in September. Todd Bagley’s mother, Georgia, released a statement after that execution, saying, “I believe when someone deliberately takes the life of another, they suffer the consequences for their actions.”Prosecutors said Vialva, the oldest of the teens at 19, was the ringleader who shot the Bagleys, as they lay in the trunk before Bernard set the car on fire.The teenagers approached the Bagleys in the afternoon on June 21, 1999, and asked them for a lift after they stopped at a convenience store — planning all along to rob the couple. After the Bagleys agreed, Vialva pulled a gun and forced them into the trunk.The Bagleys, both of whom were in their 20s, spoke through an opening in the back seat and urged their kidnappers to accept Jesus as they drove around for hours trying to use the Bagleys’ ATM cards. After the teens pulled to the side of the road, Vialva walked to the back and shot the Bagleys in the head.The central question in the decision to sentence Bernard to death was whether Vialva’s gunshots or the fire set by Bernard killed the Bagleys.Trial evidence showed Todd Bagley likely died instantly. But a government expert said Stacie Bagley had soot in her airway, indicating smoke inhalation and not the gunshot killed her. Defense attorneys have said that assertion wasn’t proven. They’ve also said Bernard believed both Bagleys were dead and that he feared the consequences of refusing the order of the higher ranking Vialva to burn the car to destroy evidence.The first series of federal executions over the summer were of white men, which critics said seemed calculated to make them less controversial amid summer protests over racial discrimination. Four of the five inmates set to die before Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration are Black men. The fifth is a white woman who would be the first female inmate executed by the federal government in nearly six decades.The federal prosecutor who now wants a life term for Bernard, Angel Moore, says recent research shows people tend to view Blacks as more to blame than their white counterparts when the facts surrounding a crime are the same, and that young Black men are less likely to be given benefits of the doubt by jurors because of their immaturity.One juror whose 2016 written statement was included in the White House petition said he still believes Bernard is responsible for “horrible decisions that had horrendous outcomes” but that “I do not believe that Brandon should be executed for bad choices he made when he was 18.”Bernard’s 16-year-old daughter has said her father constantly warns her to stay away from the wrong crowds and how a single bad decision can ruin your life.She added: “I am hoping and asking the President to spare my dad’s life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-set-to-execute-1st-of-5-inmates-before-joe-biden-s-inauguration/story-7UekfYkQXJ43Ahcl5jeweN.html
11-12-2020||World||World carbon dioxide emissions drop 7 per cent in pandemic-hit 2020||A locked-down pandemic-struck world cut its carbon dioxide emissions this year by 7%, the biggest drop ever, new preliminary figures show.The Global Carbon Project, an authoritative group of dozens of international scientists who track emissions, calculated that the world will have put 37 billion U.S. tons (34 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide in the air in 2020. That’s down from 40.1 billion US tons (36.4 billion metric tons) in 2019, according a study published Thursday in the journal Earth System Science Data.Scientists say this drop is chiefly because people are staying home, traveling less by car and plane, and that emissions are expected to jump back up after the pandemic ends. Ground transportation makes up about one-fifth of emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief man-made heat-trapping gas.“Of course, lockdown is absolutely no the way to tackle climate change,” said study co-author Corinne LeQuere, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia.The same group of scientists months ago predicted emission drops of 4% to 7%, depending on the progression of COVID-19. A second coronavirus wave and continued travel reductions pushed the decrease to 7%, LeQuere said.Emissions dropped 12% in the United States and 11% in Europe, but only 1.7% in China. That’s because China had an earlier lockdown with less of a second wave. Also China’s emissions are more industrial based than other countries and its industry was less affected than transportation, LeQuere said.The calculations — based on reports detailing energy use, industrial production and daily mobility counts — were praised as accurate by outside scientists.Even with the drop in 2020, the world on average put 1,185 tons (1,075 metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air every second.Final figures for 2019 published in the same study show that from 2018 to 2019 emissions of the main man-made heat-trapping gas increased only 0.1%, much smaller than annual jumps of around 3% a decade or two ago. Even with emissions expected to rise after the pandemic, scientists are wondering if 2019 be the peak of carbon pollution, LeQuere said.“We are certainly very close to an emissions peak, if we can keep the global community together,” said United Nations Development Director Achim Steiner.Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, thinks emissions will increase after the pandemic, but said “I am optimistic that we have, as a society learned some lessons that may help decrease emissions in the future.”“For example,” he added, “as people get good at telecommuting a couple of days a week or realize they don’t need quite so many business trips, we might see behavior-related future emissions decreases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-drop-7-per-cent-in-pandemic-hit-2020/story-MDA2aJwcLZgiDFGtfttsTL.html
11-12-2020||World||US panel endorses widespread use of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine||A U.S. government advisory panel endorsed widespread use of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine Thursday, putting the country just one step away from launching an epic vaccination campaign against the outbreak that has killed close to 300,000 Americans.Shots could begin within days, depending on how quickly the Food and Drug Administration signs off, as expected, on the expert committee’s recommendation.“This is a light at the end of the long tunnel of this pandemic,” said Dr. Sally Goza, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.In a 17-4 vote with one abstention, the government advisers concluded that the vaccine from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech appears safe and effective for emergency use in adults and teenagers 16 and over.That endorsement came despite questions about allergic reactions in two people who received the vaccine earlier this week when Britain became the first country to begin dispensing the Pfizer-BioNTech shot.While there are a number of remaining unknowns about the vaccine, in an emergency, “the question is whether you know enough” to press ahead, said panel member Dr. Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He concluded that the potential benefits outweigh the risks.The decision came as Covid-19 cases surge to ever-higher levels across the U.S., with deaths setting an all-time, one-day record of more than 3,100 on Wednesday.Pfizer has said it will have about 25 million doses of the two-shot vaccine for the U.S. by the end of December. But the initial supplies will be reserved primarily for health care workers and nursing home residents, with other vulnerable groups next in line until ramped-up production enables shots to become widely available on demand — something that will probably not happen until the spring.Next week, the FDA will review a second vaccine, from Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, that appears about as protective as Pfizer-BioNTech’s shot. A third candidate, from Johnson & Johnson, which would require just one dose, is working its way through the pipeline. Behind that is a candidate from AstraZeneca and Oxford University.U.S. health experts are hoping a combination of vaccines will ultimately enable the U.S. to conquer the outbreak.But experts estimate at least 70% of the U.S. population will have to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, the point at which the virus can be held in check. That means it could be several months before things start get back to normal and Americans can put away their masks.All eyes now turn to the FDA staff scientists who will make the final decision of whether to press ahead with large-scale immunizations with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. FDA’s vaccine director Dr. Peter Marks said ahead of the expert meeting that a decision would come within “days to a week.”The independent review by non-government experts in vaccine development, infectious diseases and medical statistics was considered critical to boosting Americans’ confidence in the safety of the shot, which was developed at breakneck speed less than a year after the virus was identified.Regulators not only in Britain but in Canada have already approved the vaccine for use in their countries, and President Donald Trump and White House officials have complained for weeks about the pace of FDA’s careful review.“Americans want us to do a scientific review, but I think they also want us to make sure we’re not wasting time on paperwork as opposed to going forward with the decision,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said before the meeting.A positive vote for the vaccine was virtually assured after FDA scientists issued a glowing review of the vaccine earlier in the week. Agency staffers said data from Pfizer’s ongoing study of 44,000 people showed strong protection across different age groups, races and health conditions with no major, unexpected safety problems.The Pfizer-BioNTech shot remains experimental because that final-stage study isn’t complete. As a result, the expert panel wrestled with a list of questions that have yet to be answered.For example, while the vaccine is more than 90% effective in blocking the symptoms of Covid-19, the FDA’s advisers stressed it is not yet clear whether it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for up to half of all cases.“Even though the individual efficacy of this vaccine is very, very, very high, you really as of right now do not have any evidence” that it will lower transmission, said Dr. Patrick Moore of the University of Pittsburgh. He urged Pfizer to take additional steps to answer that question.Several of the dissenting panel members objected to authorizing the shot for 16- and 17-year-olds, given their small numbers in the study and the low risk they face from Covid-19.Members worried, too, that Pfizer will lose its opportunity to answer critical questions once it begins offering the real vaccine to study participants who had been getting dummy shots up to now.The company proposed gradually moving those patients to the vaccine group, with priority based on age, health conditions and other factors. Under that plan, 70-year-old participants would cross over before healthy 30-year-olds.Pfizer must still show whether the vaccine works in children younger than 16 and in pregnant women.On the safety front, as widespread vaccinations begin, the first recipients will be closely tracked by government health authorities since studies in tens of thousands of people can’t detect rare risks that strike 1 in a million. Hanging over the meeting were the British allergic reactions and a warning from authorities there that people with a history of serious reactions shouldn’t get the vaccine for now.Pfizer representatives said they have seen no signs of allergic reactions in their trial.
