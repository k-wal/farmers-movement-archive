In routine consular practice, Shahnawaz Noon [the Pakistani lawyer] was selected by our High Commission to appear in the case for release and repatriation of an Indian prisoner, Mohammad Ismail, who has completed his sentence but continues to be in jail in Pakistan,” Srivastava said at a weekly briefing.“However, during the proceedings of the case regarding Ismail, Pakistan Attorney General raised the matter pertaining to Jadhav though the two cases are not connected in any way, and Noon is reported to have made those statements about our Charge d’Affaires which are not true, and they are in contravention of our stand in this case,” he added.Srivastava said Noon did this under pressure and has misrepresented the position of the High Commission.But in a statement issued on Friday, the Pakistan Foreign Office said that, by casting aspersions on the Indian High Commission’s own legal counsel, the Indian government “is looking for an escape from the legal proceedings” the Jadhav case.“The government of India is reminded that in pursuance of the judgment of International Court of Justice (ICJ), Pakistan had invited the Indian High Commission to meet with Commander Jadhav and appoint a lawyer on his behalf so that proceedings to review and reconsider Commander Jadhav’s conviction could commence. “However, during the course of diplomatic exchanges, the Indian High Commission refused to instruct a lawyer itself, as in their view this would amount to a waiver of India’s sovereign immunity. Resultantly, the government of Pakistan was constrained to initiate proceedings for appointment of a state counsel for Commander Jadhav,” the statement said.It added: “During the course of the proceedings, to show the discrepancy in the Indian position,the Attorney-General for Pakistan cited the case of Mr Muhammad Ismail, an Indian national currently in custody in Pakistan, where the Indian High Commission had instructed Mr Noon as its lawyer.”No attempt was made to link the cases of Jadhav with Indian prisoner Ismail, Pakistan said, adding that the two cases are and remain entirely distinct. “Reference to the case of Mr Ismail was only for purpose of showing the discrepancy and inconsistency in the Indian position.”The statement reiterated that in line with the judgment of the ICJ, Pakistan has already provided consular access to the Indian High Commission twice and has taken all necessary steps for effective review and reconsideration in the case.The offer of a third consular access is still there.“The Indian side is once again urged to desist from the use of its usual diversionary and dilatory tactics and instead take practical steps so that legal proceedings could be duly concluded and full effect could be given to the judgment of ICJ,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-rejects-india-s-assertion-of-pressurising-kulbhushan-jadhav-s-lawyer/story-LS3fjpTsMlXo5Nt7NkEmIN.html

Gates said his charitable foundation was now using the couple’s experience to check the spread of Covid-19.Professor Salim Abdool Karim, who heads the South African government’s advisory team on Covid-19, has served on the Gates Foundation Scientific Advisory Board for 10 years. He also chairs the WHO Scientific Committee on HIV. “Drawing on their experiences from HIV and TB (tuberculosis), they are helping guide the Covid-19 response in South Africa and around the world,” Gates said. The Microsoft founder said the motto at Caprisa has impressed him. The motto is ‘Each day that you come to work, you should be looking for how today is going to be better than yesterday.’ Salim said one in every fifth person infected with HIV in the world is South African and that statistic motivated him and his wife to take up the mantle against HIV. “Very early on, we both realised that we could pioneer and find new ways to treat and prevent HIV. We’ve now been able to manufacture these broadly neutralising antibodies. “We will be injecting it into young women to test whether it’s safe and then we want to see if it does prevent HIV. If it can, it will change the course of the HIV epidemic in Africa,” he said. Quarraisha said she had learnt that epidemiology, a science, also has a social justice component to it. “Women bear about four times more infection compared to men. Our work as scientists is to try to find technologies that women can use to prevent HIV infection, especially those women who are unable to negotiate the traditional safer sex practices,” she said. “We’ve managed to reduce transmission, but there are still close to a million women dying of AIDS. That shouldn’t be happening,” said Salim, who in May this year was forced to take to social media to dismiss as fake news that he had received a grant of 944 million Rand in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. “Because I am an adviser to the Gates Foundation, I do not have grant funding from Gates. Please convey the truth to help stop this fake news,” the professor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-hails-indian-origin-couple-for-pioneering-work-in-fight-against-hiv-covid-19/story-HvLO33jwtUByycGQVeCDuI.html

How to stimulate the economy and yet at the same time reduce our budget deficit? The only way we can have the fiscal space to maintain and revive growth is through access to additional liquidity,” the Pakistan prime minister said.Khan told his audience that rich countries have injected $13 trillion as fiscal stimulus to revive their economies but the developing countries did not have that much resources. Pakistan, he said, is also committed under an IMF programme to reduce the budget deficit.The Pakistan PM talked at length on the dangers developing countries faced and said that the effects of economies collapsing could be catastrophic. He also shared the losses the Pakistan economy has faced owing to the Covid pandemic.The Pakistan PM said that his government’s strategy had worked for the first wave as they had imposed smart lockdowns. Owing to this, the daily wagers had not suffered unnecessarily. At the same time the Pakistan PM warned that the second wave had started to paralyse life in parts of Pakistan.“Our efforts were aimed at ensuring that not only do we save people from the virus, but also prevent them from dying from hunger. We provided a relief package of around $8 billion – which was almost 3% of our GDP – to support the poor and to keep the economy afloat at the same time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-un-covid-meet-cash-strapped-pak-pm-seeks-debt-relief/story-7qli1NeooyE44dGxXbb21N.html
04-12-2020||World||EU police agency Europol warns of fake coronavirus vaccines||European Union police agency Europol issued a warning Friday highlighting the risk of organized crime scams linked to Covid-19 vaccines, including the possibility criminals will try to sell dangerous counterfeit vaccines or to hijack shipments of genuine shots.In an “early warning notification,” Europol said that crime gangs already have reacted to opportunities presented by the coronavirus pandemic.“Once a legitimate vaccine enters the market, counterfeited versions of the specific vaccine brand are expected to circulate rapidly,” the agency’s warning said, citing a phony flu vaccine that the World Health Organization discovered in Mexico in October.“Similar to the fake influenza vaccine encountered in Mexico, counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines may represent a significant public health threat if they are ineffective at best or toxic at worst, given their production in underground labs without hygiene standards,” Europol said. “Fake vaccines may even have a wider-reaching impact if new outbreaks emerge in communities assumed to be vaccinated.”The warning urged heightened vigilance by the EU’s 27 member nations and other countries to “the possible involvement of criminals in the vaccine development and distribution process.”Europol said the “expected arrival of a genuine Covid-19 vaccine has already inspired criminal activities and will likely be exacerbated once vaccines become available.”The statement came after Britain gave emergency approval Wednesday to a vaccine produced by US drugmaker Pfizer and Germany-based BioNTech, making Britain the first Western country to authorize a vaccine against the coronavirus.Europol, which is based in The Hague, said it was aware of criminals placing advertisements on dark web marketplaces “using the brands of genuine pharmaceutical companies that are already in the final stages of testing.”The police agency said criminal networks also could target the supply chain for genuine vaccines, such as by illegally refilling empty vials if they are not correctly disposed of or hijacking vehicles transporting shots.It urged EU members to share with Europol “any relevant information on criminal activities related to Covid-19 or flu vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-police-agency-europol-warns-of-fake-coronavirus-vaccines/story-tM6RWfMV8PqOvGoxDOYRcM.html
04-12-2020||World||First US delivery of Covid-19 vaccine will leave out many high-risk workers||The US government’s first shipment of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses to be divided among states and federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, will fall far short of protecting high priority groups such as healthcare workers, a Reuters analysis has found.Across the country, state health departments are preparing local hospitals for the first shipments of Pfizer Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine if the US Food and Drug Administration authorizes it, possibly as early as mid-December. The first shipment is expected to cover inoculations of 3.2 million people, nowhere near enough for the 21 million US healthcare workers. And government officials said initial shipments would also go to five government agencies including the Departments of Defense, State and the Veterans Health Administration.The subsequent two weekly vaccine distributions could cover 7 to 10 million people a week, provided a second vaccine - from Moderna Inc - is authorized early in the second half of December, and Pfizer meets its distribution estimates, according to data provided by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the companies. Federal officials have not disclosed exactly how many doses will be in later shipments. “For the time being, and the foreseeable future, the demand for vaccines is going to exceed the supply by a lot, even for the highest priority groups that are identified,” said Josh Michaud, Kaiser’s associate director of global health policy. States have the final word on how to distribute vaccines to their citizens, but federal officials have said that of some 330 million US residents, healthcare workers and those in nursing homes should be considered first for vaccines. Many states told Reuters that was their plan. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not respond to a request to comment. The Pentagon declined comment. HHS cited public comments from a Tuesday press call, in which officials said the first dose allocation will be the start of a steady stream of vaccine deliveries.SOME BETTER PROTECTED THAN OTHERS With early supplies limited, the federal government is allocating doses based on state populations, rather than the proportion of the populations at high risk. That means some states’ health workers will be better protected than others.Alabama for instance, will receive enough vaccine for around 17% of its healthcare workers, while Illinois could cover only 13%, according to data from state officials.The approach would initially leave out around 190,000 healthcare workers in Alabama and more than 570,000 in Illinois, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data on healthcare workers by state. More than 2 million healthcare workers in California will have to wait as early vaccine supplies are doled out, based on figures provided to Reuters by state officials. This first stage of the rollout illustrates the complexity of the government’s goal to vaccinate most Americans by mid-2021 to stall a pandemic that has so far claimed more than 273,000 US lives, with hundreds of thousands more deaths projected in the next few months.US officials maintain they will distribute 40 million doses by the end of the year - enough to inoculate 20 million people - with millions of shots shipping every week, assuming speedy approvals of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.Pfizer, which developed its vaccine with German partner BioNTech SE, told Reuters the United States will receive about half of the 50 million doses it will produce in 2020. Moderna’s vaccine could add at least another 12.5 million doses, federal officials have said.The CDC expects about 5 million to 10 million doses to be shipped per week in the first weeks of the US vaccine distribution effort.STATES PLAN FOR SHORTFALLStates meanwhile are preparing for the first distribution to fall short, as hospitals across the country grapple with record numbers of Covid-19 patients and staffing shortages. “Clinical staff are becoming infected, nurses and doctors. It’s creating a workforce crunch and the beds are filling up,” said Alan Morgan, chief executive of the National Rural Health Association, an advocacy group for rural hospitals. Arkansas’s state epidemiologist Jennifer Dillaha said vaccines are urgently needed to keep up with the surge in patients. “We want to ensure our hospital capacity as much as possible through vaccination for those healthcare workers who are at highest risk for infection,” she said. More than half a dozen states including Alabama, California, New Mexico, and Wisconsin, told Reuters the first allocation estimates they have been given would not be near enough to cover all their healthcare workers, let alone other high-priority residents. The size of initial allocation figures shared with Reuters ranges widely, from around 330,000 in California - the most populous US state - to less than 7,000 in North Dakota, which has 50,000 healthcare workers, according to Kaiser data and figures provided to Reuters by state officials.That means both states can vaccinate less than 20% of their healthcare workforce with the first shots. New York state will receive 170,000 shots initially, enough for roughly 13% of its healthcare workers.The US government expects the number of available doses to increase in January to about 60 million to 70 million.It has made deals for 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for $1.95 billion and 100 million of Moderna’s for $1.5 billion, with options to buy more. It expects vaccines to be free to most Americans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-us-delivery-of-covid-19-vaccine-will-leave-out-many-high-risk-workers/story-xe2JRVSRbVMMLzV1weD2SK.html
04-12-2020||World||Covid-19: What side effects to expect from a vaccine shot? Will it be more painful than flu vaccine?||Researchers usually take years to develop a vaccine as they collate data over a period of time to ensure that there are no harmful side effects after taking the shot. However, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) turned into a pandemic within weeks and claimed thousands of lives, prompting scientists to develop a vaccine within record time. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already ordered mass immunisation against Covid-19 with Sputnik V vaccine to control the surge in virus-related deaths. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom has also approved a Covid-19 vaccine, developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, for emergency use. The government is expected to roll out the vaccine next week.US biotech firms Pfizer and Moderna have submitted applications to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorisation as the United States continues to witness huge spike the Covid-19 cases and related deaths. Both companies have used new mRNA technology to develop the vaccines and have reported efficacy rate of around 95 per cent.Also Read | At 1,600 mn, India biggest buyer of Covid-19 vaccine doses: ReportWhat side effects to expect from a Covid-19 vaccine shot?While the companies have said that the vaccines are safe, many people still remain concerned about their side effects. The Data Monitoring Committee for the study of phase 3 trial of Pfizer’s vaccine has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. It reported some cases of fatigue and headache after the volunteers received the second dose of the vaccine.“The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2,” Pfizer said in a statement.Moderna has also reported that the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The first dose of the vaccine caused injection site pain in some of the volunteers and the second dose caused fatigue, pain, and redness at the injection site. The company said that these solicited adverse events were generally short-lived. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US’ top infectious disease expert, on Monday told Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg that the vaccine induces response and some people may feel an ache in the arm or get a fever. Dr Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that “almost all of this goes away within 24 or at the most, 48 hours.”“In some people, they don’t feel anything. Others feel an ache in the arm. Some may feel an ache in the arm and kind of a little chilly feeling, almost like you have a flu-like syndrome, and in a minority of people, they get a fever,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-what-side-effects-to-expect-from-a-vaccine-shot-will-it-be-more-painful-than-flu-vaccine/story-LddqC1531aJrM4tj0i0lIK.html

The capsule is to be released 220,000 kilometers (136,700 miles) away in space and land in a remote, sparsely populated area of Woomera, Australia, on Sunday.Hayabusa2 is flying smoothly according to plan, Yuichi Tsuda, project manager at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, said at a briefing ahead of the critical separation of the capsule from the spacecraft on Saturday.“We trained ourselves and now we are fully prepared. So I’m just praying that equipment that hasn’t been used yet will work well and that there will be good weather in Australia,” he said. “We are so excited.”In the early hours of Sunday, the capsule, protected by a heat shield, will briefly turn into a fireball as it reenters the atmosphere 120 kilometers (75 miles) above Earth. At about 10 kilometers (6 miles) above ground, a parachute will open to slow its fall and beacon signals will be transmitted to indicate its location.JAXA staff have set up satellite dishes at several locations in the target area to receive the signals, while also preparing marine radar, drones and helicopters to assist in the search and retrieval of the pan-shaped capsule, 40 centimeters (15 inches) in diameter.Scientists say they believe the samples, especially ones taken from under the asteroid’s surface, contain valuable data unaffected by space radiation and other environmental factors. They are particularly interested in analyzing organic materials in the samples.JAXA hopes to find clues to how the materials are distributed in the solar system and are related to life on Earth.For Hayabusa2, it’s not the end of the mission it started in 2014. After dropping the capsule, it will return to space and head to another distant small asteroid called 1998KY26 on a journey slated to take 10 years one way.So far, its mission has been fully successful. It touched down twice on Ryugu, despite its extremely rocky surface, and successfully collected data and samples during the 1½ years it spent near Ryugu after arriving there in June 2018.In its first touchdown in February 2019, it collected surface dust samples. In a more challenging mission in July that year, it collected underground samples from the asteroid for the first time in space history after landing in a crater that it created earlier by blasting the asteroid’s surface.Asteroids, which orbit the sun but are much smaller than planets, are among the oldest objects in the solar system and therefore may help explain how Earth evolved.Ryugu in Japanese means “Dragon Palace,” the name of a sea-bottom castle in a Japanese folk tale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-spacecraft-approaches-earth-to-drop-asteroid-samples/story-hszmHt7bzoI6h38DfJF5oI.html
04-12-2020||World||Lebanon’s Hezbollah suing those accusing it of Beirut port blast||Lebanon’s Hezbollah said Friday it is suing a former Christian lawmaker and a website affiliated with a Christian political party for defamation, after they accused the Shiite militant group of being responsible for the devastating explosion at Beirut’s port this summer.Hezbollah’s legal representative Ibrahim Mussawi said the accusations, leveled by Fares Souaid and the website of the right-wing Lebanese Forces party, were misleading.Mussawi, also a Hezbollah lawmaker, told a press conference outside the courts house that blaming the group threatens to disrupt social peace in Lebanon, at a time when the United States is exerting maximum pressure on his party and its allies. Washington considers Hezbollah a terrorist group and has been escalating sanctions against it and its political allies in Lebanon.The massive Aug. 4 blast was caused by nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrates, a fertilizer that was improperly stored at a port warehouse for six years. The blast killed more than 200 people and wounded over 6,000, and extensively damaged several neighborhoods in Beirut.Some of Hezbollah’s political opponents and civilians have since blamed the group for storing the explosive chemicals at the port. Hezbollah is the only group that kept its weapons after Lebanon’s civil war ended in 1990 and is believed to have ammunition warehouses around the country.The claim was dismissed by Hezbollah’s leader. No evidence has emerged to link the group to the explosive chemicals.But four months after the explosion, an investigation has yet to provide an explanation for what happened — or hold any senior official responsible. Families of the victims have asked for an international probe, in a country where violent attacks and assassinations are rarely brought to justice.Lebanon’s port authority, security agencies and political leadership were all aware of the stored explosive chemicals at the port, documents have shown. The port is one of the country’s facilities where rampant corruption has been reported.“When the US administration’s main concern and daily bread is to go after Hezbollah and attempt to pressure governments to put it on the terrorism list ... you’d gather that there are tools inside and outside that help with that,” Mussawi said.There was no immediate comment from Souaid or the Lebanese Forces party.Mussawi said he also plans to press charges against Bahaa Hariri, the son of late Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who is living in exile. He is also the estranged brother of Prime-Minister designate Saad Hariri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanon-s-hezbollah-suing-those-accusing-it-of-beirut-port-blast/story-Jk7LqYUNBHnxYNyrdP75uK.html

Colorado-based Lunar Outpost has been awarded a contract to collect lunar rocks following the arrival of a lander to the moon’s south pole in 2023. The company said in a statement that the contract is symbolic of a new incentive that will “exponentially increase the potential of future missions.”The three other companies that won the bid to collect space resources and transfer ownership to NASA include Masten Space Systems of Mojave, ispace Europe of Luxembourg, and ispace Japan of Tokyo. The new contracts will cost $25,001 to the space agency. NASA said that the companies will receive 10% of their total proposed price upon award, 10% upon launch, and the remaining 80% upon successful completion.“The objective is twofold: There is important policy and precedent that’s being set, both relative to the utilisation of space resources, and the expansion of the public and private partnerships beyond Earth orbit to the moon,” NASA acting associate administrator Mike Gold told a news conference on Thursday.Also Read | China spacecraft collects moon samples to bring back to EarthThe firms will collect a small amount of lunar regolith, between 50g and 500g in weight, and provide imagery of the collection to NASA.

04-12-2020||World||First Rohingya refugees arrive at isolated Bangladesh island||Authorities in Bangladesh on Friday sent the first group of more than 1,500 Rohingya refugees to an isolated island despite calls by human rights groups for a halt to the process.The 1,642 refugees boarded seven Bangladeshi naval vessels in the port of Chittagong for the trip to Bhashan Char, according to an official who could not be named in accordance with local practice.After about a three-hour trip they arrived at the island, which was once regularly submerged by monsoon rains but now has flood protection embankments, houses, hospitals and mosques built at a cost of more than $112 million by the Bangladesh navy.Located 21 miles (34 kilometers) from the mainland, the island surfaced only 20 years ago and was never inhabited.Saleh Noman, a Bangladeshi journalist who traveled with the refugees, said by phone from the island that the refugees were given rice, eggs, and chickens for lunch after their body temperatures were measured by health workers as a coronavirus precaution.Before they boarded the ships they were also given face masks to protect against Covid-19.The United Nations(UN) has voiced concern that refugees be allowed to make a “free and informed decision” about whether to relocate to the island in the Bay of Bengal.The island’s facilities are built to accommodate 100,000 people, just a fraction of the million Rohingya Muslims who have fled waves of violent persecution in their native Myanmar and are currently living in crowded, squalid refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar district.On Thursday, 11 passenger buses carrying the refugees left Cox’s Bazar on the way to the island. They camped overnight in school buildings in the southeastern city of Chittagong.Authorities in Cox’s Bazar did not say how the refugees were selected for relocation.About 700,000 Rohingya fled to the camps in Cox’s Bazar after August 2017, when the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began a harsh crackdown on the Muslim group following an attack by insurgents. The crackdown included rapes, killings, and the torching of thousands of homes, and was termed ethnic cleansing by global rights groups and the UN.Foreign media have not been permitted to visit the island.Contractors say its infrastructure is like a modern township, with multifamily concrete homes, schools, playgrounds and roads. It also has solar-power facilities, a water supply system, and cyclone shelters.International aid agencies and the UN have vehemently opposed the relocation since it was first proposed in 2015, expressing fear that a big storm could overwhelm the island and endanger thousands of lives.The UN said in a statement Wednesday that it has not been involved in preparations for the relocation or the selection of refugees and has limited information about the overall plan.“The United Nations takes this opportunity to highlight its longstanding position that Rohingya refugees must be able to make a free and informed decision about relocating to Bhasan Char based upon relevant, accurate and updated information,” it said.Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch on Thursday urged the government to cancel the relocation plan.The current refugee camps near the town of Cox’s Bazar are overcrowded and unhygienic. Disease and organized crime are rampant. Education is limited and refugees are not allowed to work.Still, most Rohingya are unwilling to return to Myanmar due to safety concerns. Government officials didn’t have an estimate of how many refugees would be willing to be relocated to the island.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly told the UN and other international partners that her administration would consult them before making a final decision on the relocation, and that no refugees would be forced to move.Bangladesh attempted to start sending refugees back to Myanmar under a bilateral framework last November, but no one was willing to go.The Rohingya are not recognized as citizens in Myanmar, rendering them stateless, and face other forms of state-sanctioned discrimination.A UN-sponsored investigation in 2018 recommended the prosecution of Myanmar’s top military commanders on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for the violence against the Rohingya.Myanmar is defending itself in the International Court of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands, after the West African nation of Gambia brought a case backed by the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, Canada, and the Netherlands over the crackdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-rohingya-refugees-arrive-at-isolated-bangladesh-island/story-V4KpRBWzUZJXzyjLTi8HqJ.html
04-12-2020||World||UK PM sets ‘ambitious’ new emissions cut target for 2030||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday announced an “ambitious” new target to reduce the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68 per cent by 2030 compared to the levels in 1990. This is the first target set by the UK following its exit from the European Union (EU) and Johnson said it demonstrated Britain’s leadership in tackling climate change, having already cut carbon emissions more than any similar developed country and being the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions by 2050. The UK claims its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Climate Agreement is now among the highest in the world and commits the country to cutting emissions at the fastest rate of any major economy so far. “We have proven we can reduce our emissions and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process – uniting businesses, academics, NGOs and local communities in a common goal to go further and faster to tackle climate change,” said Johnson. “Today, we are taking the lead with an ambitious new target to reduce our emissions by 2030, faster than any major economy, with our Ten Point Plan helping us on our path to reach it. But this is a global effort, which is why the UK is urging world leaders as part of next week’s Climate Ambition Summit to bring forward their own ambitious plans to cut emissions and set net zero targets,” he said. As the co-host of the virtual summit on December 12, Johnson had invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a phone call last week to participate in the event, which will coincide with the fifth anniversary of the historic Paris Agreement. The summit calls on countries around the world to submit ambitious NDCs or other climate plans on the road to the UN COP26 climate talks, which the UK government is hosting in Glasgow next year. “Tackling climate change is the one of the most urgent shared endeavours of our lifetimes, demanding bold action from every nation to prevent catastrophic global warming,” said Alok Sharma, UK Business Secretary and President of COP26. “The UK’s new emissions target is among the highest in the world and reflects the urgency and scale of the challenge our planet faces. I hope other countries join us and raise the bar at next week’s UN Climate Ambition Summit, and ahead of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next year,” he said. Each party to the Paris Agreement – including countries and international blocs such as the EU – determines what domestic action it will take and communicates it in the form of NDCs. They are at the heart of the Paris Agreement goal, set at COP21 UN summit in 2015, to hold the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees and pursue best efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. Many countries have now made net zero commitments and this round of NDCs, which set a 2030 emission reduction target, will need to be consistent with those longer term commitments. Downing Street said the latest announcement achieves that and reflects the independent Climate Change Committee’s advice on net zero. The UK government says its path to meeting this latest target is backed by the PM’s “Ten Point Plan” set out earlier for a so-called green revolution, which is aimed at creating and supporting up to 250,000 British jobs by 2030. The plan sets out ambitious policies and investment, with a stated potential to deliver over GBP 40 billion of private investment by 2030. The UK’s previous NDC target was 53 per cent and it says it will now communicate its full NDC to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in time for the Climate Ambition Summit next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-sets-ambitious-new-emissions-cut-target-for-2030/story-9RINrmNBjqcNsubbRms3lI.html

On the campaign trail, Trump warned that Biden would go easy on China, although the president-elect agrees that China is not abiding by international trade rules, is giving unfair subsidies to Chinese companies and stealing American innovation.The Trump administration, which once boasted of warm relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, also has been ramping up sanctions against China over Taiwan, Tibet, trade, Hong Kong and the South China Sea. It has moved against the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and sought restrictions on Chinese social media applications like TikTok and WeChat.Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist who has been accused of politicizing the position, has been the nation’s top intelligence official since May. In his op-ed, he did not directly address the transition to a Biden administration. Trump has not acknowledged losing the election.Ratcliffe said he has shifted money within the $85 billion annual intelligence budget to address the threat from China. Beijing is preparing for an open-ended confrontation with the US, which must be addressed, he said.“This is our once-in-a-generation challenge. Americans have always risen to the moment, from defeating the scourge of fascism to bringing down the Iron Curtain,” Ratcliffe wrote in what appeared to be call for action to future intelligence officials.Biden has announced that he wants the Senate to confirm Avril Haines, a former deputy director of the CIA, to succeed Ratcliffe as the next national intelligence director.“This generation will be judged by its response to China’s effort to reshape the world in its own image and replace America as the dominant superpower,” Ratcliffe wrote.He cited several examples of Chinese aggression against the United States:The Justice Department has charged a rising number of US academics for transferring US taxpayer-funded intellectual property to China.He noted the theft of intellectual property from American businesses, citing the case of Sinoval, a China-based wind turbine maker, which was convicted and heavily fined for stealing trade secrets from AMSC, a US-based manufacturer formerly known as American Superconductor Inc. Rather than pay AMSC for more than $800 million in products and services it had agreed to purchase, Sinovel hatched a scheme to steal AMSC’s proprietary wind turbine technology, causing the loss of almost 700 jobs and more than $1 billion in shareholder equity, according to the Justice Department.Ratcliffe and other US officials have said that China has stolen sensitive US defense technology to fuel Xi’s aggressive military modernization plan and they allege that Beijing uses its access to Chinese tech firms, such as Huawei, to collect intelligence, disrupt communications and threaten the privacy of users worldwide.Ratcliffe said he has personally briefed members of Congress about how China is using intermediaries to lawmakers in an attempt to influence legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-top-threat-to-us-free-world-since-world-war-ii-says-outgoing-intelligence-director-ratcliffe/story-rnusAgsXCckgCjeIY764GK.html

Malaysia tries to find middle ground||Malaysia’s latest challenge from the coronavirus pandemic is to allay concern among local Muslims about vaccine shots which could contain substances forbidden by Islam.The Special Muzakarah Committee of the National Council for Malaysian Islamic Affairs met Thursday to discuss the use of the vaccine. The outcome is expected to be known next week after it is presented to the King for consent, state news agency Bernama reported Friday, citing Religious Affairs Minister Zulkifli Mohamad Al-Bakri.Muslim religious authorities have previously exempted vaccines from the stringent halal labeling in cases when no alternative is available. Still, concerns about the shots containing items banned under Islamic law, such as porcine DNA, continue to linger in Muslim-majority nations including Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s virus hotspot.“Let’s not complicate the situation by taking a narrow jurisprudence opinion for the Muslim community,” Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin, a mufti, or religious head, for the state of Perlis, said in a Facebook post after attending the Muzakarah Committee meeting. “If the jurisprudence is for the nation and the general public, it needs to be positioned toward making things easy.”‘Best Choice’Malaysia last week signed a deal with Pfizer Inc. to obtain its Covid-19 vaccine that will cover 6.4 million people, or 20% of its population, starting early next year. The country is also on the priority list to receive a vaccine from China, which has been the subject of controversy among Muslims who doubt its halal status. The community makes up 61% of the Malaysia’s population.Asri said vaccines made from halal ingredients would be the “best and primary choice.” Even vaccines produced by treating and transforming forbidden substances into clean compounds are permissible, he said.A growing cluster of infections that emerged in late September forced a partial lockdown across several states just as Malaysia’s $365 billion economy showed signs of recovering. New daily cases hit a record high of 2,188 on Nov. 24, of which more than half came from a cluster linked to the worker dormitories of Top Glove Corp., the world’s top maker of surgical gloves.New cases have stayed above the 1,100 mark on most day since, data from the health ministry show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/are-coronavirus-vaccines-halal-malaysia-tries-to-find-middle-ground/story-jH0WqHfukXmJfDqw8q5FdN.html

In an interview with CNN, aired on Thursday, Biden said it would be important only to demonstrate that there is a peaceful transfer of power between the competing parties by shaking hands and moving on.“No personal consequence to me but for the country,” said the Democrat, highlighting the importance of a demonstration of a peaceful transfer of power at his inauguration.Biden also raised concern about the “image” of the United States being presented to the rest of the world, saying such controversies around the transfer of power occurs in countries under a dictatorship.Also Read | Trump targets ‘hapless’ Georgia governor again, suggests ways to detect ‘voter fraud’Meanwhile, Trump has continued with his unproven claims of electoral fraud and has refused to concede defeat in the recently-concluded presidential elections. The US president has now claimed that people in Georgia were caught bringing in ballots and putting them in voting machines.“People in Georgia got caught cold bringing in massive numbers of ballots and putting them in “voting” machines. Great job @BrianKempGA!” tweeted Trump, as he continues to target Georgia governor for helping him over the result. The tweet was promptly flagged by the micro-blogging platform as “disputed”. People in Georgia got caught cold bringing in massive numbers of ballots and putting them in "voting" machines. Great job @BrianKempGA!Trump had earlier asked why Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican, didn’t use his “emergency powers” to overrule the decision of the secretary of state. He had also suggested officials check the number of envelopes against the number of ballots, claiming that they “may just find” more ballots than envelopes received. “Biden has received more than 81 million popular votes in the presidential elections, the highest ever in the US’ history, and is projected to win 306 electoral votes as against 232 to Trump. He has already started nominating key members of the Biden-Harris Administration as it faces immense challenges presented by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-personal-consequence-biden-on-importance-of-trump-attending-inauguration-ceremony/story-nHT0jSSpZviv9uofKJPIcP.html

And if you reject it, you would get a harsh punishment.”She is a medical physician and an educator living in Sweden. Recently, she published a book giving insight into her ordeal, including witnessing beatings.“I was feeling like I was a different person. All around me got dark. It was really difficult to accept,” Sautbay said.Another such victim is Uyghur businesswoman Zumret Dawut, who was picked up in March 2018 in Urumqi.For two months, Dawut said authorities questioned her links to Pakistan, her husband’s homeland. They questioned her as well about how many children she had, and whether or not they had studied religion and read the Quran, said Al Jazeera.She further said that once she had to beg the camp’s male officers to allow her to go to the washroom. She was allowed to go while being handcuffed and the male officers followed her into the washroom.Speaking on pork being served to the Uyghur Muslims in the camps, she said, “When you sit in a concentration camp, you do not decide whether to eat, or not to eat. To be alive, we had to eat the meat served to us.”As per the documents available to Al Jazeera, agricultural development has also become a part of what German anthropologist and Uyghur scholar, Adrian Zenz, says is a policy of “secularisation”.Citing documents and state-approved news articles, Zenz has reported that there is an “active” effort in the region to promote and expand pig farming.In 2019, Xinjiang’s top administrator, Shohrat Zakir, had said that the Xinjiang region will be turned into a “pig-raising hub”.The project is expected to occupy a 25,000-square-metre (82-square-foot) area in an industrial park in Kashgar’s Konaxahar county, renamed Shufu, according to the Chinese-language website, Sina, Al Jazeera reported.It further reported that the deal was formally signed on April 23 this year.“This is part of the attempt to completely eradicate the culture and religion of the people in Xinjiang,” Zenz told Al Jazeera.“It is part of the strategy of secularisation, of turning the Uighurs secular and indoctrinating them to follow the communist party and become agnostic or atheist,” he added.As the atrocities on the Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region gain international attention, China has continued to defend its policies, claiming that the objective is to combat the “three evils of extremism, separatism and terrorism”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uyghurs-in-re-education-camps-forced-to-eat-pork-on-fridays-as-china-pushes-to-expand-pig-farms-in-xinjiang/story-rhrWxEJZByEJz8qFYAZIZL.html

You go to Pakistan, India or any part of the world and you’ll find sculptures,” he said.“Many Islamic countries have sculptures.

04-12-2020||World||US Coronavirus expert Anthony Fauci apologises for casting doubt over UK’s approval of Pfizer vaccine||Top US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci apologised on Thursday for casting doubt on the rigour of the British regulators who approved the Pfizer Inc vaccine against Covid-19, saying he had faith in the quality of their work.Britain announced the approval of the vaccine on Wednesday, with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) saying it had rigorously assessed the vaccine data and had cut no corners.It gave the UK the jump in the race to begin mass inoculation against a virus that has killed nearly 1.5 million people globally and hammered the world economy. US and European Union(EU) regulators are sifting through the same Pfizer vaccine trial data, but have yet to give their approval.In a CBS interview on Thursday, Fauci suggested the British regulators had failed to scrutinise the data carefully enough and had waved the vaccine through, comments that were prominently reported on the main British TV news channels.He later gave an interview to the BBC in which he said his earlier comments had come out wrong.“There really has been a misunderstanding, and for that I’m sorry, and I apologise for that,” he said. “I do have great faith in both the scientific community and the regulatory community in the UK,” Fauci said.“I did not mean to apply any sloppiness (to the UK regulatory process), even though it came out that way,” he added.Fauci said the point he had been trying to make was that in the US context, with widespread vaccine scepticism, it would not have been appropriate to conduct the process in the same way and at the same speed as what happened in Britain.“If we had for example approved it yesterday or tomorrow, there likely would have been pushback on an already scrutinising society,” he said.“You know, at the end of the day, it’s going to be safe, it’s going to be effective, the people in the UK are going to receive it and they’re going to do really well, and the people in the United States are going to receive it and we’re going to do pretty well,” Fauci said.In response to his earlier criticism, the MHRA issued a statement saying it had “rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible without compromising the thoroughness of our review”.The regulator also said its emergency approval had allowed “some stages of this process to happen in parallel to condense the time needed, but it does not mean steps and the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been bypassed”.Fauci is the most high-profile member of the White House coronavirus task force and has often clashed with President Donald Trump on how to protect Americans from the virus, which has caused about 273,000 US deaths.President-elect Joe Biden said on Thursday he had asked Fauci to be the chief medical adviser on his Covid-19 team when he takes office on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-coronavirus-expert-anthony-fauci-apologises-for-casting-doubt-over-uk-s-approval-of-pfizer-vaccine/story-THC1rx1PtAfuDa4sm5i0yJ.html
04-12-2020||World||Even with vaccines, airport testing is here for the long haul||Even as the race to approve and distribute Covid-19 vaccines is entering its final stretch, parts of the travel industry are sprinting to a different finish line: airport testing.In hubs large and small, from JFK to Boston to Frankfurt, Germany, a variety of companies are figuring out how to scale preflight rapid and PCR Covid testing in hopes of facilitating safe air travel and lessening quarantine requirements for anyone who isn’t first in line for a shot.The leaders of that effort may come as a surprise.In the US, it’s XpressSpa, the purveyor of quickie mani-pedis and travel pillows. It’s currently operational in four major US airports, with more to come in December.In the UK, Collinson—the parent company of the Priority Pass airport lounge network—is the testing partner for London Heathrow and Virgin Atlantic, which recently began offering free tests for passengers on flights to select Caribbean destinations. This effort expanded to three additional UK airports this week. Collinson also announced a partnership in mid-November with American Airlines, British Airways, and the Oneworld airline alliance that will bring testing to select flights and hopefully lead to the creation of an “air bridge.”In other words: Momentum is building.“We went from concept to pilot in 75 days,” says XpressSpa Chief Executive Officer Doug Satzman of the effort’s early days; the company’s first Covid-19 testing facility opened at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in June. But expanding has been slow work. “Operating in airports is a difficult, highly complex, highly regulated environment—just getting an electrician in to fix something in your store is kind of a pain,” Satzman explains.“It’s been a tiring journey, I won’t deny it,” says David Evans, co-CEO of Collinson, whose company got into the testing game due to its knowledge of airport operations and its history as a purveyor of travel insurance. While its Heathrow effort has grown from testing 25,000 passengers per day to testing more than 1 million, some challenges to scaling up are hard to overcome.Difficulties have little to do with square footage or money. Creating airport testing sites, Evans says, is a low-cost proposition that can fill any empty or under-utilized space, of which there are many in airports today. It’s the lack of coordinated policy around testing requirements that has thwarted any type of global (or even country-wide) expansion.“If they rolled out a national testing mandate for air travel, we’d be there to support in as many airports as possible,” adds Evans, who has been lobbying vociferously for that exact approach to “get the world moving again.”Both Satzman and Evans think their efforts will pay off, whether they’re the turtle or the hare in a race with vaccines. After all, both executives are of the mindset that airport testing will be a long-term need, relevant for at least the next two years and possibly far longer.Mounting PressureFor both Satzman and Evans, providing airport testing is less a way to compensate for Covid-related losses than a means to get air travel—and therefore their core businesses—back on track. As Satzman puts it, “It’s not a big money thing, it’s a service you offer to let people back in so you can make money off your other businesses. ”The same could be said about Lufthansa, which in mid-November started to roll out free and rapid pre-flight testing for certain flights between Munich and Hamburg in collaboration with the German biotech firm Centogene. “Successful testing of entire flights can be the key to revitalizing international air traffic,” says Christina Foerster, Lufthansa Group’s executive board member for customer, IT, and corporate responsibility.There’s data to support the idea that testing could reestablish consumer confidence. In a study published by the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) in October, 76% of respondents said that rapid testing prior to departure—with waived quarantining requirements for those who test negative—would be the best way to open up international travel.The barrier is a patchwork approach to entry requirements across state, regional, and international levels, and the lack of a unified system to verify results. In Hong Kong, for instance, travelers need to present a “physical, stamped, paper copy of results,” says Collinson’s Evans; travelers to other destinations need only log into a health portal for an agent to review.Satzman doesn’t see much of that changing. In the US, as in other countries, coordinated policy for airport testing would require unprecedented cooperation among agencies as wide-ranging as the Federal Aviation Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), and the Department of Health and Human Services. But with infections in the US reaching an all-time high, and Europe batting down its second wave, the need for testing has become more urgent. Add in the desire to make long-awaited holiday travels stick, and you have demand boiling over from passengers who are less concerned about quarantine requirements than keeping their relatives safe.Slow and SteadyAgainst all these odds, airport testing efforts are gaining lift-off, thanks to a few recent developments. First is the recent, increased availability of rapid tests, which have allowed companies such as XpressSpa to think a bit further outside the box. Reliability is a growing positive, too: Just this week the NFL announced that it has helped prove the concept of a rapid test that’s as reliable as PCR swabs.Then there’s interest from airlines, who are seeing wide adoption of a vaccine as too far-off to suit their financial hopes. “Airlines are the ones stringing together the air bridges,” says Satzman, referring to the joint participation of two destinations in a pre-approved testing requirement for entry. “They see us as a strategic partner because we’re the only ones that will be in various airports.”As a result, Satzman says XpressSpa is carrying out negotiations with nearly every major American carrier, from implementing a pilot program that one airline hopes to roll out across all of its busiest airports to bundling the price of a required pre-flight Covid test with airfares.The next steps, say both Satzman and Evans, involve creating digital passports via which results could be uploaded and accessed by airline agents and border control officials, as needed. (Imagine, for instance, not being able to board a plane unless you scanned your boarding pass and your digital health app at the gate.)Then, Satzman says, it can be time to look at the next chapter: administering vaccines in addition to tests, and providing additional services such as strep throat tests to help unwell passengers decide whether it’s prudent to board a plane.  “Whether we call this XCheck or something else—whatever this turns into, I do believe it will be bigger than the XpressSpa business,” Satzman adds. “There’s a lot to do in airports. And we’re going to do it, step by step by step.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/even-with-vaccines-airport-testing-is-here-for-the-long-haul/story-1SZGBhLqP3ocp7Z1G3AAcJ.html

The pain will remain forever,” Hasina said while speaking with Imran Ahmed Siddiqui, the Pakistani High Commissioner in Dhaka, at the Ganabhaban.Referring to the volumes of the book titled “Secret Documents of Intelligence Branch on Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman”, she said that all can learn many historical facts between the years 1948 and 1971 from the books, BDNews24 said.She further highlighted that the Urdu version of the book “Unfinished Memoirs” by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is a best-seller in Pakistan.“It’s well-read in Pakistan and other countries,” she said.BDNews24 further reported Pakistan High Commissioner said that his country wants to strengthen ties with Bangladesh.

04-12-2020||World||Mike Pompeo decries China’s ‘persecution’ of Hong Kong’s activists||US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo accused Hong Kong of using the courts to engage in “political persecution” after prominent activists were detained and a former opposition lawmaker fled to Europe.Pompeo said in a statement Thursday that the decisions to sentence activists including Joshua Wong to jail while denying bail to billionaire media mogul Jimmy Lai violated fundamental rights guaranteed by the treaty allowing the former British colony’s return to China in 1997. He said the US would work with its allies to defend such freedoms, something the incoming administration of Joe Biden has also pledged to do.“The United States is appalled by the Hong Kong government’s political persecution of Hong Kong’s courageous pro-democracy advocates,” Pompeo said. “The use of courts to silence peaceful dissent is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes and underscores once again that the Chinese Communist Party’s greatest fear is the free speech and free thinking of its own people.”Meanwhile, former pro-democracy lawmaker Ted Hui announced Thursday he was going into exile in the UK after fleeing to Denmark earlier this week. Hui was among those arrested last month in connection with a disruptive protest in the legislative chamber in May and quit last month as part of a mass resignation by opposition legislators over the government’s ouster of four of their members.The developments illustrate the growing threat of jail hanging over pro-democracy activists as the Hong Kong government uses new and once-little-used laws to press criminal cases against them. Police have arrested more than 10,000 people since a wave of largely leaderless protests last year, including 26 under new national security legislation carrying sentences as long as life in prison.The US, which has already sanctioned Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and several other officials responsible for the city, is facing a mid-December deadline to identify banks for penalties under a law passed earlier this year to support the local democracy movement. Biden has vowed to “fully enforce” such Hong Kong-related legislation and said he would convene a “Summit for Democracy” to reach new commitments to fight corruption and authoritarianism and advance human rights.Activists FleeChina has repeatedly rejected such actions as meddling in its own domestic affairs and issued counter sanctions against US lawmakers among other figures. Lam and Chinese officials argue the arrests have been necessary to restore stability to the Asian financial center after last year’s sometimes violent unrest.Ten members of the city’s former opposition bloc are facing criminal charges related to scuffles in the legislative chamber or their appearance at unauthorized rallies. Wong, 24, who was sentenced to more than a year in prison Wednesday for participating in a June 2019 protest outside the police headquarters, faces two other similar criminal cases.Lai, 73, was denied bail in a fraud case Thursday, potentially keeping him behind bars for months as he battles more serious foreign collusion allegations under the security law. The judge presiding over the case deemed the Next Digital Ltd. founder to be a flight risk, Lai’s Apple Daily newspaper reported, although he had already surrendered his passport and said he had no intention to leave Hong Kong.Hui, the former lawmaker, was among several pro-democracy activists to exit the city since the move to enact the national security law in June. Twelve more have been detained in mainland China since August after being caught attempting to flee Hong Kong by boat. The trend has led to efforts in places like Australia, Canada and the UK to make it easier for city residents to relocate.The high-profile departures, however, may make it harder for others facing prosecution to leave or secure bail from courts. The security law also allows courts to deny bail before trial because defendants may “continue to commit acts endangering national security,” a power that rights lawyers say clashes with the presumption of innocence in the city’s Common Law tradition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-decries-china-s-persecution-of-hong-kong-s-activists/story-lws0ii1pZzgP8FpXdLfdvM.html
04-12-2020||World||Some damages in the Sino-US relations ‘beyond repair’, Chinese state media warns||Chinese state media warned that some damage to Sino-US ties are “beyond repair” amid a new wave of counter-China measures by the Trump administration, with an ugly Twitter spat between a US senator and Chinese reporter underlining the rising rancour.The government-backed newspaper China Daily said in an editorial it viewed Washington’s decision to limit visitor visas for Chinese Communist Party members and their families and a ban on Xinjiang cotton imports are “worrisome signs.”“Even if the incoming administration has any intention of easing the tensions that have been sown, and continue being sown, some damage is simply beyond repair, as the sitting US president intends,” the newspaper said. Relations between the world’s two largest economies have sunk to their lowest point in decades over issues such as trade, technology, security, human rights, and Covid-19. Bilateral ties are being shifted onto “a dangerous path”, according to the China Daily editorial.The Chinese ambassador to the United States became the latest of senior Beijing officials to signal a desire to reset the increasingly confrontational relationship as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office in January. “There are always differences between the two countries. None of them justifies confrontation and war, cold or hot,” Cui said on Twitter Thursday. “With sufficient mutual respect and mutual understanding, we are capable of managing these differences so that they would not derail the entire relationship.”It is unclear whether a Biden administration will bring a dramatic shift, however. The Democrat told the New York Times this week that he would not remove existing tariffs set by the Trump administration against China for now. Legislation targeting China or Chinese officials over charges of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and crackdown against pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have won broad bipartisan support in Congress, as well, further suggesting that current policies towards China have staying power. An exchange of insults on Thursday between US Senator Marsha Blackburn and China Daily journalist Chen Weihua underscored persistent animosity. Blackburn, a Republican and one of the more outspoken China critics, claimed without evidence on Twitter that China “has a 5,000 year history of cheating and stealing.” Chen replied to her tweet, accusing Blackburn of being the most “racist and ignorant” US senator he has seen and calling her a “lifetime bitch.”The senator responded by calling Chen a “puppet” in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s “dream for global domination” and that the US won’t bow to “sexist communist thugs”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-damages-in-the-sino-us-relations-beyond-repair-chinese-state-media-warns/story-zdfYWpHLOn4NXRfNpVS09N.html

04-12-2020||World||New law may help ease Green Cards backlog||US Senate on Wednesday passed a legislation raising country limits on the annual grant of Green Cards — permanent residencies — that, when enacted, will stand to benefit hundreds of thousands of Indian-origin applicants who currently face a statistical possibility of waiting for decades for their turn.The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act was passed on Wednesday by unanimous consent. The House of Representatives had passed its own version of the legislation in 2019. The two bills will now go through a reconciliation process to iron out the differences, and a combined legislation must pass both chambers again before being sent to the White House for the president’s signature and enactment.“Ending nationality discrimination and levelling the playing field for high-skilled applicants, our legislation will keep families together while helping American companies retain top talent. I urge my colleagues and the President to take the final steps necessary to make these reforms a reality,” said Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Indian American lawmaker who co-sponsored by the House bill.The US grants some 1 million Green Cards a year. But a country cap limits their numbers to 7% of the total for applicants from every specific country. The worst affected by this country limit are Indian applicants, with more than 300,000 primary applicants in the backlog. The bill passed by the Senate raises the limit to 15%. Immigration Voice, which advocates end to country caps, said the bill would clear the Green Card backlog a lot sooner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-law-may-help-ease-green-cards-backlog/story-p76roKQ7cJXwgGGdYpbA2N.html
04-12-2020||World||Ex-US presidents offer to take Covid-19 vaccine publicly||Three former US presidents have volunteered to take shots of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine — when it is approved — publicly to persuade Americans who are sceptical about inoculations.Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama — three of the four living former presidents — conveyed their offer in public remarks to CNN and SiriusXM on Wednesday. There was no word on the fourth, President Jimmy Carter, who is the oldest among them and beat cancer in 2015.“First, the vaccines need to be deemed safe and administered to the priority populations. Then, President Bush will get in line for his, and will gladly do so on camera,” Freddy Ford, Bush’s chief of staff told CNN, and added that the former president had asked him to reach out to Anthony Fauci and Deborah Brix, members of the White House task force on coronavirus, with his offer of whatever help he could extend.Clinton’s press secretary also told the news channel that the former president “will do it in a public setting if it will help urge all Americans to do the same”.And Obama told SiriusXM that if Fauci, the top epidemiologist who has emerged as the most trusted voice in America on Covid-19 and the vaccines in the pipeline, “tells me this vaccine is safe, and can vaccinate, you know, immunise you from getting Covid, absolutely, I’m going to take it”.“I may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed, just so that people know that I trust this science, and what I don’t trust is getting Covid,” the Democrat added.American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German BioNTech applied to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for their vaccine candidate on November 22. Moderna, another US company, applied for the same on November 30. Their vaccines — which have an efficacy of 95% — are expected to become available in the country around mid-December after the FDA meets on December 10 and 17 to take a call on the same.Frontline workers such as health professionals and law enforcement personnel, and residents of nursing homes will be the first two groups of recipients, according to a recommendation by the US Centers for Disease Control.Despite being hit the hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic — more than 271,000 fatalities and nearly 14 million confirmed infections — many Americans have been leery of any cure or therapeutics. Among several reasons for this distrust are also allegations that the Donald Trump administration — which has been criticised for not taking the public health crisis seriously enough — pushed agencies to approve vaccines in a rush to improve his chances of re-election ahead of the November 3 polls.The President has also spoken about the efficacy of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, which he forced the drug regulator to clear for emergency use despite studies suggesting it is not a Covid-19 cure, and went so far as to suggest the injection of household cleaning agents.More than two-thirds — 66% of respondents — told Gallup in a poll in July they would not agree to be vaccinated against Covid-19 if a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the drug regulator, was available to them at the time, and at no cost. Only 34% said they would.More Americans have come around since. The latest Gallup poll, conducted in a period ending November 1, before the announcements by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna found that nearly six in 10 — 58% — respondents said they will take the shots, but 42% were still not convinced.A majority of those sceptical of the vaccines (37%) in the Gallup poll cited “rushed timeline for the development of the vaccine” as their reason.The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have indeed come in record time, aided also by an all-in effort from the Trump administration under its Operation Warp Speed, which provided massive federal aid for their development. According to the latest poll, almost 26% of those distrustful of the vaccine said they would wait to see if the vaccine was safe; 12% were those who said they just didn’t trust vaccines, and 10% wanted to see how effective the vaccine was before agreeing to take the shots.Distrust of vaccines among African-Americans, who are among the hardest hit by Covid-19, too goes back in history. In the Tuskegee Experiment -- which began in 1932 and went on for years -- African-American men, many of whom suffered from latent syphilis, were administered placebos such as aspirin and mineral even after penicillin had made the disease curable. Many of the participants eventually lost their eye eyesight and died of the disease as the researchers studied long-term progression of the illness.“I understand you know historically -- everything dating back all the way to the Tuskegee experiments and so forth -- why the African American community, would have some scepticism,” Obama said in the SiriusXM interview. “But the fact of the matter is, is that vaccines are why we don’t have polio anymore, the reason why we don’t have a whole bunch of kids dying from measles and smallpox and diseases that used to decimate entire populations and communities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-us-presidents-offer-to-take-covid-19-vaccine-publicly/story-36WNzlS5bfHmjjLTAHa5aM.html

Winners in various categories were announced by actor-writer Stephen Fry in an online ceremony from the Natural History Museum, London.The foundation said Disale made an “extraordinary announcement” in a speech after winning the prize that he will share half the prize money with his fellow finalists, resulting in the other nine receiving over $ 55,000 each.“This is the first time in the Global Teacher Prize’s six-year history that the overall winner has shared the prize money with other finalists,” the foundation said.Disale was selected from over 12,000 nominations and applications from over 140 countries around the world. The prize was set up to recognise one exceptional teacher making an outstanding contribution to the profession as well as to shine a spotlight on the important role that teachers play in society. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the “creativity and ingenuity” of the winners and said, “Although I’m speaking to you in difficult and sometimes heartbreaking circumstances, it’s right that we take time to recognise the enormous contribution and sacrifice of the world’s teachers during this pandemic.”The ceremony included a special recognition for one teacher - a Covid hero - who has gone above and beyond to keep young people learning during the Covid-19 pandemic.The $45,000 Covid Hero Award, supported by CVC Capital Partners, was given to UK Maths teacher Jamie Frost, whose free DrFrostMaths became a lifeline for students shut out of classrooms all around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-teacher-ranjitsinh-disale-wins-1-million-global-prize-shares-half-with-other-finalists/story-PdOdXBbeQWb8ISVYyY931I.html
