Trump and his allies have lost numerous cases aimed at overturning election results in states Trump lost in the Nov. 3 election after winning them in 2016, making unfounded claims of fraud.US District Judge Linda Parker in Detroit and US District Judge Timothy Batten in Atlanta ruled that the plaintiffs lacked the legal standing to bring the lawsuits and that the cases were filed too late.“The people have spoken,” Parker wrote, referring to the election results.Batten said a hearing on Monday that the plaintiffs were seeking “perhaps the most extraordinary relief ever sought” in connection with an election.“They want this court to substitute its judgment for that of two-and-a-half million Georgia voters who voted for Joe Biden, and this I am unwilling to do,” Batten said.Powell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Biden won Michigan by about 154,000 votes and Georgia by about 12,000 votes, giving him 16 electoral votes from each state. Biden amassed 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232 in the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the winner of a presidential election. The Electoral College meets on Dec. 14 to formally cast the votes.Trump, who has falsely claimed that he won the election, and his allies have waged an unsuccessful legal battle to try to undo the election results. Judges have also rejected cases in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin.“This lawsuit seems to be less about achieving the relief plaintiffs seek - as much of that relief is beyond the power of this court - and more about the impact of their allegations on people’s faith in the democratic process and their trust in our government,” Parker added.Democrats and others have accused Trump of trying to harm public confidence in the integrity of US elections and undermine American democracy. A majority of Republicans in recent opinion polls have said they believe Trump won the election and that it was stolen through voter fraud. State election officials have said there is no evidence of such fraud.Tuesday is the so-called safe harbor deadline for states to resolve disputes arising from the election. Under US law, Congress will consider a state’s election result to be “conclusive” if it is finalized by the safe harbor date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-people-have-spoken-judges-reject-two-more-us-election-challenges/story-VSlGhnHbeFG2z7SA8WKj5J.html

In her victory speech after the elections, the 56-year-old had remembered her mother, calling her the “woman most responsible for my presence here today.”In the same address, she had also mentioned, “When she came here from India at the age of 19, maybe she didn’t quite imagine this moment, but she believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible.” “I’m thinking about her and about the generations of women... who have paved the way for this moment tonight,” Harris said, referring to her mother, who has found a reference often in her speeches. Born in Chennai, Shyamala Gopalan Harris arrived in the United States in 1959, when she was 19 years old, after completing her graduation from Lady Irwin’s college in Delhi. She pursued her further studies at University of California, Berkeley, and was a participant in the US Civil Rights movements.In her nomination acceptance speech in August 2020, Kamala Harris had invoked several civil rights and political leaders like Mary Church Terrell, Mary McCleod Bethune, Fannie Lou Hamer, Diane Nash, Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm. “We’re not often taught their stories. But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders. There’s another woman, whose name isn’t known, whose story isn’t shared. Another woman whose shoulders I stand on. And that’s my mother – Shyamala Gopalan Harris,” she had said,“My mother instilled in my sister, Maya, and me the values that would chart the course of our lives. She raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage.” she said, during the same speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vice-president-elect-kamala-harris-remembers-mother-shyamala-gopalan-harris-on-her-birthday/story-znjfiYJx6i0pyNgVUcswLP.html

He had held the same post during the tenure of former US president Barack Obama. However, this time, his role will be expanded to manage the US government response to the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Murthy has been privately advising Biden on the pandemic for months.After Biden made the announcement, Murthy took to Twitter to express the gratitude and wrote, “I never dreamed I’d have the honor to once again serve as Surgeon General. In this moment of crisis, I’m grateful for the opportunity to help end this pandemic, be a voice for science, and support our nation on its path to rebuilding and healing.”The 43-year-old originally hails from a village in Karnataka’s Mandya district. He was the US Surgeon General from December 2014 to April 2017 and at 37 was the youngest one to hold the office. He was asked to step down by the Trump administration later.The health team also includes Dr Anthony Fauci as Chief Medical Adviser to the President on Covid-19, Xavier Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services. Dr Rochelle Walensky was named as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr Marcella Nunez-Smith as Covid-19 Equity Task Force Chair.The United States is among the worst-affected countries due to the Covid-19. As per Reuters’ report, more than 282,000 Americans have died due to the viral disease, forcing state governments to impose strict lockdown.Earlier in the day, authorities in California, the most populous state in the country with about 40 million residents, compelled much of the state to close shop and stay at home the day after it reported a record 30,000-plus new cases.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/grateful-for-opportunity-indian-american-dr-vivek-murthy-after-being-named-us-surgeon-general-amid-covid-19/story-BCshmKubNK7g27vpeToacM.html

Becerra will become the first Latino to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Rochelle Walensky, an expert on virus testing, prevention, and treatment, will serve as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Marcella Nunez-Smith, a member of Biden’s Covid-19 advisory board, will serve as the Covid-19 Equity Task Force chair; and Jeff Zients, an alumnus of the Obama White House, will be coordinator of the Biden administration’s Covid-19 response.Becerra, Murthy and Walensky will have to be confirmed by US Senate. If approved, Murthy will be the third Indian-descent member in Biden’s team, joining Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris and Neera Tanden, nominee to head the Office of Management and Budget. “This team of world-class medical experts and public servants will be ready on day one to mobilise every resource of the federal government to expand testing and masking, oversee the safe, equitable, and free distribution of treatments and vaccines, re-open schools and businesses safely, lower prescription drug and other health costs and expand affordable health care to all Americans,” Biden said in a statement announcing the team.The Democrat ran for the White House on the promise of tackling the Covid1-19 epidemic, which has killed more than 280,000 people in the US and infected close to 15 million, as his top priority.

07-12-2020||World||UK to Brexit-proof Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine supplies from Belgium||Britain said on Monday that plans are being put in place to ensure the transportation of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against Covid-19 is not affected in the event of no agreement being clinched with the European Union by the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31.The first vaccine doses have been arriving from Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Belgium after the UK’s independent regulator gave the official go-ahead for its rollout from this week. However, the bulk of the supply is expected in the New Year and the UK’s Road Haulage Association has warned that a failure to agree an EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal by the end of this month could see “significant disruption” to the flow of goods for many months.“We have looked at use of non-commercial flights, we’ve got border arrangements in place,” Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told UK media outlets in reference to Brexit-proofing vaccine supplies.This could “potentially” involve the armed forces being deployed if required, as the minister added: “This is such an important product, it’s probably perhaps the most important product, so we will look to ensure that those supplies are available in the UK in whatever circumstance.” The UK and EU are locked in last-ditch efforts to try and thrash out an agreement that can be ratified by all 27 EU members before the December-end deadline. Significant differences over fishing rights and business competition rules remain the main stumbling blocks but both sides have said there is still time to agree a pact, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen set for crunch talks again this week.If both sides fail to reach an agreement, it would mean import duties and delays on the border for most goods.“Everyone understands the significance of vaccines,” said Cleverly, in reference to concerns over the crucial shipment from across the border.The vaccine is typically delivered by a simple injection in the shoulder but there is a complex and difficult logistical challenge to deliver from the manufacturers Pfizer to patients. It needs to be stored at -70C before being thawed out and can only be moved four times within that cold chain before being used. Defrosting the vaccine takes a few hours and then additional time is required to prepare the vaccine for administering.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that National Health Service (NHS) staff have been working round the clock to prepare secure sites and accept deliveries. Each box needs to be opened and unpacked manually, and temperature data has to be downloaded from each box. Tracking data covering every box’s journey from Belgium is also being downloaded to check that the vials have been kept well below freezing.There are five packs of 975 doses per box and only sites with the necessary Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) licence can split the vaccine packs. Once all checks are complete, the vaccine will be made available to order by authorised sites in the state-funded NHS.The distribution of the vaccine across the UK is being undertaken by Public Health England and the NHS in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland through systems specially adapted from those used successfully for the national immunisation programmes, the government said.Around 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK from this week. In all, the government has ordered a total of 40 million doses – enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each, 21 days apart.Patients aged 80 and above who are already attending hospital as an outpatient, and those who are being discharged home after a hospital stay, will be among the first to receive the “life-saving jab”. Hospitals will also begin inviting over 80s in for a jab and work with care home providers to book their staff in to vaccination clinics. Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers based on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation’s (JCVI) phased list of recipients based on the risk of death from the deadly virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-brexit-proof-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-supplies-from-belgium/story-T1oG8iL3UeXOKASenpEkeL.html

07-12-2020||World||UK set to begin ‘marathon’ Covid-19 vaccination drive||Batches of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived in 50 hospitals across the United Kingdom for the start of a mass vaccination programme from Tuesday, with those over 80 years prioritised to receive the first of their two-dose course.Health secretary Matt Hancock called it a “historic moment”, while Stephen Powis, England’s medical director, noted logistical challenges involved and cautioned that Tuesday would mark the beginning of a long haul, calling the vaccination programme “a marathon, not a sprint”.The vaccine needs to be delivered in two does, 21 days apart. Queen Elizabeth, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, are expected to be among the first group to be vaccinated. The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine; so far 800,000 doses have arrived and 4 mn more are expected by the end of the month from Belgium.The UK regulator, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), defended its expeditious approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine last week. It faced some international criticism and uneasiness over the timeline.June Raine, MHRA chief executive, said: “I would really like to emphasise that the highest standards of scrutiny, of safety and of effectiveness and quality have been met, international standards. And so there should be real confidence in the rigour of our approval”.“More than that, our Commission on Human Medicines has scrutinised every piece of data too, so there should be no doubt whatever that this is a very safe and highly effective vaccine. It will help us turn the corner”, she added.Leading individuals in various sections of society are being enlisted to help overcome anxieties and anti-vaccine content on social media. Members of the royal family receiving the vaccine is also likely to be widely publicised.Hancock said over the weekend: “This coming week will be a historic moment as we begin vaccination against Covid-19. We are prioritising the most vulnerable first and over-80s, care home staff and NHS colleagues will all be among the first to receive the vaccines”.“We are doing everything we can to make sure we can overcome significant challenges to vaccinate care home residents as soon as possible too. I urge everybody to play their part to suppress this virus and follow the local restrictions to protect the NHS while they carry out this crucial work.”New cases and deaths have registered a minor drop in recent weeks, particularly since the month-long lockdown in England. As of Sunday evening, there were 17,272 new cases and 231 deaths across the UK. As many as 1,061 people categorised as ‘Indian’ in official records have so far died in England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-set-to-begin-marathon-covid-19-vaccination-drive/story-h2LfNpKFiXqX47wFoHMpMP.html

07-12-2020||World||WHO Foundation appoints Anil Soni as CEO||The WHO Foundation has appointed Anil Soni as its inaugural Chief Executive Officer (CEO) from January 1, 2021, and announced the launch of its global fund-raising campaign that targets $1 billion in donations for global health by 2023.The WHO Foundation is an independent grant-making foundation based in Geneva that was launched in May 2020 as a separate legal entity to strengthen WHO’s efforts to address pressing global health issues. While protecting the WHO’s neutrality and independence as a global health agency, the foundation can become a platform for new types of public-private engagement, including investing in innovative and research-based initiatives to advance WHO’s mission and help deliver on its ambitions in an increasingly uncertain economic climate. Soni joins the Foundation from Viatris, a global healthcare company, where he has served as Head of Global Infectious Diseases. “We are at a critical juncture for global public health. After months of combatting the Covid-19 pandemic, there is hope for several successful vaccine candidates. Beyond this crucial step, the path to recovery necessitates expanded investment in the many health priorities that have been compromised in recent months -- from drops in vaccine coverage and HIV treatment to delays in cancer treatment,” said Soni. Soni brings two decades of experience working across public, private, and nonprofit sectors to expand healthcare access in low and middle-income countries. While at Viatris, he has been instrumental in shortening the amount of time needed to make low-cost medicines available in high-burden settings. This was most recently reflected by the approval of an HIV medicine recommended by the WHO for infants born with HIV, at a 75% reduction in cost to the current treatment.As WHO Foundation CEO, he will accelerate the Foundation’s work to invest in innovative, evidence-based initiatives that support WHO in delivering on its mission to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. “From his work at Viatris where he has led the development and introduction of medicines to treat HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, to his leadership of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and his time at the Global Fund, he has demonstrated his ability to work across public, private, and non-profit sectors and build successful new organisations from the ground up. On behalf of the Board, we are delighted to have Anil lead the Foundation at this critical moment for the future of global health,” said Professor Thomas Zeltner, Founder and Chairman of the Board of the WHO Foundation. Such success reflects Soni’s experience building some of the most innovative and impactful organisations in global health over the last decade, notably the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria and the Clinton Health Access Initiative. In addition to advisory roles with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the MDG Health Alliance, Soni joins the WHO Foundation with a strong track record of mobilising resources and advocating for global health priorities, as demonstrated through his leadership of the Friends of the Global Fight in the United States. “Anil is a proven innovator in global health who has spent two decades in service of communities affected by HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. He earned my trust when he and his team at the Clinton Health Access Initiative worked side by side with the ministry of health in Ethiopia to expand access to treatment and strengthen the management of our health centres,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said, in a statement. A defining aspect of the Foundation is its ability to create new opportunities for major donors, corporate partners and members of the general public to engage with WHO. The Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO, which WHO and the UN Foundation launched earlier in 2020, together with the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, helped test the potential for broader support to WHO by raising $238 million in corporate and individual pledges for its and partners’ Covid-19 response efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anil-soni-made-ceo-of-who-foundation-targets-raising-1-billion-for-global-health-by-2023/story-NAlnNHJJpIsO9cbETmf9uK.html
07-12-2020||World||France finds bird flu case on duck farm, tests ongoing||A case of bird flu has been found on a duck farm in southwestern France but it is still unclear whether it is the highly contagious form of the virus, the body representing the foie gras and fattened poultry industry CIFOG said on Monday.If confirmed this would be the first outbreak of the so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza on a farm this year.The disease has been spreading rapidly in Europe, putting the poultry industry on alert after previous outbreaks led to the culling of tens of millions of birds.CIFOG director Marie-Pierre Pe said the latest case was discovered on Friday at a farm of about 6,000 ducks due to be force-fed - a technique used to make foie gras - in the town of Benesse-Maremne, near the city of Biarritz and the Spanish border.“Initial tests have shown that it is an outbreak of H5 avian influenza but it remains to be seen whether it highly or low pathogenic and whether it is the H5N8 strain or another one,” Pe told Reuters.A security zone was set up around the farm even before the confirmation, something that was not done in 2016/2017 when a wave of bird flu led to the death and culling of millions of poultry, she said.France has already detected the H5N8 virus on birds sold in three pet stores. Investigations found that the wild birds had been sold by the same person in northern France, the agriculture ministry said last week.The spread of the virus in Europe prompted France to raise its bird flu security alert to “high” in early November, which requires keeping birds indoors or installing protective netting to prevent contact with wild birds that spread the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-finds-bird-flu-case-on-duck-farm-tests-ongoing/story-9CyJwZcgLDIS2M7BC2zvnN.html
07-12-2020||World||Britain to send largest warship, carrier strike group to Indian Ocean next year||The UK is sending its largest warship, aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, and its strike task group to the Indian Ocean early next year for its maiden voyage, with London describing the move as the country’s “most ambitious deployment for two decades”. The deployment comes against the backdrop of growing interest in the Indo-Pacific in Europe amid concerns over China’s increased assertiveness, and the UK’s own concerns over Chinese actions in its former colony of Hong Kong, which London says have undermined the agreement on leaving the region unchanged until 2047. Also read | Britain gets ready for roll-out of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine this week“Next year, HMS Queen Elizabeth will lead a British and allied task group on the UK’s most ambitious deployment for two decades, its route will encompass the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean and East Asia,” a British high commission spokesperson said. “It is a natural choice for the inaugural deployment of the carrier strike task group to include a visit to the Indian Ocean and East Asia. The deployment is a sign of the UK’s commitment to regional security,” the spokesperson added. France, Germany and the Netherlands have unveiled their strategies for the Indo-Pacific, which dovetail with India’s commitment to freedom of navigation and a rules-based order, and some experts see the deployment of Britain’s carrier task group as an effort to reinforce its relevance amid Brexit. The British mission’s spokesperson described the Indo-Pacific as “increasingly important for the UK, as it is at the centre of global economic growth and a region of increasing geostrategic importance”. The UK has a “range of enduring security interests in the region”, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also described the UK and India as “natural partners in defence” that “already have high levels of interoperability”, as is evident from bi-annual exercises involving all three services and their joint work on the UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan. The 65,000-tonne HMS Queen Elizabeth, which can carry up to 40 aircraft, was commissioned in late 2017 but next year’s deployment will mark its maiden voyage in international waters. The carrier task group is expected to conduct joint exercises with the US Navy and Japan’s Self-Defense Forces, though it couldn’t immediately be confirmed if there are plans for similar drills with the Indian Navy. The British mission’s spokesperson said the Royal Navy and the Indian Navy have “strong bilateral ties” and training together under the Konkan Exercise, a bilateral drill held biennially. “The strong maritime relationship with India and other regional partners, regular deployments and a permanent naval presence provides the ability for the UK government to react quickly to a variety of emerging security and humanitarian situations with partners, as well as upholding international maritime law in support of the rules-based international system,” the spokesperson said. The UK has a long-standing presence in the Gulf and Indian Ocean through Operation Kipion, which now involves the permanent presence of seven warships at any time, typically one frigate or destroyer supported by a tanker and a four-strong squadron of mine-hunters with a support ship. The British side also pointed to the Royal Navy’s increasing presence in the Indian Ocean, where HMS Dragon warship seized drugs with a street value of more than £200 million during operations last year. These operations are backed by maritime information exchanges such as a white shipping agreement with India covering the whole Indian Ocean. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said the British naval deployment should be seen in light of two factors – the UK’s efforts to remain relevant amid its exit from the European Union, and Britain’s concerns over China’s crackdown on Hong Kong. “The UK has a key presence in the Indian Ocean through the Diego Garcia base that is leased to the US. The British naval deployment shows the importance of the region, especially when other European countries are taking the lead in this area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-send-largest-warship-carrier-strike-group-to-indian-ocean-next-year/story-l6IfMKhGDGBgbG7U0EM3mL.html

Thus, it is possible to keep in touch on strategic and long-term issues.”“The Chinese side is always ready to negotiate, the sides can draft a list [of topics] to promote dialogue, cooperation and to settle differences,” he added.This comes amid reports that Biden is expected to come through with his pledge to mobilise America’s allies in a long-overdue determination to stand up to China, forcefully, multilaterally, and effectively.In February, Biden had described Chinese President Xi Jinping as a ‘thug’, while US President Donald Trump had called Xi a ‘great leader’, and has also admitted backing away from holding Beijing accountable for the Chinese president’s rampages in Hong Kong and Xinjiang in order to gain advantages at the trade-talks table, writes Terry Glavin for the Canadian journal Ottawa Citizen.Also Read |  US set to sanction more China officials over Hong KongGlavin writes that Biden has gone out of his way to declare Beijing’s mass imprisonment of the Uyghurs and the obliteration of Uyghur culture a genocide.Meanwhile, two years ago, Trump had said: “President Xi and I will always be friends....He’s for China, I’m for the US, but other than that, we love each other.” He had also gone out of his way to cut Xi slack on Xinjiang.Until now, the United States and the world’s liberal democracies have been all over the map in coming to terms with the belligerence and barbarism of Xi Jinping.The issues have been about Hong Kong and Xinjiang, where Beijing has been carrying out a reign of terror aimed at enslaving and liquidating the Turkic Muslim Uyghur minority, China’s takeover of key UN agencies, its abusive manipulations of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and its ‘hostage diplomacy’ in one country after another.China’s mass theft of intellectual property throughout the G20 economies, the annexation of the South China Sea, and the vast and largely unchallenged subversion and influence operations Beijing’s United Front Work Department is carrying out throughout the world’s advanced economies, including Canada, are also the issues concerning the world’s liberal democracies.Over 300 separate bills targeting China have been drawn up by both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, and the important bills addressing the catastrophes in Hong Kong and Xinjiang enjoyed full bipartisan support.On December 6, amid concerns over the Chinese Communist Party’s threat to American national security, the US States Department listed over 80 Chinese companies mentioned in the US stock exchange in which US retail investors have been investing unknowingly in Chinese companies involved in both civilian and military production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-suggests-dialogue-with-us-as-joe-biden-likely-to-take-tough-stance-against-beijing/story-tjvb9ANtUrIYttEHuDwC9N.html

So it will be difficult to reach that target,” Caumes said.French health authorities reported 11,022 new confirmed COVID-19 cases on Sunday, down from the 12,923 new infections detected the previous day.(Reporting by Dominique Vidalon, editing by Ed Osmond)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-unlikely-to-achieve-daily-5-000-covid-19-cases-per-day-goal-says-top-expert/story-z1s0GPawBARAcqxNcnGGNJ.html
07-12-2020||World||Germany eyes tighter curbs as ‘soft’ shutdown fails to slow spread||Germany is looking to impose tougher restrictions on movement after a nationwide partial shutdown failed to bring contagion rates down to manageable levels.Chancellor Angela Merkel’s chief of staff called for a meeting between the federal government and heads of the country’s 16 states, which could be convened before Christmas, to decide on a plan.“Because a lockdown of this kind doesn’t work in the long run, we have to really tighten things up again, at least in the hot spots,” Helge Braun, said in an online interview with Bild newspaper.Germany shut restaurants, gyms and cinemas, but allowed schools and most of the economy to keep running as it tried a softer approach than other European countries. The measures -- in place since the beginning of November -- have made little impact on the spread of the disease, even as the government spends more than 15 billion euros ($18 billion) a month to compensate affected businesses.Braun favors a return to distance learning for older school children in areas with contagion rates of more than 200 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. With contact restrictions similar to France and Belgium, Germany could lower the spread to levels that don’t threaten to overwhelm the health-care system “within three weeks,” he said.The nationwide seven-day incidence rate currently stands at 146.2, compared with 120.1 at the start of the restrictions on Nov. 2, according to the Robert Koch Institute. The government’s goal is to lower the level to less than 50. Schleswig-Holstein in the north and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in the east are the only German states under that level.“Corona isn’t letting go and therefore we need to react,” Markus Soeder, Bavaria’s premier, said on ARD television on Monday. “I’m sure we’ll meet again before Christmas. The current system isn’t enough.”The home state of Siemens AG, BMW AG and Adidas AG will implement a state of emergency on Wednesday, restricting most people to their homes unless they have a valid reason. In communities with a seven-day incidence of more than 200, there will be a curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. with even fewer exceptions.Germany’s new coronavirus cases rose by 10,910 in the 24 hours to Monday morning, taking the total to 1.19 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There were 150 new fatalities on Monday, lifting the overall number of deaths to 18,989.The so-called reproduction factor, an indicator of how fast the virus is spreading, rose to 1.21 on Sunday, compared to 1.13 the day before. This means that 100 people with the virus will likely infect 121 others. The government has said a level below one is needed to prevent the illness from overwhelming hospitals. The number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care has been at record levels for weeks.“One can and must say that the measures we’ve taken so far haven’t been sufficient to really break the second wave of infections,” Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Monday in Berlin. Because of the rising incidence rates and the R-factor, “I am convinced that we will have to conduct very, very intensive counseling in the next few days and weeks.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-eyes-tighter-curbs-as-soft-shutdown-fails-to-slow-spread/story-J6nTI4wpdKE40Mp0zy7zyN.html
07-12-2020||World||No clarity on when Indians working, studying in China can return||Indian and Chinese officials are in communication on the issue of allowing Indians to return to China, the Chinese foreign ministry has said without elaborating on when special flights between the two countries are likely to resume.The Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) flights operating between India and China were abruptly suspended in the first week of November after 23 Covid-19 positive cases including 19 asymptomatic ones were detected on a flight from New Delhi to the city of Wuhan in central China.China’s civil aviation ministry soon after suspended four more VBM flights that were scheduled to land in different Chinese cities in the following weeks; more than 1,500 Indians had registered for the scheduled VBM flights.The Hindustan Times had reached out to the Chinese foreign ministry to ask whether VBM flights will be allowed to land in China anytime soon.In a brief emailed statement in Mandarin, the ministry said China had to take necessary anti-epidemic measures after the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak hit countries across the world.“China and India are maintaining effective communication on personnel exchanges under the premise of strict epidemic prevention and control,” the foreign ministry statement to HT said.It follows a statement issued by the Indian embassy in Beijing on December 3 that resumption of special flights depends on China. “The movement of persons in India desiring to return to work abroad, including to China, has been similarly facilitated in recent months,” the embassy said.“However, as a result of the restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on November 05, 2020 (“Notice on Temporary Suspension of Certain Valid Chinese Visas”), the operation of VBM flights to and from China has been affected,” it added.The Indian embassy statement added that while it has received numerous requests from Indians wishing to return to China, “…this is a matter that is subject to a decision by the Chinese authorities”.“For its part, the embassy is in constant touch with the Chinese side to work out a mutually acceptable mechanism that might lead to a resumption of VBM flights to China and will release information on the matter as soon as it is available,” the statement added.The last VBM flight to China on October 30 brought in 277 Indians from Delhi and evacuated 157 on its return.The future of thousands of Indian students – majority of the 23,000 who study in China – continue to be uncertain as well because Beijing is not allowing foreign students to return.In a note to the Indian embassy earlier this year, China’s ministry of education (MoE) had said that “…Indian students should maintain close contact with relevant Chinese colleges and universities and arrange to study in China in strict accordance with the suggestions and guidance of the colleges/universities.”While China has effectively contained the spread of Covid-19 within the country – except sporadic small-scale clusters – it reports a handful of “imported” cases daily.China’s national health commission said on Saturday that it received reports of 17 newly confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland on Friday, two of which were domestically transmitted in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.“Fifteen cases were imported from outside the mainland and reported in Shanghai, Henan, Guangdong, Sichuan, Beijing, Shanxi, and Fujian,” the commission said in its daily report.By the end of Friday, a total of 3,919 imported cases had been reported on the mainland.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland reached 86,601 by Friday and 4,634 deaths have been caused by the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-clarity-on-when-indians-working-studying-in-china-can-return/story-B8Pu1VtUD5tpEOXbFxwHpJ.html
07-12-2020||World||India’s imports from China dropped 13%, exports went up by 16% in 2020: State media||India’s exports to China increased by 16% in the first 11 months of the year despite the ongoing border military friction and the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, latest Chinese customs data showed on Monday.Conversely, India imported less from China during the same period, showing a 13% drop, the data quoted by state media showed.Chinese state media was quick to point out that Indian exports to China continued to rise because Beijing hasn’t politicised the border friction along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh --- ongoing since May -- while New Delhi has put curbs on Chinese exports.The fall in Chinese exports to India was also a result of falling internal demand in India because of the pandemic, the tabloid Global Times said in a report on the latest bilateral trade figures on Monday.“According to customs data released on Monday, China exported about $59 billion worth of products to India from January to November in US dollar terms, down 13%. The decline has slightly narrowed compared with a 16.2% drop in the first 10 months this year,” the article added.“However, China’s imports from India surged by 16% during this period, showing that China has refrained from politicising economic interactions with the neighbouring country,” the article said, quoting experts.It is also due to the rising “prejudicial attitude” from the Indian government toward China, as it mounts crackdown-like measures, including increasing tariff barriers, to restrict the inflow of made-in-China products into India, it added. “In comparison, China continues to import more from India despite political frictions,” it said, adding: “China’s imports from India amounted to about $19 billion in value in the first 11 months, up 16%.”According to data compiled by the Indian embassy in Beijing India was the largest export destination for Chinese organic chemicals, fertilizers, antibiotics and aluminium foil in 2019.“India’s top exports to China included organic chemicals, iron ores, unfinished diamonds, fish and crustaceans, cotton, granite stone etc,” Indian embassy data showed. It was in 2019 that India’s trade deficit with China reduced for the first time in over a decade.“In 2019, India’s trade deficit with China reduced slightly by 2%, the first such decrease in deficit since 2005 and stood at $56.95 billion.”India-China bilateral trade in the year 2019 reached US$ 92.89 billion.In 2019, India was the 12th largest trade partner of China, following the US, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany, Australia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brazil and Russia.Meanwhile, Chinese state media has cautiously welcomed the purchase of Indian rice by China, saying it was because of the cost advantage the deal offered.Last week, China for the first time in decades started importing Indian rice largely because of an offer at discounted prices.Indian traders contracted to export 100,000 tonnes of broken rice for December-February shipments at about $300 per tonne on a free-on-board basis, according to a Reuters report from New Delhi.“The purchase was a purely commercial move, as the price of the Indian rice - $300 per tonne - is far cheaper than that of its domestic counterparts, and the rice will mainly serve as animal feed rather than for humans,” Jiao Shanwei, editor-in-chief of cngrain.com, a website specialising in grain news, told state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-exported-more-imported-less-from-china-in-2020-amid-border-friction/story-lKPtwv7EwopITdbUZzLyFP.html

While early news reports said he was caught in a gunfight between his bodyguards, others said that he was fired at by a remote-controlled machine gun mounted on a pick-up truck operated by someone who later fled the country.Also Read |  Saudi prince strongly criticises Israel at Bahrain summitFadavi said on Sunday that the gun fired a total of 13 shots at Fakhrizadeh and managed to target him with such accuracy that his wife, sitting just inches away from him in the same vehicle, escaped injury. He added that 11 bodyguards in separate cars were also accompanying the couple at the time.The incident is the second targeted killing of a high-ranking Iranian official since January, when outgoing US President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike on General Qassem Soleimani.Tehran has blamed Israel for Fakhrizadeh’s killing, the fifth assassination of a nuclear scientist on Iranian soil since 2010. Israel hasn’t commented on the allegations, however Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had singled out the scientist in a power-point presentation on Iran’s nuclear program in April 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-nuclear-scientist-was-killed-using-satellite-controlled-gun/story-Hqe49HFAO8659NX8EXa2dI.html

07-12-2020||World||South Korean health minister warns of ‘Covid-19 war zone’ as cases surge||South Korea’s health minister said Monday that the Seoul metropolitan area is now a “Covid-19 war zone,” as the country reported another 615 new infections and the virus appeared to be spreading faster.The president, meanwhile, issued a call to expand testing and contact tracing. The country has recorded more than 5,300 new infections in the past 10 days and Monday was the 30th day in a row of triple-digit daily jumps.Most cases have come from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where half of South Korea’s 51 million people live. With people increasingly venturing out in public and spending longer hours indoors amid cold temperatures, health workers have struggled to stem transmissions tied to restaurants, saunas, schools, hospitals and long-term care facilities.“The capital area is now a Covid-19 war zone,” Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said in a virus meeting, asking for citizen vigilance.He said the country may have to increase social distancing to prevent the resurgence in the capital area from “exploding into a major outbreak nationwide and collapsing the health-care system.”Na Seong-woong, a senior official from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, told reporters the country could be reporting around 900 new infections a day next week if it fails to slow the virus quickly.While South Korea managed to contain a major outbreak in its southeastern region in spring by channeling nationwide health resources and personnel, it’s less clear where the reinforcements will come if the virus wreaks havoc in the Seoul area.While President Moon Jae-in’s government had been eager to tout the country’s previous gains against the virus, there’s criticism that it gambled on its own success by moving quickly to ease social distancing restrictions to the lowest level in October even as the virus was still spreading.Officials have moved to restore some distancing restrictions in the Seoul area in recent weeks, shutting down nightclubs, karaoke rooms and gyms, reducing in-person school classes and allowing restaurants to provide only delivery and take-out after 9 pmCity officials in Seoul have also reduced public transportation after 9 pm to discourage unnecessary gatherings, although some say the move might backfire by making buses and subways more packed.Some health experts have endorsed stronger restrictions, such as banning all gatherings of more than 10 people, shutting down schools and churches and requiring companies to have more employees work from home.Moon expressed concern Monday that health workers are increasingly struggling to track transmission routes amid the rising infections and urged officials to deploy the “maximum available manpower” of civil servants, police and military personnel to assist with contact tracing efforts in the capital area, his spokesman Chung Man-ho said.Chung said Moon also instructed officials to keep more testing stations open during night hours or holidays and install more “drive-through” setups that allow workers to collect samples from drivers through car windows.He also asked “any citizen who has the slightest suspicion of being infected to visit a screening center to get tested,” Chung said.During a separate briefing, Na said health officials are planning to adopt new testing techniques, including rapid antigen tests and salvia-based tests, so that they could screen potential virus carriers more quickly.The country mainly relies on a diagnostic testing method called PCR, which is more accurate but also more complicated.The country’s has reported 38,161 infections since the pandemic began and 549 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-health-minister-warns-of-covid-19-war-zone-as-cases-surge/story-BYioQo6x3nRYyzfGOq0lHL.html
07-12-2020||World||Last month the hottest November on record: EU||Last month was the hottest November on record as Europe basked in its highest Autumn temperatures in history, the European Union’s satellite monitoring service said Monday. The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) analysis of surface and air temperatures found that November 2020 was 0.8C warmer than the 30-year average of 1981-2010 -- more than 0.1C hotter than the previous record.For boreal autumn (September-November) temperatures in Europe were 1.9C above the standard reference period, 0.4C higher than the average temperature in 2006, which was the previous warmest.“These records are consistent with the long-term warming trend of the global climate,” said C3S director Carlo Buontempo. “All policy-makers who prioritise mitigating climate risks should see these records as alarm bells and consider more seriously than ever how to best comply with the international commitments set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement”.The landmark deal, which turns five this month, enjoins nations to limit temperature rises to “well-below” 2C (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.Last week the World Meteorological Organization said 2020 was on course to be among the three hottest years ever recorded.C3S said that with just one month left to go, 2020 is on par to match 2016, the current record holder. With just over 1C of warming so far, Earth is already dealing with the devastation caused by more frequent and stronger extreme weather events such as wildfires and tropical storms.Satellite images analysed by C3S also showed that Arctic sea ice extent was the second lowest for November in the database, which began in 1979.The largest negative sea ice concentration anomalies were in the Kara Sea, while there was below average cover in the eastern Canadian archipelago and Baffin Bay.“This trend is concerning and highlights the importance of comprehensive monitoring of the Arctic, as it is warming faster than the rest of the world,” said Buontempo.Temperatures were substantially higher than normal across the Arctic and much of Siberia last month, and higher than average across the United States, South America, southern Africa, eastern Antarctica and most of Australia, C3S said.The five hottest years in history have all come since 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/last-month-the-hottest-november-on-record-eu/story-zXIkqTPFl2HN0VYLNjbdGO.html

The move comes as President Donald Trump continues to pile pressure on China’s Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party in his final weeks in office.While the names or positions of any of the potential targets weren’t immediately known, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo was expected to sign off on a list that included high-ranking officials. The Trump administration had previously declined to sanction any members of the Politburo’s supreme Standing Committee.Also read | US raises concerns over CCP’s threat to American national securityAs many as 14 people were expected to be impacted, Reuters, which first reported the sanctions, said separately.Hong Kong has continued to be rocked by political upheaval in recent weeks. Last month, China passed a resolution allowing the disqualification of Hong Kong lawmakers who weren’t deemed sufficiently loyal -- prompting opposition legislators to resign en masse.Their departure fueled concern about Hong Kong’s autonomy from Beijing in the wake of China-drafted national security legislation imposed on the former British colony in June. Prominent local activist Joshua Wong was also sentenced to more than a year in prison last week for leading a 2019 protest outside police headquarters, the latest in a series of moves by Chinese and local officials to clamp down on the city’s battered opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-set-to-sanction-more-china-officials-over-hong-kong/story-l9AoJPBHUYshI8SRtYMp9H.html
07-12-2020||World||Rudy Giuliani, personal lawyer of Donald Trump, tests positive for Covid-19||Rudolph Giuliani, personal lawyer of Donald Trump, became the newest member of the US president’s inner circle to come down with Covid-19.President Trump revealed Giuliani’s infection in a tweet saying he “tested positive for the China Virus”, deploying a description of the pathogen he used to shield him from any blame. Giuliani leads the president’s legal and political efforts to challenge his election defeat to Joe Biden.President Trump indicated those efforts will continue unaffected by Giuliani’s infection, saying “we will carry on”.Giuliani is 76, is over-weight and a prostate cancer survivor, which taken together would put him in the high-risk category for developing severe symptoms of Covid-19. The former New York City mayor, who had been called America’s Mayor for leading the city’s response to and recovery from the 9/11 terrorist attacks, is undergoing treatment at a Washington DC hospital.In another potential setback for the outgoing president, attorney general William Barr is reported to be weighing his exit from the administration before the end of Trump’s tenure. Once a fierce loyalist, he invited the president’s wrath recently by declaring his department had found no evidence of widespread election fraud, disputing Trump’s claims he was robbed of a second term.President-elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, is reportedly set to name California’s Hispanic attorney general Xavier Becerra as secretary of health and human services (DHS), which will lead the Biden administration’s fight against Covid1-9.Trump and his legal team have forwarded baseless allegations of election fraud and malpractices that have been thrown out by courts in all six key states where the president lost the battle for the White House. They are now trying to persuade Republican lawmakers of those states to reject the outcome, using technicalities of the electoral college system.Giuliani is the newest member of the expanding circle of Trump’s aides, associate and family members to have been infected by the deadly virus, in no small measure because of their refusal to abide by routine social distancing norms.President Trump himself was infected and hospitalised with a bout of Covid-19 just days after the first of the two presidential debates in October. Melania Trump, the first lady, and their son Barron Trump followed shortly. As did Trump’s eldest son Don Trump Jr, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien, and Trump campaign officials Bill Stepien and David Bossie (who was assigned by Trump to lead his legal efforts before Giuliani).The United States has been hit the hardest by the pandemic with more than 14 million infections and 282,000 fatalities and President Trump’s mishandling of the most severe public health crisis — he has strenuously contested that criticism and claimed to have responded adequately —and the economic devastation that followed may have cost him a second term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rudy-giuliani-personal-lawyer-of-donald-trump-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-pCGB3vASrP82DORS1dKbgL.html

Kavtech is a Pakistani owned company, located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, with ties to Pakistani intelligence, military, and the interior,” she said in the letter.Also Read | Trump running out of time to solidify immigration agenda after US election lossMeanwhile, the election researchers familiar with the incident has opined that the inclusion of another email address in the CC line could either be an “an accident by a contractor who worked on the Nevada secretary of state’s website” or even an indication of the involvement of an unauthorised company allegedly linked to Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) into the backend of the Nevada government’s website system.“Such an intrusion could be problematic if downloading the voter registration list also worked as a phishing attack, where hackers could gain entry into the servers of those requesting the lists, or if hackers had access to state government email communications,” Kristina said.“The fact that this company was cc’ed on an email containing access to the Nevada voter registration database appears to be evidence of a breach within the Nevada Secretary of State’s email system,” Engelbrecht told Demers.“Obviously, the problems that such a breach may evidence include access to at least the voter registration information of Nevada residents. At worst it could reveal a breach that gives a foreign power access to not only the State of Nevada’s systems, but also to the email systems of anyone whom the State communicates with via email,” she added.Post the incident, Engelbrecht said in an interview with Breitbart News, “Why would they [Pakistani company] be getting this information? Why would they show up on a cc line? There’s no good way to look at that should make anyone feel confident in the security of this process.”“Further, all we can speak to is our experience. Who knows where else that is showing up and what else they’re tracking? If it’s embedded in a form like that, they could be doing that for any number of things,” she further said.“The implication here that a foreign national company with known ties to the intelligence community in Pakistan -- there’s no way to overlook that. It’s inexplicable and it should be investigated,” she added.This incident comes even after a Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) executive committee on November 12 had said in a statement, “While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too.”Meanwhile, despite sending requests for comment to the Arizona secretary of state and the Justice Department regarding the matter, Breitbart News is not received any comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-on-alert-after-link-surfaces-between-nevada-govt-website-isi-linked-company/story-ZRb3x3eZHxFyGVwC4uaz1N.html
07-12-2020||World||International Day of Civil Aviation today: All you need to know||The world is observing the International Day of Civil Aviation on Monday. The day was first celebrated by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on December 7, 1994, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Convention on International Civil Aviation.Here’s all you need to know about the International Day of Civil Aviation:1. In 1996, with the assistance of the Canadian government, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) officially recognised December 7 as the International Day of Civil Aviation in the UN calendar.2. The purpose behind observing this day, according to both the UN and ICAO, is to “help generate and reinforce worldwide awareness of the importance of international civil aviation to the social and economic development of the States, and of the unique role of ICAO in helping States to cooperate and realise a truly global rapid transit network at the service of all mankind.”3. Every five years, coinciding with the ICAO anniversaries, the ICAO Council selects a special anniversary theme. A single theme is selected for four full years between two ICAO anniversaries.4. For its 75th anniversary, in 2019, ICAO had selected the theme “75 years of connecting the world.” From 2020 to 2023, the theme will be “Advancing innovation for global aviation development.”5. Headquartered in Montreal, Canada, ICAO is a specialised agency of the UN. Its objective is to change the principles and techniques of international air navigation and plan and develop international air transport.6. The Convention on International Civil Aviation was signed on December 7, 1944. Also called “Chicago Convention,” it was signed by 52 states in Chicago. It came into effect on April 4, 1947, and on the same date, ICAO, too, came into being. In October, it became a specialised agency of the UN.7. As of March 2019, all member states of the UN, except Liechtenstein, are signatories to the Chicago Convention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-of-civil-aviation-today-all-you-need-to-know/story-DnNGKyJQ1HsBi9BJnahtiJ.html
07-12-2020||World||China’s Covid-free ‘Hawaii’ chases local tourist dollar with a vengeance||Millions of domestic tourists are descending on China’s southernmost island province of Hainan, presenting a surreal contrast with grim hospital scenes, shuttered restaurants and stifling home quarantine elsewhere in a virus-ravaged world.Known at home as the “Hawaii of China”, the island, about the size of Taiwan, has been free of coronavirus for six months, drawing eager shoppers to duty-free malls, couples seeking a sub-tropical backdrop for wedding pictures, and surfers just looking to “breathe freely”. October arrivals of 9.6 million, according to official data, exceeded the year-earlier figure, before the pandemic struck, by 3.1%, although foreign visitors slumped 87%. That was a far cry from February, when arrivals had dropped almost 90%. The rapid surge in tourism shows China’s consumer sector may be throwing off its virus-induced slumber as the closure of many international borders pushes travellers to destinations such as Hainan, traditionally costlier than most of Southeast Asia. Tourism spending has got a leg up since a new duty-free spending cap of 100,000 yuan ($15,186) for travellers took effect in July, up from 30,000 yuan earlier.Hainan has raked in 12 billion yuan in such sales in the following four months, to stand up 214.1% on the year, or almost on par with 2019 sales of 13.61 billion. Tourists racing through the Haitang Bay Duty Free Shopping Center in the island’s city of Sanya were astonished at the queues outside the boutiques of luxury brands from Chanel to Gucci, with some likening the scene to a yard sale. “This is crazy - we did not expect so many people,” said a visitor from the southwestern city of Chengdu, who gave her name only as Mrs Xie.But she was willing to queue for more than 30 minutes in the 12 million-square-foot (1.1 million-sq-m) mall just to enter a Gucci store. “Seriously, is Gucci that cheap? With these many people in line, I would’ve thought it’s free,” said the 32-year-old. A 53-year-old woman surnamed Liu who used to visit Thailand or Malaysia at this time of year said Sanya had been a good substitute. She paid more than 14,000 yuan for a Gucci handbag. “Such a steal!” said the native of Chongqing, another southwestern city.“We already bought cosmetics in Haikou and we’re here for the bags,” she added, referring to the island’s capital. As the “stay-home” economy grew in China because of the global pandemic, Morgan Stanley estimates “reshored consumption” could reach up to $165 billion this year. NORMALCYAlthough the 46 million visitors Hainan received from January to October were well below the 2019 figure of 83 million domestic and foreign tourists, Chinese travellers are set to extend the tourism boom into the winter. Reflecting demand, the average daily rate of bookings in Sanya soared 43% in November from a year earlier to $151, and jumped 51% to $190 for December，says analytics firm AirDNA, which tracks bookings on Airbnb and Vrbo. While the number of properties with at least one night booked rose 7% in November, the figure for December had already reached 85% of the year-earlier level.Hainan is also the travel destinations for the Lunar New Year coming up in February, says analytics firm ForwardKeys.On a beach stretch studded with five-star hotels along Yalong Bay, dozens of newly-weds prepared for elaborate wedding shoots.The pandemic thwarted the plans of Xia Weini, 30, and her 28-year old husband Wang Yu, natives of far western Xinjiang, to visit the Thai resort island of Phuket to pose for their photos. “Xinjiang is probably the most landlocked place in China, so we’ve always wanted to get married near the sea,” said Xia.They ended up spending more than 10,000 yuan in Sanya for the pictures instead. Apart from the glitz, Hainan offers a sense of normalcy that is a powerful draw. Business is proving so good in Houhai village, a surf spot about a 40-minute drive from the centre of Sanya, that many are turning homes into surf clubs, said Che Linxin, brand manager at Jile Surf Inn. As surfing catches on among young people stuck at home during the pandemic, the six-year-old club has drawn surfers, musicians and painters among its customers, who tripled from last year. “There’s no off-season in Sanya this year. Everyday is peak season ever since we first reopened in March,” Che added. Yanzi, a 25-year-old tour guide from Beijing, is a regular. “I had bad headaches when I was in Beijing. Maybe it’s the air or the fact my company is not even paying me my base salary,” she said. “But here, I can just walk around in public in my bikini, bathe in the sunshine and breathe freely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-covid-free-hawaii-chases-local-tourist-dollar-with-a-vengeance/story-hqr6FrKRb1zPxEr45S3ryL.html

Leading figures such as the British queen taking the Covid-19 vaccine is expected to help overcome anxieties. The initial batch received from Belgium has 800,000 doses. The UK has ordered 40mn doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is enough to vaccinate 20mn people with two does, 21 days apart. It has also reached agreement for early access to over 300mn doses of other vaccines, when approved.In China, local governments are placing orders for domestically made coronavirus vaccines. More than 1 million health care workers and others in China have received experimental vaccines under emergency use permission. Pakistan: 7 Covid patients die as O2 supply runs outAt least seven patients admitted at a Covid-19 ward and at another ward of a hospital in Pakistan’s Peshawar died after oxygen supply at the hospital ran out. Khyber Teaching Hospital officials said that seven patients died overnight due to lack of oxygen supply. A hospital spokesperson said that the hospital had the capacity to keep 10,000 litres of oxygen, which had been maintained on a daily basis. He said the oxygen supply was sourced from a company in Rawalpindi and supplies had run out after demand rose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-to-be-among-first-to-be-vaccinated-in-uk/story-Ru75sCVaH3fZm9gb8F8GZM.html
07-12-2020||World||Warning for US: 500,000 Covid-19 deaths by spring||In a chilling warning to the American public, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in Seattle has projected in a report that more than 500,000 people could die from the Covid-19 pandemic in the country by early spring despite the roll-out of a coronavirus vaccine.“Even with expected vaccine roll-out, the US is forecast to see 539,000 deaths by April 1... In the US, the expected vaccine roll-out only reduces the toll by April 1 by 9,000 deaths,” Sputnik quoted IHME as saying. The IHME also said that the steady decline in Covid-19 infection rates around the world is expected to start in February.The projection came as the US notched a record number of coronavirus cases in 24 hours for the third day running. A tally by Johns Hopkins University showed the world’s worst-hit country witnessed nearly 230,000 new infections and 2,527 Covid-related deaths on Saturday alone.For two weeks, the US has regularly topped 2,000 deaths per day, as it had in the spring at the height of the first wave of the country’s outbreak.The coronavirus has now killed more than 1.5 million people and infected 66 million around the world since emerging in China last year, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.South Korea, meanwhile, raised its coronavirus alert to the second highest level in Seoul and surrounding areas on Sunday after new infections jumped from around 100 a day to more than 500 in recent weeks. All gatherings of more than 50 people will be banned and professional sports will be held behind closed doors with no spectators.Italy is seeing a dramatic resurgence of infections after it largely tamped down an earlier outbreak by enforcing a strict lockdown, while Latin America and the Caribbean region have seen an 18% spike in cases in a week.Other countries will also see holiday restrictions, with Switzerland banning Christmas caroling in the streets and Madrid cancelling most New Year events in the city centre.In another development, Indonesia’s minister of social affairs, Juliari Batubara, has been arrested on suspicion of accepting $1.2 million in bribes linked to food aid distributed to people affected by the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warning-for-us-500-000-covid-19-deaths-by-spring/story-rVwJGc6ASWuYrmXB1uHnoO.html

Authorities in the United States, too, will decide this week on giving emergency use authorisation (EUA) to Pfizer’s candidate. According to reports, the American pharmaceutical corporation has sought emergency use approval in India as well.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWith various other vaccine candidates at different stages of trials globally, here are the latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccine development front:1. Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) on Sunday applied for emergency use approval for Oxford University-AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate, Covishield. This makes SII, which is conducting trials of Covishield in India, the second firm to seek approval for emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine candidate in India after Pfizer, as well as the first indigenous firm to do so.Also Read | SII seeks emergency use authorisation for Oxford Covid vaccine Covishield in India2. Also in Pune, phase 2 human trials of Russia’s Sputnik V have begun with 17 volunteers being administered the first dose. The shots were administered at the Noble Hospital between December 3-5. On August 11, Russia had become the first country to register a Covid-19 vaccine-Sputnik V.3. The first batch of vaccine candidate of China’s Sinovac Biotech Limited arrived in Indonesia late on Sunday night. As many as 1.2 million doses arrived on Sunday while 1.8 million more doses are likely to arrive in early January, Indonesian president Joko Widodo said. The Indonesian government has also placed orders with at least three other drugmakers, including AstraZeneca.4. The United Kingdom will, this week, become the first country to roll out a vaccine after health authorities, last week, gave approval for emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech SE’s candidate. The first shots are set to be administered on Tuesday, with the National Health Service (NHS) to give priority to frontline workers and those above the age of 80.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-serum-institute-of-india-seeks-emergency-use-approval-for-covishield-sputnik-v-phase-2-trials-begin-in-pune/story-nJJkYWWJK2YWGXVPNgmEsO.html
07-12-2020||World||Joe Biden makes picks for key public health roles as pandemic rages: Report||President-elect Joe Biden has made his selections for two key public health positions, sources said on Sunday, as he prepares to take office next month as the coronavirus pandemic rages to new levels across the United States.Biden plans to nominate California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as secretary of health and human services, two sources said, placing the Latino former congressman in a critical role battling the pandemic.The former vice president is also expected to nominate Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, to run the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a person familiar with the decision said.The choice of Becerra, 62, who also had been considered a candidate for U.S. attorney general, came as Biden faced more pressure to add diversity to his Cabinet appointments, including complaints from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about the lack of Latinos.Becerra will lead the health agency as it struggles to handle a resurgence of the coronavirus, including record infections and a daily death toll that has exceeded 2,000 in recent days, and prepares a mammoth effort to vaccinate Americans against the virus.More than 281,000 Americans have died from the Covid-19 disease, according to a Reuters tally.The announcement of the choice of Becerra could come as soon as Monday, said one of the sources familiar with the decision. Biden named some top members of his health team last week, and is expected to roll out the full team this week.“Biden is living up to his commitment to make the Cabinet a reflection of diversity,” said Robert Garcia, mayor of Long Beach, California, and a longtime ally of Becerra and Biden.Garcia said Becerra “has a strong record on healthcare but I think it goes beyond that. The president-elect selected someone with the highest levels of integrity and intellect.”In Congress, Becerra played a key role in passing the Affordable Care Act - former President Barack Obama’s key domestic policy achievement. In his current role, Becerra leads the coalition of 20 states defending the program better known as Obamacare, including before the Supreme Court last month.Biden has asked Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force, to stay on as chief medical adviser. The Democratic president-elect also has named Jeff Zients, an economic adviser touted for his managerial skills, as a coronavirus “czar” to oversee an unprecedented operation to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of a new vaccine, coordinating efforts across multiple federal agencies.Biden picked Vivek Murthy, a physician and former surgeon general who has gained prominence in recent months as co-chairman of Biden’s advisory board dealing with the pandemic, to return for a second go-around as surgeon general.Becerra served as a Democratic U.S. representative from 1993 to 2017 before moving back to his home state to become attorney general. In that post, he succeeded Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-makes-picks-for-key-public-health-roles-as-pandemic-rages-report/story-jdY4fnfZIYSNDtPd2MLKpO.html
07-12-2020||World||Nepal PM Oli skips standing committee meeting citing differences with Prachanda||Nepal Prime Minister and Chairman of ruling Nepal Communist Party has replied to party’s standing committee meeting that he won’t be able to attend the meeting to discuss on prevailing issues.Sending a two-page letter to the standing committee meeting on Sunday afternoon, PM Oli expressed his unwillingness to come to party office for standing committee meeting where he has been losing his majority.“In today’s (Sunday) meeting, Chairman KP Sharma Oli remained absent. Giving a reason to his absence, he sent a letter addressing the meeting. The letter was read out by Secretariat member Ishwor Pokhrel formally informing the meeting about it. Oli has reiterated his earlier opinion stating that Prachanda’s (Pushpa Kamal Dahal) proposal cannot be discussed in the meeting formally. Oli has cited this reason for not being able to attend the meeting,” Narayan Kaji Shrestha, spokesperson for ruling Nepal Communist Party told reporters on Sunday.In the letter, Oli has reiterated his previous stance that Dahal should withdraw his political proposal tabled in the Secretariat without any pre-conditions. Furthermore, Oli accused Dahal of working towards the dissolution of the party by tabling an “allegation paper” against him.“I suggest that the Standing Committee meeting should discuss finalising the pending works relating to the party unification, making preparations for the party’s upcoming general convention and working toward a better response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Oli mentioned in the letter.Oli expressed his determination that he wants to keep the party unity intact and run the party based on consensus.“The ongoing intra-party crisis must be resolved through dialogue and the party should remain united as there are just four months left to hold the first general convention of the party. The question of leadership change in the party can be well settled through the general convention,” the Prime Minister stated.The Standing Committee meeting of ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) was called on for Sunday afternoon at Party Head Office in Dhumbarahi, Kathmandu. It was scheduled to hold deliberation on the proposals tabled earlier by the chairmen duo KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal.Earlier on November 28, PM Oli had presented a 38-page long rebuttal in response to 19 paged political document floated by Dahal where the latter had raised questions on the ability of the incumbent government’s performance.In the next round of meeting, Oli has had demanded the withdrawal of Dahal’s political paper, claiming it to be mere allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-oli-skips-standing-committee-meeting-citing-differences-with-prachanda/story-5BxYIdT6JgyKzCdEMJG72L.html

07-12-2020||World||US, China dominated arms market in 2019: Report||US and Chinese companies dominated the global arms market in 2019, while the Middle East made its first appearance among the 25 biggest weapons manufacturers, a report by the SIPRI research institute said Monday.The US arms industry accounted for 61 percent of sales by the world’s “Top 25” manufacturers last year, ahead of China’s 15.7 percent, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.Total sales by the “Top 25” rose by 8.5 percent to $361 billion, or 50 times the annual budget of the UN’s peacekeeping operations.Six US companies and three Chinese firms were in the top 10, rounded out by Britain’s BAE Systems in seventh spot.“China and the United States are the two biggest states in terms of global arms spending, with companies cut to size,” Lucie Beraud-Sudreau, director of SIPRI’s arms and military expenditure programme, told AFP.The US has dominated the market for decades, but for China -- whose companies’ sales rose by almost five percent in 2019 -- “this increase corresponds to the implementation of reforms to modernise the People’s Liberation Army underway since 2015,” she said.US companies Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and General Dynamics clinched the top five spots, while China’s AVIC, CETC and Norinco held spots six, eight and nine. US group L3Harris Technologies was in 10th place.“Europe remains a bit dispersed...but if you combine the European companies together you could have European companies the same size” as US and Chinese manufacturers, Beraud-Sudreau noted.Airbus (European, 13th in the ranking) and Thales (French, 14th) can meanwhile boast of having the strongest international presence -- each is represented in 24 countries, ahead of US Boeing.“European companies are more internationalised” than others, Beraud-Sudreau said.- Breakthrough in the Mideast -For the first time, a company from the Middle East made it into the “Top 25”: EDGE, of the United Arab Emirates, was formed by the consolidation of some 25 defence entities in 2019.In 22nd spot, EDGE “is a good illustration of how the combination of high national demand for military products and services with a desire to become less dependent on foreign suppliers is driving the growth of arms companies in the Middle East,” SIPRI researcher Pieter Wezeman said in the report.SIPRI also noted that French group Dassault had shot up from 38th to 17th place, boosted by exports of its Rafale fighter jets in 2019.Meanwhile, two Russian companies were also in the “Top 25”, Almaz-Antey in 15th spot and United Shipbuilding in 25th. Beraud-Sudreau noted that Russian companies were in better shape several years ago thanks to a vast modernisation programme for its military, but business had since “slowed sharply”.Sanctions imposed on Moscow after its 2014 annexation of Crimea and a drop in natural gas and energy prices had impacted Russia’s economy, she said.“Russia has had to slow down its plans to modernise its military equipment... As a result there have been fewer orders from the Russian state, fewer new projects launched, and a drop in revenue,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-dominated-arms-market-in-2019-report/story-ByVRlhseCCxbkoR9Qf5qAI.html

Since then, a flurry of administration officials and others in Trump’s orbit have also been sickened, including White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicLast month, Giuliani’s son, Andrew Giuliani, a special assistant to Trump, said he tested positive for coronavirus.“I am experiencing mild symptoms, and am following all appropriate protocols, including being in quarantine and conducting contact tracing,” the younger Giuliani said in a Nov. 20 tweet disclosing his COVID-19 positive test.The extraordinary spread in Trump’s orbit underscores the cavalier approach the president has taken to a virus that has now killed more than 280,000 people in the U.S. alone.Those infected now also include the vice president, his chief of staff, the White House press secretary, advisers Hope Hicks and Stephen Miller, as well as Trump’s campaign manager and the chair of the Republican National Committee.Trump spent the waning days of his campaign trying to persuade the American public that the virus was receding, and repeatedly claimed it would miraculously “disappear” after Nov. 3.

07-12-2020||World||India questions Scotland Yard security after protest over farmers’ issue||The Indian high commission on Sunday questioned the security provided by Scotland Yard after nearly 4,000 protestors were allowed to gather to protest against farm laws in a demonstration that it said included anti-India elements.Scotland Yard arrested 13 people and advised motorists to avoid the area around the Indian mission in central London after thousands converged from various parts of the UK, leading to traffic jams in the area for some hours. Four of the arrested were later de-arrested after they provided details to the police and were fined.Indian quarters expressed strong disappointment over the security arrangements after the protestors were allowed despite restrictions in place over Covid-19 and the police stating that a “robust policing plan” was in place.Indian diplomat Vishwesh Negi said, “The high commission had been informed that as per normal practice permission had been sought... for a drive-past protest involving about 40 vehicles. We were also aware that the police had given specific warning against the gathering of more than 30 people”.“The developing situation was brought to the attention of the UK Foreign Office and Home Office. The London Metropolitan Police managed, controlled and eventually disposed the crowds. We could see that a few violent were arrested”.Also read: Satellite imagery shows China setting up border villages between India, Bhutan“Our high commission has been coordinating closely with the authorities concerned and we will, together with them, address the issues that have come up: for example, how this gathering of thousands could take place without specific permission, etc,” he added.The teenagers were arrested after they were seen setting off “firework towards a large crowd. They were also found to be in possession of a number of other fireworks,” the police said, adding that officers are in attendance at the protest in the Aldwych area.Motorists were advised to avoid Strand, Waterloo Bridge and Fleet Street near the Indian mission, which was cordoned off by a line of police officers, while a large crowd shouted slogans and held placards against the Narendra Modi government on the other side of the road, demanding scrapping of the controversial farm laws.There were also some demonstrations at Trafalgar Square. Reports from various parts of London and some approach roads into the capital also witnessed traffic jams as cars bearing flags and placards were driven by protestors arriving from various places.Negi added, “As expected, it soon became clear that the gathering was led by anti-India separatists who had taken the opportunity of the farm protests ostensibly not to back the farmers in India but use the opportunity to pursue their own agenda”.“As many are aware, the protest against agriculture reform bills in India is part of a democratic process. It is work in progress in our functioning democracy. Government of India is in talks with the protesters which are still ongoing. Needless to say, it is an internal issue of India”.Indian officials have been briefing interlocutors in the British government and parliament in recent days on the fundamental features of farm sector reforms.The protestors had gathered in central London even after the police issued a reminder that strict regulations remain in place to help prevent the spread of coronavirus disease. The reminder meant that anyone gathering for the protest risks enforcement action by officers, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-questions-scotland-yard-security-after-protest-over-farmers-issue/story-zyjRX0IlUmtEc2x4EpdVfI.html
07-12-2020||World||Austria postpones coronavirus testing after huge snowstorm||Several communities in the Austrian Alps put mass coronavirus testing on hold Sunday and others were urged to do the same after a storm dumped huge amounts of snow, sending some avalanche warnings to their highest level.Some parts of the province of Tyrol saw 70 centimeters (27.5 inches) of snow fall overnight Friday into Saturday, and another 110 centimeters (43 inches) were expected on Sunday, Austria’s APA news agency reported.In East Tyrol, 500 households were left without electricity after trees brought down power lines and the avalanche warning was at its highest level of 5. Several areas in East Tyrol postponed virus testing.In North Tyrol, the avalanche warning was at 4 on Sunday.Neighbouring Italy and Switzerland also issued avalanche warnings, and the Brenner Pass highway between Austria and Italy was partially closed, as were some train connections, APA reported.More than a meter (three feet) of snow fell within a few hours in the Italian Dolomites and rain burst riverbanks of the Panaro river, forcing a few dozen families to evacuate from the Modena area as a precaution, the ANSA news agency reported.The regional governor of Veneto urged residents to just stay home, noting in a Facebook post some areas of flash flooding where around 30 centimeters (one foot) of rain fell within a short period, isolating some small villages in the province of hard-hit Belluno.In Austria, Tyrol authorities told local communities to assess whether the conditions warranted postponing coronavirus testing planned for Sunday.“The safety of the population comes first,” authorities said.Austria on Friday started a voluntary mass testing program that officials hope will prevent long, hard lockdowns in the future. The fast antigen tests started in Vienna and in the westernmost Vorarlberg and Tyrol provinces.Over the first two days, some 300,000 people were tested out of Austria’s nearly 9 million. The government is hoping that several million will have been tested by mid December.The testing is part of Austria’s strategy to slow the spread of the coronavirus even as it starts to ease restrictions this coming week. Tough lockdown measures that took effect Nov. 17 expire on Sunday.Going ahead, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said Austria will keep restaurants, bars and hotels closed until Jan. 7 but will allow skiing from Dec. 24.In other changes, a limited curfew that has applied around the clock will be eased and will apply only between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. Schools will mostly be reopened, as will non-essential shops, museums, libraries and some other businesses.Austria has seen more than 300,000 coronavirus infections and more than 3,800 deaths, although its infection rate has declined in recent weeks. It is currently recording 266.5 new infections per 100,000 residents over seven days, down from around 600 last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-postpones-coronavirus-testing-after-huge-snowstorm/story-tnptIYbOsY6tsOTefSoF0O.html

07-12-2020||World||Double Dragons: SpaceX launches space station supplies||SpaceX launched a newer, bigger version of its Dragon supply ship to the International Space Station on Sunday, marking the first time the company has two capsules in orbit at the same time.The Dragon — packed with Christmas treats and presents — should reach the space station on Monday, joining the Dragon that delivered four astronauts last month.“Dragons everywhere you look,” said Kenny Todd, NASA’s deputy space station program manager.With NASA’s commercial crew program officially under way, SpaceX expects to always have at least one Dragon capsule at the space station.SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket blasted off with the latest Dragon from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, where coronavirus precautions kept staff to a minimum. The first-stage booster — making its fourth flight — landed on an ocean platform several minutes after the late-morning liftoff. It was first used back in May for the first astronaut launch by Elon Musk’s company.The 6,400-pound (2,900-kilogram) shipment includes billions of microbes and crushed asteroid samples for a biomining study, a new medical device to provide rapid blood test results for astronauts in space, and a privately owned and operated chamber to move experiments as big as refrigerators outside the orbiting lab. Forty mice also are flying for bone and eye studies, two areas of weaknesses for astronauts during long space stays.Todd said all this research is “the ultimate Christmas present” for NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, a virus hunter who performed the first DNA sequencing in space a few years ago.As for more personal presents for the four Americans, two Russians and one Japanese on board, “I don’t like to get out in front of Santa Claus. I fear it might mess up my own Christmas,” Todd said late last week. “Let’s see what happens when they open the hatch ... I’m optimistic.”For the astronauts’ Christmas feast, the Dragon is carrying roasted turkey, cornbread dressing, cranberry sauce, shortbread cookies and tubes of icing.The station crew watched a live broadcast of the launch, from 250 miles (400 kilometers) up.This updated cargo-carrying model — as large as the SpaceX crew capsule — will dock to the orbiting lab by itself. Previous SpaceX cargo ships needed the station’s robot arm for anchoring.The capsule will remain at the space station for about a month as usual before undocking with experiments and old equipment, and splashing into the Atlantic. That’s another change from SpaceX’s older cargo ships, which parachuted into the Pacific. Returning closer to Cape Canaveral will save recycling time.This is SpaceX’s 21st station supply run for NASA since 2012. The flight was delayed a day by rough weather in the booster-recovery area offshore. This was the 68th successful booster landing by SpaceX.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/double-dragons-spacex-launches-space-station-supplies/story-jE8aqEVdaV16a7NRGqBofM.html
07-12-2020||World||US Covid-19 cases remain over 200,000 for fourth straight day||The United States on Saturday saw 213,877 new Covid-19 infections, the country’s fourth consecutive day of more than 200,000 daily infections, as per data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University and news agency Bloomberg. While the number was lesser than that of the previous day’s 228,419 cases, the seven day average in the country is above 191,300 cases, a 16 per cent increase from the previous week.Also, the data showed 2,301 new fatalities -- the fifth consecutive day of more than 2000 deaths -- after a record 2,867 fatalities on Thursday.With cases increasing, stay-at-home orders would be effective in Southern California, of which Los Angeles and San Diego are a part, and San Joaquin Valley from 11:59 pm local time after intensive care capacity fell in the regions below the threshold of 15 per cent, reports Bloomberg.About 33 million people or 84 per cent of the state’s population would be affected by the order, according to the Los Angeles Times. Bars, hair salons, live audience sports and other such activities would remain shut following the order that would last for at least three weeks. While intensive care capacity at the five San Francisco Bay Area counties are still above the 15 per cent threshold determined by the state, Covid-19 restrictions are expected to begin soon.Meanwhile, chief advisor of the Operation Warp Speed program Moncef Slaoui has said on Sunday that he would meet with the President-elect Joe Biden. The two would discuss about Covid-19 vaccines, as the first bunch of vaccines are expected to be rolled-out later this month, reported news agency Reuters.Saloui in an interview with CBS’ Face the Nation said that he looked forward to the meeting and that “things have been really very appropriately planned.”The meeting has been scheduled amidst Biden’s comments that his team has not yet seen a detailed plan for the vaccine distribution process, which he called difficult and expensive.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-remain-over-200-000-for-fourth-straight-day/story-lZsR6LOecwdqHgF5nxzrtM.html
