Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases warned that the US is at a “very critical point” in combating the pandemic after many Americans ignored guidance to avoid travel.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageFlying has picked up recently while remaining well below year-ago levels. Figures from the Transportation Security Administration show more than 1 million people moved through US airport checkpoints on five of the past nine days heading into and through the holidays.Admiral Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said the risks entailed by traveling depend mostly on what people do once they get to their destinations, as actually being in an airplane is typically safe.“What we really worry about is the mingling of different bubbles once you get to your destination,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”Vaccinations in the US began Dec. 14 with health-care workers and residents of nursing homes. So far almost 2 million doses have been administered in the country, according to a state-by-state tally compiled by Bloomberg. Those numbers are accelerating as a second vaccine by Moderna Inc. is distributed.Mutant strainHealth officials are on alert for a more infectious Covid strain that’s emerged in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland and Japan, although there’s no clear evidence it results in more severe cases of the disease.Travelers coming to the US from the UK face more restrictions because of the new variant, with the US insisting on testing negative for Covid-19 within 72 hours of departing the country.Also Read | 14 million Americans are without jobless benefits as Trump refuses to budge on billGottlieb, a board member of Pfizer Inc., said that he believes the UK strain is already in the US, and in “a reasonable number at this point.”He saw signs that US new daily Covid-19 cases are starting to plateau, but since hospitalizations and the number of deaths tend to lag by two to three weeks, “we have a very difficult month ahead of us.”President Donald Trump has remained silent about the new variant and the worsening crisis gripping some parts of the US He took to Twitter on Saturday to criticize Democratic governors for taking emergency steps to contain the outbreak.“The lockdowns in Democrat run states are absolutely ruining the lives of so many people,” Trump tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-health-officials-warn-of-post-holiday-coronavirus-surge/story-ITUUi2jvttIFdn97B47ZsJ.html
27-12-2020||World||14 million Americans are without jobless benefits as Trump refuses to budge on bill||An estimated 14 million Americans lost jobless benefits on Sunday as outgoing President Donald Trump continued to resist signing an omnibus spending legislation that provides for $900 billion in Covid-19 relief and $1.4 trillion to keep the federal government funded beyond Tuesday.Trump is demanding $2,000 in direct payments in relief for those rendered jobless by the pandemic instead of the $600 in the bill that was proposed by his own negotiators and passed by both the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-led Senate. He is also seeking the federal spending bill to be stripped of certain expenses, including some proposed by his own administration.Congressional leaders have signalled they will try one more time on Monday to put together a package for the president to sign.“Increase payments to the people, get rid of the ‘pork’,” Trump tweeted on Sunday morning, shortly after the unemployment benefits lapsed. “Pork” comes from “pork barrel”, a term used to describe federal funding of local projects at the behest of members of congress.US Congress sent the president an omnibus legislation last week proposing $900 billion in Covid-19 relief that included direct payments of $600 each to those unemployed and assistance to small businesses, airlines and funds for vaccine distribution. The $2.3 trillion package also contained $1.4 trillion to fund the federal government.The outgoing president, who had been largely missing from the protracted negotiations that took place, suddenly announced that he won’t sign the bill as proposed unless the direct payments were hiked to $2,000 and certain expenses were not removed from the federal funding part of the legislation.Trump’s announcement took both Democrats and Republicans by surprise. Democrats had been seeking more in direct payments and had settled for less at the insistence of Republicans and the president’s own negotiators, led by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who had personally proposed the amount of $600, as the Washington Post reported.Democrats tried to pass a legislation with the increased amount sought by the president, but Republicans blocked it. Trump has felt frustrated with some Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who are unwilling to go along with his efforts to overturn the November 3 election which he lost to President-elect Joe Biden. The president wants Republican lawmakers to force Congress to reject the electoral college vote when it comes up for a final certification on January 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-million-americans-are-without-jobless-benefits-as-trump-refuses-to-budge-on-bill/story-knvmdcUNNDlW6MTBRhl2OM.html
27-12-2020||World||Maryam Nawaz says ‘incompetent’ Imran Khan was ‘imposed’ on Pakistan||Referring to Prime Minister Imran Khan, Pakistani Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz on Sunday said that certain forces which follow a “divide and rule” policy had “put together fallen fragments from political parties and formed the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf” and imposed on the country an “incompetent man”. Speaking in Larkana on the ocassion of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto’s 13th death anniversary, Maryam said that like the first women PM in a Muslim country she too wished to struggle for a united Pakistan.Beginning her speech in Sindhi, she said, “In 2008, when there was talk of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government being toppled, Nawaz Sharif quashed such thinking and said that the coming and going of governments is a decision for the people to make, not political parties.”The PML-N further said that “some forces” who follow the “divide and rule” policy had “put together fallen fragments from political parties and formed the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf” and, thus, an “incompetent man” was “imposed on us all”.“What does PDM need to say to that man? He himself is saying he knows nothing [...] he is saying people should not assume power without preparation. I say, no one should be brought into power without preparation,” said Maryam.Slamming Imran Khan, she said that while people are “killing themselves out of hunger and desperation due to inflation” he said, ‘What can I do, I have no magic button’.”She further said that “the corrupt” are pardoned, whereas political leaders are “thrown into jail, shot down and made to face the courts”, Geo News said.“But you can never send to the gallows or exile a political ideology [...] which is why, there is no one to take your name, but in every corner of Pakistan, there are people to take Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto’s names,” she said.Recalling Benazir Bhutto, the first female prime minister of the Muslim world, the PML-N vice president said that Bhutto “had to lay down her life” during her struggle and for her beliefs. “Benazir fought for her father’s struggle and vision and then ultimately joined him in the afterlife,” she said while adding “I too wish to struggle for a united Pakistan”.On the Charter of Democracy that was signed between Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, Maryam said, “This are not simply strands from history, these were events that were to alter Pakistan’s fate.”The PDM has been holding anti-government rallies against the Imran Khan government on the charges of election rigging, corruption and dominance of Pakistan Army in politics of the country.Maryam and Bilawal are among the major leaders that have said that they will send the Imran-led government packing and have organised six PDM rallies in Peshawar, Gujranwala, Karachi, Quetta, Multan and Lahore since October 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maryam-nawaz-says-incompetent-imran-khan-was-imposed-on-pakistan/story-JUM17jNRozxkGjNIeDLiXN.html

27-12-2020||World||Explained: What happens if the US government runs out of money on Monday?||US President Donald Trump’s threat not to sign a $2.3 trillion spending package approved by Congress has already shuttered an emergency unemployment aid program and threatens a partial federal government shutdown at midnight on Monday.The bill provides $892 billion in coronavirus relief and $1.4 trillion to keep regular government operations running through the fiscal year.Without Trump’s signature, Congress would need to pass a stopgap funding bill that he is willing to sign to keep federal agencies fully operating.The Trump administration has not said what it will do if the government runs out of money, but previous lapses have led to tens of thousands of non-essential workers being put on leave and others, including those dealing with public safety, forced to work without pay.Here’s what would likely happen if the White House and Congress cannot agree on a spending plan:Pandemic economic assistance: The legislation would provide $600 stimulus checks to millions of struggling Americans. Trump, in one of his chief criticisms of the bill, has said the payouts are too small and has demanded the checks be increased to $2000.Unemployment benefits being paid out to about 14 million Americans through pandemic programs lapsed on Saturday, but could be restarted if Trump signs the bill. The bill would keep the benefits going through mid-March.The spending package also extends a moratorium on evictions that expires on Dec. 31, refreshes support for small business payrolls, provides funding to help schools re-open and aid for the transport industry and vaccine distribution.All of the relief programs are at risk unless an agreement can be reached.Vaccine distribution: The federal government has already purchased 400 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, or enough for 200 million people, from Moderna and Pfizer but needs additional funds to purchase more doses. It also signed contracts with other companies for vaccines that have yet to be authorized. Private companies, including McKesson, UPS and FedEx, are distributing the doses but have been relying on staff in the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services for support.States have received $340 million from the US government to help offset costs they have borne from the vaccine rollout but say they face a shortfall of around $8 billion. A shutdown would halt plans by Congress to distribute funding to make up for that shortfall.Healthcare: Previous shutdowns have led to widespread furloughs for workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one of the agencies leading the response to the coronavirus pandemic. A CDC program to track flu outbreaks was halted during a 2013 shutdown; in 2018, the government kept the program running during another shutdown, saying “immediate response to urgent disease outbreaks” would continue.Military: The Defense Department continued operating through the last shutdown, which stretched 35 days through late 2018 and early 2019. During that period, the United States was unable to send paychecks to service members and civilian employees. Active-duty military personnel were considered essential workers; some civilian employees and contractors were furloughed.Law enforcement: The FBI and other law enforcement agencies continued working during previous shutdowns. The FBI Agents Association said after the last shutdown that funding lapses made it harder to pursue cases, in part because they were unable to pay informants. Federal courts largely remained open through the last shutdown because they had enough money available to sustain them through the shutdown.National parks and monuments: National parks and monuments largely remained open during the last shutdown, though some places, such as Philadelphia’s Independence Hall, closed. Other parks remained open with limited staffing, leading to complaints about overflowing trash, uncleaned bathrooms and illegal campsites as visitors fended for themselves.Financial oversight: Market regulators were forced to furlough staff during the last shutdown. The Securities and Exchange Commission kept sufficient staff in place to monitor markets and “respond to emergency situations.” It continued to accept corporate filings.Mail delivery: Deliveries continued as usual during previous shutdowns because the US Postal Service receives no tax dollars for day-to-day operations.Travel: The Transportation Security Administration workers who screen airline passengers continued working during the last shutdown. So did air traffic controllers, who the government considered to be essential employees.The 2018-2019 shutdown came to an end when absences by air traffic controllers raised the prospect of many flights into and out of New York being canceled, provoking a compromise between Trump and Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-happens-if-the-us-government-runs-out-of-money-on-monday/story-Sn3sdemcc0WaEJl5jGyk4I.html
27-12-2020||World||Cold chain doubts delay Covid-19 vaccinations in some German cities||Germany’s coronavirus vaccination campaign faced delays in several cities on Sunday after medical staff found potential irregularities in the cooling of the shot produced by BioNTech and Pfizer.The European Union launched a mass Covid-19 vaccination drive on Sunday with pensioners and medics lining up to get the first shots to see off a pandemic that has crippled economies and claimed more than 1.7 million lives worldwide.“When reading the temperature loggers that were enclosed in the cool boxes, doubts arose about the compliance with the cold chain requirements”, the District Office of Lichtenfels in the north of Germany’s largest state Bavaria said in a statement. The Pfizer vaccine, which uses new so-called mRNA technology, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about -70 degrees Celsius (-112°F) to remain effective before being shipped to distribution centres.Pfizer has designed special shipping containers filled with dry ice to keep the vaccine from spoiling while in transit. Shots can be kept in an ultra-low temperature freezer for up to six months, or for five days at 2C to 8C – a type of refrigeration commonly available at hospitals. Besides Lichtenfels, the northern Bavarian cities of Coburg, Kronach, Kulmbach, Hof, Bayreuth and Wunsiedel also held off from inoculating people after uncertainty arose about whether the cold chain had been maintained.“Vaccination against the coronavirus is not about who vaccinates the fastest or who does the most doses. Safety and conscientious work for the benefit of the population has the highest priority”, said Oliver Baer, district administrator of the district of Hof.Similar problems also delayed the vaccination campaign in the southern Bavarian city of Augsburg, daily Merkur reported.Germany’s vaccination campaign officially kicked off on Sunday with residents of elderly care homes being inoculated. The federal government is planning to distribute more than 1.3 million doses to local health authorities by the end of this year and about 700,000 per week from January.Vaccinations will be free and available to everyone from mid-2021 once the priority groups are expected to have finished being inoculated.“This makes us proud and above all confident that we can overcome this pandemic - because vaccinating paves our way out of the crisis,” Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cold-chain-doubts-delay-covid-19-vaccinations-in-some-german-cities/story-NCSTmTV2RwfI8mFotz4QnM.html

During an interview on CNN’s State of the Union show, Dr Fauci was asked whether he agrees with president-elect Joe Biden’s recent statement on the ongoing pandemic that the darkest days in the battle against Covid-19 is “ahead of us”.“I do,” replied Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. “We very well might see a post-seasonal - in the sense of Christmas, New Year’s - surge,” he added.The United States has, so far, recorded nearly 332,000 Covid-19 related deaths, and a report suggests that the country will witness a total of over 567,000 deaths by April 1, 2021. According to the predictions from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE), around 193,000 people could lose their lives over the next two months.Earlier this week, Dr Fauci was administered with Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine as a part of a confidence-building effort by health officials. The 80-year-old immunologist said that he feels fine after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, adding that he only felt an ache in his arm that lasted around 24 hours. “Then it went away and completely other than that, I felt no other deleterious type of effects,” he said.Also Read | US testing requirement for UK travellers may not be enough to contain Covid-19 variant. Here’s whyThe United States has rolled out two Covid-19 vaccines - one developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and the other by Moderna - for health care and frontline workers and for those at high risk. There have been concerns over the recent reports of severe allergic reactions after receiving the first dose of vaccine. However, public health experts have said that those cases as “rare” and “in line with the expectations.”Dr Ashish K Jha, Dean, Brown University School of Public Health, pointed out that over a million people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 and less than 10 people have had allergic reactions, highlighting that one in 2,000 courses of penicillin also leads to an allergic reaction. Taking to Twitter, Dr Jha said that though it is important to determine the cause of these reactions, he was pleasantly surprised how well the immunisation drive is going so far. To be clear, we absolutely should identify, publicly report these reactionsBut this is the most high profile roll out of a vaccine in recent historyAm pleasantly surprised how well its goingIts early -- but so far, these reactions are totally in line with expectations||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/post-seasonal-surge-dr-anthony-fauci-says-worst-of-covid-19-pandemic-still-to-come/story-lisTkEbPUiv9p78RAK2PxJ.html
27-12-2020||World||High-level Chinese delegation in Nepal trying to patch split between Oli and Prachanda||A high-level Chinese delegation led by a vice minister of the Chinese Communist Party arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday to “take stock” of Nepal’s political situation after the dissolution of Parliament and subsequent split in the ruling Nepal Communist Party. Although no specific details about the agenda of the visit are available, the four-member delegation, led by Vice Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Guo Yezhou, will hold high-level talks during its four-day stay in the country, according to highly placed sources. Guo is expected to meet President Bidya Devi Bhandari, Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Madhav Kumar Nepal, who has replaced Oli as chairman of the Prachanda-led faction of the party, sources said. The Chinese embassy here and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are tight-lipped about Guo’s visit. His visit is aimed at “taking stock of Nepal’s evolving political situation after the dissolution of the House of Representatives and subsequent split in the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) amid already-deepened intra-party rift”, My Republica newspaper reported. China is not happy with the split in the largest communist party of Nepal, according to sources. Guo, who personally knows all senior NCP leaders, will make efforts to patch up differences between the two warring factions of the ruling party - one led by Oli and the other led by Prachanda - during his four day stay in Nepal, according to the Kathmandu Post.Earlier, Gou travelled to Kathmandu in February 2018 when Oli-led CPN-UML and Prachanda-led NCP (Maoist Centre) - were all set to merge and form a unified communist party following victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections. Later in May, 2018, the two communist parties merged and formed a new party named Nepal Communist Party, the paper said. Gou will assess the situation inside the ruling party and will encourage both factions of the NCP to seek some kind of common ground for party unity, the Post said, quoting party leaders. He will communicate the message of Chinese leadership, including that of President Xi Jinping’s, to the NCP leadership, a ruling party leader said.“Besides this, the Chinese side has not communicated to us anything about the visit,” the leader told the Post on condition of anonymity.China has carefully chosen and sent Gou at a time when unity inside our party is shaken, a Standing Committee member said.Nepal plunged into a political crisis last Sunday after Prime Minister Oli, known for his pro-Beijing leanings, in a surprise move, recommended dissolving the 275-member House, amidst a tussle for power with Prachanda. Acting on the prime minister’s recommendation, President Bhandari dissolved the House the same day and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10, sparking protests from a large section of the NCP led by Prachanda, also a co-chair of the ruling party. Meanwhile, President Bhandari has called the winter session of the National Assembly, the upper house of Parliament, from January 1, The Kathmandu Post reported. Assistant Spokesperson to the President’s office Keshav Prasad Ghimire, in a statement on Sunday, said the President has called for the National Assembly session at 4 PM on January 1. Oli-led Cabinet on Friday recommended the President to convene the winter session of the National Assembly. Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yanqi, had communicated about the visit of Guo to Kathmandu during her meetings with senior NCP leaders of both the Prachanda- and Oli-led factions. Beijing appears concerned over the move of Oli to dissolve the House of Representatives and the evolving political situation that saw a vertical split in the NCP. This is not the first time that China has intervened in Nepal’s internal affairs. In May and July, Hou held separate meetings with the president, the prime minister and other senior NCP leaders, including Prachanda, when Oli was facing mounting pressure to step down. A number of political party leaders had termed the Chinese envoy’s series of meetings with the ruling party leaders as interference in Nepal’s internal political affairs. China’s political profile in Nepal has been on the rise in the recent years with billions of dollars of investments under its multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, including the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network. Besides the investments, China’s ambassador to Nepal Hou has made open efforts to garner support for Oli. The CPC and NCP were regularly engaged in training programmes. In September last year, the NCP had even organised a symposium, inviting some CPC leaders to Kathmandu to impart training to Nepali leaders on the Xi Jinping thought ahead of the visit of the Chinese president, his first to Nepal, according to a Kathmandu Post report. In a guarded reaction to the fast-paced political developments in Nepal, India on Thursday said it was an “internal matter” of the neighbouring nation and it was for the country to decide as per its democratic processes. “We have noted the recent political developments in Nepal. These are internal matters for Nepal to decide as per its democratic processes,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in New Delhi. “As a neighbour and well-wisher, India will continue to support Nepal and its people in moving forward on the path of peace, prosperity and development,” he said.

27-12-2020||World||Nashville explosion investigation prompts FBI to search home||Federal agents converged Saturday on the home of a possible person of interest in the explosion that rocked downtown Nashville as investigators scoured hundreds of tips and leads in the blast that damaged dozens of buildings on Christmas morning.More than 24 hours after the explosion, a motive remained elusive as investigators worked round-the-clock to resolve unanswered questions about a recreational vehicle that blew up on a mostly deserted street on a sleepy holiday morning and was prefaced by a recorded warning advising those nearby to evacuate. The attack, which damaged an AT&T building, continued to wreak havoc Saturday on cellphone service and police and hospital communications in several Southern states.Investigators from multiple federal and local law enforcement agencies were at a home in Antioch, in suburban Nashville, after receiving information relevant to the investigation, said FBI Special Agent Jason Pack. Another law enforcement official, who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said investigators regard a person associated with the property as a person of interest.Federal agents could be seen looking around the property, searching the home and the backyard. A Google Maps image had shown a similar recreational vehicle parked in the backyard when the photo was captured in May 2019; an AP reporter at the scene did not see the vehicle at the property in the late afternoon Saturday.There were other signs of progress in the investigation, as the FBI revealed that it was looking at a number of individuals who may be connected to it. Officials also said no additional explosive devices have been found — indicating no active threat to the area. Investigators have received around 500 tips and leads.“It’s just going to take us some time,” Douglas Korneski, the special agent in charge in charge of the FBI’s Memphis field office, said at a Saturday afternoon news conference. “Our investigative team is turning over every stone” to understand who did this and why.Beyond that, the only known casualties were three injured people. Investigators said they were working to identify human remains found at the scene.The infrastructure damage, meanwhile, was broadly felt, due to an AT&T central office being affected by the blast. Police emergency systems in Tennessee, Kentucky and Alabama, as well as Nashville’s COVID-19 community hotline and a handful of hospital systems, remained out of service.The building contained a telephone exchange, with network equipment in it — but the company has declined to say exactly how many people have been impacted.Asked whether the AT&T building could have been a possible target, Korneski said, “We’re looking at every possible motive that could be involved.”Investigators shut down the heart of downtown Nashville’s tourist scene — an area packed with honky-tonks, restaurants and shops — as they shuffled through broken glass and damaged buildings to learn more about the explosion.Mayor John Cooper has enforced a curfew in the downtown area until Sunday via executive order to limit public access to the area. More than 40 buildings were affected.AT&T said restoration efforts are facing several challenges, which include a fire that “reignited overnight and led to the evacuation of the building.” This has forced their teams to work with safety and structural engineers and drilling access holes into the building in order to reconnect power.“Our teams continue to work around the clock on recovery efforts from yesterday morning’s explosion in Nashville,” the company said in a Saturday statement. “We have two portable cell sites operating in downtown Nashville with numerous additional portable sites being deployed in the Nashville area and in the region.”Ray Neville, president of technology at T-Mobile, said on Twitter that service disruptions affected Louisville, Nashville, Knoxville, Birmingham and Atlanta. “We continue to see service interruptions in these areas following yesterday’s explosion. Restoration efforts continue around the clock & we will keep you updated on progress,” he said in a tweet Saturday.The outages had even briefly grounded flights at the Nashville International Airport, but service was continuing normally as of Saturday. The Federal Aviation Association has since issued a temporary flight restriction around the airport, requiring pilots to follow strict procedures until Dec. 30.According to Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake, police officers responded on Friday to a report of shots fired when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Police evacuated nearby buildings and called in the bomb squad. The RV exploded shortly afterward.___Associated Press photographer Mark Humphrey in Nashville and writer John Raby in Charleston, West Virginia, contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nashville-explosion-investigation-prompts-fbi-to-search-home/story-e7cHJrVRwCDSpejNBLkvgP.html

27-12-2020||World||AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has ‘winning formula’: chief executive Pascal Soriot||The Covid-19 vaccine developed by the British drugs group AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford has achieved a “winning formula” for efficacy, the company’s chief executive said on Sunday.The vaccine, currently being evaluated by Britain’s independent medicines regulator, provides “100 percent protection” against severe Covid disease requiring hospitalisation, Pascal Soriot said in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.He added he believes trials will show his firm has achieved a vaccine efficacy equal to Pfizer-BioNTech at 95 percent and Moderna at 94.5 percent.“We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody else,” the chief executive said, while saying only that data would be published at “some point”.The UK government announced on December 23 that the developers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had submitted their data to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).Approval is expected to be granted Monday to roll out the jab, The Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus shot to be authorised for use by the UK’s independent medicines regulator and has been given to 600,000 of the country’s most vulnerable people since last month. Earlier trials had shown varying outcomes in the AstraZeneca shot’s efficacy. The vaccine intially showed an average 70 percent effectiveness but that level jumped to 90 percent depending on dosage.- ‘Storm’ over data -Behind this average figure from large-scale trials in the UK and Brazil was a 62 percent effectiveness for those who were vaccinated with two full doses of the shot.For volunteers who received a half-dose first and then a full dose one month later, however, the vaccine was found to have 90 percent efficacy.Soriot said he was “surprised” by the initial findings. “We would have preferred a simpler set of results,” he added.The lack of clarity and transparency over the discrepancy in the results was widely criticised. Soriot said he had not expected the pushback that followed.“We assumed people would be a bit disappointed, that’s for sure,” he said. “But we didn’t expect that storm”.Great hopes have been placed in the AstraZeneca shot, originally based on a weakened version of a chimpanzee virus, because of its low cost.AstraZeneca’s vaccine also enjoys a logistical advantage over the Pfizer-BioNTech alternative, as it can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions of between two and eight degrees Celsius (36-46 Fahrenheit) for at least six months.That is a far cry from the -70C needed for Pfizer/BioNTech’s offering and could allow use of the existing refrigerated supply chain to cut costs.- ‘Light at the end of the tunnel’ -In a vote of confidence for its homegrown vaccine, the bulk of Britain’s requirements are expected to be met by the jab.The government has ordered 100 million doses, with 40 million doses scheduled to be available by the end of March.UK officials will hope that confidence is rewarded, not least because the country has been one of the countries most affected by the pandemic with more than 70,000 deaths.A surge in cases has hit nationwide over the past week, falling especially on the southeast of England and blamed on a new strain of the virus believed to be more infectious, which was first identified in the UK.According to one British study the strain is 50 percent to 74 percent more contagious.In an effort to contain the spread of the disease, millions across Britain were placed under tougher lockdown restrictions that came into force on 26 December.Dozens of countries have also imposed travel restrictions on the UK to stop the spread of the new strain.Writing in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, Finance Minister Rishi Sunak acknowledged it had been “a tough year for everyone in this country”. However, he added that “the early roll-out of vaccines - and the incredible work of our scientists and NHS - means we can now see light at the end of the tunnel”.Nearly 200 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine will be made before the end of the year, the UK drug manufacturer has said, and more than 700 million globally by the end of March next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-has-winning-formula-chief-executive-pascal-soriot/story-jtejjzFsI1XQXlu9YhSJjN.html
27-12-2020||World||UK vaccines could end Covid-19 lockdowns from February: Mail||Lockdowns in the UK could finish by the end of February once a group of up to 15 million vulnerable people have been vaccinated, the Mail on Sunday reported, citing government sources.The country’s health service would no longer be at risk of being overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases once that threshold is met, the newspaper said. The UK became the first country in Western Europe to begin vaccinations, when it started using the Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE shot on Dec. 8. More than 600,000 people have been vaccinated through Dec. 20.The country has been one of the hardest hit in Europe with more than 70,000 deaths, the most in the region after Italy. Much of the UK has been moved into the harshest Tier 4 restrictions, which prohibit household mixing and forced the closing of pubs, restaurants and many businesses after the discovery earlier this month of a more contagious strain of the virus.The vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc will be rolled out across the UK starting Jan. 4, the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing plans that ministers are drawing up. The government is hoping that 2 million people will get their first dose of one of the vaccines within two weeks of the roll-out of the AstraZeneca shot, the paper said.The Sun newspaper reported that regulators will approve the vaccine as early as Dec. 28. Responding to the report, a Health Department spokesperson said by email that the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency will need time to carry out a review of the vaccine data.The Telegraph also reported that mass vaccination centers at sports stadiums and conference venues are expected to launch in the second week of January. The Oxford vaccine is easier to store and handle than the one from Pfizer, making it easier to reach people in secluded parts of the country.The newspaper said that government officials are preparing to hold a crucial meeting on the pandemic Monday after scientists warned that school closures may be necessary to slow the spread of the new Covid-19 variant.The rate at which the virus is increasing, known as the R number, is estimated at 1.1 to 1.3 as of Dec.24, according to the latest government data. A reading above 1.0 indicates the spread of the virus is accelerating. The UK reported 34,693 more cases and 210 deaths on Dec. 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-vaccines-could-end-covid-19-lockdowns-from-february-mail/story-DVqjjHqOScvr0GMP5htgaL.html

All travellers must submit to a seven-day quarantine and take another test on the eighth day after their arrival.Countries across the Middle East shuttered borders on December 21 because the new strain is said to be faster-spreading. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman halted international flights and closed borders for a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oman-to-reopen-airport-borders-on-tuesday-after-mutation-scare/story-wFvcxdPHWi0RjD3TzdU1QN.html
27-12-2020||World||Thai hospital asked to stop advertising offer to sell Covid-19 vaccines||A private Thai hospital was ordered on Sunday to stop advertising Covid-19 vaccinations for sale in advance on the grounds that no vaccine is yet approved in Thailand.Vibhavadi Hospital told Reuters its online offer for 1,000 initial reservations for the two-dose Moderna vaccine had been the result of a misunderstanding. With reservations priced at 4,000 baht, the total cost of getting vaccinated would have been 10,000 baht ($330).As the first governments begin vaccine rollouts around the world, questions have been raised over how the limited supplies are prioritised and whether people will be able to pay to jump the queue.The Ministry of Health said in a statement that no Covid-19 vaccine had been approved for use in Thailand yet and that advertising one violated hospital regulations.“The removal of the advertisement was ordered,” it said.Chaisit Kupwiwat, a director at Vibhavadi Hospital, told Reuters: “There was a misunderstanding and so we’ve stopped the programme... We planned to order the vaccines, but now we’ve stopped.”The hospital had sought reservations by January 31 for vaccinations later in 2021.Moderna did not respond immediately to an emailed request for comment on any such sale.Thailand has signed an advance deal for AstraZeneca’s potential Covid-19 vaccine, but has not set rollout plans for any vaccine yet.Moderna’s vaccine this month became the second to get emergency use authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration after the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.Moderna has said it will deliver approximately 20 million doses to the US government this year and is expected to have between 100 million and 125 million delivered globally in the first quarter of 2021.In August, Moderna said it was pricing its vaccine at $32 to $37 per dose for smaller deals.Thailand is a major hub for medical tourism, drawing patients from Asia, the Middle East and beyond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-hospital-asked-to-stop-advertising-offer-to-sell-covid-19-vaccines/story-2E16oKgDzsCiIi9xzGL0ZI.html
27-12-2020||World||Singapore expert committee backs use of Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine||A group of top Singapore health experts backed the government’s move to approve the Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s coronavirus vaccine after it conducted an independent review of clinical data on its safety and efficacy.The vaccine demonstrated a high efficacy rate of 95% and its safety profile is consistent with the high standards set for other registered vaccines used in immunization against other diseases, the committee of experts said in a statement issued by the health ministry on Sunday. It is suitable for use for those aged 16 and above, and is expecting further trial data on other groups, such as pregnant women, the committee said.Singapore should prioritize healthcare workers, the elderly and individuals with chronic health illness given the limited supply, the experts said. The committee, made up of individuals from the city-state’s public universities, government ministries and research centres, was formed in October to give recommendations on Singapore’s vaccination strategy.Those aged 70 and above should be first in line as they are more vulnerable to severe health complications when infected, followed by individuals over 60 years old, according to the statement.The committee also recommended that about 5% of available vaccine stocks at any given point in time be set aside for specific groups of people who work in essential services, such as water and utilities, to ensure that the country can function effectively in case of an outbreak.Recommendations made by the committee marks another step for Singapore’s vaccination strategy. The first batch of Pfizer and BioNTech shots arrived last week. The Southeast Asian nation has set aside more than S$1 billion ($750 million) for vaccines and said there should be enough for its population of about 5.5 million people by the third quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-expert-committee-backs-use-of-pfizer-biontech-coronavirus-vaccine/story-iyrFZ1rVgW0W5jZmBFO7KO.html
27-12-2020||World||EU nations clear Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, begin inoculation||European Union countries began vaccinating against Covid-19 as members of the 27-nation bloc struggle with a rising number of people killed by the virus.The coordinated rollout launched on Sunday is getting underway less than a week after the EU cleared a shot developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Several European countries, including Germany, have imposed tougher restrictions in an effort to contain a winter surge in infections and deaths.It will take months to inoculate enough people to have an impact on the spread of the disease, but the sense of urgency has grown after neighboring Britain locked down parts of the country, blaming a faster-spreading strain.“Once enough people have been vaccinated, we can start traveling, meeting our friends and family again and have normal holidays, which we all long for,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Saturday in a video message.The head of the EU’s executive arm was marking what she called “Delivery Day,” when doses of the vaccine were distributed around the continent. She emphasized that immunization will be a gradual process and caution is still needed.“We have to continue being careful,” she said. “We have to protect ourselves and our loved ones.”Europe is starting the campaign to inoculate its 450 million citizens weeks after the UK and US began their own vaccination programs. More than 600,000 people in Britain and nearly 2 million in the US have received their first shot of the standard two-dose regimen, according to data collected by Bloomberg.Despite the agreed EU rollout date, some nations, including Germany and Hungary, already began administering vaccines on Saturday, local media reported.In the eastern German city of Halberstadt, a 101-year-old woman and around 40 others in a care home for the elderly were inoculated, according to DPA. “Every day we wait is a day too many,” the news agency quoted the head of the home, Tobias Krueger, as saying.Italy and Portugal began their vaccination campaigns Sunday by inoculating health-care workers, while in Denmark and Sweden, residents at elderly care centers received the first shots. Greece’s President Aikaterini Sakellaropoulou and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis are scheduled to be vaccinated later in the day, after the country gave the first vaccine to an intensive-care unit nurse.The start of the EU’s vaccination campaign comes amid an effort to contain the mutant virus strain that the UK government said is spreading more easily.While that’s spurred concern that testing, treatments and shots might not be as effective, officials at BioNTech and the European medicines regulator said they’re optimistic the vaccine will work against the new strain. The variant has appeared in countries including Germany, Japan, Australia, Singapore and Italy.The EU has ordered 200 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot on behalf of member states, with an option to obtain 100 million more, and the goal is to provide access to all countries at the same time on the basis of population size. Supplies will be limited in the early days, although another vaccine may soon help bolster availability.The rollout will unfold gradually. The EU may have enough vaccine for two-thirds of its population in the middle of September, three months behind the US, according to London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-nations-clear-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-begin-inoculation/story-yDb58U1LFh2JsHu8ckWlzO.html
27-12-2020||World||Syrian refugee camp burnt to ground in northern Lebanon||More than 300 Syrian refugees were forced to flee an informal camp in northern Lebanon as a blaze raged through and burnt tents to the ground, UN and Lebanese officials said Sunday.The fire late Saturday raged for four hours as firefighters tried to put it out, the Lebanese civil defense said.The fire ensued following a fight between a Lebanese family in al-Miniyeh in the country’s north and Syrians living in the camp, according to Lebanese media reports.A Lebanese official said the army is investigating the cause of the fire and conducting raids to round up those responsible for the altercation. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because an official statement has not yet been released.Khaled Kabbara, a UN Refugee Agency spokesman in northern Lebanon, said some 375 people lived in the informal settlement that was located on a plot of rented land. He said the entire camp was burnt to the ground.Kabbara said four people were injured in the fire and hospitalized with minor injuries. He said some residents of the camp returned Sunday to see if anything could be salvaged from the fire.Most of the refugees have sought refuge in other nearby informal settlements. Some from the local community have also offered shelter, Kabbara said.Kabbara said altercations between residents and Syrian refugees often “catastrophically impact the community as a whole.”Tensions are common in Lebanon between citizens and Syrian refugees who have fled the war in their country. Lebanon is host to more than 1 million refugees, nearly a quarter of the country’s population of 5 million, burdening the country’s already crumbling infrastructure.Tensions between Lebanese and Syrians also dates back to the days when Syria dominated its smaller neighbor for almost three decades with thousands of troops stationed in Lebanon. They withdrew in 2005 following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which sparked massive anti-Syrian protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-refugee-camp-burnt-to-ground-in-northern-lebanon/story-aNcss6ZlMRw8MPLbYtqMHL.html
27-12-2020||World||Israel enters third nationwide lockdown||Israel was set Sunday to begin its third coronavirus lockdown, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced optimism that a “world record” vaccination drive will restore a degree of normality within weeks.After a sharp rebound in detected infections, Netanyahu’s government announced three days ago that it would re-impose the strict measures that had previously helped limit transmission. From 5:00pm (1500 GMT) on Sunday, most people will be forced to stay within 1,000 metres of their home. There are a range of exceptions, including seeking medical care, attending legal proceedings or exercising. A key difference in Israel’s third lockdown compared to previous versions relates to schools, with more students able to attend classes. Instead of near total closures, Israel is keeping schools open for children under six, as well as grades one to four and teenagers finishing secondary school in grades 11 and 12.Israel’s National Council for the Child criticised the decision to close grades five through 10. “The decision to ignore this age bracket means the abandonment of hundreds of thousands of children, only because in theory they can be left at home alone while (their parents) go to work,” NCC head Vered Windman was quoted as saying by the Ma’ariv newspaper. “But this is precisely the age group that is at a higher risk of developing emotional difficulties, fears and isolation.” ‘World record’Speaking late Saturday following Shabbat, Netanyahu said Israel was hoping to vaccinate a quarter of its population, or roughly 2.25 million people, against coronavirus within a month.He said he had spoken with the heads of the companies making vaccines who had voiced confidence that the requisite number of doses could be provided. Israel’s vaccination targets are of “such a magnitude (they amount to) a world record” pace, the prime minister said. Netanyahu was the first Israeli to receive a Covid-19 jab on December 19, ahead of the launch last week of a nationwide innoculation programme.The premier has political incentives to push an accelerated vaccination campaign. The fraught coalition government that he formed in May with his former election rival and current defence minister, Benny Gantz, collapsed last week, triggering elections in March -- Israel’s fourth vote in two years. Netanyahu’s election campaign could be hindered by the start of a more intensified phase of his long-awaited corruption trial and the departure of his staunch ally US President Donald Trump from the White House.Political analysts have said that Netanyahu is hoping a rapid vaccination drive will put Israel’s pandemic-wracked economy on a path to recovery before election day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-enters-third-nationwide-lockdown/story-4Q2Y6E73R3bSKFx2iUsx1H.html
27-12-2020||World||Brexit deal hands business a mix of relief, unwanted change||The UK and European Union may have signed a trade deal, but British businesses still face a raft of difficult changes.More than four years in the making, the Brexit agreement avoids the worst-case scenario of new tariffs and quotas after Dec. 31. That’s a welcome relief, and gives companies greater scope to focus on containing the damage from the coronavirus pandemic.The divorce will still create significant disruption for a range of industries. Mutual recognition of standards, which would have allowed firms to make products in the UK and market them in the EU without any extra certification process, isn’t part of the deal. Likewise, workers in Britain’s services industry -- which makes up 80% of its economy -- face new costs and bureaucracy as their professional qualifications will no longer be automatically recognized in the EU.The deal also requires extra customs paperwork and checks at the EU border. The queues of trucks that formed around Dover, Britain’s busiest port, after France blocked incoming traffic has given Britons a taste of the disorder that could be in store.With the full text of the agreement being published only days before it comes into force, a chorus of business voices has pleaded for a grace period to comply with the changes.Here is a look at what a Brexit deal means for a variety of industries.AutomotiveUK auto manufacturers generated about 79 billion pounds ($107 billion) in sales last year and employed about 180,000 people. Carmakers now must decide whether to move forward with investment in new models and production capacity that had been put on hold for years.Vauxhall, owned by France’s PSA Group, had been holding out for more clarity on Brexit before deciding whether to approve further investment in its plant in Ellesmere Port. For others, the delays to the deal have already taken a toll -- Nissan Motor Co. has decided against producing an electric model in northern England.The deal is good news because it mostly avoids tariffs and gives electric-car makers sufficient time to phase in the new requirements, raising the chance that PSA will further invest in Vauxhall, said David Bailey, a business economics professor at Birmingham Business School.Here are the key requirements for rules of origin, which determine what percentage of the value of a car’s components need to be sourced locally to qualify for tariff-free trade:The terms for electric and hybrid cars are more lenient because the region is still in the early stages of localizing battery production. However, the 40% local content requirement for EVs and hybrids may be difficult to meet for companies that source parts mainly in Asia, Bailey said.ManufacturingProducers are responsible for about 10% of UK gross domestic product, and have been spared the threat of new tariffs. But they face a raft of paperwork and new standards regulations which could create substantial pressure across the country on its first day outside the single market and customs union.On standards, there is no mutual recognition of conformity assessments in the deal, meaning manufacturers will have to get their products approved separately by regulators in both markets. They may also have to run two separate production processes if UK and EU specifications differ, adding costs.And at the border, the prospect of trucks turning up without the correct post-Brexit forms raises worries about serious traffic snarls. For example, as many as 10,000 trucks per day carrying everything from German car parts to Spanish lettuces, as well as UK exports to Europe, pass through Dover. This key port on the south-east coast has warned of 17-mile (27-kilometer) lines of vehicles on both sides of the English Channel if its average customs clearing is slowed by just two minutes.Disruption is a nightmare for manufacturers because their years of investment into digitizing their operations have left them reliant on just-in-time supply chains. This helps them avoid the expense of stockpiles, but means that any delays in shipments spell trouble for the entire production process and the whole industry.RetailThe thorny issue of tariffs had been British retailers’ biggest concern as higher import costs in a low-margin sector would have had to be passed on to consumers during a recession. This was particularly important for supermarket chains such as Tesco Plc and J Sainsbury Plc as the UK produces only about half the food it consumes, and the vast majority of imported food comes from the EU.British wine merchants will be relieved that wine traveling between the UK and EU will require only simplified paperwork. In a no-deal scenario wines from the EU would have required expensive laboratory tests and other documentation, adding costs.However, retailers still face a raft of new non-tariff barriers stemming from costs and staffing needed to manage extra customs paperwork which, in time, could filter down to the prices paid by shoppers at checkouts. Any upheaval could aggravate the impact the pandemic has had on consumer spending. The timing may mean additional pain -- January is normally a dire month for retailers given that consumers usually pull back spending after their surge of shopping for Christmas.DrugsThe pharmaceutical industry has long called for a mutual recognition agreement to protect the sector from unnecessary duplication and cost. The deal has achieved this at least in part, with inspections of drug manufacturing facilities to be valid in both regions.However, the text doesn’t mention another industry request -- mutual recognition of batch testing. This suggests UK safety tests on medicines may need to be conducted again before they can be sold in the EU, which would add time and cost burdens.The pharmaceutical sector, like others, will also have to get to grips with customs and border checks. Coronavirus has given the issue extra weight and highlighted the need for the smooth passage of drugs and vaccines –- about 45 million packs of medicines move from the UK to the EU every month, with 37 million going the other way.The UK and EU have agreed to a one-year phase-in period for implementing regulation in Northern Ireland to give companies time to prepare to adjust packaging and distribution routes.AerospaceThis heavily regulated industry contributes 20 billion pounds a year to the UK economy, and has long dealt with standards where the slightest change in a design or machine used to make an aircraft component can spark a safety reassessment. The Brexit agreement includes an accord on safety that maps out an approach based on mutual recognition and cooperation. This is essential as some parts criss-cross the English Channel multiple times during the process of building a plane. Companies like Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc know that any major break with the status quo risks substantial disruption.After year-end, the UK will oversee its own aircraft safety regime. That means handing the responsibility to the Civil Aviation Authority for the first time in decades. There’s a question of whether it will be able to take on so much work quickly enough to avoid disruption.AirlinesBoth sides agreed to explore a liberalization of rules that limit the operations of airlines outside of the territory where their ownership is based. Before the split, UK shareholders counted toward EU ownership requirements, but now they don’t. This threatens the rights of airlines like IAG SA and EasyJet Plc to operate within the bloc.IAG, the owner of British Airways, Iberia and Vueling, is incorporated in Spain but has significant UK, US and Qatari ownership. EasyJet has had difficulty keeping its EU share of ownership above the required 50% threshold. Both have said they’ll address their shareholder structure, but under the current set-up their status as EU-controlled could be tested. Future changes to the rules could help insulate them from challenges. The UK and EU have agreed to consider making changes to the rules within 12 months.TruckingHauliers face new restrictions when moving goods between the UK and the EU. Previously, UK drivers could do unlimited trips between EU countries, and as many as three deliveries within a single country in the bloc. An extra delivery within a country is known as a “cabotage” trip.Now, British operators can only do two extra journeys when they move goods to the EU, and can only make one cabotage trip.The restrictions are a major blow to the UK concert industry, which has relied on being able to move instruments and sound equipment on multiple trips between European countries without having to return to Britain.ChemicalsThis is the UK’s biggest manufacturing export sector, with annual turnover of about 31.5 billion pounds. While the deal document contains signals that cooperation will continue, Britain’s access to a full spectrum of chemicals may still be at risk.Chemical makers have yet to be told how aligned the UK’s new standalone regulatory framework will be with Europe’s Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals regime, considered the gold standard for the safety and control of more than 22,000 substances and fluids that are key in industries from aerospace to electronics. Based on a “one substance, one registration” principle, it’s taken companies years of investment to put together all the dossiers containing data on the properties and hazards of each chemical required by REACH.The Brexit agreement includes a commitment to cooperate on sharing this data. However, the lack of a firm arrangement means companies may yet face having to repeat the time- and money-consuming process of repeating all that paperwork to operate in both markets.If ensuing talks fail to achieve regulatory alignment, the industry could face a 1 billion-pound bill to repeat all the safety documentation, according to Neil Hollis, BASF SE’s regulatory affairs manager.ServicesServices make up 80% of the UK economy and comprise a breadth of activities including IT, law, accountancy, insurance, consulting and architecture.The EU is Britain’s largest export market for services, so the lack of automatic recognition for professional qualifications is a setback. It means firms will have to jump through extra bureaucratic hoops to have the right to provide services in an EU member state.Short-term business travel between the UK and EU will continue unimpeded, but UK business visitors will only be able to travel to the EU for 90 days in any 180-day period.DataMovement of data generates 174 billion pounds of value in the UK, according to the Confederation of British Industry, but the legal framework for this activity was in doubt because Britain is about to exit the EU’s data protection regime. The Brexit deal provides an interim solution that protects current data flows until a separate legal agreement is reached.The temporary accord saves thousands of businesses from having to find alternative certifications before Jan. 1 to continue transfers, and postpones the risk of fines for violating the bloc’s strict privacy laws. This is a relief for any business which transfers data across the frontier from big tech platforms to airlines to banks.EU officials said a so-called data adequacy decision, which would certify that UK data protection standards are comparable to the bloc’s, could be made in early 2021. Until then, the bridge offered by the Brexit deal leaves the existing rules place for as many as six months after Dec. 31.AgricultureBritish farmers welcomed the deal on tariffs, which will help products from barley to lamb remain competitive in the EU, the destination for more than 60% of the nation’s agricultural exports.Still, even with the deal, there will be trade friction and the National Farmers Union called on the government to ensure cargoes of perishable foods aren’t left “languishing in queues at the border” in the new year. The British Meat Processors Association has also lamented that fresh-meat shipments won’t be prioritized in queues at the border, which may require traders to switch to trading lower-value frozen supply instead.FishingA totemic sector for the campaign to leave the EU, despite its tiny contribution to UK GDP, the fishing industry is not happy with the agreement struck with the bloc and accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of selling out coastal communities to get a deal.Under the agreement, 25% of EU rights to catch fish in UK waters will be transferred to British boats over 5 1/2 years, much less than London’s demand for an 80% cut. After the phasing-in period, there will be annual negotiations over allocations, with each side able to use tariffs in retaliation if they disagree. The UK says they should be proportionate and limited to fish.“Throughout the fishing industry there is a profound sense of disillusionment, betrayal, and fury that after all the rhetoric, promises and assurances, the Government caved-in on fish,” the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations said in a statement. “Some of the bellwether stocks tell the story most vividly, After a further five years adjustment period, the UK’s share of Channel cod will have increased from 9.3% to 10.2%.”David Henig, UK director of the European Centre for the International Political Economy think tank, said the industry had lost out in the trade-off in the final days of the talks.“In the end for the UK it seems the fear of losing car manufacturing, coupled with fear of border chaos, were a higher priority than fish or the level playing field,” he wrote in a blog post on Sunday. “This meant that the UK settled on other issues such as fish without any reward,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-deal-hands-business-a-mix-of-relief-unwanted-change/story-a73kLkXn0lsxyzWUszfAsL.html
27-12-2020||World||Merkel supplanted by Spahn as Germany’s most popular politician||German Health Minister Jens Spahn has taken over from Chancellor Angela Merkel as the nation’s most popular politician, a poll showed Sunday, highlighting his potential as a future leader of Europe’s biggest economy.Spahn, 40, has long been considered a rising star in Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, and is widely perceived to have made a key contribution to Germany’s relatively successful handling of the coronavirus pandemic.According to the Kantar poll in Bild newspaper, 52% of those surveyed said Spahn should play a major role in German politics in 2021, up from 28% at the end of 2019. Merkel’s approval rating was 51%, up 11 percentage points from the previous year.“Spahn is clearly the winner of the year,” Bild quoted Kantar’s Torsten Schneider-Haase as saying. “From the point of view of the people, he is cutting a positive figure on coronavirus policy.”Merkel is stepping down following the next election due in September 2021 after more than a decade and a half in power. The CDU will elect a new leader and probable chancellor candidate at a virtual congress next month.Spahn has backed Armin Laschet, the premier of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, while Friedrich Merz, a long-time Merkel rival, and Norbert Roettgen, a former environment minister, are also running.The winner will likely be the conservative bloc’s candidate to succeed Merkel next year, though Bavaria Premier Markus Soeder, head of the CDU’s sister party in the southern state, may be asked to step in.Soeder is the third-most popular politician on 50%, the Kantar poll showed. Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the Social Democrats’ chancellor candidate, was fourth on 47%, Merz scored 37% in sixth place, Laschet 31% in eighth and Roettgen 29% in ninth.While Spahn has thrown his support behind Laschet, there is an outside chance he could be tapped to run as the conservative candidate for chancellor if he is seen as having the best chance of winning the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-supplanted-by-spahn-as-germany-s-most-popular-politician/story-MGoGWo1M0cogUlnvHZRTWJ.html
27-12-2020||World||Daniel Pearl murder: Sindh govt halts release of Omar Saeed Sheikh, 3 others||Pakistan’s Sindh province government has decided not to release British-born al-Qaeda leader Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and his three aides, accused of kidnapping and murdering US journalist Daniel Pearl, in view of a Supreme Court order, according to a media report.In a surprise move, a two-judge bench of the Sindh High Court on Thursday directed security agencies not to keep Sheikh and other accused under “any sort of detention” and declared all notifications of the Sindh government related to their detention “null and void”. The court observed that the four men’s detention was “illegal”.The court, however, had clarified that the accused should not be released if there is a Supreme Court restraining order regarding their detention.Citing its sources, the Express Tribune newspaper said that the provincial government will not release these men in view of the Supreme Court’s September 28 order.The Pakistan People’s Party-led Sindh government believes that the apex court’s September 28 order in the case is still in the field, the sources told the daily.A three-judge apex court bench headed by Justice Mushir Alam, which is hearing the appeal by the Sindh government and the family of the slain journalist against the acquittal of Sheikh by the Sindh High Court in April, on September 28 noted that till the next date of hearing, the accused shall not be released.A senior government official said the apex court order has not been specifically recalled.“The SHC in its December 24 order also clarified that accused should not be released if there is a Supreme Court restraining order regarding their detention,” he added.The sources said the Sindh government will also challenge the SHC’s December 24 order in the apex court on Monday.In April, a two-judge Sindh High Court bench commuted the death sentence of 46-year-old Sheikh to seven years imprisonment. The court also acquitted his three aides who were serving life terms in the case – almost two decades after they were found guilty and jailed.However, the Sindh government refused to release them and kept them in detention under the Maintenance of Public Order.Their continuous detention was challenged in the Sindh High Court, which ordered their release on Thursday.On Friday, the United States expressed “deep concern” over the order to release Sheikh and his aides and said it will continue to monitor any developments in the case.“We are deeply concerned by the reports of the December 24 ruling of Sindh High Court to release multiple terrorists responsible for the murder of Daniel Pearl. We have been assured that the accused have not been released at this time,” the US State Department said in a tweet.It said that the US will continue to monitor any developments in the case and will continue to support the Pearl family “through this extremely difficult process” while honouring the legacy of Pearl as a “courageous journalist”.The US has been mounting pressure on Pakistan, demanding justice for Pearl.Ruth and Judea Pearl - the parents of Pearl - condemned the decision made by the Sindh High court and expressed full confidence in the Supreme Court of Pakistan to provide justice for their son and reinforce the paramount of the freedom of the press, the Express Tribune reported.“We refuse to believe that the Pakistani government and the Pakistani people will let such a travesty of justice tarnish the image and legacy of Pakistan,” they said in a statement.Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was abducted and beheaded while he was in Pakistan investigating a story in 2002 on the links between the country’s powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda.Pearl’s murder took place three years after Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.He was serving a prison term in India for kidnappings of Western tourists in the country.

As of 2017, he resides in London.The ATC-VII judge also issued perpetual warrants of arrest for the proclaimed offenders and ordered the police to write a letter to the interior ministry to seek international police organisation Interpol’s assistance to arrest them.The judge also ordered the confiscation of all the moveable and immoveable properties belonging to the absconders and directed the investigation officer to issue their sketches to seek public help in tracing their whereabouts.On November 23 2018, an explosion and gunshot were heard near the Chinese consulate in Karachi’s Clifton area in the morning, around 9:25 am.Three men possessing hand grenades and other weapons fired near the Chinese consulate in Clifton Block 4, according to eyewitnesses.Two policemen were killed and a security guard got injured after three gunmen tried to enter the consulate around 9:30 am.Nine hand grenades, Kalashnikov bullets, magazines, and explosives were recovered from the possession of the terrorists, Karachi police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2018-chinese-consulate-attack-pak-court-asks-cops-to-approach-interpol-to-track-baloch-leader/story-idULBZcnXualdgdfNMc9MO.html
27-12-2020||World||Covid-19: December deadliest month in US, January projections more worrisome||While the United States rolled out two vaccines in December to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the month has been the deadliest for the country since the pandemic started. Over 63,000 people living in the United States have lost their lives to the infection in the past 26 days, an extreme surge in Covid-19 related deaths when compared to November, a month that recorded another grim tally of around 37,000 deaths. The projections for the next two months are even more worrisome as another possible surge stemming from Christmas and New Year gatherings could worsen the situation. According to the predictions from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE), the daily death toll could peak around mid-January and another 193,000 people could lose their lives over the next two months.The IMHE suggests that daily deaths are the best indicator of the progression of the pandemic, although there is generally a 17-21 day lag between infection and deaths. The United States has, so far, reported nearly 332,000 Covid-19 related deaths, highest in the world, and based on the current projection scenario, the country will witness a total of over 567,000 deaths by April 1, 2021. Also Read | India’s role vital in equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines globally: Pharma industryDr Leana Wen, an emergency physician, told CNN that the individuals travelling during the holidays will be most probably visiting their family and friends and having dinner without wearing masks. “I just really worry about this surge that we’re going to see and how quickly we’re going to surpass that 400,000 deaths number,” Wen was quoted as saying the US media network.However, the immunisation drive using Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has emerged as a sigh of relief for the health authorities and Americans in general. Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced new testing requirements for inbound travellers from the United Kingdom amid concerns over new variants of SARS-CoV-2 causing rapid spread of Covid-19. The US health agency said that the air passengers arriving from the UK would require to show a negative Covid-19 test result obtained within 72 hours before the departure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-december-deadliest-month-in-us-january-projections-more-worrisome/story-itc7xDDT3U8an91sKkwfqK.html
27-12-2020||World||Wars, instability pose vaccine challenges in poor nations||Arifullah Khan had just administered another polio vaccine when the gunfire blasted from the nearby hills.“It happened so suddenly. There was so much gunfire it felt like an explosion,” he said, recalling details of the attack five years ago in Pakistan’s Bajaur tribal region near the Afghan border.A bullet shattered his thigh and he fell to the ground. His childhood friend and partner in the vaccination campaign, Ruhollah, lay bleeding on the ground in front of him.“I couldn’t move,” Khan said. “I watched him lying right in front of me as he took his last breath.”In Pakistan, delivering vaccines can be deadly. Militants and radical religious groups spread claims that the polio vaccine is a Western ploy to sterilize Muslim children or turn them away from religion. More than 100 health workers, vaccinators and security officials involved in polio vaccination have been killed since 2012.The violence is an extreme example of the difficulties many poor and developing countries across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America face as they tackle the monumental task of vaccinating their populations against Covid-19.It’s not just the problem of affording vaccines or being at the back of the line behind wealthy countries in receiving them.Poor infrastructure often means roads are treacherous and electricity is sporadic for the refrigerators vital to preserving vaccines. Wars and insurgencies endanger vaccinators. Corruption can siphon away funds, and vaccination campaign planners must sometimes navigate through multiple armed factions.“The most challenging areas ... are conflict settings, where outbreaks of violence hinder vaccinations, and areas where misinformation is circulating, which discourages community participation, said UNICEF’s deputy chief of global immunization, Benjamin Schreiber.Many nations are relying on COVAX, an international system aimed at ensuring equitable access to vaccines, though it is already short on funding.UNICEF, which runs immunization programs worldwide, is gearing up to help procure and administer Covid-19 vaccines, Schreiber told The Associated Press. It has stockpiled half a billion syringes and aims to provide 70,000 refrigerators, mostly solar powered, he said.The agency aims to transport 850 tons of Covid-19 vaccines a month next year, double its usual annual monthly rate for other vaccines, UNICEF’s executive director Henrietta Fore said in a statement.The situation can vary widely from country to country.Mexico is expected to start immunizations soon. The military will handle distribution, and the government has promised free vaccines for Mexico’s nearly 130 million inhabitants by the end of 2021.Meanwhile, Haiti, the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country, has yet to announce any vaccination plans. Health experts worry that widespread rumors could set back vaccinations — including claims that hospitals will give fatal injections to inflate Covid-19 death figures and receive more foreign aid.The African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is leading a continent-wide effort to vaccinate Africa’s 1.3 billion people in 54 countries. The agency is coordinating efforts to obtain doses and seeking World Bank help in funding — estimating it will take $10 billion to acquire, distribute and administer the vaccines.The aim is to vaccinate 60% of Africa’s population within two years — some 700 million people — more than the continent has done in the past, said John Nkengasong, director of the African CDC.“The time for action is now,” said Nkengasong. “The West cannot defeat Covid-19 alone. It must be defeated by all over the world, and that includes Africa.”Congo underscores the obstacles the campaign faces.The country has overcome Ebola outbreaks with vaccination campaigns. But it struggled in eastern Congo, where Allied Democratic Forces rebels stage frequent attacks and other armed groups vie for control of mineral riches.Rough terrain and insecurity meant vaccinators had trouble getting to all areas. Some came under attack.Rumors flew about the Ebola vaccines, including the idea they were meant to kill people, said Dr. Maurice Kakule, an Ebola survivor who worked in vaccination campaigns. Education programs overcame much of the resistance, but similar suspicions are spreading about the Covid-19 vaccine, he said.In Beni, the area’s main city, Danny Momoti, a trader, said he would take the vaccine because of his work. “I need this Covid-19 vaccination card to be accepted in Dubai and elsewhere where I go to buy the goods for Beni,” he said.Civil wars present perhaps the greatest obstacles.In Yemen, the health system has collapsed under six years of war between Houthi rebels who control the north and government-allied factions in the south.Yemen saw its first outbreak of polio in 15 years this summer, centered in the northern province of Saada. Vaccinators haven’t been able to work there the past two years, in part because of security fears, UNICEF said. Agencies rushed to give new inoculations in parts of the north and south in November and December.Cholera and diphtheria have been rampant, and once again, Yemen faces a new surge in hunger. UN officials have warned of potential famine in 2021.No plans for Covid-19 vaccinations have been announced yet, whether by the Houthis, southern authorities or WHO and UNICEF.Only half of Yemen’s health facilities remain functional. Roads, power networks and other infrastructure have been devastated. The Houthis have hampered some programs, trying to wrest concessions from UN agencies, including blocking a shipment of cholera vaccines amid a 2017 outbreak.“Even the mildest and normally preventable diseases can prove fatal due to a lack of health care access in a conflict setting,” said Wasim Bahja, the Yemen country director for International Medical Corps.In Pakistan, public distrust was fueled when the CIA in 2011 used a scam vaccination program to identify the hideout of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, leading to the special forces raid that killed him.Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria are the only countries in the world where polio is still endemic. There have been 82 new polio cases this year alone, largely because vaccinations were suspended due to the pandemic, said Dr. Rana Safdar, who coordinates the polio vaccination campaigns.The Bajaur region, where Khan was shot, remains one of the more dangerous areas, Safdar said.Khan tried to explain the deep mistrust in his region. Deeply conservative tribal elders “believe the vaccine is the reason the young people who were given it as children are disrespectful and show little concern for Islamic traditions and values.”“Everyone is scared” of Covid-19, he said. “But they are suspicious of Western things.”Khan said he signed up to administer polio vaccines because he was paid the equivalent of $56 for just a few days’ work. “I needed to feed my family.”He will likely sign up to deliver Covid-19 vaccines as well.“But first I would check if there is any danger there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wars-instability-pose-vaccine-challenges-in-poor-nations/story-ctWdCXVMSZo3sl3sZQiWTJ.html

It has reported 70,909 deaths, the highest toll in Europe and the fifth highest in the world.The vaccine will be free of charge and health workers and elderly people will be the first to be offered the voluntary inoculation.Hungary and Slovakia began their vaccination campaigns on Saturday with other European Union countries joining Italy in rolling out the shots from Sunday, as the pandemic surges across the continent.Around 9,750 doses have already arrived in Italy and another 470,000 are expected to arrive from next week, the health ministry said.“Today is a symbolic day which must give the idea of the beauty of Europe that has bought the vaccines for everybody and distributed them,” Commissioner Arcuri said.To aid the roll out of the vaccine, temporary solar-powered healthcare pavilions will pop up in town squares around the country, designed to look like five-petalled primrose flowers, a symbol of spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-kicks-off-vaccinations-against-covid-19-in-rome/story-TPjxg6MmhE7aBdUbn0tJZI.html

The suspect, identified by the media by his surname Yang, was arrested while the motive for the attack remains unknown.Chinese law restricts the sale and possession of firearms, and mass attacks are generally carried out with knives or homemade explosives.Perpetrators of similar attacks in the past have been described as mentally ill or bearing grudges against society.In earlier attacks, a school security guard wielding a knife injured at least 39 people at a kindergarten in the southern region of Guangxi in June this year. The culprit was sentenced to death.In 2018, a man killed one and injured 12 in a knife attack at a shopping mall in Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-7-killed-in-knife-attack-in-northeastern-china/story-9iokGHWZem4v1iwG6HJbAN.html
27-12-2020||World||European Union nations kick off mass Covid-19 vaccinations||European Union nations officially kicked off a coordinated effort Sunday to give Covid-19 vaccinations to some of the most vulnerable among their nearly 450 million people, marking a moment of hope in the continent’s battle against the worst public health crisis in a century.Shots were administered Sunday morning to health care workers, the elderly and some leading politicians to reassure the public that the vaccinations are safe.In Prague, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis received his shot at dawn and asserted: “There’s nothing to worry about.” In Rome, five doctors and nurses wearing white scrubs sat in a semi-circle at Rome’s Spallanzani infectious diseases hospital to receive their doses.“Getting vaccinated is an act of love and responsibility toward the collective whole,” Claudia Alivernini, a 29-year-old Spallanzani nurse, said on the eve of being the first to receive the shot in Italy, which has Europe’s worth virus toll at more than 71,000 dead.Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza, speaking outside the hospital, said the coordinated EU rollout was a sign of hope for the continent, but that people still cannot let down their guard for several months more.“We still have difficult months ahead,” he said. “It’s a beautiful day, but we still need to exercise caution ... this vaccine is the true path to close out this difficult season.”The vaccines, developed by Germany’s BioNTech and American drugmaker Pfizer, started arriving in super-cold containers at EU hospitals on Friday from a factory in Belgium. The EU has seen some of the world’s earliest and hardest-hit virus hot spots, including Italy and Spain.Others EU countries, like the Czech Republic, were spared the worst early on only to see their health care systems near collapse in the fall.Altogether, the EU’s 27 nations have recorded at least 16 million coronavirus infections and more than 336,000 deaths — huge numbers that experts still agree understate the true toll of the pandemic due to missed cases and limited testing.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen released a video Saturday celebrating the vaccine rollout, calling it “a touching moment of unity.”The campaign should ease frustrations that were building up, especially in Germany, as Britain, Canada and the United States kicked off their inoculation programs with the same vaccine weeks earlier.As it turned out, some EU immunizations began a day early in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia. The operator of a German nursing home where dozens of people were vaccinated Saturday, including a 101-year-old woman, said “every day that we wait is one day too many.”Each country is deciding on its own who will get the first shots. Spain, France and Germany, among others, are vowing to put the elderly and residents in nursing homes first.Poland is also prioritizing doctors, nurses and others on the front lines of fighting the virus. The central European nation was largely spared the surge that hit Western Europe in the spring, but has seen high daily infections and deaths this fall.EU leaders are counting on the vaccine rollout to help the bloc project a sense of unity in a complex lifesaving mission after it faced a year of difficulties in negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal with Britain.“It’s here, the good news at Christmas,” said German Health Minister Jens Spahn. “This vaccine is the decisive key to end this pandemic ... it is the key to getting our lives back.”Among politicians who plan to get virus shots on Sunday, as a way of promoting a wider acceptance of vaccinations, are Slovakian President Zuzana Caputova and Bulgarian Health Minister Kostadin Angelov.Meanwhile, the first cases of a new virus variant that has been spreading rapidly around London and southern England have now been detected in France and Spain. The new variant, which British authorities said is much more easily transmitted, has caused European countries, the United States and China to put new restrictions on travel for people from Britain.The German pharmaceutical company BioNTech is confident that its coronavirus vaccine works against the new U.K. variant, but said further studies are needed to be completely certain.The European Medicines Agency on Jan. 6 will be considering approving a second coronavirus vaccine, this one by Moderna, which has already been approved for use in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-nations-kick-off-mass-covid-19-vaccinations/story-xkSRbb8pAuIIglE7YEohfK.html

27-12-2020||World||New York state probes possibly fradulently obtained coronavirus vaccines||A health care provider in New York may have fraudulently obtained Covid-19 vaccines and diverted them to members of the public in violation of priority guidelines, the state government said on Saturday.New York state police has started a criminal investigation into the matter, which could be the state’s first vaccine distribution-related scandal.The State Department of Health is aware of reports that ParCare Community Health Network, a provider with a clinic in upstate Orange County, “may have fraudulently obtained Covid-19 vaccine, transferred it to facilities in other parts of the state in violation of state guidelines, and diverted it to members of the public,” the state’s health commissioner Howard Zucker said in a statement.ParCare’s website shows it has six locations, including four in Brooklyn, New York, and says its patients are “mainly Orthodox Hasidic Jews, Hispanics, and African Americans.”A hyperlocal Orthodox Jewish news site, BoroPark 24, published a story on Dec. 21, saying ParCare had received a shipment of Moderna Inc.’s vaccines, and showed boxes of the vaccines in what appeared to be a refrigerator. It also had what appeared to be a copy of a ParCare advertisement touting availability of “The Newest Healthcare Revolution!” on a “first come first serve” basis.Gary Schlesinger, chief exeuctive officer of ParCare, was cited saying people who are a “health care worker, are over 60, or have underlying conditions” can register online to get a vaccine.That differs from state guidelines, which allow only frontline health care workers, or staff and residents of nursing homes, to get the first batch of vaccines.“We take this very seriously and DOH will be assisting State Police in a criminal investigation into this matter,” said Zucker in the statement. “Anyone found to have knowingly participated in this scheme will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”Representatives with ParCare didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment sent on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-state-probes-possibly-fradulently-obtained-coronavirus-vaccines/story-Wmiwqyb5RN2jZacX4B2vaJ.html
27-12-2020||World||China rushes senior official to Nepal amid political uncertainty||After unsuccessful efforts by Chinese envoy Hou Yanqi to effect a patch-up between the warring factions of Nepal’s ruling party, Beijing is rushing a senior Communist party official to Kathmandu in an apparent bid to shore up Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s government. Last week, Hou met Oli’s main rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, and President Bidya Devi Bhandari to discuss the spilt with the Nepal Communist Party. However, these efforts didn’t have much of an impact on the split within the ruling party and the political crisis affecting Nepal continued to create uncertainty. Beijing has decided to send Guo Yezhou, vice minister of the international department of the central committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), to Kathmandu on Sunday in an apparent bid to patch up the differences with the Nepal Communist Party. Guo is leading a four-member team to Nepal for a four-day visit, The Kathmandu Post reported, citing two Nepal Communist Party leaders. Bishnu Rijal, deputy head of the department of foreign affairs of a faction of the Nepal Communist Party led by Prachanda, confirmed the Chinese side had communicated about Gou’s visit to Kathmandu. “I don’t have much detail to share with you at this point of time,” he said. China’s efforts are in marked contrast to the position taken by India on Oli’s decision to dissolve Parliament and call snap elections. New Delhi has said this is an internal matter that should be handled in keeping with Nepal’s democratic processes. The external affairs ministry has said India will continue to support Nepal in moving forward towards peace, prosperity and development.” In response to Oli’s moves, Prachanda has claimed control over the Nepal Communist Party and removed the prime minister from the posts of party parliamentary leader and chair. Oli’s detractors have described his actions as a “constitutional coup”. China has been accused of intervening in Nepal’s politics several times in the past few years. It is believed Beijing played a crucial role in bringing together the parties of Oli and Prachanda to form the Nepal Communist Party in 2018. In May and July this year, Hou held several meetings with the top leaders of the Nepal Communist Party to end infighting between the factions led by Oli and Prachanda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rushes-senior-official-to-nepal-amid-political-uncertainty/story-cEpTjeqjBPAgik68Wzv3hM.html
27-12-2020||World||Bangladesh set to move second batch of Rohingya refugees to remote island||Bangladesh is set to move a second batch of Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar to the remote island of Bhasan Char in the Bay of Bengal this month, officials said on Sunday, despite calls by rights groups not to carry out further relocations.Around 1,000 Rohingya refugees, members of a Muslim minority who have fled Myanmar, will be moved to the island in the next few days after Bangladesh relocated more than 1,600 early this month, two officials with the direct knowledge of the matter said.“They will be moved to Chittagong first and then to Bhasan Char, depending on the high tide,” one of the officials said. The officials declined to be named as the issue had not been made public.Mohammed Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said the relocation was voluntary. “They will not be sent against their will.”The United Nations has said it has not been allowed to carry out a technical and safety assessment of Bhasan Char, a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, and was not involved in the transfer of refugees there.Bangladesh says it is transferring only people who are willing to go and the move will ease chronic overcrowding in camps that are home to more than 1 million Rohingyas.But refugees and humanitarian workers say some of the Rohingya have been coerced into going to the island, which emerged from the sea 20 years ago.Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abdul Momen told Reuters earlier this month the United Nations should first assess and verify how conducive the environment in Myanmar’s Rakhine state was for repatriating the refugees, before carrying out an assessment of Bhasan Char.Several attempts to kickstart repatriation of Rohingya to Myanmar have failed after refugees said they were too fearful of further violence to return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-set-to-move-second-batch-of-rohingya-refugees-to-remote-island/story-Uh4i1EbL8Xn4DUM7jQbm0L.html

At least seven climbers were still unaccounted for on three popular trails, Valipour said earlier.Tehran lies at the foot of the Alborz mountain range which has several ski resorts. Separately, Iranian maritime authorities were searching for the seven crew members of an Iranian transport vessel that capsized in rough Gulf waters on Friday, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported.“We are trying to find the missing by mobilising all our facilities and forces, and informing passing vessels and the naval search and rescue centres of Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan,” Esmail Makkizadeh, deputy head of Iran’s regional maritime body, was quoted as saying by ISNA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-climbers-killed-in-iran-ship-crew-missing-after-snowfall-and-storms/story-pY2LS3P6wOOI1ogC1Iim0J.html
27-12-2020||World||Despite smooth election, GOP leaders seek vote restrictions||Changes to the way millions of Americans voted this year contributed to record turnout, but that’s no guarantee the measures making it easier to cast ballots will stick around for future elections.Republicans in key states that voted for President-elect Joe Biden already are pushing for new restrictions, especially to absentee voting. It’s an option many states expanded amid the coronavirus outbreak that proved hugely popular and helped ensure one of the smoothest election days in recent years.President Donald Trump has been unrelenting in his attacks on mail voting as he continues to challenge the legitimacy of an election he lost. Despite a lack of evidence and dozens of losses in the courts, his claims of widespread voter fraud have gained traction with some Republican elected officials.They are vowing to crack down on mail ballots and threatening to roll back other steps that have made it easier for people to vote.“This myth could not justify throwing out the results of the election, nor can it justify imposing additional burdens on voters that will disenfranchise many Americans,” said Wendy Weiser, head of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law.An estimated 108 million people voted before Election Day, either through early in-person voting or by mailing or dropping off absentee ballots. That represented nearly 70% of all votes cast, after states took steps to make it easier to avoid crowded polling places during the pandemic.A few states sent ballots to every registered voter while others dropped requirements that voters needed a specific excuse to cast an absentee ballot. Many states added drop boxes and expanded early voting options.The changes were popular with voters and did not lead to widespread fraud. A group of election officials including representatives of the federal cybersecurity agency called the 2020 presidential election the “most secure” election in US history, and US Attorney General William Barr told The Associated Press there had been no evidence of fraud that would change the outcome of the election.Nevertheless, Republicans in Georgia have proposed adding a photo ID requirement when voting absentee, a ban on drop boxes and possibly a return to requiring an excuse for mail voting, such as illness or traveling for work on Election Day.Early supporters of the ID requirement include Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Republicans who were criticized relentlessly by Trump for failing to back his fraud claims after losing in Georgia. A top deputy for Raffensperger has said the ID requirement would boost public confidence and refute any future claims of fraud.The state’s two US Senate runoffs next month will take place under current law, which requires local election officials to verify signatures on absentee ballots.In Pennsylvania, Republican lawmakers have been writing legislation to address what they claim are problems with the 2020 election and mail voting in particular, even though courts and elections officials have found no evidence of widespread problems.“We’d like to tighten it up as soon as we can,” said Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Kim Ward.Republicans hold majorities in both legislative chambers, and their support was instrumental in a year-old state law that expanded mail voting to all registered voters. One bill being discussed would go so far as to repeal that law and force voters to state an excuse to receive a ballot in the mail.Previous elections have shown that voters appreciate mail voting, no matter their party affiliation. Republican candidates down the ballot did very well this year, even as a record 81.2 million voters cast their ballot for the Democrat in the presidential race.In Michigan, Republicans held every congressional seat and kept control of the legislature despite Trump losing the state. Yet Republicans still held a legislative hearing in which Trump’s lawyers argued there were widespread irregularities without explaining how these somehow affected only the presidential race but not other contests.“Just like we have seen a lot of legislators making ill-advised decisions to hold hearings that ended up being more political theater than policy debates, we can similarly expect legislators to further this hyper-partisan agenda to restrict the vote,” said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat.Benson said lawmakers should instead look to the high turnout for the presidential election as a guide to improving what worked and then make changes sought by elections officials, such as providing more time for clerks to process mail ballots. Michigan does not allow that work to begin until the day before Election Day.Lisa Schaefer, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said her organization also would like to see lawmakers focus on reducing the strain facing local election officials.“The more time that we spend in debating other issues, the less time that we have to do something good with changes to the election code,” Schaefer said.Democrats and voting rights groups have already begun pushing back, saying Republicans should be focused on protecting voter access to the polls and not feeding into conspiracy theories launched by Trump and his allies to undermine the Nov. 3 election.They say ID requirements accomplish little, but have a high cost.“It’s a solution in search of a problem,” said California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat who was recently tapped to fill the US Senate seat of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. “It will undoubtedly have the net effect of disenfranchising a lot of people without necessarily improving election security.”Padilla supports sending registered voters a ballot in the mail.Voter fraud does happen, but studies have shown it’s exceedingly rare. Numerous safeguards are built into voting systems to ensure that only eligible voters cast a ballot. Election officials say when fraud does happen, people are caught and prosecuted.Not all Republicans are seeking to add restrictions.In Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose said his legislative priorities are to expand early voting locations, increase oversight of election vendors, add an online option for requesting absentee ballots and address confusion over drop boxes.“Ohio’s got a good thing going, but we don’t want to rest on our laurels,” said LaRose, who wants his priorities approved by the Republican-dominated legislature.Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams said the pandemic forced the state to implement early voting, which proved popular among voters of both major parties. The Republican said he thinks it’s likely state lawmakers will create an early voting policy for subsequent elections and has heard of no opposition to that in the GOP-controlled legislature.“It just makes voting easier,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-smooth-election-gop-leaders-seek-vote-restrictions/story-m3wtOlG2pgeE5uW9D7EDTJ.html
27-12-2020||World||FBI at home of possible person of interest in Nashville bomb explosion||Federal agents converged on the home of a possible person of interest in the explosion that rocked downtown Nashville as investigators scoured hundreds of tips and leads in the blast that pulverised city blocks on Christmas morning and damaged dozens of buildings.More than 24 hours after the explosion, a motive remained elusive as investigators worked round-the-clock to resolve unanswered questions about a recreational vehicle that blew up on a mostly deserted street on a sleepy holiday morning and was prefaced by a recorded warning advising those nearby to evacuate. The attack, which damaged an AT&T building, continued to wreak havoc Saturday on cellphone service and police and hospital communications in several Southern states.Investigators from multiple federal and local law enforcement agencies were on Saturday at a home in Antioch, in suburban Nashville, after receiving information relevant to the investigation, said FBI Special Agent Jason Pack. Another law enforcement official, who was not authorised to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said investigators regard a person associated with the property as a person of interest.Federal agents could be seen looking around the property, searching the home and the backyard. A Google Maps image had shown a similar recreational vehicle parked in the backyard when the photo was captured in May 2019; an AP reporter at the scene did not see the vehicle at the property in the late afternoon Saturday.There were other signs of progress in the investigation, as the FBI revealed that it was looking at a number of individuals who may be connected to it. Officials also said no additional explosive devices have been found — indicating no active threat to the area. Investigators have received around 500 tips and leads.“It’s just going to take us some time,” Douglas Korneski, the special agent in charge in charge of the FBI’s Memphis field office, said at a Saturday afternoon news conference. “Our investigative team is turning over every stone” to understand who did this and why.Separately, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a report Saturday that tissue samples found at the scene were determined to be human remains. Officials said they were working vigorously to identify whom the remains belong to.Beyond that, the only known casualties were three injured people. The infrastructure damage, meanwhile, was broadly felt, due to an AT&T central office being affected by the blast. Police emergency systems in Tennessee, Kentucky and Alabama, as well as Nashville’s Covid-19 community hotline and a handful of hospital systems, remained out of service.The building contained a telephone exchange, with network equipment in it — but the company has declined to say exactly how many people have been impacted.Asked whether the AT&T building could have been a possible target, Korneski said, “We’re looking at every possible motive that could be involved.Investigators shut down the heart of downtown Nashville’s tourist scene — an area packed with honky-tonks, restaurants and shops — as they shuffled through broken glass and damaged buildings to learn more about the explosion.Mayor John Cooper has enforced a curfew in the downtown area until Sunday via executive order to limit public access to the area. More than 40 buildings were affected.AT&T said restoration efforts are facing several challenges, which include a fire that “reignited overnight and led to the evacuation of the building.” This has forced their teams to work with safety and structural engineers and drilling access holes into the building in order to reconnect power.“Our teams continue to work around the clock on recovery efforts from yesterday morning’s explosion in Nashville,” the company said in a Saturday statement. “We have two portable cell sites operating in downtown Nashville with numerous additional portable sites being deployed in the Nashville area and in the region.” Ray Neville, president of technology at T-Mobile, said on Twitter that service disruptions affected Louisville, Nashville, Knoxville, Birmingham and Atlanta. “We continue to see service interruptions in these areas following yesterday’s explosion. Restoration efforts continue around the clock & we will keep you updated on progress,” he said in a tweet Saturday.The outages had even briefly grounded flights at the Nashville International Airport, but service was continuing normally as of Saturday. The Federal Aviation Association has since issued a temporary flight restriction around the airport, requiring pilots to follow strict procedures until Dec. 30.According to Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake, police officers responded on Friday to a report of shots fired when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Police evacuated nearby buildings and called in the bomb squad. The RV exploded shortly afterward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-at-home-of-possible-person-of-interest-in-nashville-bomb-explosion/story-AgkCvzx7wRnfq7RWngvt7J.html

I will add that over the past 30 years, the Ministry of Emergency Situations has carried out more than 500 humanitarian operations abroad. I consider this one of the most important, significant areas of your work,” Putin said in an address on Emergency Rescuer’s Day, marked on December 27.He added that Russia is proud of its rescuers who will certainly continue to carry out their duties responsibly,“The whole world knows that Russia will help, will send its rescuers and specialists to where the situation is especially difficult, will deliver the most essential items - food, medicine, clothing, provide emergency medical and psychological assistance to people in desperate situations. And Russia will do it without any ulterior motives. Not for the sake of any political benefits. This experience, of course, should be used to further improve the entire system of the Ministry of Emergencies,” Putin said.The Russian President said that a lot is already being done to improve the emergencies system in Russia, including in what concerns technical capabilities, but the system could still benefit from additional improvements.“... it is necessary to further build up the capabilities of the unified state system for the prevention and elimination of emergency situations, to fully use the advantages of modern approaches in predicting risks in order to minimize damage from natural disasters, fires, floods, accidents. And most importantly, to save lives, lives and people’s health,” Putin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-always-ready-to-provide-humanitarian-aid-to-other-countries-putin/story-mpttV9OSefcnv0iLbxPRiK.html
27-12-2020||World||India, UAE relations soar high in 2020||The traditionally harmonious relationship between the UAE and India was further cemented in the year 2020 with their top leadership holding regular parleys to enhance cooperation on bilateral, regional and multilateral fronts in the post-Covid era, including the welfare of the vast Indian community in the Gulf kingdom.The growing strategic relations between the two countries were reflected in two high-level visits from India – External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in November and Chief of Army Staff Gen. M M Naravane in December.Jaishankar met the UAE’s top leadership, focussing on enhancing cooperation on various facets of their comprehensive strategic partnership including trade, investment, infrastructure, energy, food security and defence.Also Read: S Jaishankar meets UAE counterpart; discusses Covid-19, strategic cooperationHe held high-level meetings with Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Ruler of Dubai who is also the Prime Minister and Vice President of UAE Sheikh Mohamed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.The two sides also discussed prospects for economic cooperation between India and the UAE in the post-Covid-19 era and the situation in the neighbourhood of both countries.India’s concern for the welfare of 3.3 million Indians living in the UAE, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, was one of the main points during the deliberations.Jaishankar thanked Sheikh Mohammed for taking care of the Indian community, underlining that India had been a reliable partner to the UAE in all respects during this difficult period.He also assured the diaspora of the Indian government’s responsiveness on issues pertaining to post-Covid normalcy.Naravane’s visit to the UAE was historic as it was the first-ever by the head of the Indian Army to the country.He met Commander of the UAE’s Land Forces and Staff Major General Saleh Mohammed Saleh Al Ameri and discussed key issues of mutual interest and defence cooperation. The visit is expected to further open up new avenues for cooperation in the defence and security sphere.Indians constitute roughly 30 per cent of the country’s population. Earlier in March, the Crown Prince assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the health and safety of the Indian community during the pandemic as the two leaders exchanged information and views on the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation in their respective countries, as well as the steps being taken by their governments to deal with the situation.Jaishankar, who has taken a special interest in the India-UAE bilateral relationship, said: “It is a relationship where the highest leadership of both countries have invested goodwill and energy. As a result, you can see the transformation during the last five years.” The ties between India and the UAE are on an upswing in the last few years and the leaders of the two countries have been holding regular parleys this year to strengthen them further in the post-Covid era, especially on the economic front.Also Read: Gen. Naravane holds talks with UAE Commander on defence cooperationWith robust flow of bilateral investments and an annual bilateral trade of about USD 60 billion, the UAE is India’s third-largest trade partner. The influential Gulf nation is also a major exporter of crude oil to India.India has also invited further investments from the UAE in key sectors of the Indian economy such as infrastructure including logistics, food parks, highways, ports, airports, renewable energy and defence.In September, the Consulate General of India, Dubai, and Tea Board India co-organised a virtual B2B Meet to promote Indian tea in the UAE.As the pandemic wrecked havoc across the world, it provided an opportunity for the two countries to come closer and extend a helping hand to each other to sail through the crisis.In May, the UAE sent seven metric tonnes of medical supplies to India to bolster its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.“UAE assistance to India comes in recognition of the profound and brotherly ties our two countries have shared throughout the years,” the UAE’s Ambassador to India Ahmed Abdul Rahman AlBanna had said.India repatriated its 84,497 citizens from the UAE under the Vande Bharat Mission, the country’s biggest ever repatriation exercise to bring back its citizens stranded abroad amidst the international travel lockdown over the pandemic.The UAE is also one of the countries with which India has formed an air bubble arrangement to operate flights amid the pandemic.India also welcomed the “full normalisation” of ties between the UAE and Israel, its key strategic allies, under a historic peace deal brokered by the US, asserting that it has consistently supported peace, stability and development in West Asia.From an Indian perspective, the normalisation of the UAE-Israel ties has started bearing fruit.On December 14, it was announced that the International Federation of the Indo-Israel Chambers of Commerce (IFIICC) has been launched in the UAE to broaden relationship between the Indian diaspora and Israel.At the event, it was agreed that scientific research, IT, AgriTech and food security, health care and sustainability are areas of natural synergy among India, Israel and the UAE.As India looked for a venue to conduct the Indian Premier League owing to the Covid-19 situation, the strong relations between the two countries were once again highlighted with UAE playing host to the popular cricket season with eight star-studded teams playing 60 matches for nearly two months in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-uae-relations-soar-high-in-2020/story-TdGHYS1cKqctBTgDS0xIRJ.html
27-12-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic will not be the last: WHO chief||The coronavirus crisis will not be the last pandemic, and attempts to improve human health are “doomed” without tackling climate change and animal welfare, the World Health Organization’s chief said.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also condemned the “dangerously short-sighted” cycle of throwing cash at outbreaks but doing nothing to prepare for the next one, in a video message marking Sunday’s first International Day of Epidemic Preparedness.The WHO director-general said it was time to learn the lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic.“For too long, the world has operated on a cycle of panic and neglect,” he said.“We throw money at an outbreak, and when it’s over, we forget about it and do nothing to prevent the next one. This is dangerously short-sighted, and frankly difficult to understand.”The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board’s September 2019 first annual report on world readiness for health emergencies -- published a few months before the novel coronavirus broke out -- said the planet was woefully unprepared for potentially devastating pandemics.“History tells us that this will not be the last pandemic, and epidemics are a fact of life,” said Tedros.“The pandemic has highlighted the intimate links between the health of humans, animals and planet,” he added.“Any efforts to improve human health are doomed unless they address the critical interface between humans and animals, and the existential threat of climate change that’s making our earth less habitable,” he said.World ‘turned upside-down’ The novel coronavirus has killed at least 1.75 million people and nearly 80 million cases have been recorded since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.“In the past 12 months, our world has been turned upside-down. The impacts of the pandemic go far beyond the disease itself, with far-reaching consequences for societies and economies,” said Tedros.But the Ethiopian former health minister said the coronavirus crisis should not have come as a surprise, given the repeated warnings.“We must all learn the lessons the pandemic is teaching us,” he said.Tedros said all countries should invest in preparedness capacities to prevent, detect and mitigate emergencies of all kinds, and called for stronger primary health care provision.The UN health agency’s chief said that with investments in public health, “we can ensure that our children and their children inherit a safer, more resilient and more sustainable world”.The International Day of Epidemic Preparedness was called for by the United Nations General Assembly to promote the importance of prevention, preparedness and partnership in tackling epidemics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-will-not-be-the-last-who-chief/story-DZM3dVXmNnOP23vFgJg9kO.html
27-12-2020||World||Canada’s Ontario finds two cases of coronavirus variant first seen in UK||Health officials in Ontario said on Saturday that two confirmed cases of the new coronavirus variant first detected in the United Kingdom have appeared in the Canadian province. Scientists say the variant is about 40%-70% more transmissible than the original strain. Several other countries, including Australia, Italy and the Netherlands say they detected cases of the new strain.The Canadian cases, identified in a couple in southern Ontario with no known travel history, exposure or high-risk contact, came as the province went into a lockdown on Saturday.“This further reinforces the need for Ontarians to stay home as much as possible and continue to follow all public health advice, including the provincewide shutdown measures beginning today,” Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario’s associate chief medical officer, said in a statement.Ontario reported 4,301 new cases over the past two days on Saturday, with the province seeing more than 2,000 cases per day for 12 consecutive days.Last week, Canada extended to Jan. 6 a ban on passenger flights arriving from Britain and expanded enhanced screening and monitoring measures to travelers arriving from South Africa, citing the rise of the more infectious variant. Scientists say there is no evidence that vaccines currently being deployed - including one made by Pfizer and BioNtech - or other Covid-19 shots in development will not protect against this variant. Canada began rolling out the Pfizer vaccine earlier this month and started distributing Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine across the country last Thursday.Canada has so far reported 541,616 cases of Covid-19, including 14,800 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-ontario-finds-two-cases-of-coronavirus-variant-first-seen-in-uk/story-9wXcSwocX4JuYaeoS9OCpO.html
27-12-2020||World||Protests keep up against Israeli PM as new election looms||Hundreds of Israelis protested against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday, calling on the long-serving leader to resign just days after the country was plunged into a new national election.The protesters have been gathering outside Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence for months, slamming him for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and saying he cannot lead the country while under indictment for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate corruption cases. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing.Protesters held signs urging Netanyahu to “Go,” and declaring “We won’t stop protesting until you get out of our lives.”While turnout was lower than previous demonstrations amid colder weather, the protesters have a new impetus because Israel appears headed toward its fourth election in two years in March, in which Netanyahu faces new challenges from defectors from his conservative Likud Party.The election will likely be another referendum on Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving leader and also one of its most polarizing. It will come just after Netanyahu’s trial enters its evidentiary stage, which will likely lodge the corruption charges against him firmly in the public discourse during what is expected to be a bitter, divisive campaign.Saturday’s protest came a day before Israel heads into its third national coronavirus lockdown, with much of the economy again shutting down amid surging infection numbers. Critics say Netanyahu and his so-called “emergency” government — set up in the spring specifically to deal with the virus — bungled their response, bringing the country to another costly lockdown.Netanyahu points to the country’s current vaccination campaign, which has among the world’s highest per capita inoculation numbers, as the country’s way out of the worldwide health crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-keep-up-against-israeli-pm-as-new-election-looms/story-laE9K8xFgk0j1zPFP0HHVL.html

It’s a reminder | AnalysisChina is sending a high-level delegation led by Vice Minister of the International Department of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) Guo Yezhou to Kathmandu, The Kathmandu Post reported.“Leading a four-member team, Guo is scheduled to land in Kathmandu on Sunday morning on a regular China Southern Airlines flight,” the paper reported, citing sources in both factions of the NCP.Bishnu Rijal, Deputy Head of Department of Foreign Affairs of the NCP’s Prachanda-led faction, said that the Chinese side has communicated about Gou’s visit to Kathmandu.“I don’t have much detail to share with you at this point of time,” Rijal was quoted as saying by the paper.The Chinese embassy here did not respond to its multiple calls and messages, the paper said.Although no specific details about the agenda of the visit are available, senior NCP leaders confirmed that Guo is scheduled to land in Kathmandu on Sunday morning, leading a four-member delegation, My Republica newspaper reported.Also Read | Chinese ambassador steps up as Nepal’s communist party stares at a splitObservers here believe that the visit could be to assess the ground situation in Nepal following the decision of Oli to dissolve the House of Representatives and the rival faction within the NCP taking to the streets, it said.Citing sources in the ruling party, the paper said during his four-day stay in Kathmandu, the Chinese vice minister is scheduled to meet top leaders of both factions of the party.The development comes after Chinese ambassador in Nepal Hou Yanqi held a series of meetings with the president and top leaders of the NCP, including Prachanda and Madhav Nepal, who has replaced Oli as chairman of the Prachanda-led faction.During her meeting with Madhav Nepal on Friday, Ambassador Hou, who was concerned about the split in the NCP, inquired about the future political course of the ruling party among other things, the paper quoted Rijal as saying.Hou on Thursday met Prachanda, who claims control over the ruling party after removing Prime Minister Oli from the posts of the party’s parliamentary leader and chair.She had also met the Standing Committee member and former energy minister Barsha Man Pun on Thursday, the paper said.Hou’s meeting with Prachanda came two days after she called on President Bhandari at the latter’s office in Sheetal Niwas on Tuesday.The envoy was said to have discussed the latest political development following the president’s move to dissolve the House of Representatives and announce mid-term elections.This is not the first time that China has intervened in Nepal’s internal affairs at a time of crisis.In May, Hou held separate meetings with President Bhandari, the prime minister and other senior NCP leaders, including Prachanda, when Oli was facing mounting pressure to step down.In July, she again met a number of top leaders, including the president, prime minister, Prachanda, Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal and Bamdev Gautam to save Oli.A number of political party leaders had termed the Chinese envoy’s series of meetings with the ruling party leaders as interference in Nepal’s internal political affairs.Dozens of student activists carrying placards with anti-China slogans had staged a demonstration in front of the Chinese Embassy here to protest against Hou’s interference in Nepal’s internal affairs.China’s political profile in Nepal has been on the rise in the recent years with billions of dollars of investments under Beijing’s multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including the building of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network.Besides the investments, China’s ambassador to Nepal Hou has made open efforts to garner support for Oli.The Chinese Communist Party and Nepal Communist Party were regularly engaged in training programmes. In September last year, the NCP had even organised a symposium, inviting some leaders from the Chinese Communist Party to Kathmandu to impart training to Nepali leaders on the Xi Jinping Thought ahead of the visit of the Chinese president, his first to Nepal, the Post reported.In a guarded reaction to the fast-paced political developments in Nepal, India on Thursday said it was an “internal matter” of the neighbouring nation and it was for the country to decide as per its democratic processes.“We have noted the recent political developments in Nepal. These are internal matters for Nepal to decide as per its democratic processes,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in New Delhi.“As a neighbour and well-wisher, India will continue to support Nepal and its people in moving forward on the path of peace, prosperity and development,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rushes-top-ranking-cpc-leader-to-kathmandu-to-prevent-split-in-nepal-communist-party/story-jBGCvXs8rZsWQ78iy4dmYM.html

27-12-2020||World||Millions of Americans risk losing jobless benefits as Trump refuses to sign aid bill||Millions of Americans are about to see their jobless benefits expire on Saturday as US President Donald Trump has so far refused to sign into law a $2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package, insisting that it did not do enough to help everyday people.Trump stunned Republicans and Democrats alike when he said this week he was unhappy with the massive bill, which provides $892 billion in badly needed coronavirus relief, including extending special unemployment benefits expiring on Dec. 26, and $1.4 trillion for normal government spending.Without Trump’s signature, about 14 million people could lose those extra benefits, according to Labor Department data. A partial government shutdown will begin on Tuesday unless Congress can agree a stop-gap government funding bill before then.Also read | Biden warns of ‘devastating consequences’ of Trump block on pandemic reliefAfter months of wrangling, Republicans and Democrats agreed to the package last weekend, with the support of the White House. Trump, who hands over power to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20, did not object to terms of the deal before Congress voted it through on Monday night.But since then he has complained that the bill gives too much money to special interests, cultural projects and foreign aid, while its one-time $600 stimulus checks to millions of struggling Americans were too small. He has demanded that be raised to $2,000.“I simply want to get our great people $2000, rather than the measly $600 that is now in the bill,” the president tweeted on Saturday.His refusal to sign prompted sharp rebuke from Biden, who called on the outgoing Republican president to act immediately.“This abdication of responsibility has devastating consequences...This bill is critical. It needs to be signed into law now,” Biden said in a statement.Americans face an unprecedented holiday season amid a pandemic that has killed nearly 330,000 people in the United States, with a daily death toll now repeatedly well over 3,000 people, the highest since the pandemic began.Many economists agree the bill’s aid is too low but say the immediate support is still welcome and necessary.Congress to return next weekA source familiar with the situation said Trump’s objection to the bill caught many White House officials by surprise. While the outgoing president’s strategy for the bill remains unclear, his repeated expression of discontent over it dashed hopes that he would sign.Trump spent much of Thursday and the Christmas Day golfing at his club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The bill has been sent to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida residence, where he is spending Saturday.On Friday, Trump said he has held many calls and meetings from his golf club, but neither him nor the White House provided details. He has been sending tweets repeating his baseless claims about election fraud and accusing his fellow Republicans of abandoning him in his bid to overturn the election result, already shot down multiple times by US courts.Also Read | Pelosi sets up showdown on Trump’s $2,000 checks after GOP balksBiden, whose Nov. 3 electoral victory Trump refuses to acknowledge, is spending the holiday in his home state of Delaware.Democratic US Representative Don Beyer told CNN that Trump can still save the day if he signed the bill Saturday. “That means that the people on pandemic unemployment insurance, which runs out today, get to keep it...And the way forward if he signs this, on Monday the House will take up his $2,000 check – direct check stuff – which we’ve been for all along.”The US Congress, which normally is adjourned the last week of December, will be preparing to return to work. The Democratic-controlled House plans to vote on legislation providing one-time, $2,000 checks to individuals.Trump has also repeated his discontent over a $740 billion bill authorizing the nation’s defense programs, a legislation he vetoed last week. On Monday, the House is scheduled to vote on overriding Trump’s veto. If the House vote succeeds, the Senate could hold its vote as early as Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-of-americans-risk-losing-jobless-benefits-as-trump-refuses-to-sign-aid-bill/story-HdfchQ7gwKBzW6dNjvnSbO.html
27-12-2020||World||Biden warns of ‘devastating consequences’ of Trump block on pandemic relief||US President-elect Joe Biden warned Saturday of “devastating consequences” if President Donald Trump continues to delay signing a Covid-19 economic relief bill passed by Congress.Trump threw a long-awaited pandemic aid package into doubt last week as millions of Americans prepared to lose benefits and face eviction -- demanding lawmakers more than triple the $600 direct payments to US taxpayers.“This abdication of responsibility has devastating consequences. Today, about 10 million Americans will lose unemployment insurance benefits,” Biden said in a statement.“In just a few days, government funding will expire, putting vital services and paychecks for military personnel at risk. In less than a week, a moratorium on evictions expires, putting millions at risk of being forced from their homes over the holidays.”In a video late Tuesday, Trump, who is due to leave office in less than a month, called the $900 million bill “a disgrace” -- despite it being passed Monday with a large bipartisan majority after months of negotiation.The legislation was designed to throw a lifeline to businesses and people struggling to keep their heads above water.But in a pre-recorded statement made in the White House and sent out on Twitter, Trump said he would refuse to accept the bill without changes.“I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000, or $4,000 for a couple,” he said.The move puts Trump at odds with Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, who have ruled out any larger stimulus measures.Democrats failed Thursday to get a standalone measure through Congress to increase the payments that would go to all taxpayers earning up to $75,000 a year, with smaller amounts for those making up to $99,000.“Delay means more small businesses won’t survive this dark winter because they lack access to the lifeline they need, and Americans face further delays in getting the direct payments they deserve as quickly as possible to help deal with the economic devastation caused by Covid-19,” Biden added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-warns-of-devastating-consequences-of-trump-block-on-pandemic-relief/story-ViqmJziidoG6JY14NDV9MP.html
