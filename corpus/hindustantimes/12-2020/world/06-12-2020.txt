The Lahore rally would be the last nail in the coffin of the selected government.”Rehman remarks come a day after Imran Khan ruled out the possibility of the government granting permission to the PDM for holding anti-government rallies and warned that police cases will be lodged against organisers.In an interview to a private news channel, the premier had said the government has decided against allowing the Opposition to hold the public gathering, Geo News reported. “We will file FIRs against everyone -- from the kursi wala to the sound system handlers but will not stop them [Opposition leaders] from going there,” he said.Meanwhile, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz senior leader Rana Sanaullah said people will express solidarity with the PDM at the Minar-e-Pakistan. He also said that the final decision about en masse resignation from national and provincial assemblies will be taken by the leadership of the Opposition’s 11-party alliance - PDM.“I was first accused of owning property worth two billion rupees in Australia. A fake case was lodged against me. Drug peddlers were brought from Faisalabad to testify against me, but the government did not find any witness against me despite all the pressure,” said Sanaullah.Underscoring the need for dialogues, Sanaullah said that if the Imran Khan-led government had held negotiations with the Opposition, the country’s current situation would have been different, reported ARY News.He also said that his party will comply with the PDM leadership’s decision.

However, an unsigned note circulated as part of the messaging campaign said, “There are elements within the protesters who are using these protests to support terrorist activities and secessionist movements like Khalistan and Kashmir.” Pro-Khalistan groups such as Sikhs for Justice and Shiromani Akali Dal-Amritsar Canada have also joined the agitators in Canada.The note also said, “While the entire nation has sympathy for the farmers and their cause, the use of this platform to fuel secessionist voices will not be tolerated by the people of India.”In a rebuke to Canada’s ruling dispensation, which echoed the statement and demarche from the external affairs ministry in New Delhi, the note stated, “The prime minister and senior ministers from the Canadian government and other leaders have spoken on the issue, given the compulsions of their domestic politics.”It pointed out that discussions between representatives of protesting farmers and the Indian government are still being held. It also noted that the impact of these reforms could include seeing “India’s agriculture and food processing industries transformed”.The note is part of the Ottawa-based high commission’s “intense outreach” to political and diaspora leaders in Canada, according to an Indian official.It also pointed out that Canada is “one of the most strident critics” of India’s minimum support price (MSP) regime, and other agricultural policies at the World Trade Organization (WTO). “In this context, the recent comments by the Canadian leadership are at odds with Canada’s aggressive posture at the WTO towards India’s agricultural support to its farmers,” it asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-s-missions-in-canada-launch-outreach-campaign-on-farmers-protest/story-DabhnbMeqo78G7PiSnnwGO.html

Around 700 who were unable to find places to stay with friends or family during the operation were looked after in Frankfurt’s convention center.Even 75 years after the end of World War II, such finds are relatively common in Germany, testament to the ferocity of the conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-experts-defuse-wwii-era-bomb-found-in-frankfurt/story-BzYa5zAsNtgwHUNoOcW2mL.html

However, the deputy inspector general (DIG) of police said the police were investigating all aspects, the paper reported.Incident involving forced conversion of minority non-Muslim girls and subsequent marriage with Muslim men frequently surface in Pakistan.Last month, a young Christian girl, Arzoo Raja, was reportedly abducted, forced to convert and marry a 44-year-old Muslim man in Karachi. Her parents filed a case which is still in the court.Christians constitute around 2 per cent of the population in Muslim-dominated Pakistan. Karachi, Lahore and Faisalabad have a large Christian population. There are many Christian villages in the Punjab heartland, while there is also a sizable population in the deeply conservative north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, particularly in Peshawar city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/christian-woman-killed-in-pak-for-rejecting-marriage-proposal-report/story-FT55wZIxHt4osoHqgFkcgL.html
06-12-2020||World||Will the US ever have a national Covid-19 testing strategy?||As the coronavirus epidemic worsens, US health experts hope Joe Biden’s administration will put in place something Donald Trump’s has not — a comprehensive national testing strategy.Such a strategy, they say, could systematically check more people for infections and spot surges before they take off. The health experts say it would be an improvement from the current practice, which has professional athletes and students at elite universities getting routine tests while many other Americans stand in line for hours — if they get tested at all.“We have had no strategy for this virus. Our strategy has been no strategy,” said Dr. Michael Mina, a Harvard University researcher focused on use of testing to track disease.Some experts say the lack of such a system is one reason for the current national explosion in cases, hospitalizations and deaths.“If we’d had a more robust approach and testing was scaled up as one of the tools, I think much of this third surge would would have been avoidable,” said Dr. Grant Colfax, director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health.There are differing opinions on what such a strategy should look like, but many experts say rapid and at-home tests should be used so Americans can check themselves and stay away from others if they test positive.The president-elect has endorsed that strategy, called for making testing free for all Americans, and said government experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies should be empowered to coordinate the entire effort.“The reality is we’re not testing enough today,” Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, co-chair of Biden’s coronavirus advisory board, told The Associated Press this week.His transition team so far has not gone into further detail.Testing was one of the first — and most enduring — stumbles in the federal government’s response to the coronavirus epidemic that hit the nation early this year.In February, the CDC distributed test kits to public health laboratories that initially were faulty. US officials worked with companies to expand testing, but shortages of chemicals, materials and protective equipment meant fewer tests were available than what experts said was necessary.Worse, some experts say, states and cities competed against each other to buy limited testing services and materials, and with little guidance or training on how to best use the tests.In April, President Donald Trump declared governors were responsible for testing. Amid complaints about shortages and delays, the federal government began sourcing and shipping key testing supplies to states, beginning with swabs.In the latest phase, Trump officials are sending more than 100 million rapid, point-of-care tests to states. The government said the first shipments went out in early October.Such tests are considered key to slowing spread, but states have distributed them differently. For example, Alaska is sending tests to oil drilling sites, Colorado to local public health agencies for testing homeless populations, and Mississippi to veterans’ homes.There’s also no federal standard for reporting test data. Some states report the number of tests administered, while others tally the number of people tested. Some have counted types of tests that others don’t, which can skew results because some tests are better at diagnosing active infections than others.Administration officials say they are proud of the current state of testing. Last month, Vice President Mike Pence celebrated that 170 million tests have been completed, and that an expanding array of tests are available.But the focus should be less on numbers and more on action, said Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the University of Nebraska College of Public Health.“It shouldn’t be anybody who needs a test can get a test,” Khan said. “It should be anybody who has a positive test immediately gets isolated” and the people they were in contact with checked and placed in quarantine.He was echoed by Nunez-Smith, the Biden coronavirus adviser.“Testing is only useful when we can act on the test,” said Nunez-Smith, a Yale health equity researcher.Trump himself has voiced a lack of enthusiasm for comprehensive testing. In a June tweet, the president called testing a double-edged sword that is good to have but “makes us look bad.” And Dr. Scott Atlas — a top pandemic adviser to Trump before he resigned Monday — argued against testing people who aren’t experiencing symptoms.But some regard such thinking as an attempt to spin a leadership failure into something else.“The executive branch has seen test results – case counts – as a report card on its performance,” said Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington evolutionary biologist who studies emerging infectious diseases.The nation may be weeks away from coronavirus vaccines becoming available, but that won’t erase the need for testing, said the Rockefeller Foundation’s Eileen O’Connor.“We’re not going to get everybody vaccinated right away. And we still don’t know how long that immunity will last,” she said. So testing will still be needed to monitor where the infection is active and to see if infections are occurring in vaccinated people.What should be done moving forward?In July, the Rockefeller Foundation called for making cheap tests widely available to better identify people who are infected and don’t know it. That would involve developing and making cheap antigen tests, which provide quick results but are less reliable than genetic tests. Foundation officials hoped the government would push companies to manufacture tests the same way it has pushed vaccine makers to mass produce experimental vaccines.Some Harvard researchers believe that testing half the population each week would be possible by mailing those tests to millions of US households.Participation would be voluntary, and positive results would have to be confirmed with genetic tests — the home tests are not considered as sensitive as more established lab-based testing. Even so, it could dramatically expand the amount of infection monitoring going on across the nation, its proponents say.During an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health said Americans should have easy tests they can do in their own homes.“We don’t have that,” he said. “We should have that.”Versions of such an approach have been tried in some places, including Slovakia and Minnesota. But some experts note there is little precedent for screening tens of millions of people with cheap, rapid tests—which would generate a significant portion of false results. It’s also unclear whether people who test themselves at home will follow instructions to quarantine.Nearly all experts agree that more data and coordination is needed.“Having every state do its own thing without guidance from the federal level — from CDC in particular — I think has really hampered us,” said Scott Becker, the chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. “It is a federal response as much as it is a state response, but it’s a shared responsibility. We need to work together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-the-us-ever-have-a-national-covid-19-testing-strategy/story-9bnTPxAhrFQQoiOPJ5hyZJ.html

The government also looked into partnerships with two other Chinese drug manufacturers, Sinopharm and CanSino Biologics.Penny Lukito, head of the Food and Drug Control Agency, estimated that the Sinovac vaccine would obtain emergency use authorization from the agency by the third or fourth week of January, after the agency evaluates interim results from the third-stage clinical trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-2-million-doses-of-china-made-covid-19-vaccine-arrives-in-indonesia/story-xHSaQC8YHS18eAPH6xI1qL.html
06-12-2020||World||Three years after US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, its status remains contentious. Here’s why||It has been three years since US President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and ordered to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city, upending decades of the country’s foreign policy in favour of the Jewish nation. US State Secretary Mike Pompeo on Sunday said that the decision strengthened the diplomacy efforts and partnership between the two countries, calling it the “greatest hope for peace.”  Three years ago, @realDonaldTrump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s rightful capital and ordered @usembassyjlm to move from Tel Aviv. This simple recognition of reality strengthened our diplomacy efforts, our partnerships, and still today reflects our greatest hope for peace.The Trump administration has been aggressive about its foreign policy for Israel, by taking several decisions that have been seen as against Palestinian interests. The United States recognised Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a disputed region occupied by Israel since 1967, and announced a reversal of its decades-long policy on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, calling the occupation not necessarily a violation of international law. “Basing policy on reality, we recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and we recognised Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights,” Pompeo told a Senate committee in 2019.Also Read | India urges Israel, Palestine to re-engage in direct talks to advance goal of two-state solutionEarlier this year, Trump also unveiled the long-awaited Middle East peace plan to resolve Israel-Palestine conflict, proposing an independent Palestinian state and promising to keep Jerusalem as Israel’s “undivided capital.” The Secretary General of the Arab League called the plan “a great waste of legitimate rights” of Palestinians, adding that the organisation is open to any serious effort to achieve peace.India has repeatedly called for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, urging both parties to resolve issues through direct negotiations. After the Middle East peace plan was unveiled, the Ministry of External Affairs called on the parties to engage with each other and find an acceptable two-State solution for peaceful coexistence.Why the status of Jerusalem remains contentious?Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to Jerusalem, a city considered holy to the Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state they hope for, while Israel regards the whole of Jerusalem as its capital. In 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem, West Bank and Gaza Strip, which was followed by years of armed conflicts. UN Security Council Resolution 242 called for a withdrawal of Israeli troops “from territories occupied in the recent conflict”, recognising the right of “every state in the area to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries.” Since then, the Palestinians have been fighting for an independent state comprising the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. After US’ recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to adopt a resolution, asking nations not to establish diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. The delegates warned that the US’ decision risked igniting a “religious war across the already turbulent Middle East and even beyond.” As many as 128 countries, including India, voted in favour of adopting the resolution, with only nine countries voting against it. It also demanded that countries comply with all relevant Security Council resolutions and work to reverse the “negative trends” imperilling a two-State resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-years-after-us-recognition-of-jerusalem-as-israel-s-capital-its-status-remains-contentious-here-s-why/story-7wit0tSiDwgFkekT4PnHIP.html

Friday’s incident, which occurred at about 5 p.m. (0900 GMT) in a mine shut for more than two months as the company dismantled underground equipment, is being investigated, it added.China on Sunday ordered local authorities to “resolutely take decisive measures to effectively stop major accidents in coal mines from happening,” according to a statement published on the website of the Ministry of Emergency Management.Officials from the State Council also urged the Chongqing government to launch a comprehensive safe production check on all coal mines, and eliminate outdated production capacity in an orderly and safe manner, the statement said. China’s mines are among the world’s deadliest, with 16 deaths reported in late September after high levels of carbon monoxide trapped miners at the Songzao coal mine in Chongqing.Diaoshuidong, built in 1975 and run since 1998 as a private enterprise, is a high-gas mine with annual capacity of 120,000 tonnes of coal, Xinhua said.In 2013, three people were killed and two injured in a hydrogen sulphide poisoning incident at the mine, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/23-dead-in-coal-mine-accident-in-china-s-chongqing/story-LwaDQnYEzfz5YirWOS2WgO.html

We plan to have all the ancillary materials the syringes, the needles, the swabs,” Slaoui said.“I think the plans are there and I feel confident that once we will explain it, everything in detail. I hope the new transition team will understand that things are well planned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-meet-us-vaccine-advisor-moncef-slaoui-this-week/story-7oSf0Bfcb4i1oQr79uIbxI.html
06-12-2020||World||China dismisses ‘Wolf Warrior diplomacy’ charge as akin to ‘China threat’ theory||China has sought to dismiss the use of the term “Wolf Warrior diplomacy”, which is used to describe confrontational rhetoric by its diplomats to ward off criticism on a host of issues, calling it yet another version of “China threat theory” being floated by Beijing’s critics.Obviously, the “Wolf Warrior diplomacy” is actually another version of the “China threat” theory and another “discourse trap,” whose purpose is to prevent China from fighting back, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said in the first official reaction to the widely-used phrase among international diplomats and media to highlight Beijing’s aggressive posturing.Chinese diplomats were once known for their low-key approach in dealing with complex domestic and global issues. But their style changed in recent years as Beijing battled increasing global adversity on issues like coronavirus, which became a pandemic after emerging from Wuhan, allegations of mass internment camps in Xinjiang and imposition of national security law in Hong Kong.Critics also say the change in style is fuelled by the pursuance of aggressive nationalism by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. Le said that as a responsible major country, China has always been a defender of the international order, a contributor to global governance and a provider of international public goods.It was a time when there seemed to be less inordinate criticism from the West. But the world and Chinese diplomats have changed, a write up in the CPC’s aggressive tabloid Global Times said.“In some Westerners’ eyes, Chinese diplomats are now engaged in ‘Wolf Warrior’ style diplomacy, named after a 2015 Chinese patriotic action film and its 2017 sequel. The change seemingly has made the West feel challenged,” it said.The term was coined from the 2017 Hollywood Rambo style Chinese action film “Wolf Warrior 2”.Le, a former Ambassador to India, dismissed such labels as misunderstanding China’s diplomacy, stressing that China has always been a country of etiquette, valuing harmony, and never taking the initiative to provoke others, nor running to the door of another’s house to pick a quarrel. “China has no choice but to stand up in defence of our national interests and dignity, as others have come to our door and meddle in our internal affairs and abuse us,” Le was quoted as saying by the official media here while addressing a think-tank forum on Saturday.Le said the allegation by some people that China has made enemies all around the world with aggressive diplomacy is not true.“We have always made friends and forged good relationships. It is precisely certain big countries which have pressured other countries to take sides with ‘my way or no way’ choice. But even under such circumstance, China’s ‘circle of friends’ is not getting smaller but bigger”, he said. “Many developing countries and friendly people have resisted the pressure and continued to cooperate with China and spoken out in support of China on international occasions,” he said. This week, outgoing US National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe has said China poses the greatest threat to America and the rest of the free world since World War II.“The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the US and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically,” Ratcliffe wrote in an op-ed published on Thursday in The Wall Street Journal.“Many of China’s major public initiatives and prominent companies offer only a layer of camouflage to the activities of the Chinese Communist Party. I call its approach of economic espionage ‘rob, replicate and replace,’“ Ratcliffe said.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying dismissed the allegations as a further move to spread “false information, political viruses and lies” in hopes of damaging China’s reputation and China-US relations.“It offered nothing new but repeated the lies and rumours aimed at smearing China and playing up the China threat by any means,” Hua said at a daily briefing on Friday. “It’s another hodgepodge of lies being produced by the relevant departments of the US government for some time,” she said.Last month, another Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian while rebutting joint statement by Five Eyes countries criticising China’s top legislature to disqualify four pro-democracy lawmakers of Hong Kong, said: “No matter how many ‘eyes’ you have, be careful not to be poked and get blind by harming China’s sovereignty, security and development interests.” The Five Eyes is an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US.Commenting on the aggressive style of diplomacy of by Chinese diplomats, Wang Xiangwei, a Beijing based columnist of the South China Morning Post, published from Hong Kong said Beijing should be cautious not to enter US trap. “Indeed, as the Chinese foreign ministry and official media consistently paint Washington’s moves and rhetoric as irrational, reckless and bordering on unhinged, that gives Beijing the reason to refrain from doing the same to the US”, he wrote in one his columns recently.“There is also a growing suspicion that Washington is laying a trap and deliberately provoking Beijing to react irrationally for the sake of its domestic politics”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-dismisses-wolf-warrior-diplomacy-charge-as-akin-to-china-threat-theory/story-Jth3oZelGqm0grMyOwP5zM.html
06-12-2020||World||Family of children’s author Roald Dahl apologise for his anti-Semitic remarks||The family of Roald Dahl, late author of children’s classics such as “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”, has apologised for anti-Semitic remarks he made, saying the comments were “incomprehensible to us”.The British author, who died in 1990 aged 74, remains popular with young readers around the world and several of his books such as “The BFG”, “Matilda”, “Fantastic Mr Fox” and most recently “The Witches”, have been turned into movies and stage shows.However, controversy has occasionally flared up over anti-Semitic comments, particularly those made in a 1983 interview with Britain’s New Statesman magazine.“There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity, maybe it’s a kind of lack of generosity towards non-Jews,” he said, adding that “even a stinker like Hitler didn’t just pick on them for no reason”.In a statement on the official website of the organisations that manage his legacy, copyrights and trademarks and a museum dedicated to him, the Dahl family apologised for what they said was the lasting and understandable hurt his remarks had caused.“Those prejudiced remarks are incomprehensible to us and stand in marked contrast to the man we knew and to the values at the heart of Roald Dahl’s stories, which have positively impacted young people for generations,” they said.“We hope that, just as he did at his best, at his absolute worst, Roald Dahl can help remind us of the lasting impact of words.”The director Steven Spielberg was asked about Dahl’s anti-Semitic comments in 2016, when he was at the Cannes film festival promoting his adaptation of The BFG.Spielberg said he had been unaware of the comments when he took on the project, adding the book was about embracing differences and that was the value he had sought to impart in telling the story.Other high-profile adaptations of Dahl’s works have included two big-budget movie versions of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Fantastic Mr Fox, and a stage musical version of Matilda that has been a hit in London and on Broadway.A new movie version of Dahl’s The Witches, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Anne Hathaway as the Grand High Witch, was recently released on HBO Max by studio Warner Brothers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/family-of-children-s-author-roald-dahl-apologise-for-his-anti-semitic-remarks/story-F9yphSitfEKvsOObYrohLJ.html
06-12-2020||World||Presidential inauguration planners rethink how to party in age of virus||Public health guidance to avoid big parties in the age of coronavirus is about to collide with what is typically one of America’s biggest celebrations of all: the swearing-in of a new president.While lots of details are still to be worked out, this January 20 is sure to be more subdued than prior inauguration days.A giant parade down Pennsylvania Avenue? Not likely.Fancy balls? They may morph into virtual events.The traditional luncheon where lawmakers offer best wishes to the new president? It might not include food this year.What about the swearing-in itself? The inaugural platform on the Capitol’s West Front is going up just like always, but it probably won’t be as crowded.“I think you’re going to see something that’s closer to what the convention was like than a typical inauguration,” President-elect Joe Biden said Friday, referring to the all-virtual event that marked his nomination last summer. “First and foremost, in my objective, is to keep America safe but still allow people to celebrate — to celebrate and see one another celebrate.”For their convention, Democrats pulled together a made-for-TV mashup of homemade videos, speeches from classrooms and living rooms, and music played from afar, narrated by celebrity hosts.Biden’s swearing-in itself will not be virtual. But guests should be prepared to socially distance and wear a mask. Lawmakers are also considering requiring a Covid-19 test for anyone on the platform near the president-elect, said Paige Waltz, a spokesperson for the joint congressional committee charged with overseeing the event.The VIP platform can hold 1,600 people. Lawmakers also generally distribute tickets for positions nearby. While no hard decisions have been made, the committee is looking at cutting the numbers on both accounts.“My guess is there will still be a platform ceremony,” Biden said. “But I don’t know exactly how it’s all going to work out. The key is keeping people safe. I can’t do a super version of the president’s announcement in the Rose Garden.”That was an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s Rose Garden introduction of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, where hundreds of people crammed together, many without masks. It turned out to be a superspreader of the virus.Biden’s play-it-safe approach to the coronavirus during his campaign offers clues about what to expect in terms of inaugural modifications.He said Friday that a “gigantic inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue” was unlikely, although a big reviewing stand is being constructed in front of the White House.No decisions have been made on whether the official inaugural balls should go forward. Some advocacy groups already are going virtual with their galas, including the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization.“Our goal is to democratize the inauguration party experience by holding a virtual event integrating our 3 million-plus members and supporters into the day’s events and breaking the traditional bubble of a Washington insider experience,” said Lucas Acosta, a spokesperson for the group.The celebrity component of this year’s celebration has yet to be determined, but one source close to the inauguration suggested looking for hints in the lineup of celebrities who campaigned for Biden, including Lady Gaga, John Legend, and Jon Bon Jovi.Work to build the inaugural platform at the Capitol and the White House reviewing stand began before the November 3 election, as is traditional. New this year: Congressional planners have invited lawmakers to record video messages for the president-elect and vice president-elect that can be played on Jumbotrons before the swearing-in.After the ceremony, the president and vice president have traditionally attended a luncheon in National Statuary Hall that includes speeches, gifts and toasts. The event began in 1953, when President Dwight Eisenhower, his wife, Mamie, and 50 guests dined on creamed chicken, baked ham and potato puffs in the Old Senate Chamber.This year’s format and venue are up in the air. One congressional aide familiar with the planning said it’s likely that food will be out altogether. Rather, the event would revolve around the speeches lawmakers make wishing the new administration well.Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who heads the congressional inaugural committee, has been careful not to refute Trump’s baseless claims that he won the election. But Waltz said the congressional inaugural committee staff nonetheless is ready to work with Biden’s Presidential Inaugural Committee.That committee oversees inaugural events held away from the Capitol, including the parade and balls. Tony Allen, president of Delaware State University, serves as CEO.“This year’s inauguration will look different amid the pandemic, but we will honor the American inaugural traditions and engage Americans across the country while keeping everybody healthy and safe,” Allen said.Plans for protests are underway, too.A few groups have submitted requests for protest permits with the National Park Service. The Answer Coalition, made up of antiwar and civil rights organizations, plans a demonstration demanding “urgent action to save the environment, end war and prioritize money to meet people’s needs.” Let America Hear Us Roar For Trump is seeking a permit to “support our President.”As for Trump, it’s unclear whether he’ll show up for the inauguration. He recently told reporters: “I know the answer, but I just don’t want to say it yet.”Biden, asked if Trump should attend, said it’s important for the United States to show that competing party leaders can stand together, shake hands and move on. “It is totally his decision, and it’s of no personal consequence to me. But I do think it is for the country,” he told CNN.Even though plans are still taking shape, Biden’s inaugural committee is already raising money for such events as balls and concerts. The law allows unlimited contributions to the committee, but Biden will limit contributions from individuals to $500,000 and from corporations to $1 million. The committee won’t accept contributions from lobbyists or the fossil fuels industry.That’s according to an inaugural official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the work of the committee.The contribution limits for Biden are far lower than those for Trump’s inaugural four years ago. He raised a record $107 million for his inauguration and accepted massive checks, including $5 million from Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson.The inauguration is normally an economic boon for the Washington region, with visitors typically required to book several days in a hotel and at premium rates to get a reservation. This year, there are more options than usual — a sign the inauguration is less of a draw.“Given the pandemic, it’s good news that we’re hearing of some hotels being full already. But for the most part, there is still capacity in the city,” said Elliott L. Ferguson, president and CEO of Destination DC, the district’s marketing organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/presidential-inauguration-planners-rethink-how-to-party-in-age-of-virus/story-H6aEmrXqEZvnCs8rX7vigK.html

He is recognized as the legitimate ruler of Venezuela by the US and dozens of its allies, but that’s based on his status as head of congress, which he is about to lose.Guaido and his allies are boycotting the election, citing the absence of international monitors, while a minority segment of the opposition is taking part.Turnout is expected to be between 25% and 36%, according to Venezuelan pollsters. In the last congressional vote held in 2015, participation was 76%.Polls are open from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m., with results expected Sunday evening.Fewer people will turn out this time because the election is not perceived as credible, said Luis Vicente Leon, director of Caracas firm Datanalisis.“This electoral event will have neither massive opposition witnesses, nor credible audit, nor trusted automated voting systems, which makes it difficult to be sure of its real results,” Leon said.The government is trying to boost turnout through cash payments and food handouts. Maduro even promised to grant “special prizes” to the 100 communities with the highest participation rates.With no real opponents and widespread apathy, the government could win between 190 and 230 of the 277 seats, according to Caracas-based political risk firm ORC Consultores. The new assembly will take over on January 5.Maduro will likely try to use control of the National Assembly to try to bypass US sanctions and attract some foreign investment, especially through oil ventures, according to ORC director Oswaldo Ramirez. The assembly has to approve such investments.Although the main opposition parties won’t participate, some of them will still appear on the ballot. That’s because the top court -- packed with Maduro loyalists -- suspended and replaced the boards of those parties to hand them over to government allies in an attempt to boost the election’s appearance of legitimacy.The economy is suffering through its seventh straight year of contraction, with food shortages and annual inflation of 6,600%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/venezuela-s-last-democratic-institution-poised-to-fall-to-nicolas-maduro/story-pNDe1ffReh6oZCvCFEe27J.html

Why is it used in vaccine trials?||After Haryana health minister Anil Vij, who had participated in a vaccine trial, tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), it triggered a lot of questions around the efficacy of the vaccine candidate Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech. The company later issued a clarification, saying the trial volunteers receive the two vaccine doses 28 days apart and the efficacy of the vaccine can be determined 14 days after the second dose is administered.The Biotech firm further added that the phase 3 trial is a double-blinded study where half of the participants receive the vaccine and the other half receive a placebo. A double-blinded study means neither the participant nor the investigator knows whether the person was administered a vaccine or a placebo. What is a placebo?According to the dictionary definition, a placebo is a medicine or procedure prescribed for the psychological benefit to the patient rather than for any physiological effect. It is a substance or treatment which is designed to have no therapeutic value, including inert injections, pills, or any other kind of fake treatment. Also Read | Pfizer seeks emergency use nod in India, UK rolls out inoculation planWhy is it used in vaccine trials?The researchers compare the results of the vaccine with those obtained from the placebo and the placebo-controlled trials are widely regarded as a standard method for testing the efficacy of new treatments. The aim of administering a placebo in trial volunteers is to observe how many people in each group naturally contract the virus and fall ill.In the United States, if the number of inoculated volunteers contracting Covid-19 is at least 50 per cent lower than the number in the placebo group, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can grant the emergency use authorisation. The drug regulator requires a longer period of study to grant permanent approval to the vaccine candidates.The United Kingdom has authorised Pfizer’s vaccine for emergency use and the company is now awaiting emergency use authorisation from the FDA for its roll-out in the US. The biotech firm had announced that the final efficacy analysis of its vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, undergoing Phase 3 trial met all of the study’s primary efficacy endpoints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-what-is-a-placebo-why-is-it-used-in-vaccine-trials/story-BPExFDcqzLbmzjuThqNolN.html
06-12-2020||World||Henrietta Lacks and her contribution to Covid-19 vaccine||Everywhere in the world the scientific community is racing against time to save humanity from the ongoing pandemic. Scientists and frontline workers are being hailed for their selfless service, but one individual who awaits her due is Henrietta Lacks — a black tobacco farmer who died at 31 from an aggressive form of cancer. Her cells, says American Virologist Angela Rasmussen, were used to study the effect of SARS-CoV on humans, providing inputs for the development of a vaccine. Who is Henrietta Lacks and why is she important?Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951 at the age of just 31. At the time, many hospitals in the US practised segregating black patients from white patients, which reduced her options for seeking treatment. She ended up at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, in a ward located down the hall from George Gey, a researcher who had been attempting to grow human cells in his lab for decades. Her doctor sent some of her cells to Gey without her consent, changing the course of medicine forever.Lacks’s cell had the ability to divide and replicate indefinitely, whereas normal human cells are able to do that around 50 times, making it easier for researchers to grow the culture of identical cells quickly. Soon scientists all over the world started using her cell lines for furthering their research. They were used to carry out research for the first polio vaccine, for in-vitro fertilization, for cancer, and most recently for studying the effects of SARS-CoV replication in the human body. Scientists began to dub the cell line cultivated from her as HeLa, in her honour, but for the longest time, her own family was not aware of her contribution.What are the ethical issues behind HeLa cells?Journalist Rebecca Skloot was the first one to connect the dots and trace her DNA 50 years later, raising questions on ethics and racial injustice. HeLa cells brought in enormous profits for biotech companies but none of that ever benefited her family and her community. As Covid-19 wreaks havoc on America’s racial minorities, scientists are being forced to confront the historically unequal treatment meted out to blacks and other minorities. Cells are also derived from elective abortions, one such cell line actively used in vaccine research in the past is the HEK-293, a human embryo that was selectively aborted in the Netherlands, much to the dismay of the Catholic leaders in North America. This group urged the US Food and Drug Administration to instead provide incentives for Covid-19 vaccines that do not use fetal cell lines. The HeLa cells, however, spell out a different set of questions and possibilities. While asking the scientific community to not disregard the many contributions blacks have made over the years, also brings up the prospect of ‘restorative justice’, according to Yolonda Wilson, a bioethicist at Howard University in Washington. Lacks’s descendants who recently marked her 100th anniversary of her birth in August have expressed similar hopes. Once vaccination commences in full swing, a chance to correct a historical wrong will present itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-henrietta-lacks-and-what-s-her-connection-to-the-covid-19-vaccine/story-neC7CB4lUabGiFgJVbbp2L.html
06-12-2020||World||Queen Elizabeth, 94, to be among first to receive Covid-19 vaccine in UK||Queen Elizabeth, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, are expected to be among the first to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, whose first consignment has arrived in the UK and is set to be administered first to those above the age of 80 from Tuesday.Anti-vaccine claims on social media and elsewhere are among major obstacles faced by the UK’s health officials planning the biggest mass vaccination programme in the country’s history. Leading figures such as Queen Elizabeth taking the vaccine is expected to help overcome anxieties. The initial batch received from Belgium has 800,000 doses. The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which is enough to vaccinate 20mn people with two does, 21 days apart. It has also reached agreement for early access to over 300mn doses of other vaccines, when approved by regulators.Reports in the British press on Sunday said Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip may “let it be known” that they have had the vaccine that would be initially rolled out in 50 hospitals that have facilities for freezing the consignment at a temperature between 70 and 80 degrees Celsius.Due to their age, the Queen and Prince Philip are in the first group identified for vaccination. Frontline health staff, people over the age of 80 and care home workers will be the first to get the vaccine that was approved by the UK’s regulator on December 2.Terming Tuesday’s rollout of the vaccine as a “historic moment”, health secretary Matt Hancock said: “I urge everybody to play their part to suppress this virus and follow the local restrictions to protect the National Health Service while they carry out this crucial work”.Since the completion of the Brexit process on December 31 may lead to transport bottlenecks on the border, particularly if a deal is not agreed with the European Union by then, UK officials are considering deploying Air Force aircraft to bring the vaccine from Belgium from January 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-94-to-be-among-first-to-receive-covid-19-vaccine/story-ll4QSI4DOeM8xh2rcTyeML.html

Khyber Teaching Hospital spokesperson, Farhad Khan, said that six patients had died overnight due to lack of oxygen supply. “Of the six, five were admitted in the Covid-19 ward, whereas one other was admitted at a different ward,” he told the media.The spokesperson said that more oxygen was required during the winter season. The hospital had the capacity to keep 10,000 litres of oxygen which was maintained on a daily basis and it also had backup cylinders. He claimed that the situation was “under control” now and details were being acquired about the reasons behind the delay in supply.Khan said that the oxygen supply was sourced from a company in Rawalpindi and that supplies ran out after demand rose and also because of a rise in Covid-19 patients. Pakistan is experiencing its second wave of Covid-19 cases and experts have warned that this wave is more widespread than the earlier one. The country’s coronavirus positivity ratio again climbed to 7.59% on Saturday, with the highest positivity ratio observed in Abbottabad at 17.57%, according to the data released by the National Command and Operation Centre. The ratio had decreased to around 7.2% earlier.After Abbottabad, the second highest positivity ratio was observed in Rawalpindi at 15.26%, followed by Karachi at 14.31% and Hyderabad at 12.13%. In most cities, business and office hours have been reduced and public events have been curtailed.Prime Minister Imran Khan has appealed to the public to follow restrictions. He has also hinted that if the current trend continues, the government would be forced to go for total lockdown as against the current practice of partial or “smart” lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-patients-die-in-pakistan-as-oxygen-supply-runs-out/story-FvJUZdxePMLlRMxO6FcOVL.html
06-12-2020||World||Saudi prince strongly criticises Israel at Bahrain summit||A prominent Saudi prince harshly criticized Israel on Sunday at a Bahrain security summit that was remotely attended by Israel’s foreign minister.Prince Turki al-Faisal, who led Saudi intelligence for more than two decades and served as ambassador to the US and Britain, warned that any normalisation deals needed to help the Palestinians obtain their own independent state.He described Israel as a “Western colonising” power. He said Israel has “incarcerated (Palestinians) in concentration camps under the flimsiest of security accusations— young and old, women and men, who are rotting there without recourse to justice. They are demolishing homes as they wish and they assassinate whomever they want.” Although the prince does not hold any official position, his stance is seen as closely mirroring that of King Salman. In contrast, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has signalled greater willingness to quietly engage with Israel to counter common rival, Iran, and boost foreign investment in the kingdom.Prince Turki’s comments come as neighbouring Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates recently moved to normalise relations and establish ties with Israel.Saudi Arabia has insisted that any normalisation between it and Israel can only happen alongside a lasting peace deal involving a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, who spoke immediately after Prince Turki, said: “I would like to express my regret on the comments of the Saudi representative.” “I don’t believe that they reflect the spirit and the changes taking place in the Middle East,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-prince-strongly-criticises-israel-at-bahrain-summit/story-zOZsGxxAiN6psbVTYWI4AM.html
06-12-2020||World||UK prepares for ‘historic moment’ of vaccination against Covid-19||The first 50 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals are gearing up for what the UK government has described as the “biggest immunisation programme in history” as the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against Covid-19 arrived at “secure locations” in the country from neighbouring Belgium this weekend.Frontline healthcare staff, people over the age of 80 and care home workers will be among the first to get the vaccine as part of Phase 1 of the programme from Tuesday, which was approved for rollout by the UK’s independent regulator earlier this week. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had declared the jab, which claims to offer up to 95 per cent protection against Covid-19, is safe for human use against the novel coronavirus after “rigorous” checks.“This coming week will be an historic moment as we begin vaccination against Covid-19,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.“I urge everybody to play their part to suppress this virus and follow the local restrictions to protect the NHS while they carry out this crucial work,” he said.The minister added that the government is doing everything it could to overcome “significant challenges” to ensure care home residents are vaccinated as soon as possible after they were also cleared for Phase 1 by the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), as those at the highest risk of death from the deadly virus.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that NHS staff are working through the weekend for the first vaccinations to take place from Tuesday across 50 shortlisted hubs in the first wave. More hospitals will start vaccinating over the coming weeks and months as the programme ramps up.Patients aged 80 and above who are already attending hospital as an outpatient, and those who are being discharged home after a hospital stay, will be among the first to receive the “life-saving jab”. Hospitals will also begin inviting over 80s in for a jab and work with care home providers to book their staff in to vaccination clinics. Some media reports indicate that Queen Elizabeth II, 94, and her 99-year-old husband, Prince Philip, are likely to be among this group.Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers and all those vaccinated will need a booster jab 21 days later.“Despite the huge complexities, hospitals will kickstart the first phase of the largest scale vaccination campaign in our country’s history from Tuesday. The first tranche of vaccine deliveries will be landing at hospitals by Monday in readiness,” said Professor Stephen Powis, NHS National Medical Director.“The NHS has a strong record of delivering large scale vaccination programmes – from the flu jab, HPV vaccine and lifesaving MMR jabs – hardworking staff will once again rise to the challenge to protect the most vulnerable people from this awful disease,” he said. General practitioners (GPs) and other primary care staff are also being put on standby to start delivering the jab, with a number of them ready from December 14 and more in other parts of the country joining in a phased basis during the coming weeks and months. Vaccination centres treating large numbers of patients in sporting venues and conference centres will subsequently join the drive when further supplies of vaccine come on stream, the DHSC said.The vaccine is typically delivered by a simple injection in the shoulder but there is a complex and difficult logistical challenge to deliver from the manufacturers Pfizer to patients. It needs to be stored at -70C before being thawed out and can only be moved four times within that cold chain before being used. Defrosting the vaccine takes a few hours and then additional time is required to prepare the vaccine for administering.The DHSC said that NHS staff have been working over the weekend to prepare the sites and accept deliveries.Each box needs to be opened and unpacked manually, and temperature data has to be downloaded from each box.Tracking data covering every box’s journey from Belgium is also being downloaded to check that the vials have been kept well below freezing.There are five packs of 975 doses per box and only sites with the necessary MHRA licence can split the vaccine packs. Once all checks are complete, the vaccine will be made available to order by authorised sites in the state-funded NHS.The distribution of the vaccine across the UK is being undertaken by Public Health England and the NHS in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland through systems specially adapted from those used successfully for the national immunisation programmes, the government said.Around 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK from next week. In all, the government has ordered a total of 40 million doses – enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each, 21 days apart.Meanwhile, the UK recorded a further 397 deaths from the deadly virus, taking the country’s death toll to 61,014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-prepares-for-historic-moment-of-vaccination-against-covid-19/story-xxN7R3YFyRuBhl3ZEijd7L.html
06-12-2020||World||US Navy official says ‘uneasy deterrence’ reached with Iran||The top US Navy official in the Mideast said Sunday that America has reached an “uneasy deterrence” with Iran after months of regional attacks and seizures at sea, even as tensions remain high between Washington and Tehran over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program.Vice Adm. Sam Paparo, who oversees the Navy’s 5th Fleet based in Bahrain, struck an academic tone in comments to the annual Manama Dialogue hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He described having a “healthy respect” for both Iran’s regular navy and the naval forces of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.“We have achieved an uneasy deterrence. That uneasy deterrence is exacerbated by world events and by events along the way,” the vice admiral said. “But I have found Iranian activity at sea to be cautious and circumspect and respectful, to not risk unnecessary miscalculation or escalation at sea.”Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.While Iran has not directly seized or targeted a tanker in recent months, a mine recently struck an oil tanker off Saudi Arabia and a cargo ship near Yemen came under assault. Suspicion immediately fell on Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels for being behind both attacks. The Houthis have not commented on either attack.Paparo, a former Navy fighter pilot who most recently served as director of operations at the US military’s Central Command, offered a different stance than his immediate predecessor, Vice Adm. James Malloy. In one of his last comments to journalists in August, Malloy referred to Iran as “reckless and provocative” and always trying in dramatic naval drills to “lower the denominator until they’re sure that they can look like they’ve won something.”Malloy’s tenure saw oil tankers seized by Iran and a series of limpet mine explosions targeting tankers that the Navy blamed on Iran. Tehran denied being involved, though Revolutionary Guard members were filmed taking an unexploded mine away from one tanker.By contrast, the several months that Paparo’s been in charge have not seen any major crises.The US Navy routinely has tense encounters with the Revolutionary Guard, whose speed boats race alongside American warships in the Persian Gulf and sometimes conduct live-fire drills with machine guns and missile launches in their presence.The Guard typically patrols the shallower waters of the Persian Gulf and its narrow mouth, the Strait of Hormuz. Iran’s regular navy largely operates in the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. While previous commanders have made a point to differentiate between the professionalism of the two, Paparo dismissed it as an “old idea” that included a lingering belief that the service was still loyal to Iran’s former shah, who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.“Forty-one years into the revolution, I think we can dispense with that notion,” the vice admiral said. “I sincerely doubt there’s a difference among them.”Paparo also said he did not believe the 5th Fleet’s mission would be affected by the Navy potentially reconstituting a 1st Fleet responsible for the Indian Ocean.Still, Paparo’s remarks carried a clear warning, quoting former US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis at one point.“Be polite, be professional and have a plan to kill everyone in the room,” he said. “That’s how we conduct ourselves at sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-official-says-uneasy-deterrence-reached-with-iran/story-rWNZ7IMrHHZPIFEINR4CEN.html

In late 2016, US Embassy staff in Havana, Cuba, began to report the development of an unusual set of symptoms and some of the cases began with the sudden onset of loud noise.A year later, a US diplomat in Guangzhou, China, started experiencing unexplained symptoms, including headache and memory problems. The doctors concluded that the diplomat, Mark Lenzi, suffered a serious brain injury but MRI findings didn’t reveal the cause. The US State Department requested the National Academy of Sciences to assess the cause.“The committee felt that these acute symptoms were more consistent with a directed radio frequency (RF) energy attack, and explored possible related mechanisms,” the report said, referring to cases involved in so-called sonic attacks.Also Read | US raises concerns over CCP’s threat to American national securityThe researchers said that the chronic symptoms that were reported are often seen in patients after head trauma, as a result of chemical exposure, infectious diseases, or stress in a hostile environment. The committee did not find any evidence for usual forms of traumatic injury. While it did evaluate possible chemical and infectious causes as well as psychosocial causes, the overall analysis showed that they were not the likely cause.The committee said that there are several studies on the health effects of pulsed RF sources, but there are insufficient data in the open literature on potential RF exposure/dosage characteristics and biological effects possible for the cases involved. The report has not concluded that the use of directed microwave energy was deliberate, however, it cautioned that such action could be used for nefarious purposes. “The mere consideration of such a scenario raises grave concerns about a world with disinhibited malevolent actors and new tools for causing harm to others, as if the U.S. government does not have its hands full already with naturally occurring threats,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mysterious-injuries-suffered-by-us-diplomats-in-china-cuba-likely-caused-by-microwave-energy-study/story-TabYjh6B37FUpI6Huw27zN.html

I urge both sides to accelerate their peace efforts to end the country’s long war,” he said in another tweet.Meanwhile, the US State Department in its official statement has welcomed the formation and the first Leadership Committee meeting of the Afghanistan High Council for National Reconciliation on Saturday.“This inclusive body is chaired by Dr Abdullah Abdullah while afghan leaders across the political spectrum have unified to make decisions and mobilize support for a just and lasting peace. All sides of the conflict should come together and chart a path to peace,” said the statement.It further said, “As an authoritative body on peace, the High Council and its Leadership Committee will provide counsel and guidance to the Islamic Republic negotiating team with the Taliban on the terms of an agreement on a political roadmap, power-sharing, and a permanent ceasefire to end the country’s long war.”According to a report by TOLO News, the Afghan political leaders attended the first meeting of the High Council for National Reconciliation but some political figures, including Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Salahuddin Rabbani--the head of Jamiat-e-Islami party and Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, did not participate in the event.“The meeting could have been more complete. There are other personalities in our country who have contributed to peace. They have their own analytical analysis of peace and have public standing. They have the ability to represent, so we hope that they are also invited,” Tolo News quoted former President Hamid Karzai as saying at the reconciliation council’s meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-taliban-discuss-peace-process-release-of-remaining-prisoners/story-JNVlqxrRrLBpE8sCyatIhL.html

Many major stock and bond indices developed by index providers like MSCI and FTSE include malign People’s Republic of China (PRC) companies, listed on the Department of Commerce Entity List and/or the Department of Defense List of Communist Chinese military companies. The money flowing into these index funds - often passively, by US retail investors - supports Chinese companies involved in both civilian and military production.”It further said that some of these companies produce technologies for the “surveillance of civilians and repression of human rights”, as is the case of “Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang, China”, as well as in other repressive regimes, such as Iran and Venezuela.Some of the companies named in the list include -- China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, Aviation Industry Corporation of China, China State Shipbuilding Corporation,Huawei Technologies, China Spacesat, AVIC International Holdings Ltd., Xi’an ChenXi Aviation Technology Corp., Ltd.“As of June 2020, at least 22 of the 31 parent-level PRC military companies had affiliates’ securities included on a major securities index, including at least 68 distinct affiliate-level securities issuers; at least 13 PRC firms on the Entity List had affiliates or parent companies included in the MSCI or FTSE stock indices; and the MSCI emerging market index included 230 A-shares Chinese stocks incorporated on the mainland, quoted in renminbi, and listed on Chinese Communist Party-controlled Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges,” said the State Department.This list comes amid the worsening of relations between the US and China.On Friday, the US terminated five programmes that were disguised as “cultural exchanges,” with China as they are “fully funded and operated by the PRC government as soft power propaganda tools”.On December 3, the US government had issued an order to block cotton imports from a Xinjiang governmental organisation in China due to the ongoing human rights abuses of Uyghurs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-raises-concerns-over-ccp-s-threat-to-american-national-security/story-XGC5TBxiBFc3wK7fIyezeJ.html

He gave no further details.Democracy activists say conditions have worsened in the former British colony after China imposed security legislation on the financial hub in June, making anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or colluding with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison.China, which promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, denies curbing rights and freedoms, but authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have moved swiftly to quash dissent after anti-government protests erupted last year and engulfed the city. Local media reported that at least five accounts worth hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars belonging to Hui and his family, all of whom are now in Britain, had been inaccessible since Saturday. Hui contacted the banks and was told there were “remarks” placed on his accounts, but the staff refused to provide further information, Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reported.“We do not comment on the details of individual accounts,” a Hang Seng Bank spokesman told Reuters by email. HSBC and BOC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Hui said on Thursday he had fled after facing criminal charges and would seek exile in Britain.One of the pro-democracy activists arrested last month and charged with disturbing legislature proceedings, Hui arrived in Copenhagen last week on an official invitation from Danish lawmakers.Hong Kong’s Security Bureau issued a statement on Friday that, while not naming Hui, said “running away by jumping bail and using various excuses such as so-called ‘exile’ to avoid one’s responsibility is a shameful, hypocritical and cowardly act of recoil.”Hui was one of several opposition lawmakers who quit Hong Kong’s Legislative Council last month in protest at the dismissal of four colleagues in what they called another push by Beijing to suppress democracy in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-hong-kong-lawmaker-ted-hui-says-accounts-frozen-after-he-sought-exile/story-5Xy30Qcy3tLchPX5pwzJPI.html
06-12-2020||World||Britain’s Queen Elizabeth may go public after having Covid-19 vaccine, Times reports||Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and her husband Prince Philip may “let it be known” once they have received a vaccine against Covid-19, The Times newspaper reported, citing unnamed royal aides.The 94-year-old monarch and her 99-year-old spouse are likely to be among the first to be offered a jab, with the government prioritising elderly people as it begins the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine that was approved on Dec. 2.The queen is highly admired in British society, and her public backing for the vaccine would be a powerful message to counter anti-vaccination misinformation circulating online.The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 60,000 people in the United Kingdom and infected more than 1.7 million.The royal family has not been untouched, with both heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and his eldest son Prince William testing positive for Covid-19 earlier in the year.Under the government’s priority list for the vaccine roll-out, the first doses are intended to be given to elderly care home residents and their carers, followed by people over 80 and health service staff.The Times said that in 1957, the queen made public that Charles and his sister Princess Anne, then 8 and 6, had been inoculated against polio, helping to ease concerns about potential side-effects of what was then a new vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-s-queen-elizabeth-may-go-public-after-having-covid-19-vaccine-times-reports/story-Zja00mxQMObclP7ylnQ0eP.html

06-12-2020||World||Australia Lacks Strategy to Deal With China, Labor’s Wong Says||Australia lacks an overarching approach to handling a “much more assertive” China, and needs a plan for economic diversification and liaising with Asian allies to handle the emerging superpower, opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong said.“The strategy should be working out how we deal with the effects for Australia and the region of a China which demonstrably is taking a very different stance,” Wong told ABC’s ‘Insiders’ program. “The government really does need to stop focusing on splashy headlines and work out what is it doing.”Australia is the world’s most China-dependent developed economy and finalized a free-trade agreement with Beijing in 2015. Ties have been fraught since 2018, when Canberra barred Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network, and went into freefall earlier this year when the prime minister called for an independent probe into the origins of the pandemic, leading to trade reprisals.On Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison sought an apology from China after a diplomat in Beijing tweeted an image purporting to show an Australian soldier holding a knife to an Afghan child’s throat. That related to an investigation that uncovered alleged war crimes by Australian troops in Afghanistan.“The relationship is obviously in a very difficult and challenging place,” Wong said Sunday. “Going forward, I think we should assume that a more assertive, at times more aggressive China, is here to stay.”Despite the criticism, the opposition Labor party has sought to maintain a bipartisan response to China’s actions, with Wong saying it’s important for Australia to “remain unified in our condemnation.”Debate has simmered on whether Morrison was correct to respond so quickly -- and in person -- to the tweet. A visibly angry prime minister called a press conference 45 minutes after it was posted. Morrison reportedly only spoke with his foreign minister beforehand; Wong said he didn’t get in contact with Labor.“In diplomacy you always have to think carefully about how you calibrate your response,” she said. “It is a big call to go directly, escalate directly to the national leader, and I hope that Scott Morrison thought very carefully about that decision. I hope that he took advice.”Olympic BoycottChina refused to apologise; instead the Foreign Ministry’s top spokeswoman shot back, asking whether Morrison lacks “a sense of right and wrong.”Asked whether Australia should boycott the Winter Olympics in China in 2022, Wong said the opposition’s view -- and she understood this to be government’s too -- is that the event is an opportunity to focus on China and a legitimate time for questions of human rights.“China talked about the importance of human rights this week in the tweet,” Wong said. “Equally, I assume that they will therefore recognize the right of other nations and other communities to raise the issue of human rights in the context of the Olympics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-lacks-strategy-to-deal-with-china-labor-s-wong-says/story-NJilwSFPriQx3394m8ivIJ.html
06-12-2020||World||Joe Biden’s transition tests the US-UK‘special relationship’||Presidential transitions, even when they are less fraught than this one, prompt more apprehension among America’s allies than among its enemies. This is especially true of the British.The British government is exerting itself to show the incoming Joe Biden administration that the UK remains a useful ally. Last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed to a remarkably generous supplementary funding deal for Britain’s armed forces, worth $22 billion over four years. Clearly, he hopes the new US commander in chief will regard this as a commitment to maintain the country’s military capability, always a cornerstone of transatlantic relations.British officials burn midnight oil to divine the likely course of the Biden administration. A former British ambassador in Washington tells me: “The question is always, ‘Do we know the people who will be around the president? And will they like us?’”Johnson and his advisers know that Biden has no predisposition to like the Prime Minister — as President Donald Trump did, seeing a minor clone of himself, a fellow china-breaker.In the wake of Brexit, Britain will urgently need a new trade deal with Washington to replace the US-European Union(EU) arrangements. Yet the Biden administration will be in no hurry to negotiate, especially until it becomes plain whether the precarious 1998 Irish Good Friday peace agreement is threatened by cavalier UK conduct over border trade, as some of us fear that it will be.When spring blossoms, Britain’s Prime Minister will almost certainly visit the new US president. Tired old phrases about a “special relationship” will be dusted off and written into British headlines. In Washington, such fantasies evoke mild amusement. Few Americans will notice that Johnson is in town.This British government, like its predecessors, has to learn the hard lesson that US presidents spend much less time thinking about them than they do thinking about the occupant of the White House. Henry Kissinger has wittily described the follies of British prime ministers in meeting US chief executives. “Harold Wilson,” he wrote of the  British leader, “greeted President Nixon with the avuncular goodwill of the head of an ancient family that has seen better times.”Kissinger wrote pityingly of the British yearning to claim a special relationship with the US This should be indulged, he said, because “we do not suffer in the world from such an excess of friends that we should discourage those who feel that they have a special friendship for us.” The US, he urged, should never wantonly trample on British sensitivities. It should merely pursue “special relationships” with all its allies.Britain and the US have many values and interests in common. But successive British leaders diminish themselves when they parade delusions about their nation’s importance. Though I am not an intimate in the corridors of power, I have trafficked with six prime ministers, and urged all save Margaret Thatcher — I would not have dared — in vain to adopt realistic attitudes toward Anglo-American relations.A few days before Theresa May entered 10 Downing Street in July 2016, by chance I was her neighbour at a dinner party. We chatted mostly about nothings, but toward the end of the evening, I said that, as a historian, I would venture to offer one fragment of advice.When she took office, I said, she would visit Washington and receive all the courtesies in which Americans excel. However, she should never delude herself that relations between our countries involve sentiment. They are governed, instead, by the same criteria that dictate every nation’s foreign policy: perceptions of self-interest. Britain must never fall out with the US, but our leaders should forsake expectations of favours.May said nothing in response, and I did not expect her to. But soon after Trump became president, she visited Washington and offered him a state visit to Britain — an almost unheard-of invitation at the outset of an administration.For various reasons, the visit was put off until July 2019. When the president eventually arrived, the British pulled out the stops to entertain him, organizing a spectacular demonstration of the Special Air Service’s antiterrorist prowess, together with the Royal Family’s inimitable road show.It all proved wasted effort. Trump has treated Britain no worse than any other nation, but also no better. Just before General James Mattis resigned as US defense secretary in February 2019, he spoke privately to a senior British officer whom he warned: “However many state visits you fix, this president does not do allies.”None of the above — nor, indeed, what follows — is a complaint about American behavior. Again and again in the postwar era, our two nations have worked together in ways that have benefited world peace. But British governments would enjoy happier lives, and expose themselves to fewer humiliations, if they acknowledged the UK’s relatively modest place in today’s world, together with the fact that many other folks are competing for the ears and smiles of Washington.The US and British militaries have always cooperated closely, with mutual respect. So much has been written about the quarrels between generals in World War II that it is sometimes forgotten how amazingly well relationships worked at the operational level. Intelligence is the field where Britain has the most to offer the US, a tradition unbroken since the World War II era of Bletchley Park’s legendary code-breakers. GCHQ, the British cyberwar center outside Cheltenham, is a world-class operation, which America’s National Security Agency values immensely.Trump threatened to break the intelligence partnership unless Britain withdrew contracts from the Chinese Huawei corporation, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government complied. Its own security experts believe the US was correct on this issue.The same was true back in November 1956, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s rage about the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, following Gamal Abdel Nasser’s nationalization of the Suez Canal, forced a humiliating retreat. “Suez,” as the British still refer to the crisis, was a ghastly mistake, which exasperated Americans by deflecting world attention away from the savage, almost simultaneous Soviet suppression of the Budapest uprising. Nonetheless, Anglo-American solidarity through the decades of the Cold War was a critical factor in holding together the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance and checking Soviet adventurism. British governments suffered moments of private alarm that the US might unleash nuclear weapons, first in Korea, then during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. But the public front of the alliance remained unbroken.John F. Kennedy was the last US president to have close friendships with leading British figures, notably the UK ambassador in Washington, David Ormsby-Gore, and the journalist Henry Brandon. There was also mutual affection between Kennedy and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. It fell to the latter to smooth his countrymen’s ruffled feathers after Secretary of State Dean Acheson asserted in 1962 that the British had lost an empire but “not yet found a role,” a remark that stung to the quick, because so true.The transatlantic relationship survived turbulence in the mid-1960s, when President Lyndon Johnson put Wilson on the barbecue, figuratively speaking, to persuade him to send even a token troop contingent to Vietnam. Wilson’s refusal was perhaps the wisest act of his premiership, but prompted US secretary of state Dean Rusk to poke a British journalist in the chest at a Georgetown cocktail party and growl: “When the Russians invade Sussex, don’t expect us to come and help you!”The decade of Margaret Thatcher, of course, was the sole period of the last half-century when a British leader has commanded the highest respect and attention in the US Ronald Reagan admired her prodigiously. Yet their relationship is often misunderstood. His administration repeatedly acted in ways that dismayed and even affronted her, as in 1983 when it occupied Grenada, a former British colony, without consulting London.    Even during the UK’s war against Argentina in the Falklands a year earlier, the most serious early crisis of Thatcher’s premiership, US Secretary of State Alexander Haig and UN ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick strongly opposed endangering US interests in South America to save the moth-eaten imperial lion, as they saw Thatcher’s nation.Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger alone, and importantly, supported Britain and ensured critical military and intelligence aid. In the last weeks of the war, Reagan enraged the Prime Minister by telephoning to urge her not to impose absolute defeat, and thus humiliation, on the Argentine military junta.Thatcher exploded, and the transcript of their conversation delights posterity. “This is democracy and our islands,” she told him. Having lost valuable British ships and invaluable servicemen’s lives to return to the Falklands, she utterly rejected a diplomatic settlement. At one point in her harangue, Reagan held up the phone in the Oval Office so that others might hear the Prime Minister, saying, “Isn’t she marvelous?”Several wars later, during and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Prime Minister Tony Blair expended immense political capital to support President George W. Bush all the way to Baghdad, which has cost his historic reputation dearly. Blair’s backing reflected yet another British Prime Minister fantasizing that he could buy favoUrs in Washington.Although the British committed a division to the Iraq operation, American histories scarcely mention that participation. Moreover, Blair deluded himself that backing the invasion would enable him to secure a tougher US stance toward Israel, in pursuit of Middle East peace.   A year after the war, a very senior official of the British Foreign Office said to me ruefully: “You know, we stuck out our necks a long way for the US over Iraq. Yet now we have a dozen outstanding bilateral issues with Washington on aircraft landing rights, F-35 technology access codes and suchlike, and we are getting absolutely no payback.”The reality, of course, as all nations are obliged to recognize, is that the many elements of US administrations operate almost independent of each other, often little influenced by the White House. Prime Minister David Cameron sought to persuade President Barack Obama to give BP a helping hand amid the colossal cash penalties inflicted by US courts following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (which were far in excess of those imposed on similarly negligent U.S. oil companies). He got nowhere.Kissinger has written, in terms relevant to this day, that the British way of retaining great-power status “was to be so integral a part of American decision-making that the idea of not consulting them seemed a violation of the natural order of things.”It remains the ambition of every British Prime Minister to make our country sufficiently useful to merit consultative status in Washington during international crises, though this becomes more difficult as the focus of US foreign policy shifts toward Asia. The British are unwilling to acknowledge that their armed forces’ lack of mass makes them ever-less-credible fighting partners. The Royal Air Force has fewer front-line planes than a US Marine air wing; the British Army and Royal Navy are likewise shrunken. The principal value of UK support of US foreign warmaking is to provide political cover.Britain’s brilliant ambassador in Washington in the early 1990s, Robin Renwick, has written: “The UK needs to understand the perspective in which it is viewed in Washington. There is a clear recognition that, from every perspective except military, Germany is a far more important force in Europe, and will be still more so post-Brexit.”After Biden’s inauguration, Boris Johnson’s government will face a familiar problem: As the British people display ever less confidence in their Prime Minister, there is no reason for America’s president to feel any more enthusiasm for him.    Nonetheless, a working relationship between the two nations, rooted in common security concerns and ancestry, should remain serviceable to both. Our soldiers are unlikely again to land together on the beaches of Normandy, as they did in 1944. But it will be a sadness, indeed, should we not remain on the same side of history’s barricades through tough decades ahead.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Hastings is a Bloomberg columnist.

06-12-2020||World||Australia’s Victoria eases restrictions for ‘Covid safe’ summer||Australia’s Victoria state eased Covid-19 restrictions on Sunday after the country’s pandemic hotspot recorded 37 days without any new coronavirus infections, moving toward a “Covid-safe” holiday season. From midnight on Sunday, up to 100 people will be able to attend public gatherings such as weddings, with density rules of one person per two square metres remaining in place, while 50% of office workers will be able to return to workplaces by Jan. 11, up from 25% now, the state’s premier said. “Today we can take some big steps, not to normal, but to a Covid-safe summer (but) we all need to remain vigilant and we all need to play our part,” Premier Daniel Andrews told a news conference. Masks will remain mandatory at indoor venues and on public and ride-share transport, he said. Public health concerns eased after two travellers who returned from Germany, bypassing quarantine in Sydney to travel straight to Melbourne, returned negative Covid-19 tests.All passengers on the Saturday afternoon domestic flight between the two cities and some airport staff must remain in self-quarantine until the results from a second test arrive on Monday, a health official said. Australia recorded 7 new cases overnight, all returned travellers. The country has all but stamped out the coronavirus through strict quarantine measures, particularly in Victoria, the second-most populous state, which in early August logged as many as 700 daily infections.This comes as a Reuters tally of global infections rose above 65.58 million people, while more than 1.5 million people have died, and as the United States continues to set single-day records for new infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-victoria-eases-restrictions-for-covid-safe-summer/story-nsB7KwoNnV9phkvl0Y9kON.html
06-12-2020||World||Trump challenges vote results while urging turnout in Georgia||President Donald Trump is pressing his grievances over losing the presidential election, using a weekend rally to spread baseless allegations of misconduct in last month’s voting in Georgia and beyond even as he pushed supporters to turn out for a pair of Republican Senate candidates in a runoff election in January.“Let them steal Georgia again, you’ll never be able to look yourself in the mirror,” Trump told rallygoers.Trump’s 100-minute rally before thousands of largely maskless supporters came not long after he was rebuffed by Georgia’s Republican governor in his astounding call for a special legislative session to give him the state’s electoral votes, even though President-elect Joe Biden won the majority of the vote.The Jan. 5 Senate runoffs in Georgia will determine the balance of power in Washington after Biden takes office. Republicans in the state are worried that Trump is stoking so much suspicion about Georgia elections that voters will think the system is rigged and decide to sit out the two races.The latest futile attempt to subvert the presidential election results continued Trump’s unprecedented campaign to undermine confidence in the democratic process, but overshadowed his stated purpose in traveling to Georgia — boosting Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.Republicans need one victory to maintain their Senate majority. Democrats need a Georgia sweep to force a 50-50 Senate and position Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tiebreaking vote. Party officials had hoped the president would dedicate his energy to imploring supporters to vote in the runoff, when Perdue and Loeffler try to hold off Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively.Trump did echo Republican rhetoric that the races amounted to “the most important congressional runoff, probably in American history.” That is only true because he lost.But after Air Force One landed, it quickly became apparent that Trump was intent on airing his own complaints and stoking baseless doubts about the conduct of last month’s vote, rather than boosting his party.“I want to stay on presidential,” Trumps said minutes into his speech. “But I got to get to these two.” He praised the GOP lawmakers, Perdue for his support for military spending and Loeffler for pushing for early coronavirus relief spending. But he quickly pivoted back to his own defeat.Trump pulled out a piece of paper and read a list of his electoral achievements, including falsely asserting he won Georgia and the White House. Biden carried the state by 12,670 votes and won a record 81 million votes nationally. Trump continued to reiterate his unsubstantiated claims of fraud, despite his own administration assessing the election to have been conducted without any major issues.Chants of “Fight for Trump” drowned out the two senators as they briefly spoke to the crowd.Hours before the event, Trump asked Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in a phone call to order the legislative session; the governor refused, according to a senior government official in Georgia with knowledge of the call who was not authorized to discuss the private conversation and spoke on the condition of anonymity. A person close to the White House who was briefed on the matter verified that account of the call.Kemp, in a tweet, said Trump also asked him to order an audit of signatures on absentee ballot envelopes in his state, a step Kemp is not empowered to take because he has no authority to interfere in the electoral process on Trump’s behalf.Trump, though, vented his frustrations with Kemp on Twitter and at the rally.“Your people are refusing to do what you ask,” he complained in a tweet, as if speaking with Kemp. “What are they hiding? At least immediately ask for a Special Session of the Legislature. That you can easily, and immediately, do.”At the rally, he took aim once again at Kemp, saying he could assure him victory “if he knew what the hell he was doing.”Trump’s personal contact with the governor demonstrated he is intent on amplifying his conspiratorial and debunked theories of electoral fraud even as Georgia Republicans want him to turn his focus to the runoff and encourage their supporters to get out and vote.In his tweet, Kemp said: “As I told the President this morning, I’ve publicly called for a signature audit three times to restore confidence in our election process and to ensure that only legal votes are counted in Georgia.”While the governor does not have the authority to order a signature audit, an audit was initiated by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and it triggered a full hand recount that confirmed Biden’s victory in Georgia. The race has been certified for Biden and affirmed by the state’s Republican election officials as a fairly conducted and counted vote, with none of the systemic errors Trump alleges.But after two pro-Trump lawyers this past week questioned whether voting again is even worth it — in echoes of the president’s baseless accusations of widespread voter fraud — even Vice President Mike Pence betrayed concerns that the Republican coalition could crack under the force of Trump’s grievances.“I know we’ve all got our doubts about the last election, and I hear some of you saying, ‘Just don’t vote,’” Pence said Friday while campaigning with Perdue in Savannah. “If you don’t vote, they win.”Few Republicans in Washington or Georgia believe wide swaths of the electorate in this newfound battleground would opt out of voting because of Trump’s false claims or his denigration of the Georgia governor and secretary of state for certifying Biden’s victory in the state.The risk for the GOP is that it wouldn’t take much of a drop-off to matter if the runoffs are as close as the presidential contest: Biden won Georgia by about 12,500 votes out of 5 million cast. There’s enough noise to explain why Pence felt the need to confront the matter head on after two Trump loyalists floated the idea of the president’s supporters bailing on Perdue and Loeffler.Trump’s false claims have resonated with voters such as Barry Mann, a 61-year-old business owner who came to hear Pence in Savannah. Mann hasn’t decided whether he’ll vote for his senators a second time.“I think there’s some issues with our election and more investigation needs to be done,” Mann said, adding that he doesn’t think Perdue and Loeffler have done enough to support Trump’s efforts to overturn the results. “I want to see what happens between now and January,” Mann said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-challenges-vote-results-while-urging-turnout-in-georgia/story-3sdL6GFwJeC1rMVp8XOdnJ.html
06-12-2020||World||US Covid-19 deaths could surpass 500,000, says IHME||A total of over 500,000 people could die from Covid-19 in the US by early spring despite the release of the coronavirus vaccine, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in Seattle projects.“Even with expected vaccine rollout, the United States is forecast to see 539,000 deaths by April 1...In the US, the expected vaccine rollout only reduces the death toll by April 1 by 9,000 deaths,” Sputnik quoted IHME as saying, at the University of Washington in Seattle projects.The projections show a rapid vaccine rollout is forecast to reduce the Covid-19-related death toll to 528,000 in the US with vaccination targeting high-risk groups, the death toll could be reduced from 548,000 to 524,000.“The forecasts show that if mask-wearing increased to 95 per cent, combined with expected vaccine rollout, approximately 66,000 lives could be saved, compared to a vaccine rollout scenario with current mask-wearing levels remaining the same. Even with a vaccine, if states do not act to bring current surges under control, the death toll could reach 770,000 by April 1,” according to IHME.The steady decline in Covid-19 infection rates around the world are expected to start in February and continue into March and subsequent months, IHME stated further.Earlier this week, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) committee voted to give healthcare workers and nursing home residents the first of the Covid-19 vaccines once the doses are rolled out, within three weeks.US President Donald Trump said at the Saturday rally in Valdosta, Georgia that coronavirus vaccines will be made available in the US next week, Sputnik reported.The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US has surpassed 14.5 million. More than 281,000 people have died from the coronavirus infection in the US, which has the highest Covid-19 death toll and the largest number of confirmed cases of all the countries in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-deaths-could-surpass-500-000-says-ihme/story-XSkVir4aPeXreLwn0FX5LN.html

06-12-2020||World||South Korea clamps down as virus cases surge to nine-month high||South Korea imposed stricter social-distancing measures, including a ban on gatherings at high-risk venues such as karaoke bars, as the Asian nation that was lauded for its initial coronavirus containment strategy faces one of its worst resurgences.The social-distancing alert for the greater Seoul area was raised to 2.5 from 2, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Sunday. All gatherings of more than 50 people will be banned, and restaurants will continue to be prohibited from serving customers after 9 p.m. and can do only takeouts and deliveries. In addition, no spectators will be allowed into sporting events.“The situation in the greater Seoul area is serious,” Chung said at a Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures meeting in Seoul City Hall. “The 2.5 level will be maintained for the next three weeks until the end of the year.”South Korea confirmed 631 cases on Sunday, the highest in nine months, while total deaths rose by five to 545, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The greater Seoul area -- which covers the capital, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province -- is home to almost half of South Korea’s population, and Chung acknowledged the disruption that the latest move would cause.‘Psychological Stress’“The measure would bring both economic and psychological stress to small business owners,“ the prime minister said. “But we must curb the infection numbers now, if we want to have our ordinary lives back as early as possible.”The uptick in cases comes after the social-distancing level greater Seoul was raised to 2 from 1.5 just two weeks ago, limiting restaurant hours and gatherings. In a meeting last Sunday, Chung announced additional restrictions on top of the level 2 measures, including a halt on some businesses.The Seoul municipal government also imposed a de facto curfew for two weeks from Dec. 5, shuttering most shops at 9 p.m. and cutting back public transportation operations by 30%.The central government will discuss whether to add more measures after monitoring the current spread of the virus. A shift to level 3 would result in a suspension on gatherings of more than 10 and all sporting events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-clamps-down-as-virus-cases-surge-to-nine-month-high/story-Xy8JaFdQYMuFOfCfThS08K.html
06-12-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine update: Pfizer seeks emergency use nod in India, UK rolls out inoculation plan||After getting the nod for emergency use in the UK and Bahrain, Pfizer Inc has applied for emergency use authorisation in India. The United Kingdom is getting ready for emergency rollouts of the Pfizer vaccine and is now in the final stages of planning before the vaccination drive starts on December 14. Elsewhere in China, a million people have already been vaccinated as the country soldiers on with its vaccination drive.Experts all over the world have begun to question China’s hurry in vaccinating its citizens when it claims to have contained Covid-19’s viral spread within its borders.Here’s an update on what has been happening on the vaccine front:1. Pfizer has sought emergency use authorisation for its vaccine from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) said PTI. In its application the firm has also asked for a waiver on clinical trials in India. Five other vaccines are currently in advanced phases of clinical trials in India. The Pfizer vaccine’s one major drawback is that it has to be stored at minus 70 degree Celsius, a temperature which most Indian cold storages cannot reach.2. The UK will soon become the first western country to deploy a Covid-19 vaccine after regulators approved the Pfizer-BioNTech shot on Wednesday, according to Reuters. It plans to begin inoculations during the week of December 14. The government has bought 40 million doses, enough to inoculate 20 million people on the two-dose regimen. Following stringent quality checks, the vaccine will be first distributed to 50 hospital hubs around the country, followed by doctor-run vaccination centres. The shots will be administered in order of priority, with the first vaccines going to those in care homes, including healthcare workers, and people over 80 years old. NHS England has announced that vaccines are scheduled to arrive at hospitals Monday with the first vaccinations starting Tuesday. Once the vaccine becomes more widely available, smaller sites like local pharmacies will also be involved in administering the doses. 3. Provincial governments all across China have started placing orders for the experimental, indigenous vaccine. More than 1 million people have already been vaccinated after the provincial governments approved the experimental vaccine for emergency use, reported the Associated Press. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be kept frozen, the Chinese ones can be stored in temperatures as low as 2 to 8 degree Celsius.4. As India starts to roll out inoculation drives all over the country, Uttarakhand’s topography presents a challenge. The Uttarakhand Drone Application and Research Centre (DARC) under Information Technology Development Agency (ITDA) is preparing to deploy drones for the supply of vaccine doses in remote areas. Amit Sinha, inspector general of Uttarakhand police and director of ITDA, has said that one such drone has been used for a test run, and it has flown from Dehradun to Mussoorie and successfully delivered a generic vaccine in an icebox. ITDA at present has about 12 drones including Quadcopters and fixed-wing vehicles.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-pfizer-seeks-emergency-use-nod-in-india-uk-rolls-out-inoculation-plan/story-9J8ivhCf444WYrKTmmNv6L.html
06-12-2020||World||Chinese court tells Dutch collector to return Buddha statue||A Chinese court has ordered a Dutch art collector to hand over a Buddha statue in the latest twist in a 3-year-old legal battle with villagers who say it was stolen from a temple.Residents of Yangchun, a village in the southeastern province of Fujian, say the statue is a 1,000-year-old relic that holds the mummified remains of a monk and disappeared in 1995. The collector says he bought the object in Hong Kong in 1996 but denied it was the stolen statue.The ruling Communist Party is stepping up efforts to retrieve Chinese art and artifacts that are believed to be stolen and in foreign hands.The Sanming Intermediate People’s Court on Friday ordered the collector, Oscar van Overeem, to return the statue within 30 days, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.Two committees representing villagers sued in a Dutch court in 2017, but judges ruled the following year they didn’t count as legal entities that could make a claim.Friday’s ruling found the temple and its relics were collectively owned by the villages of Yangchun and Dongpu, giving residents the right as a group to demand the statue’s return, according to Xinhua.The villagers say the missing statue contains the remains of Zhang Gong Zhushi, or Patriarch Zhang Gong, who became famous for helping to treat diseases during the Song Dynasty.Villagers say they traced the missing statue to the Dutch collector after it appeared in an exhibition in Hungary in 2015, according to Xinhua.After negotiations with the collector broke down, they filed suit, citing Dutch law that prohibits ownership of a body of a person whose identity is known.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-tells-dutch-collector-to-return-buddha-statue/story-1vbFIKcMyvTV5bHfIJ0bWM.html

This is a message about multi-lateral partnerships and the freedom of passage.”China has said its intentions in the region are peaceful.But Japan has grown particularly concerned about a rise in Chinese naval activity around the disputed islands in the East China Sea that Tokyo calls the Senkaku, while Beijing refers to them the Diaoyu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-france-us-plan-their-first-joint-military-drills-in-may/story-ht1Ghp6WltYwtDVKW11HKJ.html
06-12-2020||World||Why French protests pivoted to police power and abuse||Thousands of people have taken to French streets over the past three years to express anger over rising social and economic inequalities. The outrage is now centered on tougher new security laws and police abuses. Large demonstrations were held in major cities across the country at the end of November.1. What triggered the most recent protests?An article in a draft security bill would ban posting or broadcasting videos or photos of police with intent to cause them “physical or psychological harm.” Violators could face up to a year in prison. Critics say that provision, known as Article 24, would inhibit the publication of images by journalists and citizens, removing a key tool in holding police to account and exposing abuses. Jean-Louis Debre, ex-president of the Constitutional Council, called Article 24 “absurd” considering that legislative tools already exist to fight against the propagation of hatred online. Adding fuel to the protests was the release of footage showing police officers beating a Black music producer at the entrance of his Paris studio.2. How did the government respond?Three police officers were charged on November 30, with two of them placed in custody while the investigation continues. In a Facebook and Twitter statement, President Emmanuel Macron said the videos brought “shame on us” and condemned violence both by and against the police. Then the parliament majority announced it would completely rewrite Article 24. The government plans a “major survey” in January to gauge racism and discrimination in French society. It also plans a national platform to report incidences of discrimination.3. What’s the point of the legislation?The number of officers wounded on duty and targeted by violence has doubled over the past 15 years; in recent protests alone, 98 officers were injured, according to the government. It wants to do more to protect them. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin often cites the 2016 fatal stabbing of a police officer and his partner in front of their toddler by a jihadist as an example of the dangers faced by law enforcers. Macron is also renewing his focus on law-and-order as he reaches out to traditional conservative voters ahead of presidential elections in 2022. It was a group of lawmakers within Macron’s own party that pushed for the legislation, but during the first reading in parliament, 10 deputies from the president’s party voted against it and 30 abstained. The bill still passed by a large majority.4. What happens now?Macron’s government has tried to hold the line in the face of criticism from civil society and protesters. Authorities acknowledge shortcomings, but insist systemic violence doesn’t exist within the police force. Other provisions in the draft security legislation that have caused alarm would expand the powers of the police by giving them access to security cameras and grants them the right to deploy drones equipped with facial recognition technology to monitor public demonstrations. Opponents say that the freedom of assembly and data privacy is at risk. Another piece of legislation, the so-called separatism law, aims to fight organizations and individuals that threaten the unity and secular values of the French Republic. But groups like Human Rights Watch have expressed concern that actions the government says are intended to counter radical Islam could fuel Islamophobia.5. Have protests increased under Macron?According to the Ministry of the Interior, protests under Macron haven’t attracted as many people as under other presidents. Macron swept to power in May 2017 with a promise to radically reshape the country. That was bound to cause upset in a nation where citizens are known for taking to the streets to express their anger. After Macron took office, one of the largest trade unions demonstrated against his planned overhaul of labour laws. The following year brought the Yellow Vest protests triggered by a planned tax rise on fuel. Protests at times turned violent. In December 2019, strikes and protests brought Paris to a standstill as Macron sought to push through his pension reform. Some rallies demanding racial justice followed the killing of American George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-french-protests-pivoted-to-police-power-and-abuse/story-Tcokog9K759oYEJjMTwSUK.html
06-12-2020||World||Covid-19 could push number of people living in extreme poverty to over 1 billion by 2030: UN||An additional 207 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 due to the severe long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic, bringing the total number of the world’s extremely poor to more than a billion, a new study from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has found. The study assesses the impact of different Covid-19 recovery scenarios on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), evaluating the multidimensional effects of the pandemic over the next decade. The study is part of a long-standing partnership between the UNDP and the Pardee Center for International Futures at the University of Denver. “Severe long-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic could push an additional 207 million people into extreme poverty on top of the current pandemic trajectory, bringing the total to over 1 billion by 2030,” noted the study. The ‘Baseline COVID’ scenario, based on current mortality rates and the most recent growth projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), would result in 44 million more people living in extreme poverty by 2030 compared to the development trajectory the world was on before the pandemic. Under a ‘High Damage’ scenario, where the recovery is protracted, Covid-19 is likely to push an additional 207 million people into extreme poverty by 2030, and increase the female poverty headcount by an additional 102 million compared to that baseline, says the report. The ‘High Damage’ scenario anticipates that 80 per cent of the Covid-induced economic crisis would persist in 10 years’ time due to loss in productivity, preventing a full recovery to the growth trajectory seen before the pandemic. However, the study also finds that a focused set of SDG investments over the next decade in social protection/welfare programmes, governance, digitalisation, and a green economy could not only prevent the rise of extreme poverty, but actually exceed the development trajectory the world was on before the pandemic. “This ambitious, yet feasible ‘SDG Push’ scenario would lift an additional 146 million people out of extreme poverty, narrow the gender poverty gap, and reduce the female poverty headcount by 74 million, even taking into account the current impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic,” UNDP said. UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said as this new poverty research highlights, the Covid-19 pandemic is a tipping point, and the choices leaders take now could take the world in very different directions. “We have an opportunity to invest in a decade of action that not only helps people to recover from Covid-19, but that re-sets the development path of people and planet towards a more fair, resilient and green future,” he said. The concerted SDG interventions suggested by the study combine behavioural changes through nudges for both governments and citizens, such as improved effectiveness and efficiency in governance and changes in consumption patterns of food, energy and water. The proposed interventions also focus on global collaboration for climate action, additional investments in Covid-19 recovery, and the need for improved broadband access and technology innovation, UNDP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-push-number-of-people-living-in-extreme-poverty-to-over-1-billion-by-2030-un/story-lvdk2haxDPuf1w7954Fk0H.html
06-12-2020||World||China prepares large-scale rollout of Covid-19 vaccines||Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country’s 1.4 billion people.Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said Thursday during a U.N. meeting, as Britain issued approval for emergency use of Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine candidate and providers scrambled to set up distribution.China’s fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there. However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries.One developer, China National Pharmaceutical Group, known as Sinopharm, said in November it applied for final market approval for use of its vaccine in China. Others have been approved for emergency use on health workers and other people deemed at high risk of infection.“We must be prepared for large-scale production,” said Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, who has overseen much of the country’s response, during a visit Wednesday to developers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.Sun visited one of Sinopharm’s Beijing subsidiary companies; another producer, Sinovac, and a research lab under the National Medical Products Administration, a regulatory agency that approves medical products for public use.The government has yet to say how many people it plans to vaccinate. Sun said plans call for vaccinating border personnel and other high-risk populations this month.The companies are using more traditional techniques than Western developers.They say unlike Pfizer’s vaccine, which must be kept frozen at temperatures as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), theirs can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46F). The Chinese producers have yet to say how they might be distributed.More than 1 million people in China have received experimental vaccines under emergency use approval. Health experts question why China is using them on such a vast scale now that the outbreak is largely under control within its borders.Health officials previously said China will be able to manufacture 610 million doses by the end of this year and ramp up to 1 billion doses next year.The government of Jiangsu province, where the major city of Nanjing is located, issued a procurement notice for vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm on Wednesday for emergency use vaccinations.Click here for complete coverage of coronavirus pandemicAuthorities in Sichuan province in the west, which has about 85 million people, announced Monday they were already buying vaccines. An official newspaper in Anhui province, southeast of Beijing, said a local residential committee issued a notice asking whether residents want a vaccine.The Sichuan and Anhui announcements said the vaccine, given in two shots, would cost a total of 400 yuan ($60).Vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm were approved for emergency use in July.In October, Zhejiang province south of Shanghai offered the public vaccination under emergency use authorization. It said people considered high-risk would get priority.In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people had received its vaccine.In September, Sinovac’s CEO said about 3,000 of its employees had taken their vaccine. He said the company provided tens of thousands of doses to the Beijing city government.Developers have yet to disclose how effective their vaccines are and possible side effects.Sinopharm has clinical trials under way in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina with nearly 60,000 volunteers. It has built two facilities in China capable of producing 200 million doses per year.Sinovac has trials in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. Its most recent publicized data, a study in the science journal the Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who had recovered from COVID-19. The company projects it will be able to produce a few hundred million doses of the vaccine by February or March of next year.Another producer, CanSino, is testing in Russia, Pakistan and Mexico and pursuing partnerships in Latin American countries. Its vaccine, which has been used on an emergency basis with the Chinese military, uses a harmless adenovirus to carry genes into human cells to generate an immune response.A fourth company, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biologic Pharmacy Co., is conducting final stage trials across China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-prepares-large-scale-rollout-of-covid-19-vaccines/story-LcsfnLuMuylehFE3h3kBWP.html

That team includes Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp and Draper.Blue Origin has vied for lucrative government contracts in recent years and is competing with rival billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Dynetics, owned by Leidos Holdings Inc, to win a contract to build NASA’s next human lunar landing system to ferry humans to the moon in the next decade.In April, NASA awarded a lunar lander development contract to Blue Origin’s team worth $579 million, as well as two other companies: SpaceX which received $135 million to help develop its Starship system and Leidos-owned Dynetics which won $253 million.NASA is poised to pick two of the three companies “in early March” 2021 to continue building their lander prototypes for crewed missions to the moon beginning in 2024, an agency spokeswoman has said.But slim funds for the landing systems made available to NASA by Congress, as well as uncertainty over the incoming Biden administration’s views on space exploration, have threatened to delay NASA’s decision to advance the lunar lander contracts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-says-blue-origin-will-take-the-first-woman-to-moon-s-surface/story-PCobpNWkdQ7zRyA8ls1pTO.html

The other two suspects are private citizens, Firli said.Juliari was being questioned at KPK headquarters and will be taken into custody, said KPK spokesman Ali Fikri. The Social Affairs Ministry was not immediately available for comment.Some of the suspects were arrested in a sting operation in Jakarta on Saturday, where KPK found the cash, Firli said.“The money was stored in seven suitcases, three backpacks, and in envelopes, amounting to around 14.5 billion rupiah,” or$1.03 million, he said. The online briefing displayed suitcases containing cash.Last month, KPK named Maritime and Fisheries Minister Edhy Prabowo as a suspect in a separate corruption case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/julian-batubara-indonesia-s-social-minister-named-suspect-after-bribery-raid/story-lx8RjEuDRSb0T0RyZxmTCO.html

The vaccine, created by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, has arrived at secure locations in Britain from Belgium, the department of health and social care said on Sunday.Britain will become the first western country to deploy a Covid-19 vaccine after regulators approved the Pfizer-BioNTech shot on Wednesday.Here’s how the UK is preparing for the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine:1. Following quality checks to ensure the vaccines have been kept at the correct temperature, the shots will be made available to 50 hospital hubs around the country, before being distributed to doctor-run vaccination centres that will administer them.2. The government has bought 40 million doses from the companies, enough to inoculate 20 million people on the two-dose regimen. The shots will be given in order of priority, with the first vaccines going to those in care homes, including frontline workers and people over 80 years of age.3. Vaccines are planned to arrive at hospitals on Monday with the first vaccinations starting Tuesday, according to a separate release from NHS England, with patients aged 80 and over who are already in hospital or attending appointments there among the first to receive the jab, the NHS said. Any appointments not used for the first priority groups will be given to healthcare workers at high risk of serious illness from Covid-19.4. When more of the vaccine becomes available, smaller sites like local pharmacies will also be involved in administering the vaccines, the government has said.5. About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week in the country with a population of 67 million.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-hospital-hubs-to-doctor-run-centres-uk-s-plan-for-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out/story-Dl59kGsQic6yVwZJ0HRjTM.html

Biden also talked about what his father said his expectations were from a government.“My dad used to say, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems. But I expect it to understand my problems.” Folks out there aren’t looking for a handout — they just need help. They’re in trouble through no fault of their own, and they need us to understand,” he tweeted.“I know times are tough, the challenges are daunting, but I know we can do this. We can create an economic recovery for all. We can move from crisis to recovery to resurgence. This is the United States of America. We’ve done it before — and we will do it again,” he also wrote on Twitter.His remarks came a day after he said that the November US jobs report was grim and there was a need for urgent action on coronavirus relief. “This is a grim jobs report. It shows an economy that is stalling,” he said, adding he was “encouraged” by bipartisan Senate efforts on a $900 billion relief package. “Congress and President Trump must get a deal done for the American people. But any package passed in the lame-duck session is not enough. ... Congress will need to act again in January,” Biden was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.As on Friday, a new daily high of nearly 228,000 additional confirmed Covid-19 cases was reported in the US in the holiday season, eclipsing the previous high mark of 217,000 cases set the day before, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Much of the nation saw surging numbers in the week after Thanksgiving when millions of Americans ignored warnings to stay home and celebrate only with members of their household.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/understand-problems-joe-biden-recalls-father-s-words-on-government/story-5LWPoGN4MUT8uuS7COoSmN.html

06-12-2020||World||Last-ditch push to Brexit deal starts with recriminations flying||UK and European Union negotiators will resume trade talks on Sunday as both sides strive to patch up serious last-minute differences that are threatening to derail a deal.Officials said the next 48 hours will be crucial after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke by telephone on Saturday and agreed to restart the deadlocked talks.The discussions had broken down the previous day with the British side accusing their EU counterparts of putting fresh demands on the table at the last minute. Johnson and von der Leyen agreed to talk again on Monday night after acknowledging that “significant differences” remain.Amid the pessimistic noises from both sides, a British official said the resumption of negotiations in Brussels marks the last throw of the dice.Originally, the two sides had sought to reach an accord by Oct. 15, but the negotiations have gone right to the wire. Britain is due to leave the European single market and customs union at the end of this month. With the U.K. and EU both needing time to get parliamentary approval for any deal, one needs to be reached weeks before then to be ready by that deadline.Cabinet SupportOfficials on both sides said next week is realistically the last chance to get a deal. According to the Sunday Times, Johnson has the backing of his cabinet if he opts to walk away. Thirteen ministers, including eight who opposed Brexit, will support no-deal if Johnson thinks it necessary, the report said.Although the EU has said it will never be the one to walk away from the negotiations, it sees Thursday’s summit of the bloc’s 27 leaders, where they would be asked to sign off on any deal, as a natural end point. Negotiators are striving to reach a deal on Monday, or Tuesday at the latest, one official said.“Significant differences remain on three critical issues,” Johnson and von der Leyen said in a joint statement after their call, which lasted about an hour. These are the level playing field for businesses, fisheries, and the governance of any agreement -- disagreements that have dogged the talks since they started in March.“Both sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved,” according to the joint statement.Without an accord, businesses and consumers will be left facing the cost and disruption of tariffs and quotas, while relations between the UK and EU could be poisoned for a generation.Blame GameA small team of British negotiators will travel to Brussels on Sunday morning and work to see if they can bridge the final gaps, a UK official said. There is barely any time left and the process may conclude without a deal, the official added.The UK blamed France for hardening the EU’s position. On Friday, the country’s European affairs minister, Clement Beaune, said his government will veto any deal if it isn’t in its national interest. On Saturday, Beaune told the Journal du Dimanche weekly newspaper that the negotiations were a “test of sovereignty” for the EU and the UK’s demands over fisheries are “unjustifiable.”One person familiar with the EU side of the discussions said several member states were now lining up behind France to block a deal if too many concessions are made.The UK has blamed the EU for making new demands -- including on so-called ratchet clauses that would bind Britain to EU labor and environmental standards as they evolve over time, and a review of any agreement on fishing after 10 years, according to a person familiar with the British position. An EU official denied that the proposals were new.For its part, the UK has offered to delay any changes to the EU’s share of the fishing catch for three years, according to a person familiar with the EU side. This is unacceptable to the bloc, the person said.The talks are also stuck on how the UK’s state-aid rules would be regulated, as well as on how any agreement would be enforced. The EU wants to be able to punish any breaches of the deal by the UK with retaliation in other areas -- something Britain has so far rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/last-ditch-push-to-brexit-deal-starts-with-recriminations-flying/story-3mcL2Vw18hLu25Ul0MoXtL.html
06-12-2020||World||Covid-19 cases continue climbing in US during holiday season||Coronavirus infections across the US continue to rise as the country moves deeper into a holiday season when eagerly anticipated gatherings of family and friends could push the numbers even higher and overwhelm hospitals.Vast swaths of southern and inland California imposed new restrictions on businesses and activities Saturday as hospitals in the nation’s most populous state face a dire shortage of beds. Restaurants must stop on-site dining and theaters, hair salons and many other businesses must close in the sprawling reaches of San Diego and Los Angeles, along with part of the Central Valley, including Fresno.Five counties in the San Francisco Bay Area were set to impose their own lockdowns Sunday.A new daily high of nearly 228,000 additional confirmed Covid-19 cases was reported nationwide Friday, eclipsing the previous high mark of 217,000 cases set the day before, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.The seven-day rolling average of deaths attributable to Covid-19 in the US passed 2,000 for the first time since spring, rising to 2,011. Two weeks ago, the seven-day average was 1,448. There were 2,607 deaths reported in the US on Friday.Johns Hopkins had previously reported Wednesday daily Covid-19 deaths at 3,157. That was later updated to 2,804 due to a change in numbers from Nevada, a spokeswoman said Saturday.Much of the nation saw surging numbers in the week after Thanksgiving, when millions of Americans disregarded warnings to stay home and celebrate only with members of their household. Many in California anticipated tight restrictions on businesses and activities, sending people scrambling to shop or get haircuts while they still could.Arizona’s top public health official took on a blunt tone as she reported the state’s latest case numbers, a near-record of nearly 6,800 new infections, telling people to wear masks around anyone outside their household, “even those you know and trust.”“We must act as though anyone we are around may be infected,” Dr. Cara Christ, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services, wrote on Twitter. Arizona’s intensive-care units are experiencing caseloads not seen since the summer, when the state had one of the worst outbreaks in the world. Just 8% of ICU beds and 10% of all inpatient beds were unoccupied Friday, according to state data.Hospital officials issued bleak warnings about the potential for severe overcrowding, fearing that Thanksgiving gatherings seeded new outbreaks that are not yet showing in daily case counts. It takes several days after someone is exposed to develop symptoms, and several more to get test results. Eventually, more severe cases will require hospitalization.“In less than a week, we went from exceeding 5,000 new cases reported in one day to exceeding 6,000,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, North Carolina’s health secretary. “This is very worrisome.”In St. Louis, two children’s hospitals opened their doors to adult patients without Covid-19 as medical centers in the region fill up, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Mayor Lyda Krewson said the city has reopened a temporary morgue. Area hospitals are at about 82% capacity for in-patient beds and 81% capacity for ICU beds.In Idaho, the National Guard helped direct people and traffic at a Boise urgent care and family practice clinic converted to a facility for people with coronavirus symptoms. Health officials say Idaho’s attempt to hold the coronavirus in check is failing.Hospitals are struggling not only with the increase in patients but with their own staff as health workers contract Covid-19 themselves or quit under the pressure of caring for so many infectious patients.“We continue to be concerned about the potential implications of the travel we have seen in the past week with Thanksgiving, as well as social gathering related to the holidays,” said Dr. Adnan Munkarah, executive vice president and chief clinical officer for Henry Ford Health System in Detroit.The health system currently has 576 employees out because they have tested positive, have pending tests or are quarantined because of close contact, up from 378 a week ago, Munkarah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-continue-climbing-in-us-during-holiday-season/story-vGQinGpAc4x1A4GnX4TKIK.html
06-12-2020||World||Britain’s Queen Elizabeth to get Covid-19 vaccine ‘in weeks’: Reports||Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II will receive the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine within weeks, after UK regulators granted emergency approval and the world’s first roll-out begins next week, reports late Saturday said.The monarch, 94, and her 99-year-old husband Prince Philip are in line to get the jab early due to their age and will not receive preferential treatment, the Mail on Sunday reported.The newspaper said Britain’s most senior royals would reveal they have been given the inoculation “to encourage more people to take up the vital jab”, amid fears so-called anti-vaxxers could dent enthusiasm for it.Britain on Wednesday gave emergency approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, with health officials set to use criteria based on age and vulnerability to decide the order of people to receive it.Elderly care home residents and their carers will be the very first to get inoculated, followed by those aged 80 and over and frontline health and care staff.Other elderly people and the clinically extremely vulnerable will be next, with the rest of the population then prioritised by age.Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Daily Mirror also reported a string of high-profile figures in Britain had committed publicly to getting the vaccine in a bid to boost take-up.They include Monty Python star Michael Palin and Bob Geldof, the tabloid said.Britain has pre-ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine in total, and is set to receive an initial batch of 800,000 to begin next week’s rollout.Regulators were forced to defend their world-first approval on Wednesday of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, insisting it met all safety standards after US and European officials queried the rapid process.Meanwhile, plans are reportedly being stepped up to ensure any complications arising from the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31 do not impact its roll-out.The vaccine will be manufactured at Pfizer’s plant in Puurs, Belgium, and needs to be transported in temperature-controlled thermal shippers that use dry ice.The Observer reported late Saturday that ministers have drawn up contingency plans to fly millions of doses into Britain on military aircraft in the event of Brexit-related disruption at UK ports.“We will do this if necessary,” a health department spokesperson told the newspaper.Talks to finalise a UK-EU free trade deal and avoid potential chaos in January are currently gridlocked, with just days left to seal an agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-s-queen-elizabeth-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-in-weeks-reports/story-fv1Ieg2ok15mJGSnKA6LKO.html
06-12-2020||World||Britain gets ready for roll-out of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine this week||Britain is preparing to become the first country to roll out the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine this week, initially making the shot available at hospitals before distributing stocks to doctors’ clinics, the government said on Sunday.The first doses are set to be administered on Tuesday, with the National Health Service (NHS) giving top priority to vaccinating the over-80s, frontline healthcare workers and care home staff and residents.Britain gave emergency use approval for the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech last week - jumping ahead in the global race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history.In total, Britain has ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million.About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week.Initial doses that have arrived from Belgium are being stored in secure locations across the country, where they will be quality checked, the health ministry said.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has onerous storage requirements. It needs to be kept at -70C (-94F) and only lasts five days in a regular fridge.For that reason, the health ministry said the vaccine would first be administered in 50 hospitals. It said it would take a few hours to defrost each vaccine and prepare it for use.NHS England has written to general practitioners, telling them to get ready to start giving vaccinations through local doctors’ services from Dec. 14.Rather than run clinics in individual surgeries, groups of local doctors will operate more than 1,000 vaccination centres across the country, the government said.Boxes of the vaccine contain five packs of 975 doses, but special regulatory approval is needed to split them up. A senior medical official has said that while he was hopeful it would be possible to split the packs and deliver straight to care homes, it was not guaranteed.Britain is among the first nations to roll out vaccinations outside the context of a clinic trial, raising hopes that the tide could soon turn against a virus that has killed nearly 1.5 million people globally and hammered the world economy.Russia began distributing its Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine through 70 clinics in Moscow on Saturday, although the shot has not finished its final trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-gets-ready-for-roll-out-of-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-this-week/story-DnKX1A5svBebhPbiluYIrK.html

If the situation continues, at some point we may encounter an explosive outbreak in the near future,” said Dr Albert Au, from the centre’s communicable disease branch, at a regular Covid-19 press briefing.South China Morning Post reported that Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee ordered all taxi drivers who intended to work between December 25 and January 23 next year to get tested by December 22.The Hospital Authority, meanwhile, urged residents to be patient and cooperate with medical professionals at health facilities, following an incident at St John Hospital in Cheung Chau on Thursday, where a resident had poured deep throat saliva samples on a desk in a nurse’s room after being told the deposit time for the day was over.The latest figures pushed the city’s Covid-19 tally to 6,802, with 112 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-health-experts-warn-of-explosive-covid-19-outbreak-as-city-records-101-infections/story-3Zs6BktN5u6ARgr5IDtJnN.html

No agreement feasible if these are not resolved. Chief negotiators will reconvene tomorrow. We will speak again on Monday,” von der Leyen said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asked their Brexit negotiators to resume talks but cautioned no deal was possible unless key issues were resolved.“Significant differences remain on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries,” Johnson and von der Leyen said in a joint statement. “Both sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved.”“Whilst recognising the seriousness of these differences, we agreed that a further effort should be undertaken by our negotiating teams to assess whether they can be resolved,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-chief-says-trade-talks-with-britain-to-resume-sunday/story-zJFSVKwnvdpMIgd8MrBjJN.html

In last months’ virtual meeting, Canada’s foreign minister François-Philippe Champagne had commented on the “critical role” that India is playing with regard to the requirements globally for medicines needed to combat the pandemic.In its statement, the CIF lauded the farm laws, saying, “India enacted significant reforms to its agricultural sector through a series of bills recently. The need to reform agriculture in India and to bring it par with modern standards was never controversial.”It also welcomed “the Indian government’s willingness to listen to the concerns of the farmers. In a democracy, peaceful negotiations are the only way to resolve differences”.Trudeau’s remarks during a Facebook live event to celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak was followed up within hours with him delivering a recorded message to the annual convention of the Indo-Canadian business chamber. He extolled the economic ties between the two countries in that message and its potential. However, an Indian official pointed out, with political ties now flat-lining, economic engagement between the two governments will suffer as a result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-justin-trudeau-softens-stand-but-india-canada-bilateral-ties-have-already-taken-a-blow/story-N1Itc2oZ3HXM51NagoswRN.html
06-12-2020||World||Tens of thousands rally in Armenia demanding PM’s resignation||Tens of thousands of opposition supporters marched across the Armenian capital Saturday to push for the resignation of the ex-Soviet nation’s prime minister over his handling of the conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.In six weeks of fierce fighting that ended with a Russia-brokered peace deal on Nov. 10, the Azerbaijani army reclaimed lands that Armenian forces have held for more than a quarter-century.Armenia’s opposition parties warned Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan there would be civil disobedience across the country if he does not resign by noon on Tuesday. Pashinyan has refused to step down, defending the peace agreement as a painful but necessary move that prevented Azerbaijan from overrunning the entire Nagorno-Karabakh region.More than 20,000 protesters rallied in Yerevan on Saturday, chanting “Nikol ,you traitor!” and “Nikol, go away!” and then marched to the prime minister’s official residence.“The seat of the prime minister of Armenia is currently being occupied by a political corpse,” Artur Vanetsyan, the leader of the opposition party Homeland and the former head of the National Security Service, said at the protest rally.Several priests of the Armenian Apostolic Church joined the protest, denouncing Pashinyan for allowing Azerbaijan to take over some holy sites.Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That conflict left not only Nagorno-Karabakh itself but large chunks of surrounding lands in Armenian hands.In 44 days of fighting that began on Sept. 27, Azerbaijan troops routed the Armenian forces and wedged deep into Nagorno-Karabakh, forcing Armenia to accept the Nov. 10 peace deal that saw the return to Azerbaijan of a significant part of the separatist region. It also obliged Armenia to hand over all of the areas it held outside Nagorno-Karabakh.Azerbaijan completed reclaiming those territories on Tuesday when it took over the Lachin region located between the Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia.Armenian opposition leaders hold Pashinyan responsible for failing to negotiate an earlier end to the hostilities at terms that could have been more beneficial for Armenia. They have emphasized, however, that the opposition wasn’t pushing for the annulment of the peace deal.Veteran politician Vazgen Manukyan, whom 17 opposition parties have nominated as their candidate for prime minister, said at Saturday’s rally that his transition government would seek to renegotiate some vague aspects of the Nov. 10 peace deal.Manukyan, 71, served as prime minister in 1990-91, when Armenia was part of the Soviet Union and later served as defense minister during the separatist war.Armenia’s Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 2,718 Armenian servicemen were killed in the latest fighting. At least 55 Armenian civilians also were killed.Azerbaijan said this week that 2,783 troops of its were killed and more than 100 were still missing. The government said 94 of its civilians also were killed and more than 400 were wounded.Azerbaijan celebrated the end of fighting as a national triumph, and President Ilham Aliyev established a new Nov. 8 national holiday called Victory Day to commemorate the event.Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry said it will conduct a military parade next Thursday involving 3,000 troops and 150 military vehicles. It said the show will also feature trophy weapons seized from the Armenian forces.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is scheduled to visit Azerbaijan that day. Turkey has strongly backed its ally and used the hostilities to expand its clout in the region. Earlier this week, Russian and Turkish military officials signed documents to set up a joint monitoring center to ensure the fulfillment of the peace deal.Russia deployed nearly 2,000 peacekeepers for at least five years to monitor the peace deal and to facilitate the return of refugees. The Russian troops will also ensure safe transit between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia across the Lachin region.___Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow and Aida Sultanova in London contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tens-of-thousands-rally-in-armenia-demanding-pms-resignation/story-X3VLbF46TVpGWk2j7H8oxJ.html
06-12-2020||World||Pope Francis updates Vatican financial authority following scandals||Pope Francis has revamped the Holy See’s financial intelligence and anti-money-laundering unit following financial scandals, including an ongoing in-house corruption probe, Vatican officials said Saturday.The changes involve the governance and organization of the Vatican’s financial watchdog agency, which has been renamed the Supervisory and Financial Information Authority, or ASIF, the Vatican said. Until Saturday, the agency was known as AIF, or Financial Information Authority.The revamped authority’s president, Carmelo Barbagallo, a former Italian central bank official, said the changes ordered by Francis in the form of a new statute would strengthen the entity’s financial supervisory responsibilities.Earlier this year, Barbagallo indicated he was pressing for supervisory authority that the pontiff signed off on Saturday.Francis is intent on bringing greater accountability and transparency to the Vatican, building on efforts forged by his predecessor, Benedict XVI.ASIF’s activities are being divided into three units: vigilance, rules and legal affairs, and financial information.Its functions include “supervision aimed at the prevention and countering of money laundering and the financing of terrorism,” according to the new statute.In signing off on the statute, Francis cited the Holy See’s “progressive implementations of supervisory offices regarding anti-laundering, combating terrorism and the proliferation of the arms of mass destruction.”Financial scandals have dogged the Vatican for decades.One of the latest centers on a London real estate deal involving a $350 million investment by the Vatican secretariat of state. Vatican investigators are looking into the case.ASIF’s predecessor agency was raided last year by Vatican police who seized confidential documentation as part of an investigation by Holy See prosecutors into the 2012 investment in a swank London residential building. Much of the money the Vatican poured into the investment came from donations from Catholic faithful.When raided, the agency was conducting its own investigation of the deal, trying to discover who might have benefited from it. The sensational raid effectively torpedoed the agency’s own probe and led to the removal of its top two managers. Barbagallo was appointed a few weeks later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-updates-vatican-financial-authority-following-scandals/story-3nnaswpC4XdGYfagC7IToK.html
06-12-2020||World||UK records another 15,539 coronavirus cases, 397 deaths||Another 15,539 people in Britain have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of coronavirus cases in the country to 1,705,971, according to the official figures released Saturday.The coronavirus-related deaths in Britain rose by 397 to 61,014, the data showed.The figures came as Britain’s chief medical officers warned Saturday that the coming winter would be “especially hard” for the health service due to coronavirus despite hopes brought by vaccines.“Although the very welcome news about vaccines means that we can look forward to 2021 with greater optimism, vaccine deployment will have only a marginal impact in reducing numbers coming into the health service with Covid over the next three months,” the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said in a letter to colleagues.The experts urged the public to show restraint and self-discipline, especially in the run-up to Christmas.“The actions and self-discipline of the whole population during lockdowns and other restrictions have helped reduce the peak and in most parts of the four nations, hospital numbers are likely to fall over the next few weeks, but not everywhere,” they said.“The social mixing which occurs around Christmas may well put additional pressure on hospitals and general practice in the New Year and we need to be ready for that,” they added.England is currently under a new three-tier system of coronavirus restrictions that replaced the month-long national lockdown in England which ended Wednesday.Under the new system, shops will be allowed to re-open across England, giving a Christmas bonanza to the struggling retail sector, but all bars and restaurants in the toughest Tier 3 areas will remain closed. The system put about 98 percent of England into the highest Tier 2 and 3.However, between Dec. 23 to 27, up to three different households are allowed to meet in a private home, a place of worship, or outdoor public spaces.To bring life back to normal, countries such as Britain, China, Germany, Russia, and the United States are racing against time to develop coronavirus vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-records-another-15-539-coronavirus-cases-397-deaths/story-ZyiLRA4axrhWlocKzUZ9EK.html

06-12-2020||World||Nod from California: Joe Biden now has enough electors to officially become US president||US President-elect Joe Biden has secured enough electoral college votes to officially win the presidency after California certified its election outcome on Friday, handing him 55 pledged votes.Biden now has nine more than the 270-mark that he needed to technically secure a win over his opponent, President Donald Trump, in the election. Colorado, New Jersey and Hawaii, which Biden won, still haven’t certified their results, and when they do, Biden’s tally of electoral college votes will go up to 306, which he has been projected to win for weeks now. Trump lost the election, garnering 232 electoral college votes. But he has refused to accept his defeat, alleging, without any proof, election fraud. The Trump campaign and his allies have filed multiple lawsuits challenging the outcome in the six states that cost him the election - Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia Arizona and Nevada - and his campaign announced one more lawsuit on Friday. The outgoing US president is scheduled to address a rally in Georgia in support of Republican senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler whose fate in the January run-off would determine who controls the Senate. Their loss would hand over the Republican-controlled chamber to the Democrats.California’s certification of Biden’s win wouldn’t have received so much attention. But Trump’s refusal to accept defeat has turned every formality in the election process into a milestone. It’s still a significant milestone, as Edward B. Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University, told AP. “It is a legal milestone and the first milestone that has that status,” Foley said. “Everything prior to that was premised on what we call projections.”The remaining states have until December 8 to certify their results. And on December 14, electors of the electoral college will vote to declare the victor - in this case, Biden. They will convey the outcome to US congress, which will approve it on January 6, two weeks to the inauguration on January 20.Trump has tried to persuade Republican-controlled legislature in these states to declare their own list of electors. But has had no success yet. He is also trying to get state legislators to petition Congress to reject the electoral college result.Dozens of Republican state legislators wrote to the state’s congressional delegation on Friday, seeking rejection of the electoral college vote. “We, the undersigned members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, urge you to object and vote to sustain such objection to the electoral college votes received from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021,” they wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nod-from-california-joe-biden-now-has-enough-electors-to-officially-become-us-president/story-HyEX871CDIxtLT1trBz8YK.html
