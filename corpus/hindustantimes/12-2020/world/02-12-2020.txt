We are trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I’ll see you in four years,” he told guests at a White House Christmas party on Tuesday.The event, attended by several Republican Party power brokers, was closed to the media, but a video of the outgoing president’s speech quickly went public.Nearly a month after the November 3 election the 74-year-old Trump still refuses to acknowledge that he lost and has not conceded to his Democratic rival, who is busy building his incoming administration.Shuttered in the White House, Trump has limited his public appearances to the bare minimum but has not shied away from spewing furious tweets about alleged election fraud -- which his own attorney general says is not evident.“To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,” Bill Barr told the Associated Press on Tuesday.Barr’s statement was all the more powerful because he is a staunch Trump ally.Given the curious political climate, in which the president-elect is busy introducing his cabinet nominees while the current president spreads conspiracy theories, speculation in the nation’s capital is running wild.According to NBC News, Trump has discussed the possibility with his close aides of launching his 2024 campaign on January 20 -- Inauguration Day for Biden, which clearly the Republican does not plan to attend.As he has admitted publicly in the past, the Manhattan real estate mogul-turned-president is a bit superstitious. In 2017, he filed the paperwork for his 2020 campaign on January 20, the same day he took the oath of office.Trump loves nothing better than being a provocateur, and should he stage a rally to rival the pomp and circumstance of the inauguration, he would embrace one of his favorite political maneuvers: counter-programming.Several times during his term, he boycotted the annual dinner hosted by the White House Correspondents Association -- only to show up at a campaign rally the same night.Obstacle course The formal launch of a Trump 2024 campaign would allow him to stay center stage, at least in the short term. But his path to victory would be strewn with obstacles, to say the least.From January 20, he will be the former president, and the political calculus will change dramatically.The sway he holds over Republican lawmakers and the round-the-clock media attention he commands (and on which he thrives) will both taper off considerably.All eyes will turn to his successor, but also to various senators and state governors within his own party who harbor White House ambitions.As he has repeatedly said on Twitter, Trump did not suffer the collapse at the polls that some predicted, and can certainly boast of a significant political base.The recounts roll on, but one thing is for sure: the 2020 election saw record turnout. Biden won more than 81 million votes, but Trump passed the 74 million mark -- -- the top two totals ever for presidential candidates.On a nationwide basis by percentage, Trump -- who incessantly mocks “losers” -- doesn’t fare as well. He earned less than 47 percent of the ballots cast.So will he end up being the Republican presidential nominee in four years?That seems rather a long shot. Trump is hardly a traditional politician -- he functions on instinct, in the moment. Long-term strategic planning is hardly his strong suit. In theory, nothing is preventing him from trying again in four years. The US Constitution prevents anyone from serving more than two full terms in the White House, but non-consecutive terms are possible.Only one president did so: Grover Cleveland, in the late 19th century. Elected for the first time in 1884, his reelection bid was a failure in 1888, but four years later, he won again -- making him both the 22nd and the 24th president of the United States.Cleveland was 56 at the start of his second term. Trump would be 78 -- the same age as Biden is now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-openly-floats-idea-of-2024-white-house-run/story-63JSUQlKDohInVBOPNqHAN.html
02-12-2020||World||Covid-19: US CDC recommends shorter self-quarantine periods||US health officials on Wednesday recommended a shortened quarantine period for people exposed to Covid-19, from 14 to 10 days if they haven’t taken a test and have not developed symptoms.This can be further reduced to just seven days if the exposed person receives a negative test, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) scientist Henry Walke said.“Reducing the length of quarantine may make it easier for people to take this critical public health action, reducing the economic hardship associated with a longer period, especially if they cannot work during that time,” he said.“We believe that if we can reduce the burden a little bit, accepting that it comes at a small cost, we may get a greater compliance overall.”The US is seeing more than 150,000 new cases a day and is bracing for a coronavirus super-surge following extensive travel over the Thanksgiving holiday.The new guidance, which will be posted on the CDC’s website and passed on to state and other local jurisdictions, was based on the latest research regarding infectiousness and how the disease progresses.But, Walke stressed, it isn’t risk-free and people who end quarantine early should continue to monitor for symptoms for the full 14 days.Reducing the quarantine period from 14 to 10 days comes with a “residual risk” the person leaving early could transmit to someone else at between 1-12 percent, according to CDC calculations.For the seven-day quarantine with a negative test, the residual risk of onward transmission is 5-10 percent.In addition, the CDC also announced testing guidance in light of Thanksgiving travel and in anticipation of more of the same over the Christmas holiday period.CDC epidemiologist Cindy Friedman stressed that the safest option was to postpone all plans.But if people do decide to travel, the agency recommends they get a viral test one to three days before their trip, and consider getting tested after their trip within three to five days.This should be accompanied by reducing non-essential activities for a full seven days after travel, even if the test is negative.“Testing does not eliminate all risks, but when it’s combined with reducing non-essential activities, symptom screening, other precautions such as wearing masks and social distancing, it can make travel safer,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-cdc-recommends-shorter-self-quarantine-periods/story-we2GJTfaNaZQsk74eeclkL.html
02-12-2020||World||US justice dept finds no vote fraud, orders probe into ‘cash for pardon’ scheme||The US justice department had found no evidence of widespread voting fraud to change the outcome of the 2020 election, attorney general William Barr has said, in a big blow to President Donald Trump’s plans to overturn his defeat.The department is also probing an alleged bribery scheme involving campaign donations to secure a presidential pardon, a court filing showed on Tuesday. The document is highly redacted, with all identifying information blacked out. But it refers to a “secret lobbying scheme” directed at “senior White House officials” to gain a presidential “pardon or reprieve of sentence” for an unnamed person. The probe comes days after Trump pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The clean chit to elections from Barr, a Trump ally, was seen as a stunning repudiation of his boss’s efforts. Barr told the Associated Press that the department of justice prosecutors and FBI agents had followed up specific poll fraud complaints and information they had received, but “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election”.Trump’s attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis hit back in a statement, saying “there hasn’t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation” and that the lawyers had “gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined”.Barr also told the news agency he had named US attorney John Durham as Special Counsel to investigate origins of the Russia meddling probe into the 2016 election. As attorney general, a political appointee, he could have been easily removed by the Biden administration, but firing a special counsel can be messy.Trump’s lies about election fraud are beginning to alarm Republicans. One Georgia election official angrily appealed to him to stop and condemn threats of violence against election officials by his supporters.With his chances of staying in power dwindling, Trump indicated he may be considering another run in 2024. “It’s been an amazing four years. We are trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I’ll see you in four years,” he told guests at a White House Christmas party, according to a CNN report.The president has also threatened to veto the defence spending bill if it did not include a provision rescinding a law that shields social media platforms from liability for their content — Section 230. He and his allies have long complained of discrimination by Facebook, Twitter and others.Seemingly undeterred by being fact-checked by his attorney general, Trump tweeted out a stream of TV clips of so-called witnesses speaking about election fraud at briefings and one legislative hearing that they claimed to have seen or experienced personally, which, have failed, once again, to withstand scrutiny in court.President-elect Joe Biden, on the other hand, has continued to put together his administration publicly, unaffected by Trump’s efforts to overturn the election. He introduced his economic team comprising Janet Yellen and Neera Tanden, nominees for treasury secretary and director of the office of management and budget respectively, in Wilmington, Delaware.“Let me be clear, with this team and the others who we will add in the weeks ahead, we will create a recovery for all and get this economy moving again,” Biden said while introducing his team. “We will create jobs, raise incomes, reduce drug prices, advance racial equity across the economy, and restore the backbone of this country — the middle class.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-justice-dept-finds-no-vote-fraud-orders-probe-into-cash-for-pardon-scheme/story-EwdLU5PuayX1ZhaJoetygO.html
02-12-2020||World||‘Let’s get to work already’: Putin directs authorities to start mass Covid-19 vaccinations||President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian authorities on Wednesday to begin mass voluntary vaccinations against COVID-19 next week as Russia recorded 589 new daily deaths from the coronavirus.Russia will have produced 2 million vaccine doses within the next few days, Putin said. Russia said last month that its Sputnik V jab was 92% effective at protecting people from COVID-19 according to interim results.“Let’s agree on this - you will not report to me next week, but you will start mass vaccination...let’s get to work already,” Putin told Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova.Golikova said large-scale vaccination could begin on a voluntary basis in December. The rise in infections has slowed since reaching a high on Nov. 27, with 25,345 new cases reported on Wednesday. Russia has resisted imposing lockdowns during the second wave of the virus, preferring targeted regional curbs. With 2,347,401 infections, Russia has the fourth-largest number of COVID-19 cases in the world behind the United States, India and Brazil. It has recorded 41,053 deaths related to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.The Kremlin earlier gave assurances that Russians were first in line to be vaccinated, with Moscow also discussing supply deals with other countries. “The absolute priority are Russians,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “Production within Russia, which is already being developed, will meet the needs of Russians.”Authorities in St Petersburg, which reported 3,684 new infections on Wednesday, ordered bars and restaurants to close from Dec. 30 until Jan. 3, to combat the rise in cases there, the RIA news agency reported. Museums, theatres and concert halls would be closed to the public in the city of more than 5 million people for the duration of Russia’s New Year holidays, from Dec. 30 to Jan. 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/let-s-get-to-work-already-putin-directs-authorities-to-start-mass-covid-19-vaccinations/story-aVN9VcLynvc7gci6kxv9UI.html
02-12-2020||World||US companies add fewer jobs than forecast, ADP data show||US companies added fewer jobs in November than forecast, signaling a deceleration in hiring as coronavirus cases surge and some governments begin imposing new restrictions.Businesses’ payrolls increased by 307,000 during the month, the smallest advance since July, after an upwardly revised 404,000 gain in the prior month, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 440,000 advance.The slower-than-expected pace of hiring illustrates the labor market’s uneven recovery as Covid-19 continues to spread and some states and local governments enact new restrictions on restaurants, retail and travel. At the same time, Congress has yet to agree on another round of fiscal assistance to shore up the most-affected businesses and keep employees on payrolls.The data precede the federal government’s monthly jobs report on Friday, which is forecast to show private payrolls increased by about 486,000 after a 638,000 gain in October.Service-provider employment increased 276,000 in November, reflecting gains in leisure and hospitality, health care and business services, according to ADP. Payrolls at goods producers rose 31,000 last month, including a 22,000 gain at construction firms.Payrolls at small, medium and large businesses all increased, with the biggest advance occurring at medium-size firms. Hiring rose 139,000 at those companies with 50 to 499 employees. Large businesses added 58,000 to payrolls and small companies took on 110,000 workers.ADP’s payroll data represent firms employing nearly 26 million workers in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-companies-add-fewer-jobs-than-forecast-adp-data-show/story-KZ6mTLIIhstNJNbEoQTlZJ.html
02-12-2020||World||North Korea-linked hackers targeted J&J, Novavax in hunt for Covid-19 research||Suspected North Korean hackers have recently tried to break into at least nine health organizations, including pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson and vaccine developer Novavax Inc, revealing a broader effort to target key players in the race to develop treatments for Covid-19.Four people who have investigated the attacks said the spate of hacking attempts began in September, and used web domains mimicking online login portals to try and trick staff at the targeted organisations into revealing their passwords.The hacking attempts included a bid to get inside British drugmaker and vaccine developer AstraZeneca, which Reuters first reported last week was in Pyongyang’s crosshairs.North Korea has not confirmed any coronavirus infections, but South Korea’s National Intelligence Service has said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the country had trade and people-to-people exchanges with China - the source of the pandemic - before shutting the border in late January. A Reuters review of publicly-available Internet records show that web domains and servers used by the attackers have previously been identified by the US government and security researchers as part of a North Korean hacking campaign. Other targets identified by the sources, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, included the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, the University of Tuebingen in Germany, and four South Korean pharmaceutical firms: Genexine Inc, Boryung Pharma Co Ltd, Shin Poong Pharm Co Ltd and Celltrion Inc.Reuters was not able to determine if any of the hacking attempts, some of which were reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier on Wednesday, were successful.North Korea’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A message sent to an email address used by the hackers was not returned. Pyongyang, which has no direct line of contact for foreign media, has previously denied carrying out cyberattacks.Novavax spokeswoman Amy Speak said her company was “aware of this threat” and was coordinating with government agencies and private cybersecurity experts.“We are confident we can continue to progress with our Covid-19 vaccine candidate without disruption and that these incursions do not pose a risk to the integrity of our data,” she said.A spokeswoman for the University of Tuebingen said staff were repeatedly targeted by hackers but all recent attacks “were detected and blocked by our IT-Team at an very early stage, no damage occurred.”Genexine said it was aware of a malicious website impersonating a company login portal but had not recorded any direct attacks against its staff. Celltrion said it had recently identified and successfully blocked a number of hacking attempts as part of its regular security work.Johnson & Johnson, Beth Israel, and Shin Poong declined to comment. Boryung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Simon Choi, an expert at South Korean cybersecurity group IssueMakersLab, said he had attributed the hacking attempts to North Korea and it was clear the attackers were specifically hunting for information about Covid-19. In the case of South Korea’s Celltrion, for example, he said the spies tried to break into an email account set up to field queries about Remsima, a monoclonal antibody which is being studied as a treatment for severe cases of the disease.A person familiar with the matter said that some of the fake login pages had been spotted by security experts at Microsoft Corp, helping prompt an alert the company issued last month about the threat of North Korean espionage to Covid-19 researchers. Microsoft stopped short of naming the targeted organizations in its Nov. 13 blog post, but said they were “leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers” in countries including the United States and South Korea.Lawmakers in South Korea also appear to have alluded to the digital espionage campaign, saying last week that its intelligence service thwarted attempts by Pyongyang to hack into South Korean companies developing coronavirus vaccines, although they provided no further details.Officially, North Korean authorities have reported no cases of coronavirus in their country, making it the only non-island nation - aside from Turkmenistan - to do so. But North Korean leader Kim Jong Un raised eyebrows last month when he was quoted by state media as ordering officials to intensify their anti-coronavirus work. Digital espionage against health bodies, vaccine scientists and drugmakers has intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic as state-backed hacking groups scramble to obtain the latest research and information about the outbreak.Reuters has previously documented how hackers linked to Iran, Vietnam, South Korea, China and Russia have on separate occasions been accused of trying to steal information about the virus and its potential treatments.Western officials say any stolen information could give foreign governments a valuable strategic advantage as they fight to contain a disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-linked-hackers-targeted-j-j-novavax-in-hunt-for-covid-19-research/story-AUopdjkwllSn2l1EtZe9MO.html
02-12-2020||World||Climate change damaging more World Heritage sites: Report||Climate change is increasingly damaging the UN’s most cherished heritage sites, a leading conservation agency warned Wednesday, reporting that Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and dozens of other natural wonders are facing severe threats.Climate change that has lead to shrinking glaciers, increasing fires, floods and droughts, and the bleaching of coral reefs are among the troubles facing 83 of the 252 World Heritage Sites listed by UNESCO, the UN’s cultural agency.Sixteen World Heritage sites have deteriorated since the last World Heritage Outlook was released three years ago, while only eight improved, said the International Union for Conservation of Nature, made up of governments and civil society groups and advises UNESCO on natural threats to those sites.“Natural World Heritage sites are amongst the world’s most precious places, and we owe it to future generations to protect them,” IUCN Director-General Bruno Oberle said. “Climate change is wreaking (havoc) on natural World Heritage, from shrinking glaciers to coral bleaching to increasingly frequent and severe fires and droughts.”The report says the Great Barrier Reef, where ocean warming, acidification and extreme weather have added to the coral decline and shrinking marine species populations, were one of four sites in Australia under “very high” threat.The islands of protected areas in the Gulf of California in Mexico have also entered the “critical” category in the listing. Spain’s Garajonay National Park, Olympic National Park in the United States, and Mexico’s Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve are among those under “very high” threat, the new report said.It said while 63% of the heritage sites are classified as “good” or “good with some concerns,” 30% are of “significant concern” and 7% are in “critical” shape.In a difference from the previous two IUCN reports, climate change has eclipsed “invasive alien species” — such as when foreign rodents, fish or plants are transplanted, accidentally or not, to new environments — as the most potent threat against such sites.Human activities like tourism, hunting and fishing, and livestock grazing have also had an impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-change-damaging-more-world-heritage-sites-report/story-2NhIUYH00se4PydC0qRN6N.html
02-12-2020||World||Warmer world in 2020 busted weather records, hurt people: UN Body||An overheating world obliterated weather records in 2020, creating an extreme year for hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, droughts and ice melt, the United Nations’ weather agency reported Wednesday.While the globe partly shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic, extremes linked to human-caused climate change intensified, the World Meteorological Organization said in its State of the Global Climate report. The report kicked off a day when the United Nations pushed for new climate action with two reports and a major speech by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres describing the woeful state of the planet.The UN is ramping up its efforts for a Dec. 12 climate summit in France on the 5th anniversary of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.The WMO report found that worsening global warming is being seen in all seven key climate indicators, but it said the problem is more than measurements and is increasing human suffering in an already bad year.“In 2020, over 50 million people have been doubly hit: by climate-related disasters (floods, droughts and storms) and the Covid-19 pandemic,’’ the report said. ”Countries in Central America are suffering from the triple-impact of hurricanes Eta and Iota, Covid-19 and pre-existing humanitarian crises.”By the time it ends, 2020 will go down as one of three warmest years on record, despite a La Nina cooling of the central Pacific that often lowers temperatures globally, the WMO report said.This year is set to be about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the last half of the 1800s, which scientists use as a baseline for warming caused by heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Most trapped heat goes into the world’s seas, and ocean temperatures now are at record levels, the report said.“There is at least a 1-in-5 chance of it temporarily exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2024,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement.The Paris climate accord set a goal of not exceeding 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times.A new analysis by Climate Action Tracker scientists who monitor carbon pollution and pledges to cut them said public commitments to emission cuts, if kept, would limit warming to about 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and possibly as low as 2.1 degrees Celsius. Those public commitments include President-elect Joe Biden’s promise that the US will have zero net carbon emissions by 2050 and China’s goal to do the same by 2060.“2020 was a shocking year, not only because of COVID, but also because of the impacts from extreme events we saw,” said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn’t part of the WMO report.Among the dozens of extremes that the report highlighted:-- A record 30 Atlantic named tropical storms and hurricanes, plus a record 12 that made U.S. landfalls.--Death Valley, California, hit 129.9 degrees (54.4 degrees Celsius), the hottest temperature the world has seen in 80 years, while the Los Angeles metropolitan area logged its hottest day on record with 120.9 degrees (49.4 degrees Celsius) in September.--Record wildfires struck California and Colorado in the western United States, following a major fire season in Australia, worsened by record heat.--The Arctic had record wildfires and a prolonged heat wave culminating in a 100-degree mark (38 degrees Celsius) in Siberia in June. Temperatures in Russia from January to August were 2.7 degrees (1.5 degrees Celsius) hotter than the previous record.--Record low Arctic sea ice was reported for April and August and the yearly minimum, in September, was the second lowest on record.--More than 2,000 people died in record summer rains and flooding in Pakistan and surrounding nations. Extensive flooding from extreme rains in Africa killed hundreds of people in Kenya and Sudan. And in China, the overflowing Yangtze River killed at least 279 people.--Near-record drought and heat caused heavy crop losses in South America. Much of central Europe had extensive drought, with a record 43-day spring dry spell in Geneva, home of the WMO.Mahowald of Cornell said while these events can’t solely be blamed on climate change, “these are the types of events scientists fear will increase due to climate change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warmer-world-in-2020-busted-weather-records-hurt-people-un-body/story-EETjtVNwnW9BYfIVo7cIwI.html
02-12-2020||World||US trade conflict must end, says EU to Joe Biden in new transatlantic agenda||The European Union and the United States should resolve their trade disputes after US President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January in a “new transatlantic agenda”, the EU executive said on Wednesday, laying out its wish-list for better ties.After four years of US President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda during which Washington imposed tariffs on Brussels on national security grounds, the EU is now looking for close cooperation with Biden on almost all issues.The United States and the EU “must work closely together on solving bilateral trade irritants”, the European Commission said in a proposal to EU governments, noting that EU-US commerce accounts for a third of world trade.However, the 12-page document presented by EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell made no mention of how to progress, other than appealing to “shared values of human dignity, individual rights and democratic principles.”“We would prefer to have a friendly agreement among us and not to have to go to the World Trade Organization, which is the way you go when you don’t agree,” Borrell told a news conference.The European Union is awaiting a ruling from the WTO on its challenge to US tariffs on steel and aluminium. Borrell said the EU would prefer to talk and not to wait for WTO settlements.Like NATO, the EU hopes to hold a summit in 2021 with Biden. EU leaders will discuss their approach at a meeting on Dec. 10.Both the EU and the United States have imposed tariffs in a dispute over aircraft subsidies. Washington has threatened further duties over EU plans to tax digital services companies.The two sides also have differing views on the value of the WTO and its system of settling disputes, which Washington has paralysed by blocking the appointment of judges.Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in September that “major powers are either pulling out of institutions or taking them hostage for their own interests,” in thinly veiled criticism of the United States.In its proposal, the EU said a first step would be for the EU and the United States to finalise the appointment of a new WTO director-general and “explore how to restore the essential dispute settlement function by reforming the Appellate Body.”The Commission said the EU and the US should also open a “transatlantic dialogue” on the power of large technology companies, find fair ways to tax them and address “market distortions”.Other areas of work would focus on fifth-generation mobile networks, artificial intelligence, data flows and cooperation on regulation and standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-trade-conflict-must-end-says-eu-to-joe-biden-in-new-transatlantic-agenda/story-qp8vRGfIAdWrc60gOIqKGN.html
02-12-2020||World||UK debates world-leading cuts in carbon dioxide emissions||Boris Johnson is mulling stricter UK greenhouse-gas cuts of as much as 69% by 2030, which would make it one of the most ambitious developed nations in the world when it comes to fighting climate change.A final decision hasn’t been taken, and targets in the range of 65% to 68% reductions from 1990 levels are also being considered, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the policy has yet to be finalized.A target of that magnitude would put the UK at the vanguard of global efforts to fight climate change, eclipsing the 55% reduction over the same period envisaged in the European Union’s Green Deal. It will also mark a key waypoint in the country’s plan to eliminate net emissions altogether by 2050 as part of efforts to contain global warming to at least 2 degrees Celsius.An announcement is planned before Dec 12, when Johnson is scheduled to co-host a United Nations event at which other countries may announce their more ambitious pledges on slashing carbon dioxide, the person said.“We’re looking at our nationally-determined contribution which will be extremely ambitious and will be published around the time of the climate summit on Dec 12 this year,” Johnson said in the House of Commons on Wednesday.Also Read | New Zealand declares climate emergency, promises carbon neutral government by 2025In recent months, major emitters including China and Japan have followed the UK in setting long-term goals to zero out greenhouse gases. Those new targets will put the world on course to limit global warming to 2.1 degrees Celsius, according to Climate Action Tracker. But mid-term goals are also required under the terms of the Paris Agreement to ensure countries stay on track and to provide signals to businesses on where to invest.Environmental campaigners at Greenpeace have called for a target as tough as 75% by 2030 that includes international aviation and shipping and doesn’t rely on the use of carbon credits, where polluters offset their own emissions by funding clean-energy projects elsewhere.Adair Turner, chairman of the Energy Transitions Commission research group, said that in order to have “a really credible and strong commitment,” the UK’s new goal should be in the range of 65% to 70%. Alongside that figure the UK should also commit to almost fully decarbonize its electricity system by 2035.“We’ve actually got to get emissions down a lot in the 2020s themselves, because what matters is the stock in the atmosphere” of greenhouse gases, he said.Glasgow CallingAs host of the next round of global climate change talks that take place in Glasgow next year, Johnson has been seeking to burnish his environmental credentials. Last month he unveiled a 10-point plan to boost green industries that included banning the sale of new diesel and petrol cars by 2030. The blueprint also included funding for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage technology and plans to expand offshore wind power.The new 2030 target will be based on advice from the independent Climate Change Committee which is slated to be published next week, tracking the UK’s progress to meeting its environmental long-term goals. Its most recent figures found the UK to be off track to meeting the net zero goal and is “unprepared for the worst impacts of climate change.”The new 2030 target would replace an existing UK goal to reduce emissions by 57% in the period between 2028 and 2032. That goal was set in 2016 but to deliver on a 2050 goal to cut emissions by just 80% by mid century. Since then, the UK became one of the world’s first countries to set a binding net zero goal for 2050, meaning it now needs a tougher mid-term goal.Also Read | Biden plan to end US fossil fuel subsidies faces big challengesJohnson also wants to use green policies in a bid to boost relations with US President Elect Joe Biden, who has made climate change a key pillar of his campaign, reversing President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement.Amber Rudd, a former secretary of state for energy and climate change in Johnson’s Conservative Party, said setting the new target was complicated by Brexit. That’s because the UK is due to leave the EU’s Emissions Trading System on Dec 31, through which big emitters like steel makers, pay for their pollution.“As we leave the European Union, what is going to happen to the ETS and our involvement in it, is there going to be a replacement, how will it work?

However, this year coincides with La Niña which has the opposite effect and cools temperatures.The WMO will confirm the data in March 2021.A climate pact agreed in Paris five years ago compels countries to make efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, above which scientists warn of catastrophic climate change.While it is not the same as crossing that long-term warming threshold, the WMO says there is at least a one in five chance of temperatures temporarily, on an annual basis, exceeding that level by 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-2020-likely-world-s-second-hottest-year-2016-first/story-vAF90XjPg3oxgt0fuibHGP.html

It released images of the barren landing site showing the lander’s shadow.“Chang’e has collected moon samples,” the agency said in a statement.The probe, launched Nov 24 from the tropical island of Hainan, is the latest venture by a space programme that sent China’s first astronaut into orbit in 2003. Beijing also has a spacecraft en route to Mars and aims eventually to land a human on the moon.This week’s landing is “a historic step in China’s cooperation with the international community in the peaceful use of outer space,” said a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying.“China will continue to promote international cooperation and the exploration and use of outer space in the spirit of working for the benefit of all mankind,” Hua said.Plans call for the lander to spend two days drilling into the lunar surface and collecting 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rocks and debris. The top stage of the probe will be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule to take back to Earth, where it is to land in China’s northern grasslands in mid-December.Also Read |  US should act to counter China’s subversion of UN, commission says in report to CongressIf it succeeds, it will be the first time scientists have obtained fresh samples of lunar rocks since the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 probe in 1976.The samples are expected to be made available to scientists from other nations, although it is unclear how much access NASA will have due to US government restrictions on cooperation with China’s military-linked program.From the rocks and debris, scientists hope to learn more about the moon, including its precise age, as well as increased knowledge about other bodies in our solar system. Collecting samples, including from asteroids, is an increasing focus of many space programs.American and Russian space officials congratulated the Chinese program.“Congratulations to China on the successful landing of Chang’e 5. This is no easy task,” NASA’s science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen, wrote on Twitter.“When the samples collected on the Moon are returned to Earth, we hope everyone will benefit from being able to study this precious cargo that could advance the international science community.” US astronauts brought back 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of lunar samples from 1969 to 1972, some of which is still being analyzed and experimented on.The Chang’e 5 flight is China’s third successful lunar landing. Its predecessor, Chang’e 4, was the first probe to land on the moon’s little-explored far side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-spacecraft-collects-moon-samples-to-bring-back-to-earth/story-dv5VOFEWkEM6XagRILQwfK.html

A former Hong Kong legislator, Hui was able to get his passport back from the government and a visa after receiving an invitation from Danish lawmakers.“When I began in politics, I never dreamed that the day would come that I could be jailed but democracy is fragile, and it is duty of all democrats everywhere to stick together in times of crisis. I call upon European countries such as Denmark to follow in the footsteps of Great Britain and allow protesters in Hong Kong a safe haven from the terror of CCP,” he said.“All politicians around the world should stand up for democracy together and face the realities of the situation in Hong Kong. If democracies do not stand together, we will fall together,” Hui said.Since the start of the protests in June 2019, Hong Kong police have made more than 10,000 arrests.Prominent pro-democracy figures who have been arrested include activists Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, as well as media tycoon Jimmy Lai, an outspoken advocate for democracy. Hui was arrested in May over an incident in the Legislative Council in which he dropped a rotten plant and attempted to kick it at the body’s president.Activists have accused the Hong Kong government and the central Chinese government in Beijing of tightening control over the semi-autonomous territory in response to demands for more democracy. They say authorities are destroying the autonomy promised to the city, a global financial center with greater freedoms than mainland China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-hong-kong-lawmaker-asks-europe-to-provide-safe-haven/story-U41P8h4kVdn9Psnbm0EQ2K.html

Biden is opposed to annexation and has promised a more evenhanded approach to the conflict.The taxes are a key source of revenue for the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It was forced to cut the salaries it pays to tens of thousands of civil servants, worsening an economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Also Read |  Russia slams Pompeo’s visit to Golan Heights: Know about all US decisions favouring IsraelHussein al-Sheikh, a close aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, confirmed the receipt of nearly 3.8 billion shekels (around $1.1 billion) from Israel.

Israel says the so-called Martyrs’ Fund incentivizes violence, while the Palestinians say it provides aid to needy families.President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan, unveiled in January, would have allowed Israel to annex a third of the West Bank, including all its Jewish settlements. The Palestinians immediately rejected the plan, and Abbas announced in May that he was cutting all ties to the US and Israel, and would no longer abide by past agreements with them.Israel shelved its annexation plans in August after the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalize relations, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the pause was only temporary.Also Read | Israel pushes for East Jerusalem building before Donald Trump exits White HouseTrump took unprecedented steps to support Israel and isolate the Palestinians, including moving the US Embassy to contested Jerusalem, cutting off aid to the Palestinians and ending decades of US opposition to Israeli settlements, which the Palestinians and much of the international community view as a violation of international law.Biden has vowed to restore aid to the Palestinians and press both sides to resume the long-moribund peace process, without providing much detail about his approach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-transfers-1-billion-to-cash-strapped-palestinian-authority/story-VRwjyuZ14dVVizcReHb8SI.html
02-12-2020||World||UK approves Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine; roll-out from next week||The UK on Wednesday approved a Covid-19 vaccine, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, with 800,000 doses to be administered starting next week, marking the fastest development of any vaccine in history, from the design stage to approval within a year.The first country to approve a Covid-19 vaccine, the UK has ordered 40 million doses, with 800,000 doses arriving from its production base in Belgium next week. The UK’s regulator said the coronavirus vaccine was approved after rigorous, scientific and detailed review of rolling data.The usual prolonged process of vaccine development involving several years of design, clinical trials and regulatory scrutiny has been expedited to within 10 months in the case of Covid-19, marking a new phase in the history of global public health.June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said “no corners were cut” while assessing the data. The UK’s health officials said the elderly and those above 80 years will be prioritised when the first doses arrive.Raine said, “We have carried out a rigorous scientific assessment of all the available evidence of quality, safety and effectiveness. The public’s safety has always been at the forefront of our minds - safety is our watchword.”“I’m really pleased to say that the UK is now one step closer to providing a safe and effective vaccine to help in the fight against Covid-19 - a virus that has affected each and every one of us in some way - and in helping to save lives,” she added.Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the development as “fantastic” while a “thrilled” health secretary Matt Hancock reiterated his belief that normalcy would return by April. Johnson said, “It’s the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.”Hancock, however, sounded a note of caution, asking Britons to see through the winter months by following restrictions until coronavirus vaccines are rolled out on a wide scale. “We can’t lower our guard yet,” said Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer.The vaccine with 95% efficacy needs to be initially refrigerated in bulk in “freezer farms” at between minus 70-80 degrees Celsius when doses arrive. It then has 10 days to reach vaccination centres, and once delivered, it can be stored up to five days in a fridge between 2-8 degrees Celsius, and administered.Arrangements are being made by the National Health Service (NHS) for mass vaccination across the UK.An official spokesperson said, “The NHS has decades of experience in delivering large-scale vaccination programmes and will begin putting their extensive preparations into action to provide care and support to all those eligible for vaccination.“To aid the success of the vaccination programme, it is vital everyone continues to play their part and abide by the necessary restrictions in their area, so we can further suppress the virus and allow the NHS to do its work without being overwhelmed.”The MHRA is currently analysing data from trials of the University of Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines. The former is expected to be the mainstay of countering the virus in the UK, India and elsewhere due to its low cost and logistical ease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-approves-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-from-next-week/story-G31avctGke48JtW1GxCmYL.html
02-12-2020||World||Wildfire risks might cause nearly million Californians to face blackouts||Nearly one million people in Southern California are facing blackouts as the state’s three biggest utilities weigh cutting power to prevent live wires from sparking fires during high winds.Edison International’s Southern California Edison warned it may need to shut off electricity to more than 230,000 homes and businesses in eight counties, the utility said on its website. That’s about 690,000 people based on the size of the average household, and would constitute the region’s largest public-safety blackout this year.Dry winds that can fan flames and knock power lines down are forecast to rattle Southern California through Friday, with the worst of it on Wednesday and Thursday, the National Weather Service said. California has already been charred by record fires that have burned 4.2 million acres and killed 31 people in 2020. Utilities including Edison and PG&E Corp. have cut power repeatedly to prevent live wires from falling into dry brush.Edison’s cuts could begin between late Wednesday and Friday, Edison spokesman Chris Abel said.Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric utility also warned Tuesday that 88,700 homes and businesses, or more than 260,000 people, could lose power Wednesday night or Thursday morning, and possibly remain in the dark through Sunday or Monday. Most affected customers would be in the mountains east of San Diego. PG&E, California’s largest utility, said it may cut power to about 600 homes and businesses in Kern County this week, as well.Last week, Edison cut power to thousands of customers on Thanksgiving during high winds. In 2019, PG&E filed for bankruptcy after its wires sparked the deadliest blaze in state history.The high winds and blackouts will be mostly confined to Southern California but could touch a portion of the state’s Central Valley as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wildfire-risks-might-cause-nearly-million-californians-to-face-blackouts/story-cgVYx59AHYz09eo7wBHnkN.html
02-12-2020||World||US should act to counter China’s subversion of UN, commission says in report to Congress||The US should take steps to counter China’s efforts to subvert the principles of the United Nations and its bodies, including preparing a report on Beijing’s actions to influence votes of UN members, an American commission has recommended in a new report submitted to Congress. The report by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which was submitted on Tuesday, comes against the backdrop of concerns in New Delhi and other world capitals about the outsize influence wielded by China in UN bodies at a time when the efforts to reform the world body have made little headway. The commission recommended the US Congress should direct the state department to produce annual reports “detailing China’s actions in the United Nations and its subordinate agencies that subvert the principles and purposes of the United Nations”. Such reports should document China’s actions that violate UN treaties and are meant to “influence the votes of United Nations members, including through coercive means”. Also read | China ‘planned’ Galwan Valley clash, US commission says in report to CongressThe reports should also list China’s actions to “nominate or support candidates for United Nations leadership positions that do not adhere to United Nations standards for impartiality or are subject to the influence of the Chinese government,” and actions by Chinese nationals and others holding UN positions who appear to support the Chinese government’s interests in violation of UN impartiality standards. The commission further recommended the reports should document actions by “Chinese military and support personnel engaged in United Nations peacekeeping operations that are inconsistent with the principles governing these missions, including China’s deployment of these personnel to protect its economic interests and improve the power projection capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army”. The commission was scathing in its analysis of China’s role at the UN, saying Beijing’s efforts to “transform global governance is really a call to change the UN system to bring it more in line with Beijing’s principles” and preferences. “Beijing has sought to bring international law and the UN’s definition of human rights more in line with its own interests by decreasing emphasis on individual rights. China is the second-largest donor to the UN after the United States: it provides 12 percent of the UN’s total budget, up from 1 percent 20 years ago. The CCP [Chinese Communist Party] seeks to use this as leverage to reduce funding for human rights-related functions such as human rights officers in peacekeeping missions,” the report said. Besides, China has sought to use UN legal instruments such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea for its own gain, and also exploits its influence over UN organisations to “promote specific Chinese foreign policy objectives, contrary to both the spirit and the letter of how the UN was intended to operate,” the commission said. Noting that Chinese officials currently hold the post of director general of four out of 15 UN specialised agencies – Food and Agriculture Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization, International Telecommunications Union and United Nations Industrial Development Organization – the commission said these officials “violate UN standards of conduct and leverage the institutions they lead to promote China’s political objectives, such as policies concerning Taiwan”. China’s election to the UN Human Rights Council in October, albeit with fewer votes than in 2016, created concerns against the backdrop of developments in Xinjiang and Hong and its assertive actions in areas ranging from the South China Sea to Taiwan to Ladakh. In New Delhi, China is often seen as a key force stymieing reforms of the UN and the Security Council, including its expansion to include more permanent members such as India. China is the only P5 member that hasn’t backed India’s admission into a reformed and expanded Security Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-should-act-to-counter-china-s-subversion-of-un-commission-says-in-report-to-congress/story-IkuHeKNpx0B0uVDDHpIJAP.html
02-12-2020||World||The UK has approved one Covid-19 vaccine, here’s what happens next||Now that Britain has become the first western country to approve a Covid-19 shot, the spotlight shifts to the high-stakes rollout. Vaccinating the country’s roughly 67 million people won’t happen overnight. The UK has ordered enough doses of the two-shot Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to immunize 20 million people.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Who will get the vaccine first?The government plans to prioritize as it begins to deploy the vaccine, starting with residents and staff in care homes, then moving to people over 80 years old and health-care workers, documents show.Britain will immunize people throughout the wider population next, based on age and risk. The shot is expected to be available from next week.Where can people get it?In the UK, 50 hospitals are ready to administer the vaccine, followed by doctors and pharmacists, assuming they have the facilities needed to store the doses, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Sky News Wednesday.The country has moved to expand the pool of people who can give the jabs beyond the National Health Service to other health professionals.Where is the vaccine at the moment?The vaccine is still at Pfizer’s production site in Puurs, Belgium. The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said the doses will be made available starting next week.Can I get more than one vaccine?Not for now. The UK only cleared the one made by Pfizer and BioNTech, although a product using a similar technology from Moderna Inc. may also get approved soon.It may become possible to mix shots when other vaccines are approved. That should work for shots that target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, according to Andrew Pollard, who is leading the University of Oxford’s vaccine trial with AstraZeneca Plc. The three front-runners use the spike protein as a target, as do many others in clinical tests.Also Read | Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin: List of states which have started phase 3 trials of Covid-19 vaccineHow does the approved vaccine compare with others?The product relies on a technology called messenger RNA, which has never been used to make approved vaccines before. So does Moderna’s. Both showed they were more than 90% effective in clinical trials. The approach is designed to transform the body’s own cells into vaccine-making factories.The main difference is that the Pfizer-BioNTech product must be stored ultra-cold until a few days before it is used. Moderna’s vaccine is stable at refrigerator temperatures for 30 days. Astra-Oxford’s jab importantly can be kept at refrigerator temperatures.How do we know the vaccine is safe?Pfizer and BioNTech tested the product in a clinical trial involving almost 44,000 people without observing severe side effects. The most common symptoms were fatigue and headaches.The UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, said on Wednesday that the vaccine “met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.” Hancock described the review as having been “rigorous,” not rushed.Monitoring safety will be one of the biggest challenges once shots are rolled out widely, Emer Cooke, the new head of the European Medicines Agency, said in an interview last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-uk-has-approved-a-vaccine-here-s-what-happens-next/story-zYiSgAg6zNU3qNcetMx66L.html

Its analysis and decision on other vaccine candidates is expected in the near future.An official spokesperson said, “The government has today accepted the recommendation from the independent MHRA to approve Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine for use. This follows months of rigorous clinical trials and a thorough analysis of the data by experts at the MHRA who have concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness… The vaccine will be made available across the UK from next week.”The vaccine with 95% efficacy needs to be initially refrigerated at a temperature between minus 70 and 80 degrees Celsius, and administered in two doses, 21 days apart. Since hospitals have the infrastructure, it will be initially given to hospital staff and to vulnerable care-home residents.The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with 800,000 doses arriving from the company’s production base in Belgium next week.

The speed of the rollout depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine, Britain said.- The bulk of the rollout will happen in the new year.Also Watch l UK clears Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine, shots available from next week - Hancock said the vaccine will first go to the elderly, those in care homes and their carers, and to those who are clinically vulnerable.- Britain has established three routes to get the vaccine out to the country, a programme it has described as “challenging” because it needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F) or below.- 50 hospitals are set up across England and waiting to accept the vaccine, large vaccination centres are being set up now, and in time local health centres known as general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists will provide the jab in the community if they have those capabilities.- The community element is likely to take on a larger role if a rival vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is approved, because it does not need such cold storage and is easier to deliver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-approves-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-who-gets-it-first/story-aP3bSQtBh2YfSwBSGzm54I.html
02-12-2020||World||New NATO report suggests measures to counter ‘China’s growing importance’||The North Atlantic Treaty Organization took another step toward making China a strategic focal point after the alliance published a report stressing Chinese geopolitical threats.The study, from a group of experts assembled by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg for the 30-nation NATO, includes recommendations on bolstering its political cohesion and ability to face new security challenges. China features prominently.“NATO must devote much more time, political resources and action to the security challenges posed by China -- based on an assessment of its national capabilities, economic heft, and the stated ideological goals of its leaders,” the experts said in the report released in Brussels on Tuesday. “It needs to develop a political strategy for approaching a world in which China will be of growing importance through to 2030.”The recommendations follow a series of high-profile splits in NATO. The organization has been shaken over the past four years by US President Donald Trump’s vocal demands for European countries to spend more on defense and his unilateral changes to the deployment of American troops abroad.“China’s coming closer to us, investing heavily in infrastructure in NATO countries in Europe,” Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday after the first part of a two-day video conference of the alliance’s foreign ministers. It’s the last such meeting for US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo as NATO waits for President-elect Joe Biden to take office Jan. 20 and anticipates smoother transatlantic ties.On Wednesday, in the first NATO event of its kind, the alliance’s foreign ministers will be joined by representatives of Asia-Pacific countries -- including Japan and Australia -- in an online session devoted to China.The Chinese government said it was committed to “peaceful development and win-win cooperation” with the rest of the world.“Our development advances will not pose a threat or challenge to anyone else,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. “We hope NATO will look at our development in an objective, positive and open way.”Political TensionsNATO was established 71 years ago to deter a Soviet Union that collapsed in 1991. It’s now focusing again on threats posed by Russia as a result of its renewed muscle-flexing, pursuing anti-terrorism policies taken up after the 2001 attacks in the US and seeking to adapt to the rise of China.In December 2019, a NATO summit for the first time mentioned challenges posed by China.In this context, the US-dominated alliance is trying to prevent a repeat of internal political tensions that boiled over in the wake of a Turkish incursion into northern Syria in October 2019 to challenge Kurdish forces.Turkey, which has NATO’s second-biggest army, received Trump’s approval for the military operation that European countries opposed. This prompted French President Emmanuel Macron to say a lack of strategic cooperation among NATO members showed the alliance was suffering a “brain death” -- a remark that irritated many countries in the alliance including Germany.The German government then pushed for NATO to create an expert group to advise member countries on future transatlantic security challenges -- a proposal endorsed by the alliance’s leaders at their meeting a year ago in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-nato-report-suggests-measures-to-counter-china-s-growing-importance/story-8CumAnhai41pFAsNKYYSIJ.html
02-12-2020||World||China ‘planned’ Galwan Valley clash, US commission says in report to Congress||The Chinese government had planned the clash with Indian troops in Galwan Valley in June, which resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified Chinese casualties, a US commission has concluded in a new report to Congress. The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, in the report submitted on December 1, described the nearly eight-month-long India-China standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as the “most severe border crisis in decades”. Referring to the “massive physical brawl in the Galwan Valley” between People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Indian troops on June 15, the report said, “Some evidence suggested the Chinese government had planned the incident, potentially including the possibility for fatalities. For instance, several weeks prior to the clash, Defense Minister Wei [Fenghe] made his statement encouraging Beijing to ‘use fighting to promote stability’.” It added, “Satellite images depicted a large Chinese buildup in the Galwan Valley, including potentially 1,000 PLA soldiers, the week before the deadly skirmish.” Also read | India’s ban on 43 Chinese apps is the 4th strike since Ladakh standoffThe report further noted that just “over two weeks before the incident, in another potential indication of Chinese leaders signalling their intent to escalate tensions, an editorial in China’s state-owned tabloid Global Times warned that India would suffer a ‘devastating blow’ to its trade and economic ties with China if it got ‘involved in the US-China rivalry’”. The India-China border standoff emerged in the open after two clashes between troops of the two sides in the Sikkim and Ladakh sectors of the LAC. The two countries have been unable to agree on disengagement and de-escalation at friction points despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks. There was no word from Indian officials on the report. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, described the report’s conclusion as significant and said: “The finding that the Galwan Valley clash was planned sounds plausible and echoes concerns that were expressed by Indian experts as far back as the summer – that all this isn’t happening by chance.” He added, “Such a report would be born of diligent research and the fact that it has been passed and presented shows it reflects bipartisan sentiment in the US. You don’t suddenly deploy tens of thousands of troops at the border without a plan or a strategy that has a certain purpose.” However, Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany, said: “The evidence presented in the report is weak at best. While it remains possible that China expected and perhaps even provoked the deadly clash, this report brings us no closer to knowing if that was indeed the case.” The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission was created by the US Congress in 2000 with the mandate of monitoring and submitting an annual report on national security implications of trade and economic ties between Washington and Beijing. The latest report focused extensively on China’s assertive actions against Taiwan and Hong Kong, its strategic aims in Africa and the border standoff with India. The clash in Galwan Valley resulted in the first fatalities along the LAC since 1975 and the Indian leadership has said the incident had shaken the foundation of India-China ties based on maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the disputed border. The US commission’s report said the clash in Galwan Valley “followed a series of standoffs beginning in early May along multiple sectors of the LAC” and led to “at least 20 Indian deaths and an unconfirmed number of Chinese casualties”. If China’s goal from its actions was “to acquire territory...[the Chinese government] might deem the moves a success”, the report said. “If Beijing intended to dissuade India from building infrastructure on its side of the LAC or warn it against aligning with the United States, however, ‘then the Chinese moves have been ineffective, if not counterproductive’,” the report added. The report also referred to the imposition of a draconian national security law in Hong Kong this year and said, “This action was one of many in 2020 – including border skirmishes with India, military exercises to intimidate Taiwan, and pressure on Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, among others – that demonstrated the Chinese government’s indifference to its reputation abroad.” The report also noted that China and India had engaged in “multiple physical clashes” along the LAC for decades, but since President Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012 the “two countries have seen five major altercations along their border”. China and India had engaged in “multiple physical clashes” along the LAC for decades, but since President Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, the “two countries have seen five major altercations along their border”, it said. “The exact motivations behind the Chinese government’s provocative behaviour on the LAC this year remain unclear. The proximate cause of the clash appeared to be India’s construction of a strategic access road to support troops stationed along the LAC. China has also built extensive infrastructure along the LAC in recent years,” the report said. In the aftermath of the June 15 clash, China “asserted sovereignty over the entire Galwan Valley, a new claim and significant change to the territorial status quo”, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-planned-galwan-valley-clash-us-commission-says-in-report-to-congress/story-yZEK4tFfdcDOhNvnLVzigN.html
02-12-2020||World||Trump threatens to veto defense bill over social media protections||President Donald Trump is threatening to veto a defense policy bill unless it ends protections for internet companies that shield them from being held liable for material posted by their users.On Twitter Tuesday night, Trump took aim at Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects companies that can host trillions of messages from being sued into oblivion by anyone who feels wronged by something someone else has posted — whether their complaint is legitimate or not.Trump called Section 230 “a serious threat to our National Security & Election Integrity,” adding, “Therefore, if the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill.”Trump has been waging war against social media companies for months, claiming they are biased against conservative voices.In October he signed an executive order directing executive branch agencies to ask independent rule-making agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, to study whether they can place new regulations on the companies.Since losing the presidential election, Trump has flooded social media with unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Twitter has tagged many such Trump tweets with the advisory, “This claim about election fraud is disputed.”Tuesday’s veto threat is another potential roadblock for the passage of the annual defense policy measure, which is already being held up in Congress by a spat over military bases named for Confederate officers. The measure, which has passed for 59 years in a row on a bipartisan basis, guides Pentagon policy and cements decisions about troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, military personnel policy and other military goals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-threatens-to-veto-defense-bill-over-social-media-protections/story-EqtHKS8inqP1KFdp46vLhI.html

02-12-2020||World||Emmanuel Macron on the defensive as pressure mounts over police abuse||Emmanuel Macron’s government is holding its line over police violence despite mounting criticism from civil society and parliamentarians.The tense relationship between the police and the public, and minority communities in particular, is becoming a major issue in France with the 42-year-old president pushing for tougher legislation as part of a drive to improve security and crack down on crime. Macron was forced to retreat from plans to make it harder for people to post images of the police on social media after protests on Saturday drew huge crowds -- as many as 300,000 by some estimates.In the days before the demonstration, a video showing three officers beating Black music producer Michel Zecler at the entrance of his Paris studio lent credence to those arguing that such footage has a role to play in holding the police to account and exposing abuses.Questioned by a Senate committee in Paris on Tuesday, National Police Director General Frederic Veaux, said the French police force doesn’t have a problem with racism or violence.“By saying this, I’m not in denial or stonewalling, I’m describing what I see and what I hear,” he said.The police chief condemned violent incidents and said those responsible were harshly sanctioned. Violence against police agents and their families meanwhile is on the rise, he said, echoing recent comments by Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin.Speaking to the National Assembly on Monday evening, Darmanin blamed the attack on the music producer on “individual behavior” while acknowledging shortcomings in the training of officers.“I do not share the view that there is a divorce between the police and the population,” he said.Three officers were charged late on Sunday, with two of them placed in custody while the investigation continues into the alleged assault of Zecler.Government U-TurnOn Monday, the French government announced that it will rewrite Article 24 of the “global security law” that would have made it a crime punishable by a year in prison and a 45,000-euro ($54,000) fine to publish the face or any other identifying feature of a police officer with intent to cause them “physical or psychological harm.”In announcing the complete rewriting of article, Christophe Castaner, head of Macron’s ruling party in the parliament, insisted the aim remains to better protect the police and to defend freedom of the press both for professional journalists and for citizens posting images on social media.“France should be the country of no violence or any infringement of any freedom whatsoever,” he said.Macron has been trying to position himself as the law and order candidate in a country where campaigning for presidential elections in two years time has already begun.In the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 16 beheading of a teacher by an Islamist militant he saw a bounce the polls, but enthusiasm for his tough stance was short lived and Macron is now under fire on multiple fronts as he tries to respond to the resurgence of jihadism and contain the spread of the coronavirus.His approval rating has dropped by 5 points to 41, according to a recent Ifop poll, with a 17 point fall among those aged under 25 years.Macron had sought to douse the anger over the video on Friday, asking his government to come up with proposals to restore the public confidence in the police. He said the beating “shames us,” and condemned violence both against and by the police, but he and Darmanin have repeatedly denied systemic racism with the security forces.The French leader himself will give an interview on Thursday to Brut -- an online channel that addresses young people.(Updates with comments from National Police General Director in 4th- 7th paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emmanuel-macron-on-the-defensive-as-pressure-mounts-over-police-abuse/story-urVg8XNCuIDo9e8NAsW1wL.html

Russia’s Permanent Representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia, in turn, did not rule out that the vaccine developers would present it at the UN headquarters.“On Wednesday, December 2, a presentation of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine will take place. Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko, Russia’s Permanent Representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia, and head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) Kirill Dmitriyev will take part in the event,” Strzhizhovsky said.He said a virtual event entitled “Sputnik V: Vaccine Against Covid-19” will be held on the sidelines of a special session of the UN General Assembly. During the meeting, detailed information on the Russian vaccine will be presented.In August, Russia’s Health Ministry registered the world’s first vaccine for the prevention of Covid-19, developed by the Gamaleya Research Centre. It was named Sputnik V. The vaccine is based on a well-studied and validated human adenoviral vector platform, the important benefits of which are safety, efficacy and no long-term adverse effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-permanent-mission-health-ministry-to-present-sputnik-v-at-un/story-KdfGHGKfF8x21EW3SjwB3J.html
02-12-2020||World||Poll shows more Canadians see India as an opportunity, China as a threat||There is an increase in the number of Canadians viewing India’s growing economic power as an opportunity, while more and more of them now see China’s rise in the domain as a threat. These are among the findings of a national opinion poll conducted by the Vancouver-headquartered non-profit Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada (APF Canada).The organisation that strives to be a bridge between Canada and the Asia-Pacific region has been tracking Canadian attitudes towards the economic rise of India and China since 2004. “Between 2018 and 2020, the change in perceptions for China and India has followed opposing paths, something we have not observed before. While 72% of Canadians agree that the growing economic power of India is more of an opportunity than a threat, a modest increase since 2018 (71%), only 35% of Canadians agree that the growing economic power of China is more as an opportunity than a threat, down from 60% in 2018,” the results of the annual survey revealed.This is the also the first time that the survey has shown the majority of respondents seeing China’s economic power as a threat, at 57%. Again, the perception towards India is headed towards a positive direction with just 18% seeing its economic growth as a threat, which the APF Canada described as “an all-time low”.Canadians’ general feeling towards India has also remained stable. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 means “very warm, favourable”, India scores 5.7. “Over the past decade, the governments of India and Canada have been making efforts to build a mutually beneficial relationship, which can only prosper further if the Canadian public also holds a positive view,” the report noted. “On the flip side, Canadians’ feelings towards China, which had been remarkably stable for the past decade until 2018, dropped from 4.9 to 3.6 in 2020.”The survey said there was support for Canada entering into a free trade agreement (FTA) with India, though that was not the case with regard to China. Just about one-third voiced support for an FTA with China, which 59%. “It marks the lowest support for an FTA with China since we started polling Canadians on the subject in 2012,” the report stated.One of reasons behind the growing animosity of Canadians’ towards China is the Covid-19 pandemic. Two-third of Canadians disagreed with the statement that the Chinese government “acted responsibly” at the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan. The vast majority, at 68%, “feel that Canada should support an independent inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 virus”.Human rights abuses and the arrest and detention of two Canadians by the Chinese government are also feeding into the escalating negativity. “The majority of Canadians (83%) feel that Canada should stand up to China as Canadian national values such as the rule of law, human rights, and democracy are on the line,” the report pointed out, while “67% think Canada should work alongside the US and other allies to pressure China, and about 67% also believe Canada should take a more aggressive approach towards China” to liberate the two imprisoned there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poll-shows-canadians-see-india-as-an-opportunity-china-as-a-threat/story-0ifQm2S1tbIuL1XllvrqAJ.html
02-12-2020||World||Joe Biden closes in on top health leaders as Covid-19 ravages US||President-elect Joe Biden’s front-runner for secretary of Health and Human Services is New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, and he may announce several of his administration’s health leaders as soon as next week, according to people familiar with the matter.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The position of HHS secretary is down to two possibilities, the people said, between Lujan Grisham and former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, a co-chair of the coronavirus advisory board Biden appointed shortly after he was elected.Biden’s health team will assume office with the US still suffering from the pandemic, as virus cases and hospitalizations soared over the past month. His health secretary is expected to have input on filling other top health posts, such as FDA commissioner and the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the people said, so those appointments may not be announced until later.The Health and Human Services secretary will have the tough task of rebuilding Obamacare, which Biden has promised to expand. That will be a difficult undertaking with a Republican-led Senate.Murthy or Jeff Zients, who led the Obama administration effort to repair healthcare.gov, the faulty Obamacare website, may be named to a leadership role on the pandemic, according to the people familiar with the matter -- a “Covid-19 czar.”Mandy Cohen, the North Carolina state health secretary, is a favorite for CMS, the people said. Biden’s choices to lead the Food and Drug Administration appear narrowed down to David Kessler, a former commissioner of the agency who is another co-chair of his coronavirus advisory board, and Joshua Sharfstein, a former FDA official who is a vice dean at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health.Biden announced his economic team on Tuesday, a group led by Treasury Secretary-designate Janet Yellen whose top priority will be restoring jobs eliminated by the pandemic. An announcement on some of his health team could come as soon as Monday, the people said.The people familiar with the matter asked not to be identified because talks are still ongoing and no final decision has been made. It’s not clear how many people will be announced at once, or which positions would later be filled by the health secretary once the Biden administration is in place.Biden’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The US recorded 158,000 new coronavirus infections on Monday and a record 205,000 cases three days earlier. Biden will take office as distribution of coronavirus vaccines ramps up, and he has warned that any delay in the transition to his administration could slow or complicate that endeavor.Lujan Grisham is seen as having an easier path to confirmation than Murthy, who has spoken out against gun violence as a public health threat and may draw strong opposition from Senate Republicans as a result, the people familiar with the matter said.Also Read | Joe Biden urges Congress to pass ‘robust package’ to deal with economic crisisIf he isn’t nominated to lead HHS, Murthy is under consideration as Covid-19 czar or another role, including a second stint as surgeon general, the people said. Murthy talks to Biden almost every day as co-chair of his advisory board and is seen as having influential supporters.Murthy and Zients have also represented Biden’s transition team on calls with current HHS officials, two of the people said.Biden’s team is still discussing what the White House coronavirus task force and Operation Warp Speed -- the Trump administration’s effort to fast-track vaccines -- will look like under the new administration.If Biden announces his health team next week, he may be just days ahead of the first emergency FDA approval of a coronavirus vaccine. President Donald Trump is planning a vaccine summit next week at the White House, while an FDA advisory panel is scheduled to meet on Dec 10 to discuss the shots.Vice President Mike Pence told governors this week that the vaccines could start being delivered as soon as the week of Dec 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-closes-in-on-top-health-leaders-as-covid-19-ravages-us/story-xN7nJtKZuC5ibAicepVsFL.html
02-12-2020||World||Chinese defence minister’s visit to Nepal, Pakistan made with eye on India, say experts||China’s actions during its defence minister’s recent visits to Nepal and Pakistan, including the signing of a defence agreement in Islamabad, were apparently made with an eye on India, experts and former diplomats said on Wednesday. Chinese defence minister Wei Fenghe began his tour of the region with a day-long visit on Sunday to Nepal, where he told the leadership in Kathmandu that China “firmly supports Nepal to safeguard the national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Wei’s next port of call was Pakistan, where the two sides signed a memorandum of cooperation (MoU) for enhancing defence cooperation. Wei met Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and discussed regional security and expressed appreciation for Islamabad’s efforts to secure the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). ALSO WATCH | ‘Faulty’: CSIR chief slams Chinese study on Covid’s Indian origin claims Bajwa too thanked Wei for China’s support to Pakistan on all key issues at regional and international forums. Experts and former diplomats believe these actions were taken by China clearly with an eye on the dragging border standoff with India, which is currently in its eighth month with little sign of an immediate breakthrough in the disengagement of troops and de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash, who closely tracks developments in the neighbourhood, said Wei’s visit to Nepal came at a time when relations between Kathmandu and New Delhi were returning to normal after a border row over Nepal’s new political map that included Indian territories. “China was letting Pakistan and Nepal know it is still with them and this was also a message to India,” Prakash said. The experts said Wei’s remarks about China helping Nepal protect its territorial integrity clearly appeared to have been made with the India-Nepal border row in mind, especially when the two countries are making efforts to tackle the issue. “We had a number of good visits to Nepal, including by the Indian Army chief and foreign secretary, and the relationship was on the mend. The Chinese want to keep Nepal attuned to Beijing’s priorities and within the Chinese orbit. They also want to keep the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) intact,” Prakash said, referring to rifts within Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s ruling party. China’s envoy to Nepal has often publicly interceded to iron out differences between Oli and his main rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, pointed to India’s outreach in recent months to key neighbours such as Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal – including several major development and connectivity projects and high-level visits – and said Wei’s visits to Kathmandu and Islamabad were meant to counter these efforts. “At a time when China is also facing criticism for its role in tackling Covid-19 in the initial stages, it wants to send out a message that it hasn’t vacated its space in India’s neighbourhood. China couldn’t send a senior minister, so sending a key general is the best case approach to ensure those who it believes are on its side remain there,” Patil said. Prakash added, “In Islamabad, the Chinese clearly wanted to add some steel to Pakistan’s spine. Besides, the Chinese have concerns about the pace of implementation of projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including CPEC, and they’re leaning on Gen Bajwa to ensure it remains on course.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-defence-minister-s-visit-to-nepal-pakistan-made-with-eye-on-india-say-experts/story-wuDC90A4TXWA0znGrLOCtI.html

The Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly in Response to the Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) Pandemic will take place on December 3 and 4 at the UN Headquarters. The world organisation said government leaders, United Nations’ principals and other relevant stakeholders would be able to engage in dialogue on the impact of the pandemic on people, societies and economies and discuss the multi-faceted, coordinated response required to address this crisis. Serum Institute of India Chief Executive Officer Adar Poonawalla will also address the session through a pre-recorded video on December 4. BioNTech co-founders Ugur Şahin and Ozlem Tureci, vaccine team leader at Oxford University Sarah Gilbert and Chief Executive Officer of GAVI (the vaccine alliance) Seth Berkley will address the special session virtually. AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford are working on a Covid-19 vaccine, while global drugmaker Pfizer and BioNTech announced their vaccine candidate is 95 per cent effective. World leaders expected to address the session are Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, French President Emmanuel Macron, Nepalese Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, German Chancellor Angela Merkel. President Donald Trump is not listed as a speaker for the session and US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar will address the high-level meeting. The two-day special session will allow many stakeholders to share their experiences in fighting the pandemic, reflect on the global response to date, and forge a united, coordinated, and people-centered path forward. The Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed more than 1.3 million lives and infected more than 54 million people globally, “is not only the greatest global health crisis since the creation of the United Nations 75 years ago, it is also a humanitarian, socio-economic, security and human rights crisis,” the world body said. The session’s first day will feature statements by the President of the General Assembly Volkan Bozkir, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, President of the Security Council for the month of December South African Ambassador Jerry Matthews Matjila and Chair of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries Ilham Heydar oglu Aliyev. The General Assembly will then hear from world leaders. According to the speakers list, there are 141 speakers inscribed, including 53 heads of state, 39 heads of government, four deputy prime ministers and 38 ministers. The second day will feature speeches from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and other UN and inter-governmental agencies. Bozkir’s Spokesperson Brenden Varma, replying to a question on whether it was far too late to hold the special session on Covid-19, said the President of the General Assembly agrees that it is already too late to have this meeting, which should have been held in the summer as the coronavirus cases were rapidly increasing across the world. Varma said member states have come together and decided to hold this special session on Covid-19. “And the point of this is to recommit to multilateralism,” he said. Currently there are a lot of responses to Covid-19, but the point of the session is to bring countries together, along with UN actors, the private sector and vaccine developers to work together to see “where we are, to take stock and to identify gaps and challenges and then to move forward together so we have a unified response that actually makes sense and that can actually combat this pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-leaders-to-address-special-session-of-unga-on-covid-19-pandemic/story-MqfNIIJS13HuGuG5cexUNO.html
02-12-2020||World||President again? Trump teases 2024 run at White House Christmas party||President Donald Trump teased running again for president in 2024 as he hosted a holiday reception at the White House on Tuesday evening.“It’s been an amazing four years,” Trump told the crowd, which included many Republican National Committee members. “We’re trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I’ll see you in four years.”The video of Trump’s appearance was streamed live on Facebook by one attendee, Pam Pollard, who is national committeewoman for the Oklahoma GOP. It showed dozens of people crammed into the Cross Hall of the White House state floor, standing closely together. Many seen in the video were not wearing masks.The Trumps began hosting holiday receptions this week, intent on celebrating a final season before Trump leaves office on Jan. 20. According to social media postings reviewed by The Associated Press, the events have featured large crowds of often maskless attendees gathered indoors — violating the very public health guidance the U.S. government has pressed the nation to follow this holiday season as cases of COVID-19 skyrocket across the country.In the video, Trump is heard continuing to air baseless allegations of election fraud to explain his defeat by President-elect Joe Biden despite his attorney general, William Barr, telling the AP earlier Tuesday that the Justice Department had not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud and had seen nothing that would change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.“It’s certainly an unusual year. We won an election. But they don’t like that,” Trump told the group, adding: “I call it a rigged election, and I always will.”The White House has been the site of at least one suspected COVID-19 superspreader event, and dozens of the president’s aides, campaign staffers and allies have tested positive in numerous outbreaks. Trump himself was hospitalized for the virus in October, and the first lady and two of his sons have tested positive. Numerous others have had to quarantine.Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s spokeswoman and chief of staff, had said last month that the White House would be moving forward with events, “while providing the safest environment possible.” She said that would include smaller guest lists, that “masks will be required and available, social distancing encouraged while on the White House grounds, and hand sanitizer stations throughout the State Floor.”“Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,” she added.___Miller reported from Wilmington, Del.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-again-trump-teases-2024-run-at-white-house-christmas-party/story-GtMsJqGHTOfAG0C641FgNL.html
02-12-2020||World||Donald Trump’s H-1B visa rule that hurt Indians scrapped by US judge||A US judge on Tuesday threw out two rules proposed by the Trump administration to narrow eligibility for H-1B visa aspirants and raise their salaries in an effort to make it tougher for companies, mostly in IT, to use this short-term employment programme to hire foreigner workers instead of local Americans.US district judge Jeffrey S. White of the Northern District of California ruled that the changes were introduced in a hurry and did not abide by the usual transparency obligations: provide notice and sufficient time for public comments. The administration had sought to rush it through in October arguing urgency - as a “good cause exception” - in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.“The court cannot countenance - reluctantly or otherwise - defendants’ reliance on the Covid-19 pandemic to invoke the good-cause exception,” White wrote. “The pandemic’s impact on the economy is the only reason DHS proffered as good cause, and defendants do not dispute that the failure to provide notice and comment was prejudicial.”ALSO WATCH | US President Donald Trump says ‘2020 election was probably least secure ever’ The United States issues 85,000 new H-1B visa every year. More than 70% of them go to Indian professionals hired by American companies such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft, and Indian IT services companies such as TCS, Wipro and Infosys.Many of them tend to stay on and graduate to permanent residency, or Green Cards, and eventually citizenship - such as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who came to the US to study on an F-1 visa, got hired by McKinsey on H-1B and went on to become a US citizen via the mandatory Green Card.“This ruling has many companies across various industries breathing a huge sigh of relief today,” said Jon Baselice, director of immigration policy for the US Chamber of Commerce in a statement. “Both of these rules had the potential to be incredibly disruptive to the operations of many businesses.”Among those breathing easier will be people at Nasscom, which represents Indian IT companies, some of whom have built substantial operations in the US using H-1B visas to bring workers from India. “These regulations seem to be based on misinformation about the programme and runs counterproductive to their very objective of saving the American economy and jobs,” it had said when the administration announced the new rules in October.In October, the administration announced two rules. One of them went into effect immediately – it raised salaries for H-1B to match those of Americans workers with similar qualifications, which was intended to deny companies from hiring foreign workers only because they were cheaper.The second rule was to go into effect after some days. It sought to narrow the eligibility for H-1B aspirants. A basic bachelor’s degree in anything wouldn’t be enough. For instance, a foreigner being hired for a job in computer engineering had to be a computer engineer.The Trump administration has had the H-1B programme in its crosshairs from the president’s first year in office, when he announced his “Buy American, Hire American” policies.Critics of the programme that allows two tranches of three-year work permits to principal H-1B visa holders and work authorisation for spouses, have argued that companies have used it to replace American workers with foreigners on lower salaries. The Trump administration agreed. While it tried to change the system incrementally, it accelerated them and with more far-reaching changes after Covid-19 struck early this year, causing widespread job losses. Trump suspended the programme and immigration to ensure Americans have the first shot at jobs becoming available as the economy recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-judge-strikes-down-donald-trump-s-rules-narrowing-h-1b-eligibility/story-BZTyzup99fIHx1RGx5556K.html

An acknowledgement of the burden that they will carry if we do not get this right and do not take action now,” Ardern told lawmakers in parliament. After an hour-long debate, a majority of parliamentarians voted in favour of the declaration. The main opposition National Party voted against it saying it was nothing but “virtue signalling”.New Zealand joins 32 other countries including Japan, Canada, France and Britain that have declared a climate emergency.Ardern, who returned to power in October delivering the biggest election victory for her centre-left Labour Party in half a century, has called climate change the “nuclear free moment of our generation”.Also Read | New Zealand joins Australia in denouncing China’s tweetIn her first term she passed a Zero Carbon Bill, which sets the framework for net zero emissions by 2050 with an exemption for farming, and banned new offshore oil and gas exploration.Nearly half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, mainly methane.The government on Wednesday promised the public sector will achieve carbon neutrality by 2025. Government agencies would have to measure and report emissions and offset any they can’t cut by 2025.The programme will be backed by a NZ$200 million ($141 million) fund to finance replacing coal boilers and help purchase electric or hybrid vehicles, it said.Greenpeace welcomed the declaration, but challenged the government to follow through with policy and action.“For Jacinda Ardern’s climate emergency declaration to be more than just words, that means tackling New Zealand’s largest source of climate pollution: agriculture,” said Greenpeace agriculture and climate campaigner Kate Simcock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-declares-climate-emergency-promises-carbon-neutral-government-by-2025/story-3eYCH0DzLnfMzgJkRy09zM.html

Since Nov. 17, more than 1,000 cases have been reported, only a few of which were brought from outside the city.That is prompting the government to raise penalties for failing to follow orders on mask wearing in public and for compulsory tests.Exceptions were made for some group gatherings, including a limit of 20 people for weddings and shareholder meetings, but religious activities and group travel would no longer be exempt.Hong Kong and Singapore, meanwhile, have called off a planned travel bubble until next year in response to the surge in Hong Kong cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-limits-most-gatherings-to-2-people-amid-surge-in-covid-cases/story-HMNxaG0FDJZtboHyOTTRAJ.html
02-12-2020||World||William Barr disputes Donald Trump’s claims of election fraud||US Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday said the justice department has found no evidence of widespread voting fraud to change the outcome of the 2020 election, delivering a big blow to President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn his defeat citing unfounded claims of poll fraud.Barr is a close Trump ally and has repeated and defended all of the president’s wild claims and allegations in the past. His clean chit on the elections was seen, therefore, as a stunning repudiation of his boss’s efforts to question it. He was seen at the White House after his remarks became public, but had his job intact till late in the evening.The attorney general told AP in an interview that department of justice prosecutors and FBI agents had followed up specific poll fraud complaints and information they had received, but “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election”.The attorney general also told AP he had named US attorney Bill Durham as special counsel to investigate the investigators of the 2016 election, allegations of Russian interference and collusion by the president or his campaign. As US attorney, a political appointee, he would have been removed by the Biden administration, but not as special counsel.Barr’s remarks were consistent with the assessment by the department of homeland security’s top election security official, Christopher Krebs, who said the “2020 election was the most secure in US history”. Trump subsequently fired him.President Trump himself hadn’t reacted publicly to Barr’s remarks. But his attorney Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis hit back in a statement, saying “there hasn’t been any semblance of a department of justice investigation” and that the lawyers had “gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined”.They have been unable to prove any of this so-called evidence in any court of law despite having filed more than three dozen lawsuits along with Republican allies.Seemingly undeterred by being fact-checked by his attorney general, Trump tweeted out a stream of TV clips of so-called witnesses speaking about election fraud at briefings and one legislative hearing that they claimed to have seen or experienced personally, which have failed, once again, to withstand scrutiny in court.President-elect Joe Biden, on the other hand, has continued to put together his administration publicly unaffected by Trump’s efforts to overturn the election. He introduced his economic team comprising Janet Yellen and Neera Tanden, picks for treasury secretary and director of the office of management and budget respectively, in Wilmington, Delaware.“Let me be clear, with this team and the others who we will add in the weeks ahead, we will create a recovery for all and get this economy moving again,” Biden said while introducing his team. “We will create jobs, raise incomes, reduce drug prices, advance racial equity across the economy, and restore the backbone of this country - the middle-class.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/william-barr-disputes-donald-trump-s-claims-of-election-fraud/story-AM5IYU24h9jhYMC2SvOXMP.html

Mr. President-elect, I know you’ve done the same. I saw that understanding during the last Great Recession and the Recovery Act that followed,” Yellen said. “And now we are facing historic crises again,” she said, adding the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout have caused much damage to American people and had a disproportionate impact “on the most vulnerable among us”. “Lost lives. Lost jobs. Small businesses struggling to stay alive or closed for good. So many people struggling to put food on the table and pay bills and rent,” she said.Also Read| US Election 2020: Meet the ‘trailblazers’ of Joe Biden’s economic team“It’s an American tragedy,” she added. “And it’s essential that we move with urgency. Inaction will produce a self-reinforcing downturn causing yet more devastation. And we risk missing the obligation to address deeper structural problems. Inequality. Stagnant wages, especially for workers who lack a college education.” Biden said no one is better prepared to deal with this crisis than Yellen. “She will be the first Treasury Secretary who was also Chair of the Federal Reserve, Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, and Chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors. Janet is one of the most important economic thinkers of our time,” he said.“She has spent her career focused on employment and the dignity of work. She understands what a job means to people and their communities. Respected across party lines and around the world, by Main Street and Wall Street. An educator, a mentor. Above all the daughter of a working-class Brooklyn neighborhood who never forgot where she came from,” Biden said.Also Read: Biden assembles administration as Trump cries foul in another call-in“Her husband, George, is pretty good too.

02-12-2020||World||Hungarian politician and member of European Parliament resigns, admits to attending Covid-19 ‘sex party’||A Hungarian European Parliament lawmaker on Tuesday admitted he was present at an illegal party broken up by Belgian police in central Brussels last week, following reports he took part in a COVID-19 lockdown sex orgy.Jozsef Szajer, an MEP with Hungary’s ruling ultra-conservative Fidesz party who resigned his seat on Sunday, acknowledged in a statement that he attended the party — but did not comment on Belgian media reports on its nature. He said police on the scene issued him a verbal warning and took him home.Belgian newspaper HLN and other media reported on Tuesday that police had disrupted a sex party attended by 25 people above a café, and that one attendee, a Fidesz MEP, had attempted to flee the scene but was apprehended. HLN said several diplomats were also present.The newspaper did not name the lawmaker but said he had resigned on Sunday — when Szajer stepped down.The Brussels prosecutor’s office confirmed to The Associated Press that police ended a lockdown party in a downtown Brussels flat on Friday evening after they were called because of a night-time disturbance. The office did not confirm that it was a group sex party and a Brussels police spokeswoman declined to comment.In a statement, the prosecutor’s office later said police found about 20 people in the apartment. After police checked their identities, two partygoers invoked diplomatic immunity,The prosecutor’s office added that a third man was arrested after a passer-by told police he tried to escape. Only identified as S.J., the man was unable to show I.D. and was escorted to his residence, where he produced a diplomatic passport.“The man’s hands were bloody. It is possible that he may have been injured while fleeing,” the prosecutor’s office said, adding that police found drugs in his backpack.All those who attended the party have been reported for violating anti-COVID measures banning social gatherings. In addition, a police report has been registered against S.J. for violation of the narcotics legislation.Szajer denied using drugs at the party, and said he offered to have an on-the-spot drug test taken, which police declined.“Police said an ecstasy pill was found. It’s not mine, I don’t know who placed it or how,” Szajer said in his statement.It was the latest in a series of scandals involving members of Fidesz, which has vocally heralded Hungary’s role in defending Christian family values. Hungary’s prime minister and head of Fidesz, Viktor Orban, is a prominent critic of the liberal political culture of Western Europe, and has laid his political power on a foundation of what he calls “illiberal” Christian democracy.Szajer, a Fidesz founding member, was one of the lead architects of Hungary’s new constitution in 2011, which was criticized by opponents for emblazoning conservative Christian ideology.In July, a Budapest court sentenced Fidesz member and former Hungarian ambassador to Peru Gabor Kaleta to a one-year suspended prison sentence and fined him for possessing more than 19,000 sexually explicit images of minors.In 2019, video was leaked of Fidesz politician Zsolt Borkai participating in an orgy on a yacht in the Adriatic Sea. Borkai, the mayor of a medium-sized city 70 miles from the capital of Budapest, was re-elected that month despite the scandal, and Fidesz said it considered the issue “a private matter.”In his statement Tuesday, Szajer apologized for breaking Belgian rules limiting social gatherings.“It was irresponsible on my part and I will suffer the penalties,” he wrote.___Petrequin reported from Brussels.

02-12-2020||World||Covid-19 cases found in US in 2019, weeks before China||Testing has found Covid-19 infections in the US in December 2019, according to a study, providing further evidence indicating the coronavirus was spreading globally weeks before the first cases were reported in China.The study published Monday identified 106 infections from 7,389 blood samples collected from donors in nine US states between Dec. 13 and Jan. 17. The samples, collected by the American Red Cross, were sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing to detect if there were antibodies against the virus.“The findings of this report suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infections may have been present in the US in December 2019, earlier than previously recognized,” the paper said.Reports of a mysterious pneumonia spreading in Wuhan, China, first emerged in late December 2019. After multiplying rapidly throughout the city in the following weeks, the disease spread across the globe, with the first US case emerging on Jan. 19.The revelations in the paper by researchers from the CDC reinforce the growing understanding that the coronavirus was silently circulating worldwide earlier than known, and could re-ignite debate over the origins of the pandemic.Also Read: United States: CDC to shorten Covid-19 quarantine to 10 days, 7 with testIt’s not the first evidence showing the virus could have existed or infected people outside China before 2020. A patient in France was found to have contracted the virus after being hospitalized with flu-like symptoms at the end of December, contradicting official statistics showing Covid-19 reached the country from people returning from Wuhan at the end of January.The CDC study indicated there were isolated infections in the western part of the US in mid-December. Antibodies were also found in early January in other states before the virus was known to have been introduced to those places.The scientists indicated it’s unlikely that the antibodies developed to curb other coronaviruses, as 84 samples were found to have neutralizing activity specific to SARS-CoV-2.They also noted it wasn’t possible to determine the magnitude of infections on a state or national level based on the samples, or whether the cases were locally transmitted or travel-related.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-found-in-us-in-2019-weeks-before-china/story-n6O2m35NgG1ErF0oPKO4AJ.html
02-12-2020||World||United States: CDC to shorten Covid-19 quarantine to 10 days, 7 with test||The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to shorten the recommended length of quarantine after exposure to someone who is positive for Covid-19, as the virus rages across the nation.According to a senior administration official, the new guidelines, which are set to be released as soon as Tuesday evening, will allow people who have come in contact to someone infected with the virus to resume normal activity after 10 days, or 7 days if they receive a negative test result. That’s down from the 14-day period recommended since the onset of the pandemic.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the announcement, said the policy change has been discussed for some time, as scientists have studied the incubation period for the virus. The policy would hasten the return to normal activities by those deemed to be “close contacts” of those infected with the virus, which has infected more than 13.5 million Americans and killed at least 270,000.While the CDC had said the incubation period for the virus was thought to extend to 14 days, most individuals became infectious and developed symptoms between 4 and 5 days after exposure.It’s not the first time that the CDC has adjusted its guidance for the novel coronavirus as it adjusted to new research. In July the agency shortened, from 14 days to 10, its advice on how long a person should stay in isolation after they first experience Covid symptoms — provided they’re no longer sick.The new guidance was presented Tuesday at a White House coronavirus task force meeting for final approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-cdc-to-shorten-covid-19-quarantine-to-10-days-7-with-test/story-ZbEv8eFHoG03kOVR6Tfi0M.html
02-12-2020||World||Judge throws out Trump administration rules limiting skilled-worker visas||A federal judge on Tuesday struck down two Trump administration rules designed to drastically curtail the number of visas issued each year to skilled foreign workers.The changes applying to the H-1B visa program announced in October include imposing salary requirements on companies employing skilled overseas workers and limits on specialty occupations. Department of Homeland Security officials deemed it a priority because of coronavirus-related job losses and estimated as many as one-third of those who have applied for H-1B’s in recent years would be denied under the new rules.US District Judge Jeffrey White in California said the government didn’t follow transparency procedures and its contention that the changes were an emergency response to pandemic job losses didn’t hold water because the Trump administration has floated the idea for some time but only published the rules in October.“The Covid-19 pandemic is an event beyond defendants’ control, yet it was within defendants’ control to take action earlier than they did,” White wrote.The US issues up to 85,000 H-1B visas each year in sectors including technology, engineering and medicine. Usually, they’re issued for three years and renewable. Most of the nearly 600,000 H-1B visa holders in the US are from India and China.The H-1B rules announced weeks before the election were part of President Donald Trump’s wider agenda to curb nearly all forms of immigration. In June, he issued an order temporarily suspending the H-1B program until the end of the year.The US Chamber of Commerce and universities including the California Institute of Technology sued in California, arguing there wasn’t adequate notice or time for the public to comment on the changes. They also said the rules, particularly related to requiring a prevailing wage for visa-holders, would have a drastic impact on new hires and “sever the employment relationship of hundreds of thousands of existing employees in the United States.” The University of Utah cited an example where an H-1B employee seeking renewal was paid an $80,000 salary but would have to be paid $208,000 under the new rule.The judge agreed that the federal government didn’t make a case for implementing the rules under the Administrative Procedure Act, which makes agencies accountable to the public by requiring a detailed process for enacting regulations.“Defendants failed to show there was good cause to dispense with the rational and thoughtful discourse that is provided by the APA’s notice and comment requirements,” White wrote.The rule on wages, proposed by the Department of Labor, took effect in October, while the Homeland Security rule on occupations and other issues was supposed to take effect Monday. It also would have placed limits on “offsite” firms that employ and contract out H-1B visa holders to other companies; their visas would have been limited to one year at a time.“This is incredibly important decision to preserve the H-1B program,” said attorney Paul Hughes, who represented the plaintiffs. “This ruling enables those individuals to maintain their jobs and their families in the United States.” The Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that the ruling “has many companies across various industries breathing a huge sigh of relief,” with the visa changes having “the potential to be incredibly disruptive to the operations of many businesses.” Messages left Tuesday for spokespeople with the Labor and Homeland Security departments weren’t immediately returned.The wage rule has prompted at least two other federal lawsuits in New Jersey and Washington, D.C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-throws-out-trump-administration-rules-limiting-skilled-worker-visas/story-WhtFgmltMNQYfy37oBmffN.html
02-12-2020||World||No evidence of widespread voter fraud, says US attorney general William Barr||U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Tuesday the Justice Department had found no evidence of widespread voter fraud in last month’s election, even as President Donald Trump kept up his flailing legal efforts to reverse his defeat.“To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,” Barr, a Trump appointee widely seen as loyal to the Republican president, told the Associated Press.Barr told federal prosecutors last month to pursue investigations into credible allegations of election fraud, but warned them to avoid probes into “fanciful or far-fetched claims.” Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump in the Nov. 3 election by 306 to 232 in the state-by-state Electoral College that chooses the president - the same margin that Trump declared a “landslide” when he won four years ago - as well as by more than 6.2 million ballots in the popular vote.Despite that, Trump has continued to claim loudly and without evidence that the election was marred by widespread fraud. Those claims that have been repeatedly rejected by state and federal officials.The Trump campaign’s legal team responded to Barr’s comments by saying the Justice Department did not do enough to investigate allegations of voter fraud. Trump’s campaign has had no success advancing election-fraud claims in court, but his continued complaints appear to have yielded political benefit as polls show a large percentage of Republicans now believe the election was not conducted fairly.A top election official in Georgia implored Trump to stop his baseless claims, saying they were leading to threats and potential acts of violence against him and other authorities.“Someone’s going to get hurt, someone’s going to get shot, someone’s going to get killed,” said Gabriel Sterling, manager for the state’s voting systems. “It has all gone too far. ... It has to stop.”In Wisconsin, Trump’s campaign asked the state’s top court to consider throwing out 221,000 absentee ballots that allegedly lacked information. Biden won that battleground state by about 20,000 votes. CORONAVIRUS AID Biden, for his part, has focused on setting up his administration before he takes office on Jan. 20. On Tuesday, he urged Congress to pass a coronavirus aid package that has been stalled for months, and promised more action to help the economy after he becomes president.At its peak over the summer, expanded federal unemployment benefits funneled some $12 billion weekly into individual bank accounts, money that propped up spending, padded savings and fueled rehiring. But those benefits are expiring by the end of this year, prompting calls for a more extended safety net while a coronavirus vaccine is rolled out. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Congress should include a fresh wave of stimulus in a spending bill that must be passed by Dec. 11. Separately, a bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a $908 billion relief bill aimed at breaking the deadlock.Biden said any such package passed by Congress before he takes over next month would be “at best just a start.” “My transition team is already working on what I’ll put forward in the next Congress to address the multiple crises we’re facing, especially our economic and COVID crises,” Biden said at an event in Wilmington, Delaware.He was speaking alongside his selections for senior economic roles, including his nominee for Treasury secretary, former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who said the pandemic and economic damage it caused in the United States was “an American tragedy.” Yellen would be the first female Treasury secretary.Other picks include Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton economist who would be the first Black woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers. Economists Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein would also serve on that council, which advises the president on economic policy.Biden has also chosen Neera Tanden, who heads the Center for American Progress think tank, to head the Office of Management and Budget. She would be the first woman of color to hold that post.The economic team’s makeup reinforces Biden’s view that a more aggressive approach to the economic recovery from the pandemic is required. Yellen, Rouse and Tanden would require Senate confirmation, and several Republicans in that chamber have said they oppose Tanden’s nomination. Control of the Senate will be decided in a pair of runoff election in Georgia on Jan. 5.The United States is in the grip of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with more than 4 million new cases and over 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported in November, according to a Reuters tally of official data.

The Republican Party currently has 50 Senators in the 100-member Senate, while the Democrats has 48.A Republican majority in the Senate along with the two wins in Georgia Senate race is essential for the party to maintain its hold in the national politics. The party has lost control of the White House and the House of Representatives.“Biden has promised to reverse the Trump admin’s immigration policies, halt all deportations, & introduce amnesty legislation for illegal immigrants on day 1,” Haley said.“The amnesty bill would send a clear signal to people across the world: Come to America illegally & get rewarded for it,” said the former two-term Governor of South Carolina. She was the first ever Cabinet-ranking official in any administration after President Donald Trump nominated her as the US Ambassador to the United Nations.A day earlier, Haley in a series of tweets was critical of the foreign policies of President-elect Biden.“Biden stated he wanted to return to the disastrous Iran deal that he helped orchestrate as VP. The Trump administration’s foreign policy made the Middle East safer & more secure. It would be a huge mistake for Biden to go running back into the arms of Iran’s ayatollahs,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-nikki-haley-slams-joe-biden-s-immigration-policy/story-kU7HLeqDH0MCS1A4ujnAHJ.html

They are expected to review Moderna’s candidate a week later.The distribution timeline described by Slaoui and US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar appeared to assume that the FDA’s authorization of the first vaccine would come within days of the December 10 meeting. But the head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Dr. Peter Marks, told patient advocacy groups last week that it might take “a few days to a few weeks” for his agency to render its decision.FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has likewise said the process could take longer than the Trump administration has suggested.Asked in a ABC News interview on Tuesday whether the vaccine could become available the week of December 15, Hahn said: “It is possible,” but noted, “it will depend on what sort of questions and data come out of the vaccine advisory committee.”The US Transportation Department said on Tuesday it has made preparations to enable the “immediate mass shipment” of Covid-19 vaccines and completed all necessary regulatory measures.A panel of advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday voted 13-to-1 to recommend that healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be first in line to receive initial doses of Covid-19 vaccines when they become available.The CDC will take the recommendation into account and provide guidance to the states to assist governors in their decisions about vaccine distribution priorities.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday complained about the lack of federal funding for vaccine distribution. He also criticized a data-sharing agreement put forward by the government that he said could “dissuade undocumented immigrants from taking the vaccine.” Cuomo expressed concern that data on those receiving the vaccine could end up in the hands of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Meanwhile, leading medical officials are pleading with Americans to abide by public health measures for slowing a pandemic that claimed 37,000 US lives just last month.A record nearly 96,000 Covid-19 patients were reported in US hospitals on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally. Hospitalizations and deaths are expected to spike even higher in the midst of the holiday travel season, a trend that officials have warned will push an already strained healthcare system to the breaking point.The monthly toll of US Covid-19 deaths are projected to nearly double in December to a pandemic-high of more than 70,000 and surpass 76,000 in January before ebbing in February, according to a widely cited model from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.The monthly record for US Covid-19 deaths of 58,740 was set in April.The pandemic and restrictions meant to stop it have ravaged the US economy.A bipartisan group of US lawmakers on Tuesday unveiled a $908 billion Covid-19 relief bill aimed at breaking months long deadlock between Democrats and Republicans over new emergency assistance for small businesses, unemployed people and industries.US nursing homes are experiencing the worst outbreak of weekly coronavirus cases since the spring, according to the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living (AHCA/NCAL).New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi urged at-risk residents to halt non-essential activities and stay in as much as possible as the city battles its second coronavirus wave.“This escalation unfortunately follows a tragically familiar pattern - cases grow, hospitalizations follow,” Chokshi said. “And, sadly, too many result in critical illness or even death.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-prepare-for-swift-vaccine-roll-out-as-covid-cases-surge/story-QqSxr7pD0uH5ERS3RJumeI.html
02-12-2020||World||Which Americans will get the coronavirus vaccine first?||The Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines could be approved in a matter of weeks, but who in the United States will get them first? A high level panel of US experts on Tuesday voted that health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be prioritized in the first phase.“I believe that my vote reflects maximum benefits, minimum harm, promoting justice and mitigating the health inequalities that exist, with regard to distribution of this vaccine,” said Jose Romero, chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.As the sequence continues though, US experts may differ from other countries in prioritizing “critical workers” who keep society running -- potentially even before people at highest risk. To be clear, there won’t be one single set of rules for the whole nation. At the risk of creating confusion, which was the case during the vaccine campaign against the H1N1 flu in 2009, the federal government only makes recommendations to states, which decide for themselves how to distribute the doses and who gets priority. Panels of top experts have already delivered their opinions, which diverge in certain key respects and reveal the tension at the centre of the debate: vaccines should both protect the most vulnerable and help facilitate a return to normal. It’s on the question of jumpstarting the economy as quickly as possible that the US may set itself apart.France’s top health authority recommended starting with retirement home residents and employees who work there, followed by the elderly and health care workers, then the over-50s, people whose jobs put them at risk, medically high-risk people, the poor, and finally the rest of the population.That’s the approach recommended by the World Health Organization and adopted by a number of rich countries, Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told AFP.In the US, the panel voted overwhelmingly in favour of prioritizing health care workers and long-term care facilities, which have accounted for about 40 percent of deaths in the country so far.The committee did not vote for what would happen after the initial phase, but experts have proposed to then give priority to essential workers in phase “1b,” followed by adults with multiple risk factors and adults over 65 in phase “1c.”Keeping the country runningEssential workers include teachers, workers from slaughterhouses to the supermarkets who keep Americans fed, and those who drive buses and trains, sell them their medicine, maintain order, or deliver mail and parcels. People in these jobs are often minority Hispanics or Black, and have been hit disproportionately by the pandemic.In practice, these ethical, epidemiological and economic considerations may be ignored in the initial rush on doses. Problems remain to be solved: though it may be easy to target retirement homes and hospitals, how are pharmacists and doctors supposed to confirm that a person is indeed an essential worker, or that they have two underlying conditions? The Trump administration has said that retirement homes will receive Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines as early as mid-December in the event of a regulatory green light.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/which-americans-will-get-the-coronavirus-vaccine-first/story-OBhe6VzYe8wK0UqShmeZaP.html
02-12-2020||World||Baby among 5 killed as car runs down shoppers in Germany||A baby was among five people killed when a car tore through a pedestrian shopping street in the southwestern German city of Trier on Tuesday, police said, after arresting the driver.Prosecutor Peter Fritzen said the driver, a 51-year-old Trier native, appeared to be suffering from “psychiatric problems” and had been under the influence of alcohol during the incident, in which 14 other people were hurt.Police said they had “no indications of a political motive” after questioning the suspect, and Fritzen said prosecutors were considering requesting he be placed in psychiatric care.At the same press conference, Trier mayor Wolfram Leibe said those killed when the man drove his SUV into the shoppers included a nine-month-old and a 73-year-old woman. “I think this is Trier’s darkest day since World War II,” he said.Also killed were a 25-year-old woman and a 45-year-old man. Police have not yet released details on the fifth victim. Malu Dreyer, premier of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate where Trier is located, expressed shock that a baby was among those killed by the driver’s “insane act” and shared her condolences with all the affected families.The baby’s mother was being treated in hospital for injuries sustained in the rampage.Witnesses had earlier described seeing people being flung into the air as the car struck them.‘Traumatised’ The incident started around 1250 GMT and ended within four minutes of the first emergency calls arriving, with police intercepting the driver after he turned off a main shopping street.Police said he had ploughed through the streets for between 600 metres and a kilometre, leaving behind a trail of destruction.Officers sealed off the area and cleared people from the centre of the city of about 110,000 people.Smartphone footage from an eyewitness showed the arrest of the driver, handcuffed and lying face down on the street being pinned down by several officers next to the damaged vehicle. In the evening, the cathedral bells were rung and a memorial service held for the victims.Joachim, accompanied by his teenage daughters Helena and Sophia, attended the service expressing their sadness.“We wanted to show our sympathy for those who lost their lives and those who lost a loved one,” Joachim said.An unnamed man who said he was a former neighbour of the suspect told NTV that the driver had a history of mental issues, as well as money worries and problems with his father.Christmas shopping Chancellor Angela Merkel voiced her “great sadness,” and said her thoughts were with the relatives of those who were “so suddenly and violently ripped from their lives” and with the injured, in a message shared by her spokesman. Early footage from the scene showed stunned shoppers huddling outside stores festooned with Christmas decorations as sirens blared in the distance.Broken glass and debris from stalls and outdoor displays were strewn along the cobbled street.Picturesque Trier, near the border with Luxembourg, traces its history back to the Roman Empire and is often called Germany’s oldest city. It is also the birthplace of Karl Marx.Although Germany is grappling with a second coronavirus wave that has forced restaurants, bars, sports and cultural centres to close, retailers have been allowed to stay open, and many people were out Christmas shopping.“It’s lucky that the Christmas market has been cancelled because of corona, or it could have been much worse,” witness Frederic Fries told Welt TV.The incident brought back memories of a truck rampage at a Berlin Christmas market in 2016 that killed 12 people, Germany’s deadliest Islamist attack to date.In January 2019, a German man injured eight people when he drove into crowds on New Year’s Eve in the western cities of Bottrop and Essen. He was later taken into psychiatric care.In April 2018, a German man ploughed his van into people seated outside a restaurant in the city of Muenster, killing five before shooting himself dead. Investigators later said he had mental health problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baby-among-5-killed-as-car-runs-down-shoppers-in-germany/story-fQZZK0luAbfc5knBTtPfxK.html
02-12-2020||World||Taiwan could be used as scapegoat by China: Foreign minister Wu||Amid growing tension between China and Australia, Taiwan has called on Canberra to help defend the island territory against threats from Beijing.Taiwan foreign minister Joseph Wu has warned that matters with China can escalate amid aggressive military activities, ABC News reported. He said that Taipei could be used as a scapegoat to relieve increasing pressures at home.“If you look at the Chinese military activities around Taiwan, it’s been intensifying. We see that the Chinese military vessels, as well as its military airplanes, cross into Taiwan’s ADIZ, especially in the southwest corner of Taiwan’s ADIZ almost on a daily basis,” Wu was quoted as saying by ABC News.“If an authoritarian country is facing domestic difficulties, the easiest way for them to keep the country together will be ... to find a scapegoat outside,” he added.The foreign minister has called on like-minded countries including Australia to back Taiwan against the Chinese “expansionism”.“I see like-minded countries like Japan and Australia and India and the United States can also work together to prevent China from further expansionism,” Wu said.This comes as a growing diplomatic dispute between China and Australia on trade, defence, and foreign policy matters.China continues to regard Taipei as a “breakaway province” and has said that it wouldn’t mind using force to claim it.In recent years it has also increased military drills around Taiwan, with almost 40 Chinese warplanes crossing the median line between the mainland.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the United States.

02-12-2020||World||Netanyahu rival Gantz threatens to end coalition, force election||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s chief governing partner on Tuesday said he would vote in favour of a proposal to dissolve their troubled coalition, accusing the Israeli leader of repeatedly breaking his promises and pushing Israel closer to its fourth election in two years.The announcement by Defense Minister Benny Gantz that he would vote in favour of a preliminary no-confidence measure on Wednesday did not immediately cause the government to collapse. Rather, it served as a warning by Gantz, who also holds the title of alternate prime minister, that he has run out of patience with Netanyahu and is ready to break up their alliance if a long-overdue budget isn’t passed immediately.A formal vote to dissolve the government could come as soon as next week, leaving the door open to last-minute negotiations.“The only one who can prevent these elections is the one who decided to have them — Netanyahu,” Gantz said in a nationally televised speech. “The burden of proof is on you.”Netanyahu’s Likud party and Gantz’s Blue and White battled to a stalemate in three consecutive elections before agreeing in May to form their coalition. Under the deal, Netanyahu is to serve as prime minister for the first 18 months before they trade places next November and make Gantz prime minister for another 18 months.The two rivals agreed to the power-sharing deal with the stated aim of steering the country through the twin health and economic crises caused by the coronavirus. But the government has been plagued by paralysis and infighting.Hovering over the disagreements is Netanyahu’s ongoing trial on corruption charges. Gantz accused Netanyahu out of acting out concerns for his “personal survival” and working to thwart the legal process as the coronavirus rages and hundreds of thousands of Israelis remain out of work and families struggle to get by.In his address, Gantz said he’d had “no illusions” about Netanyahu when he formed the government. He accused Netanyahu of blocking key appointments, delaying legislation and claiming credit for the accomplishments of others.“Netanyahu didn’t lie to me. He lied to all of you,” he added, looking straight into the camera.The biggest area of disagreement has been the failure to pass a budget. Their agreement called for passage of a budget by August. They then agreed to extend the deadline until Dec. 23, but no progress has been made. A failure to reach a deal would cause the government to automatically collapse and trigger a new election.Gantz, accusing Netanyahu of dragging out the talks for personal reasons, apparently does not want to wait that long.Once the budget is complete, Netanyahu would be forced to commit to their rotation agreement next year and yield power to Gantz. But if the government collapses, Netanyahu would remain as prime minister throughout the three-month election campaign and until a new coalition is formed.Fearing a new election is inevitable, Gantz appears to have concluded that it would be best for the vote to take place as soon as possible, when Netanyahu’s trial is underway and with the coronavirus still out of control.Netanyahu has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals in which he is accused of offering favors to wealthy media figures in exchange for positive news coverage about him and his family. The trial is expected to kick into high gear in February when a string of witnesses is scheduled to testify.Netanyahu, on the other hand, would benefit by further delaying the budget talks. That would give more time for the coronavirus vaccine to arrive and the economy to begin recovering next year, presumably giving him a better chance in elections.Opinion polls predict that Netanyahu’s Likud Party would still emerge as the largest party in parliament in the next election, but with far fewer seats than it currently has. Gantz’s Blue and White has plummeted even further, making it in both their interests to compromise and avoid a new election.In a video released ahead of Gantz’s speech, Netanyahu accused Blue of White of acting like “a government within the government” and urged his rival not to force a new election.“Benny, what needs to be done now is to make a U-turn from politics for the citizens of Israel,” he said. “This is what needs to be done now and I’m asking you to do it.”Gantz accuses Netanyahu of stalling the approval of appointments of key judiciary and law-enforcement officials, in hopes that a new election might allow him to bring together a friendlier coalition that could appoint officials more inclined to delay the trial or dismiss the charges altogether.Opposition leader Yair Lapid, the sponsor of the bill to dissolve the government, welcomed Gantz’s speech.“Six months after the formation of this bloated and disconnected government, it is clear to everyone that Netanyahu can’t lead Israel out of the corona crisis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-rival-gantz-threatens-to-end-coalition-force-election/story-scb0OSFs2rlxtsztmMtIEL.html

His remarks came as a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate unveiled a $908 billion stimulus proposal Tuesday in an effort to break a months-long impasse that’s now threatening to tip the economy back into contraction.“Right now the full Congress should come together and pass a robust package for relief,” Biden said. “Any package passed in a lame duck session is lucky to be at best, just a start.”Biden said his transition team is working on his own proposed legislation for the incoming Congress to address both the economic recovery and the coronavirus pandemic. “We need to support small businesses and entrepreneurs who form the backbone of the communities that we live in that are teetering on the edge,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-urges-congress-to-pass-robust-package-to-deal-with-economic-crisis/story-2f0TnoV8Hm0maP5LvgFkpM.html
02-12-2020||World||US urged to do more against rising China threat||The US should ratchet up its demands of China to include equal access for companies and media, stricter monitoring of Beijing’s activities at the UN and preventive action to safeguard American interests in technology and finance, a bipartisan panel told Congress on Tuesday.A 575-page report by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, created by Congress to track and anticipate threats from China, characterized the world’s second-largest economy as a threat to the current international order that has American values at its core. And it said China’s leaders view those values as a barrier to the country’s external ambitions and an existential threat to their rule.“Chinese leaders’ assessment of the United States as a dangerous and firmly committed opponent has informed nearly every facet of China’s diplomatic strategy, economic policy, and military planning in the post-Cold War era,” the panel said.Amid a continuing US effort to roll back China’s dominance in next-generation 5G communications, the role of technology emerges as a clear theme throughout the annual report. The study said Beijing uses the establishment of technical standards as a way to “advance an alternative technological order.”It also warned that China’s effort at financial opening was part of a “calculated strategy” to secure foreign investment inflows and use them to shore up the domestic economy. This would increase exposure to unique risks in China’s financial system for foreign investors, the report said.“China is an adversary presenting unique and immediate threats to our economic and security interests,” Robin Cleveland, chairman of the commission, said in an opening statement. Cleveland said the report reflected “an understanding that the challenges posed by the Chinese Communist Party are not partisan – they are American concerns.”The analysis also looked at areas including military capabilities, trade relations, public health and Covid-19-related issues, as well as Taiwan and Hong Kong.Beijing’s national security law for the former British colony had “significantly compromised” the rule of law and press freedom, the report found. “Under growing pressure from the CCP, the territory’s judicial system has been thrown into crisis as judges are compelled to adopt mainland legal principles and CCP positions,” the report said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.A statement from Hong Kong’s government described the report as “yet another example” of US interference in Hong Kong’s affairs, using “democracy and self-determination as an excuse.” The statement continued, saying “such groundless and unjust political maneuvers will achieve nothing but undermining Hong-Kong-US relations and hurting the US’s own interests.”Competition between the US and China had intensified under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, the authors wrote, and they argued that the time for action is now.“If Beijing succeeds in normalizing its views of governance, the result could undermine individual rights around the world,” the commission said. “Underestimating Beijing’s intent to revise the international order based on its current capabilities risks delaying a response until it is already too late to preserve the liberal international order.”The report makes 19 recommendations, highlighting 10 of those as being of “particular significance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-urged-to-do-more-against-rising-china-threat/story-Cx4EyPJX2fELCEvx3qL9kL.html
02-12-2020||World||Trump family urges US appeals court to move lawsuit against them to arbitration||A lawyer for Donald Trump on Tuesday urged a federal appeals court to halt a lawsuit accusing the US president of exploiting his family name to promote a marketing scam targeting poor and working-class people.The lawyer, Thomas McCarthy, told the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan the plaintiffs were “done in by the allegations of their own complaint,” and that their proposed class action concerning the multi-level marketing company American Communications Network belonged in arbitration.Four plaintiffs, including a hospice worker, accused Trump, his adult children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka and an affiliate of their family company of promoting ACN in exchange for millions of dollars in secret payments from 2005 to 2015.The plaintiffs said ACN charged $499 to sell videophones and other goods, and the Trump family conned them into thinking Donald Trump believed their investments would pay off.Trump and his children have called the civil lawsuit, one of many against the president, politically motivated, saying they had no control over ACN and that Trump’s endorsement was merely his opinion.Some defendants prefer arbitration to litigation because evidence can be harder to come by, costs can be lower, and proceedings are often confidential.US District Judge Lorna Schofield refused in April to send the ACN case to arbitration, saying the plaintiffs had no reason to believe their arbitration agreements with ACN covered the Trumps.In Tuesday’s arguments before a three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Denny Chin appeared to agree with Schofield’s conclusion that it was unfair for the Trumps to demand arbitration only after she had dismissed a racketeering claim.“You waited eight months before asking to compel arbitration,” Chin told McCarthy. “You requested and obtained substantive relief. In those circumstances, why isn’t the right to arbitration, to the extent it exists, waived?”McCarthy responded that the claims against the Trumps and ACN were intertwined, that only “minimal” time had passed, and that the lawsuit was still in its early stages.Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, countered that arbitration is “fundamentally a matter of consent,” and that her clients never expected to battle the Trumps in arbitration.“This is a fraud case,” she said. “This is about what Donald Trump said.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-family-urges-us-appeals-court-to-move-lawsuit-against-them-to-arbitration/story-iLv98YbpgMokbcy35o8CJK.html
02-12-2020||World||China successfully lands spacecraft on moon to retrieve lunar rocks: State media||A Chinese probe sent to the Moon to bring back the first lunar samples in four decades successfully landed on Tuesday, Beijing’s space agency said.China has poured billions into its military-run space programme, with hopes of having a crewed space station by 2022 and of eventually sending humans to the Moon.The latest mission’s goal is to shovel up lunar rocks and soil to help scientists learn about the Moon’s origins, formation and volcanic activity on its surface.The Chang’e-5 spacecraft, named for the mythical Chinese moon goddess, “landed on the near side of the Moon late Tuesday,” state media agency Xinhua reported, citing the China National Space Administration.If the return journey is successful, China will be only the third country to have retrieved samples from the Moon, following the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s.The probe entered the Moon’s orbit on Saturday after a 112-hour journey from Earth, Xinhua said, after a rocket carried it into space from China’s southern Hainan province last week.It is to collect two kilogrammes (4.5 pounds) of surface material in a previously unexplored area known as Oceanus Procellarum, or “Ocean of Storms”, which consist of a vast lava plain, according to the science journal Nature.The collection will take place over the course of one lunar day, equivalent to around 14 Earth days.Its lunar samples will then be returned to Earth in a capsule programmed to land in northern China’s Inner Mongolia region later in December, according to US space agency NASA.The mission is technically challenging and involves several innovations not seen during previous attempts at collecting moon rocks, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics researcher Jonathan McDowell told AFP last month.Under President Xi Jinping, plans for China’s “space dream”, as he calls it, have been put into overdrive.The new superpower is looking to finally catch up with the US and Russia after years of belatedly matching their space milestones.A Chinese lunar rover landed on the far side of the Moon in January 2019 in a global first that boosted Beijing’s aspirations to become a space superpower.The latest probe is among a slew of ambitious targets set by Beijing, which include creating a super-powerful rocket capable of delivering payloads heavier than those NASA and private rocket firm SpaceX can handle, a lunar base and a permanently crewed space station.China’s astronauts and scientists have also talked up manned missions to Mars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-successfully-lands-spacecraft-on-moon-to-retrieve-lunar-rocks-report/story-5h5elkUs8jRiWbR3FXTzFJ.html
02-12-2020||World||Republicans oppose nomination of Neera Tanden; call her the worst nominee of Biden so far||US President-elect Joe Biden nominating Indian-American Neera Tanden as his Director for Office of Management and Budget has run into trouble with some of the top Republican Senators openly opposing the pick due to her “combative and insulting comments” about many members of the Senate.Tanden, 50, if confirmed by the Senate, would be the first woman of colour and first Indian-American to lead the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The OMB serves the President of the United States in overseeing the implementation of his vision across the Executive Branch. Specifically, OMB’s mission is to assist the President in meeting his policy, budget, management, and regulatory objectives, and to fulfil the agency’s statutory responsibilities.Tanden’s career has focused on pursuing policies designed to support working families, foster broad-based economic growth, and curb rampant inequality.Also Watch l ‘Trump one of the most irresponsible presidents in American history’: Joe Biden Influential Senator John Cornyn, who is also co-chair of the Senate India Caucus, described Tanden as the worst nominee of Biden so far and said: “I think in light of her combative and insulting comments about many members of the Senate, mainly on our side of the aisle, that it creates certainly a problematic path to confirmation.” In an interaction with reporters, Cornyn said that Tanden “deleted a lot of her previous tweets in the last couple of weeks which seems pretty juvenile, as if people won’t have access to it.” “I’m a little surprised that he would do that and not even consult with any Republicans. Some of this can be avoided with a little bit of a heads up and consultation,” Cornyn said.In a tweet he alleged that Tanden deleted more than 1,000 tweets, including criticism of Republicans.The Republican Party has 50 senators in the 100-member US Senate, with the Democrats having 48 in their kitty. Elections for the two Senate seats in Georgia are scheduled for January 5.Tanden, who has 313,400 followers on Twitter, where she is quite active, had been very critical of the Republican senators and President Donald Trump in the past.In one of her tweets, Tanden had referred to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as “Moscow Mitch.” She is reported to have deleted many of her tweets that were critical of Republican Senators.According to The Washington Examiner, Tanden has deleted over a thousand tweets in anticipation of a tough confirmation vote.“Tanden’s deleted tweets include, for example, multiple posts expressing disapproval of Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a centrist Republican who has been known to vote with Democrats on some issues and is considered a “swing” vote.Yet, she left a 2018 tweet that calls Collins “pathetic” for supporting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination in the Senate,” the daily said.  Republican Whip Senator John Thune alleged that Tanden has been pretty partisan in some of her previous positions and in many cases with respect to Republican senators who have to vote on her potential nomination.Senator Rick Scott from Florida alleged that Tanden is a big-government, big-spending radical liberal who’s a terrible choice for OMB Director.“It’s just more proof that Biden and the Democrats will continue to move further and further to the Left,” he said.However, a few top Democratic senators also appreciated her nomination.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, speaking on the Senate floor, alleged that the Republicans are twisting themselves into pretzels to explain their reflexive opposition to these outstanding selections.“Neera Tanden, who would be the first woman of colour to ever run the Office of Management and Budget, is so eminently qualified that some on the Republican side—grasping at straws—have taken issue with comments made on twitter criticising the policy positions of Republicans in Congress,” Schumer, a Democrat, said.“Honestly, the hypocrisy is astounding. If Republicans are concerned about criticism on Twitter, their complaints are better directed at President Trump, who has made a hobby out of denigrating Republican Senators on twitter. I fully expect to see some crocodile tears spilled on the other side of the aisle over the President-elect’s cabinet nominees. But it will be very tough to take those crocodile tears seriously,” Schumer said.Senator Mazie K Hirono said that Tanden is a highly qualified nominee whose professional and lived experience makes her an accomplished choice to lead OMB.“As someone who relied on food stamps and public housing growing up, Neera understands the transformational role and responsibility of government programmes to help individuals and families across our country,” the Democratic Senator said.House Majority Leader Steny H Hoyer said that he has worked closely with Tanden for a number of years.“I know that she will be a tremendous asset to President-elect Biden as he works with Congress to invest in a stronger economy for all Americans,” the Democratic Party leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-oppose-nomination-of-neera-tanden-call-her-the-worst-nominee-of-biden-so-far/story-KBbLBfQpiPxA4JXPp5UdlL.html
