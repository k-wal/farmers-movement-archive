In a tweet, they reiterated that “no foul play is suspected” and that they have “updated the family” in this regard.However, in an open letter, a group of organisations has urged the Canadian government “to undertake immediate and thorough investigation, bring the perpetrators to justice, and take just, diplomatic and political course of action in case any foreign country or group were found to be involved in the brutal murder of this human rights activist”.Canada’s permanent representative to the UN, Bob Rae, has expressed grief over Karima’s sudden demise, tweeting, “I had the honour and pleasure of meeting Karima Baloch to discuss the human rights situation affecting many of her friends and family. I am deeply saddened to learn of her death, and express my deepest condolences to her family and her community.”No evidence has yet emerged or been offered by investigators on whether indeed she was murdered. However, the statement asserted “that given the threats to her life by Pakistani authorities because of her political activism, a much thorough investigation” into the incident was warranted.The organisations issuing the statement include Baloch National Movement, Balochistan National Party - Canada, World Sindhi Congress - Canada, Pashtun Council Canada, and PTM Committee Canada. They represent dissident groups agitating against Islamabad.With regard to their demand for a thorough investigation, the signatories also said that “any lack of concrete action to this end might jeopardise the global image that Canada has”.They added that this episode “reminded” them of the death of Sajid Husain, a Baloch journalist forced into exile in Sweden “after covering violence, crime and a simmering insurgency in Pakistan”. He was found dead on April 23, 2019 in north of Stockholm, after remaining missing for more than a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-linked-groups-in-canada-seek-probe-into-baloch-activist-s-mysterious-death-in-toronto/story-fogfHMf3tKA3tqwCjQFHrJ.html

Most soft commodities advanced as a weaker dollar boosted the appeal of assets priced in the greenback.In the week ended Dec. 17, US export sales of upland cotton more than tripled from a year earlier, government data showed. China has boosted purchases to meet commitments under a trade deal, while its economy rebounds.The US Department of Agriculture cut its forecast for the domestic crop several times after adverse weather, including drought and hurricanes, eroded supply prospects. Futures have jumped 57% from the lowest in a decade on April 1. A surge in soybean and corn prices signals cotton acreage may ebb next year, Peter Egli, a Chicago-based director for Plexus Cotton Ltd., said in a report.“Export demand has held strong despite stay-at-home orders and weaker economies around the world,” Jack Scoville a vice president at Price Futures Group in Chicago, said in an email. “Traders now hope for even more demand later” as coronavirus vaccines are distributed and consumer demand recovers, he said.Cotton for March delivery rose 1.3% to 75.79 cents a pound at 12:34 p.m. on ICE Futures US in New York. Last week, the price reached 77.41 cents, the highest for a most-active contract since April 2019.Brazil, the second-largest exporter, faces a smaller harvest and higher domestic demand, while Pakistan, a major importer, is boosting purchases after a drop in production.Raw sugar, arabica coffee and cocoa climbed in New York.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cotton-futures-rise-with-chinese-purchases-pacing-us-exports/story-xBGwG7Cu9N6fzkCiPqtzXM.html
23-12-2020||World||‘Highly concerning’: UK identifies new South African coronavirus variant, tightens lockdown||Two cases of another new strain of Covid-19 linked to South Africa have been identified in the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed here on Wednesday. Like the UK variant identified earlier, the new variant of the novel coronavirus is also driving a massive resurgence of the disease in South Africa, with experts warning the country is probably facing a much larger second wave. “Both [cases of the new variant] are contacts of cases who have travelled from South Africa over the past few weeks,” Hancock said, addressing a briefing from 10 Downing Street. “This new variant is highly concerning because it is yet more transmissible and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK,” he said.The minister confirmed immediate restrictions on travel from South Africa and the government’s urgent message being for anyone who has been in South Africa or been in contact with someone linked with the country in the last fortnight to immediately quarantine.Analysis on the new mutation and its trajectory in the UK is meanwhile being analysed by scientific experts at Porton Down, the country’s specialist laboratory in south west England.As a result, even more parts of the UK are set to be put under the strictest level of lockdown after ministers held talks earlier on Wednesday following the UK registering 36,804 positive coronavirus cases, the largest daily number of infections recorded at any time during the pandemic. Millions more in the east and south-east England will be placed into the Tier 4 highest alert level from December 26, celebrated as Boxing Day the day after Christmas, as the new UK variant of coronavirus continues to show high transmissibility.The minister also revealed that the Oxford University vaccine being produced by AstraZeneca has submitted its full data package for regulatory approval, even as the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine rollout continues. “I know how hard 2020 has been for everybody… But we mustn’t give up now we know that we can control this virus we know we can get through this together… I know from the bottom of my heart, that there are brighter skies ahead,” he said.The briefing comes as the new variant identified in the UK last week, named VUI-202012/01 and with much higher transmissibility, led to several countries including India cutting off transport links with the UK in an effort to try and contain its spread outside Britain.The backlog of lorries built up on the UK border with France have now begun to gradually clear up after an agreement was reached.France agreed to lift its ban on UK arrivals on the condition of a negative coronavirus test. However, there have been reports of scuffles on the UK-France border as truckers face days ahead before the nearly 1,500 lorries can start moving towards their destinations.During what is an annual festive and holiday period in the UK with Christmas and New Year, millions in the country have had their plans to meet friends and family scuppered after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson abandoned a planned five-day “Christmas bubble” after scientists confirmed the new Covid-19 variant was spreading more rapidly.Under the revised rules, only people living in tiers one to three are permitted to socialise in a bubble of three households on December 25 for Christmas Day. Those in Tier 4 areas must only celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubble. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. The Opposition Labour Party has accused Johnson of having “always been behind the Covid curve” and urged him to move quickly. “If the scientific advice is tougher restrictions, don’t sit on it for weeks like you did last time, don’t dither, don’t delay – because that has disastrous consequences, take the action that is needed now to save lives,” said Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth. However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has written to Johnson to say his party will back any government moves to tighten restrictions if that is what scientists recommend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highly-concerning-uk-identifies-new-south-african-coronavirus-variant-tightens-lockdown/story-55ZimkpCdUhShBq132OD3N.html
23-12-2020||World||UK, EU on the brink of ‘historic’ post-Brexit trade accord||The U.K. and European Union are on the brink of sealing a historic post-Brexit trade accord, with officials hopeful a deal could be struck as soon as Wednesday.Negotiators from the two sides are in the very final phases of the talks, officials said. Discussions are still continuing on fisheries, the biggest obstacle to an accord. It’s still possible, one official cautioned, that the deal could fall apart.Sterling advanced by as much as 1.6% to $1.3571, the biggest intraday gain in more than a week. The yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds was poised for the biggest gain since March.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have intervened personally in recent days, holding several phone conversations in a last-ditch bid to reach an agreement before the U.K. leaves the single market at the end of the month.If they can pull off an accord, it would draw a line under almost five years of often tempestuous negotiations since the U.K. voted to withdraw from the EU in 2016 and lay the foundations for Britain to trade and collaborate with the bloc going forward. Hundreds of trucks backed up around the southern English port of Dover earlier this week had offered a sobering reminder of the potential consequences of ending Britain’s transition period on Dec. 31 without a deal.Read More: Isolated U.K. Seeks to Reopen Trade Route After Days of ChaosNegotiations resumed early on Wednesday in the commission’s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels, with discussions focused on what access EU boats will have to British waters, and what rights the EU will have to impose retaliatory tariffs should the U.K. limit that access in the future.Both sides have made an agreement on fishing a precondition for any wider deal over their future relationship, even if the 650 million euros ($790 million) of fish European boats catch in U.K. waters each year is a fraction of the 512 billion euros of goods traded annually between Britain and the EU.Michel Barnier, the bloc’s chief negotiator, told a meeting of ambassadors from the 27 EU member states Tuesday that there had been progress in the talks, and a deal could be signed before Christmas -- if the British are prepared to compromise further on fishing, according to diplomats briefed on the discussions. The talks could continue beyond Christmas, or fail completely, he told the private meeting.Senior EU officials said the decision lies with Johnson, while people familiar with the British side said the onus was on the Europeans to move.Diplomats in the EU’s working group have discussed how a potential agreement could be put into effect by Jan. 1 even though there isn’t enough time for formal ratification by the EU Parliament. While such procedural preparations aren’t in themselves proof a deal has been reached, they signal that the bloc is preparing for one.If an agreement is struck, the commission will publish the draft unofficial text and send it to member states and the European Parliament, according to a diplomat briefed on the preparations. EU government envoys in Brussels will have two days to discuss and approve the draft, according to the plan. Then a written procedure for the signing of the free trade agreement will follow, so that it can be published in the official journal of the European Union by Dec. 31.(Updates with pound in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-on-the-brink-of-historic-post-brexit-trade-accord/story-H4TbdHkbnQC2BdUdPfWcXN.html
23-12-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson imposes ‘strictest’ Covid-19 curbs in several more areas||Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed tougher regulations across a swath of England in an effort to stamp down on the mutant strain of coronavirus that’s spreading quickly across the country.Sussex, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, most of Hampshire and the remainder of Essex will now face the strictest rules under the government’s 4-tier system, from 00:01 a.m. on Dec. 26, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Wednesday in a press conference.They join London and southeast England, meaning non-essential shops will have to close and socializing is further curtailed.The new variant “is spreading at a dangerous rate,” said Hancock, putting the rise in cases in the past week at 57%. “The direction is clear and in many cases quite stark.”The government is struggling to bring the virus back under control after the new mutant strain began spreading rapidly in London and surrounding areas. After an England-wide lockdown last month halted growth in infections, the virus has since started spreading exponentially again, risking overwhelming the National Health Service as cases tick upwards.The new coronavirus variant, which emerged in southeast England in September, has alarmed scientists and governments around the world because early analysis suggests it may be as much as 70% more transmissible than other circulating strains. Countries including France temporarily suspended travel from the U.K. in response.Hancock also said that two new cases of an even more transmissible variant originating in South Africa have so far been detected in the U.K. He told people who have recently returned form South Africa to go into quarantine.(Updates with locations moved up a tier in table.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-imposes-strictest-covid-19-curbs-in-several-more-areas/story-jyLWESXGNvm9BpE3CpA1mL.html

It needs to be stored and shipped frozen, but does not require the ultra-cold temperatures of the shot that Pfizer developed with German partner BioNTech.“After a thorough, independent review of the evidence, it has determined that the Moderna vaccine meets the department’s stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements,” the health ministry said in a statement.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Dec. 15 that Canada had signed a deal to receive up to 168,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine before the end of the year.A second wave of Covid-19 is sweeping across Canada and medical officials in some parts of the country say the health care system is under dangerous strain.

In a Twitter post, Estonia’s Defence Ministry called the move “important & highly appreciated news”Washington has provided military assistance before to the three Baltic nations, which are the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members. However, the Estonian ministry said this was the first time the aid is being allocated through a dedicated program, the Baltic Security Initiative.Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are former Soviet republics which joined NATO in 2004. All three countries border Russia.“The decision by the US Congress demonstrates that our strongest ally is committed to the defence of our region and understands the security challenges here,” Estonian Defence Minister Juri Luik said in a statement.He said the measure confirmed that “the United States sees Estonia and the Baltic states as trustworthy allies who take their commitment to defence seriously” by investing into their national defence capabilities and contributing to NATO operations.The Defence Ministry noted that the US has maintained an active military presence in the Baltic region this year and Estonia’s military held multiple joint exercises with the US Army, Air Force, and Navy.From late September to early November, the US Cyber Command held a joint operation with Estonia to help the nation search out and block potential cyber-threats from Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-grants-169m-in-military-aid-to-baltic-nations-for-2021/story-Rj2lmJUiYm3BySKi96QNdL.html
23-12-2020||World||US Covid-19 relief bill has new law providing for up to 10 years in prison for illegal streaming||A piece of legislation has been added to the much-awaited Covid-19 stimulus bill, passed by the US Congress after months of negotiation, that severely punishes streamers who pirate large amounts of copyrighted content. Earlier this month, Senator Thom Tillis, chairman of the senate judiciary subcommittee on intellectual property, introduced the ‘Protecting Lawful Streaming Act’ which provides for up to 10 years of imprisonment in case of multiple violations. However, the law doesn’t target casual internet users who use illegal streaming services or “access pirated streams or unwittingly stream unauthorized copies of copyrighted works.” Tillis’ office had stated that it “would apply only to commercial, for-profit streaming piracy services.” The bill has been co-sponsored by five Democratic and four Republican senators.“The shift toward streaming content online has resulted in criminal streaming services illegally distributing copyrighted material that costs the US economy nearly $30 billion every year, and discourages the production of creative content that Americans enjoy,” Tillis had said in a statement.Also Read | Trump threatens to torpedo Covid relief with new demandsThe Republican senator highlighted that the legislation is narrowly targeted to punish criminal organisations, adding that no individual streamer has to worry about the fear of prosecution. He said the bipartisan legislation also has support from two groups including Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group.In a separate statement, Public Knowledge said that although there is no need for further criminal penalties for copyright infringement, the bill is “narrowly tailored” and avoids criminalising casual internet users who may click on a link, or upload a file. Meredith Rose, senior policy counsel at Public Knowledge, stated that the law also does not criminalise streamers who may include unlicensed works as part of their streams.“We appreciate Senator Tillis’ decision to release the text of his proposal, and his leadership in bringing in consumer groups to the table, listening to our concerns, and working to prevent risk to end users and legitimate streamers and streaming platforms,” Rose added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-relief-bill-has-new-law-providing-for-up-to-10-years-in-prison-for-illegal-streaming/story-xFFgQUKIk586Nt3JTkyNiI.html
23-12-2020||World||Pakistan Democratic Movement holds rally in Mardan despite govt restrictions||Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an 11-party alliance, held a rally in Mardan on Wednesday despite a ban imposed by the district administration amid the COVID-19.The district administration had decided not to allow the opposition leaders to hold the public procession given the rising numbers of coronavirus infections across the country, according to Geo News.Responding to the PDM’s call for protest, Mardan deputy commissioner warned that action will be taken against the protesters.The protesters, led by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) and PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, PML-N Vice-President Maryam Nawaz, and senior PPP leader Yousuf Raza Gilani, gathered at Gaju Baba Khan flyover, Geo News reported.Awami National Party Ameer Haider Khan Hoti, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, Aftab Sherpao of the Qaumi Watan Party, and other opposition leaders are scheduled to address the rally.This comes after the PDM demanded Prime Minister Imran Khan-led government to quit by January 31 or face intensified movements by opposition parties such as a long march to Islamabad.“The meeting in Mardan would be followed by another public meeting in Larkana on December 27 on the eve of the death anniversary of Benazir Bhutto,” The News International quoted Mian Iftikhar Hussain, PDM spokesman, as saying.The PDM decided to focus on smaller cities for the public meeting. The protest will be held in Bahawalpur on December 30, Malakand on January 3, 2021, Bannu on January 6, Khuzdar on January 9, Loralai on January 13, Tharparkar on January 16, Faisalabad on January 18, Sargodha on January 23, and Sialkot on January 27.In the past months, Khan has stepped up his efforts to silence the voice of the PDM, along with thousands of people, who criticised the government. Despite such attempts, the PDM has held five such rallies in Multan, Peshawar, Gujranwala, Karachi, and Quetta since October 16.

23-12-2020||World||Britain approves use of Covid-19 self-test kit||Britain on Wednesday approved using a Covid-19 self-test kit endorsed by its state-run health service to detect asymptomatic cases, as it mulls further restrictions to stem the spread of a highly infectious variant of the virus.The government has said it wants to start mass testing people as part of its strategy for tracking and tracing infections with cases spiking and as it battles the new variant.It had launched a mass-testing pilot scheme in the northwest city of Liverpool in November, offering everyone tests whether or not they had symptoms, in an attempt to find a new way to use testing to limit the spread of the coronavirus.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that the kit uses an antigen lateral flow test (antigen LFT), which can give results in 30 minutes.Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised a “world-beating” national test-and-trace system earlier this year, whereby people with symptoms get tested and the contacts of positive cases are asked to self-isolate.But the broader NHS Test and Trace system has been heavily criticised following a series of high-profile failures since its launch earlier this year, and government ministers have conceded it has not performed as well as they had hoped.Britain also began testing truckers for Covid-19 on Wednesday as Paris and London agreed that drivers carrying a negative test result could board ferries for Calais after much of the world shut its borders to Britain to contain the new mutated variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-approves-use-of-covid-19-self-test-kit/story-LavJfUF4Vz3uJbLKgXVO9M.html

It has not been possible to reach him for comment.Speaking earlier on Wednesday, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung, said 170 of the woman’s contacts had tested negative for the virus, while three others are awaiting results.Taiwan has reported a total of 777 cases - mostly imported - and seven deaths. Around 130 people remain in hospital for treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-s-eva-air-sacks-pilot-blamed-for-rare-local-covid-19-case/story-nIxanGXGPafkUd4MwWOg8O.html

The bench is led by Chief Justice Rana and will have four other justices who will be picked by him.Although the petitioners demanded an interim order against the decision, the apex court has refused to issue any such order.Meanwhile, leaders of the Prachanda-led faction have told the Election Commission (EC) that they hold a two-thirds majority in the party and therefore they must be granted official recognition by the election body, the paper said.“We are here with the proof that we are the only legitimate Nepal Communist Party,” Leela Mani Pokharel, a standing committee member of the party, was quoted as saying by the paper.Pokharel said that their faction has a majority with official signatures of 315 central committee members of the party.To get official recognition from the EC, the faction should have majority members, full details and their signatures along with copies of citizenships.Nepal on Sunday plunged into a political crisis after Prime Minister Oli got President Bidya Devi Bhandari to dissolve Parliament, a controversial move amidst a prolonged tussle for power between him and former premier Prachanda within the ruling dispensation. The move came after the intra-party feud reached climax in the ruling party which has been witnessing months long tussle between two factions, one led by Oli and another led by Prachanda. The ruling party has now been virtually divided more than two years after it was formed following the merger of CPN-UML led by Oli and CPN-Maoist Centre led by Prachanda in May 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pushpa-kamal-dahal-led-faction-of-ncp-elects-him-as-new-parliamentary-leader-of-nepal/story-5ZVY2ctxT2Qh0uOBbD87jI.html

Bohai Sea is a westward, inner extension of Yellow Sea.In a separate instance, at least 16 more Indian seafarers have not been allowed to leave their ship MV Anastasia, stranded off Caofeidian port in the same province.Beijing has not allowed them to get off the vessel in the backdrop of increasing imported Covid-19 infections in the country, putting the physical and mental health of the sailors at risk.There’s been no report of any Covid-19 case on the ship in the past six months on Jag Anand.But that hasn’t stopped the Chinese port authorities from implementing strict anti-epidemic protocols, preventing the sailors from disembarking.“China has explicit stipulations on the epidemic control measures and quarantine of seafarers at ports,” said Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, at a regular ministry briefing on Wednesday when asked about the condition of the Indian sailors aboard Jag Anand.“The local authorities of China have been in close communication with the Indian side and replied to their requests in a timely manner. We also provide necessary facilitation and assistance while meeting certain quarantine and epidemic prevention requirements,” Zhao said.The ship sailed from the port of Gladstone in Australia on May 26 - carrying Australian coal - and reached Jingtang port in China on June 13.Since that day, the ship has been anchored 2-3km away from the port.HT had reported in November that while the local port authorities have not allowed “crew change” - whereby a ship’s crew can disembark and head back to their country of origin - it has been communicated to them that anyone needing treatment could be allowed to come ashore temporarily for medical attention.A news report by India’s ANI in November had said the 23 Indian crew members on board were seeking help from the Indian government to return home. Some are suffering from health issues and the ship is running short of medicines, the report said.However, that’s not the only merchant navy ship on which Indian sailors have been stranded for months.At least 16 Indians are stuck on MV Anastasia off the Caofeidian port in Hebei province.“Onboard the Anastasia are 18 seafarers - 16 of them Indian, one Russian and one Filipino - forced to work at sea for far longer that their current anchorage, with crew clocking up to 20 months as ports refuse to let them disembark for fear of spreading contagion,” a report in The Sydney Morning Herald said Tuesday, adding that at least four them were on “suicide watch”.An estimated 1,500 seafarers are stranded in Chinese harbours, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-indian-sailors-remain-stuck-on-stranded-ships-at-chinese-ports/story-6xarQxJww09AJ8RdZpenLN.html

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) stated that a traveller on Singapore Airlines flight 637 used AOKpass, a digitally authenticated medical records, “to officially present a negative Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction” digital test result upon arrival at Changi Airport’s immigration counters.“This was the first time an immigration authority has used a blockchain based, digitally verifiable health certificate,” the statement read.According to the ICC, Singapore has become the first country to use a digital health certificate to verify the Covid-19 status of inbound travellers. All travellers from Malaysia and Indonesia will now be able to use ICC AOKpass at Changi Airport to digitally authenticate their Covid-19 test results. They will also be able to authenticate other necessary health credentials during immigration checks.Also Read | Covid-19: All you need to know about global QR code proposed by ChinaICC secretary-general John W.H. Denton AO opined that the chaos at UK ports, triggered by movement restrictions due to the new coronavirus variant, demonstrated the need for pre-travel testing. Denton AO said in a statement that the AOKpass app, following months of pilot tests, has now reached the necessary level of maturity to receive a “sovereign endorsement.” “Deploying standardised testing and verification systems are, simply put, the only way governments can safeguard cross-border commerce while the spread of the virus remains highly unpredictable,” he added.Dr Chester Drum, a co-founder of AOKpass, said in a statement that the use of blockchain technology is a critical step in combating the challenges of forged tests and medical records. He stressed that there is an urgent need for a common framework in certifying, authenticating and securing the results of a Covid-19 test.“In addition, users must trust that their data privacy is managed well, with no risk of personal data leaks,” Drum added.Chinese President Xi Jinping has also been pushing for a Covid-19 tracking system by using QR codes, as a part of “global mechanism” to ease international travel during coronavirus pandemic. During a virtual G20 summit in November, Xi had proposed a mechanism on the mutual recognition of health certificates in the form of “internationally accepted QR codes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singaporean-citizen-first-to-use-digital-covid-19-health-certificate-to-cross-international-border/story-HInDE4bqz6hjoY4YqfRAuK.html

23-12-2020||World||Global virus rules for Christmas: Tough, mild or none at all||In Peru, you can’t drive your car on Christmas. In Lebanon, you can go to a nightclub, but you can’t dance. In South Africa, roadblocks instead of beach parties will mark this year’s festive season.How many people can you share a Christmas meal with? France recommends no more than six, in Chile it’s 15, and in Brazil it’s as many as you want. Meanwhile, Italy’s mind-boggling, color-coded holiday virus rules change almost every day for the next two weeks.Countries around the world are trying to find the right formulas to keep their people safe for Christmas, especially as new virus variants prompt renewed travel bans and fuel resurgent infections, hospitalizations and deaths at the end of an already devastating year.Here’s a look at some of the restrictions around the world for the holiday season: BRITAIN It was meant to be a time when families across the UK could enjoy something like a normal Christmas despite the pandemic. Authorities planned to relax restrictions, allowing up to three households to mix in the days around Dec. 25.The emergence of a new, more contagious variant of the coronavirus changed that.The four nations of the U.K. – England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – are all in various states of shutdown and have ditched their Christmas plans. No indoor mixing of households is allowed in London and southeast England.Instead of Christmas joy, a sense of dread and isolation is looming. Dozens of countries have limited flights from Britain, and daily new infections are running at record highs. Hospitals across the U.K., which has Europe’s second-highest virus-related death toll at over 68,000, are heading towards capacity at a time of year when other illnesses abound.BRAZIL In Brazil, Christmas 2020 will look much like normal – even though the country has been among the world’s hardest-hit by the pandemic and new Covid-19 infections are now on track to match the peak of the first surge.Many beaches and restaurants in Rio de Janeiro were packed last weekend, despite a city measure forbidding drivers to park along the shore.No national restrictions have been imposed ahead of Christmas, though the governor of São Paulo ordered that only essential services such as public transport, supermarkets and pharmacies remain open around Christmas and New Year’s Eve.Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador have also called off their Dec. 31 firework displays.SOUTH AFRICA  South Africa is targeting beaches and booze as it imposes new restrictions for the Christmas season amid resurgent infections.Alcohol can only be sold Monday through Thursday, and a nighttime curfew is in place. Beaches — major tourist attractions this time of year — will be closed on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day.The government is urging people to avoid crowded Christmas celebrations, but indoor gatherings of up to 100 people are still allowed; outdoors up to 250 people can congregate.Police are setting up roadblocks to slow a second surge of infections that authorities and scientists say is being fueled by another variant of the virus, one distinct from the variant affecting England. Some countries are banning flights from South Africa, where the weekly infections and deaths have doubled over the past two weeks.LEBANON  Unlike much of the world, Lebanon eased restrictions during the holidays, hoping to inject foreign currency into a tanking economy. Tens of thousands of Lebanese expats have arrived home for the holidays, leading to fears of an inevitable surge in infections.Last week, the Interior Ministry allowed nightclubs to reopen — but said dancing will be prohibited. That triggered a debate on social media about what constitutes dancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-virus-rules-for-christmas-tough-mild-or-none-at-all/story-lblZ4cU4bh1VMNr9fChd3K.html
23-12-2020||World||Malaysia to double AstraZeneca vaccine order through Covax deal||Malaysia is set to secure an additional 6.4 million doses of the Astrazeneca Plc. vaccine through the Covax facility, enough to inoculate 10% of the country’s population, Science and Technology Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said.This will see the Southeast nation doubling its order from the company, with the first batch expected in the second quarter of 2021, Khairy said in a televised briefing Wednesday.The government is also in final negotiations with China’s Sinovac for 14 million doses, CanSino Biologics for 3.5 million doses, and for 6.4 million shots of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine made by the Gamelya Research Institute, Khairy said.“The deals with Sinovac, Cansino, and Gamelya will involve local companies that have been identified based on their ability to work together and to provide fill finish manufacturing capacity for the vaccines,” he said.Malaysia is struggling to stem a fresh wave of cases that emerged in September and threatens a nascent economic recovery. Daily infections hit a record 2,234 on December 10, with cases erupting at facilities of companies including Top Glove Corp. and Karex Bhd., the world’s biggest producer of condoms.The government has already secured 12.8 million doses from Pfizer Inc-BioNTech SE in a deal signed last month, and on Tuesday it announced an agreement to buy 6.4 million doses directly from Astrazeneca.Malaysia has negotiated with Pfizer the option to boost its purchases to cover another 20% of its population, and is in talks with Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, Khairy said.“I won’t rule out the possibility that we will increase our orders slightly,” he said. “Johnson & Johnson is also a single shot. We like single shot, for obvious reasons. So we are still looking at that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-to-double-astrazeneca-vaccine-order-through-covax-deal/story-9rvx2euV6thOJvb6SbDLeL.html
23-12-2020||World||Russia sees nothing good in ties with ‘hostile’ US under Biden||Russia expects nothing good in relations with a “deeply hostile” US under the incoming administration of Joe Biden and has no plans to make unilateral concessions to improve ties, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said.“We are heading from bad to worse,” Ryabkov said in an interview with the Interfax news service published Wednesday. “The next US president has been left with a bad legacy and it will take a long time for him to sort this out.”Moscow hasn’t initiated any contacts with Biden’s transition team “and we are not going to do this,” said Ryabkov, who oversees Russia-US relations. “In the end, it’s up to the Americans to decide what, when and how to make our bilateral relations.”His comments come as Washington has blamed Moscow for a massive cyber-attack that hit a wide range of government departments and Fortune 500 companies. Russia has denied responsibility. While U.S. President Donald Trump has played down the breach even as his own senior officials accuse Russia, Biden has pledged to respond once he takes office next month.Ryabkov dismissed the controversy, saying Russia registers hacking attempts from US and other foreign sources “every day” and “we don’t make a fuss about it.”Russia’s hopes for a transformation of ties when Trump was elected in 2016 were sunk by the scandal that erupted over contacts between his transition team and Russian officials before the president took office.With the Biden adminstration, Russia may adopt an approach of engaging only in “selective dialogue” in areas of mutual interest, Ryabkov said.“We definitely don’t expect anything good,” Ryabkov said. It would be strange to expect better ties “from people who, many of them, have spent their careers engaging in Russophobia and throwing mud at my country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-sees-nothing-good-in-ties-with-hostile-us-under-biden/story-dB48eg3JmhPfWfvLAAQnRJ.html
23-12-2020||World||China seeks guarantees before loaning $6 billion for Pakistan rail project||China has sought additional guarantees before sanctioning a $6-billion loan for the Main Line-1 (ML-1) railway line project in Pakistan, due to the country’s weakening financial position, according to a media report on Wednesday.China has also proposed a mix of commercial and concessional loans to fund the rail project, going against Islamabad’s wishes of ‘cheapest lending’.The issue of additional guarantees was raised during the third joint ML-1 Financing Committee Meeting held ten days ago (December 13), The Express Tribune newspaper reported, quoting official documents.A senior Pakistani official involved in the negotiations said China raised the additional guarantees issue during the meeting but did not make it part of the draft of minutes shared with Pakistan.The draft minutes have not yet been signed by both the countries.The ML-1 project includes dualisation and upgrading of the 1,872-km railway track from Peshawar to Karachi and is a major milestone for the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The official said China raised the additional guarantees issue to get clarity over Pakistan’s financial condition after it applied for debt relief from the G-20 countries, which is only meant for the world’s poorest nations.The third round of financial negotiations gave further clarity on the Chinese position on $6 billion lending for the $6.8 billion strategically important ML-1 project of Pakistan Railways, sources in the Ministry of Economic Affairs said.As part of debt relief from G-20 countries, Pakistan cannot secure expensive commercial loans, except those allowed under the International Monetary Fund and World Bank framework.The Chinese authorities have proposed that “keeping in view the financial situation in Pakistan so also the conditions laid down by the G-20 regulations for debt suspension, the government of Pakistan may provide additional guarantee mechanism for the loan other than sovereign loan for the ML-1 project”, according to officials privy to the negotiations.It was surprising for us when China raised the issue of additional guarantees during the meeting, another senior Pakistani official who was part of the meeting said.In August this year, the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) approved the strategically important ML-1 project worth USD 6.8 billion.The ECNEC meeting had continued for hardly 20 minutes, leaving many critical issues about financing and technical details unresolved.Both the sides have reached broad-based consensus on the technical parameters, including bidding documents, according to deliberations that took place in the joint bilateral third financial and seventh technical committee of ML-1 project.But an early start of construction work on what the official described as “strategically important project” is unlikely after China linked the civil works with prior finalisation of financing mechanism of the single-largest project of the CPEC.Unlike Pakistan’s expectations of getting the $6 billion loan at 1% interest rate, China has proposed a mix of commercial and concessional lending, the sources said.China maintained that the lending will be both a combination of commercial and concessional loans, according to sources.The Economic Affairs Ministry had proposed a 1% rate while the Ministry of Railways was inclined to take the mix of commercial and concessional rate, subject to the condition that the average rate may remain lower than 2.38%, sources said.However, Pakistan was expecting that due to the strategic nature of the project, China would accept its request for 1% interest rate and a grace period of 10 years for repayment of the loan.China has offered to finance 85% of the project cost with payback period of 15 years to 20 years in biannual tranches. Sources said the Chinese had offered a five years grace period. Pakistan has asked for up to 90% of financing and was ready to accept a 20 years repayment period, subject to the condition that the grace period should be 10 years.“The Chinese side proposed that negotiations for financing must be only to the extent of package-1 consisting of $2.434 billion and the negotiation for remaining two packages will be undertaken during the implementation phase of package-I,” according to the official documents.Pakistani authorities pressed for negotiation for the total project cost of the ML-1. China has also offered financing in Chinese currency Renminbi (RMB).According to the ML-1 framework agreement, the project will be executed in the engineering, procurement and construction mode by Chinese contractors. Under the CPEC framework, ML-1 is the only strategic project being finalised as part of the initial $46 billion deal.Sources said that Pakistan’s desire to start work on the package-1 from January 2021 would remain unfulfilled due to delay in finalisation of financing details.Pakistan had planned to complete the package-I from January 2021 to December 2024 and will cover the construction of a 527-km track between Peshawar, Rawalpindi and Lahore, according to the paper.The CPEC is part of China’s One Belt, One Road initiative, a global infrastructure development strategy to invest in nearly 70 countries and international organizations. India has expressed concern over the projects as a portion of the CPEC runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, violating Indian sovereignty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seeks-guarantees-before-loaning-6-billion-for-pakistan-rail-project/story-ulBksG1G25TGpw8307CLPI.html
23-12-2020||World||‘Pakistan doomed to fail’: PoK activist condemns murder of Karima Baloch||Condemning the killing of Baloch activist Karima Baloch, PoK activist Sardar Shaukat Ali Kashmiri said that Pakistan is doomed to fail as a country.He said that the barrel of the guns of the Pakistan establishment (Pakistan Army) cannot silence the voices of Balochistan.“Voices of the Balochis cannot be silenced by the power of guns, it will lead to the end of Pakistan,” he said.Earlier, Karima Baloch, an activist, who had been vocal about Pakistan Army and government atrocities in Balochistan, was found dead in Toronto, Canada.Karima was a refugee in Canada and named as one of the world’s 100 most “inspirational and influential” women in 2016 by the BBC.Talking about the atrocities of the Pakistan military, the activist opined that Pakistani security forces are already known for kidnappings, forced disappearances, killings of innocents, and gross human rights violations.“We support Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) move to restrict the powers of intelligence agencies,” he said.There have been several instances where Pakistani security forces conduct operations on individual households, physically assault innocent women and children, and rely on extrajudicial death squads to subjugate Baloch civilians.Kalima too faced the consequences for being vocal against the government atrocities in Balochistan, her brother, uncle, and maternal uncle were murdered in Pakistan, said Shaukat.Not only in Pakistan but those Balochis who have settled abroad also face the same consequences, he added.The intelligence agencies of Pakistan produce wrong documents to deport such activists. Many Baloch political activists in order to avoid persecution escape from Balochistan and are compelled to seek asylum in European countries; journalists and human rights activists are among these asylum seekers. Shaukat cited the example of the murder of Sajid Hussain, a Baloch journalist exiled in Sweden.Equating the Pakistani establishment with Nazi Germany, he said that as it failed in its propaganda during World War II and paid the heaviest price, the same way Pak Army will pay for its sins.Slamming its Army, he said that Pakistan is the only country in the world made due to its army whereas in general, the army protects its nation.Reminding them of their atrocities in Bangladesh, he said that mistreatment of citizens leads to fragmentation of the country.

23-12-2020||World||Australian writer detained in China sends defiant Christmas message||An Australian writer detained in Beijing on spying allegations has told his readers to “pursue democracy, rule of law and freedom” in a Christmas message from prison that said 300 interrogations had not yielded any evidence.Pro-democracy blogger Yang Hengjun, who is facing trial on espionage charges that he denies, has been unable to receive visits from his wife or family since he was arrested in January 2019 after he arrived at Guangzhou airport from New York. Yang said in his message that after “torture, more than 300 interrogations and a lot of verbal abuse, I am now in a place of deeper retrospective and introspective meditation”, according to his former teacher, Feng Chongyi, who is based in Sydney. Feng also confirmed the authenticity of the message to Reuters.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China was a country with the rule of law and the case was being handled independently by judicial bodies.“All of Yang Hengjun’s lawful rights have been fully guaranteed, and there is no so-called torture or abuse,” he told reporters. Yang, 55, had revealed in a 2011 letter to Feng that he had previously worked for China’s state security agency for a decade in Hong Kong and Washington, and left the service before moving to Australia in 1999. He later wrote spy novels that were published in Taiwan, and amassed a large online following in China as a democracy blogger, before moving to New York.He had denied revealing any state secrets in his novels during an earlier, brief detention in 2011 on suspicion of involvement in the Jasmine Revolution democracy protests.Australian diplomats visited Yang on Dec. 17, one of the few visits permitted by Chinese authorities this year.Yang’s trial, which had been due to proceed by January, has been delayed by three months.In the message, Yang said he was “waiting for court”, and still had “some confidence in the court”. “Whether or not they judge me guilty will say a lot about whether the court is governed by rule of law or by pure absolute power,” he said in the message.“I have strong faith in humanity, in righteousness, justice and God.”Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last year it was “absolutely untrue” Yang had acted as a spy for Australia.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in October that Yang’s treatment in detention, with no family visits and limited legal representation, was not compatible with international norms. Diplomatic relations between major trading partners Australia and China have worsened this year after Canberra called for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, and Beijing imposed a series of trade reprisals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-writer-detained-in-china-sends-defiant-christmas-message/story-naiCFWGn2jxcLnpMQt4gUL.html
23-12-2020||World||Trudeau shuts out China again by rejecting Arctic gold deal||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government rejected a plan by China’s Shandong Gold Mining Co. to acquire a gold miner that operates in the Canadian Arctic, potentially inflaming a diplomatic feud.TMAC Resources Inc. owns the Hope Bay gold mine in the northern territory of Nunavut, an operation that includes a port and air strips. Shandong, an acquisitive state-backed metal producer, agreed to buy the Toronto-based company for about $150 million in May. In October, TMAC received notice the government had ordered a national security review.The Canadian miner said late Monday an order had been issued under the Investment Canada Act for Shandong not to proceed with the takeover. Shandong confirmed the rejection in a statement Tuesday, citing a decision made for the “purpose of safeguarding national security.”Officials in Trudeau’s office declined to comment on the move, which comes amid badly frayed ties between Canada and China over the 2018 arrest of a top Huawei Technologies Co. executive on a US extradition request.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday that Canada “should provide an open and non discriminatory business environment for all companies operating in Canada, including the Chinese ones.”The Chinese embassy in Ottawa sees any politicization of economic co-operation as wrong, a spokesperson said by email late Tuesday, calling on the Canadian government to foster a fair market for all foreign investors.A spokesperson for the Canadian industry ministry said she was restricted in explaining why the Shandong deal was rejected, citing confidentiality provisions of the investment act. “Canada remains open to investments that create jobs, growth, access to global trade and value chains, and long-term prosperity for Canadians, while protecting Canada’s national security interests,” Sophy Lambert-Racine said by email Tuesday.TMAC plunged as much as 19%, the most intraday since March, and was down 11% to C$1.16 as of 12:05 p.m. in Toronto. The shares have declined 70% this year.Security observers have said a sale could be a threat to Canada because it would give China greater access to the Northwest Passage and is close to Canadian early warning radar facilities in the Arctic.The Trudeau government’s rejection of the deal might not be the end of the story, according to Stephanie Carvin, a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa and former government intelligence analyst.“The issue when dealing with state-owned and state-championed enterprises is that when you say no to them, China finds other ways to circumvent the rule of law,” she said by phone Tuesday. “If you say no once, it doesn’t mean they won’t try again in some way.”The decision -- and Beijing’s reaction to it -- will be watched closely by other Arctic nations, Carvin said, flagging that Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne had meetings with his Nordic counterparts recently. “Canada is not the only country struggling to deal with China in the north. Denmark is particularly concerned,” she said, citing Beijing’s infrastructure investments in Greenland.Canada-China relations soured sharply two years ago, when police detained Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver’s airport. She has been confined to the Pacific coast city since then, fighting extradition. In the days after her arrest, China jailed two Canadians on espionage charges and halted billions of dollars in agricultural imports.Even before the Huawei case flared, China was warning of an investment chill in Canada after Trudeau’s government rejected a takeover of Toronto-based construction giant Aecon Group Inc., citing national security concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-shuts-out-china-again-by-rejecting-arctic-gold-deal/story-ZHfKpcwlh0wkmUU3tCBd0J.html
23-12-2020||World||America denies China expelled US Navy warship near Spratly Islands||China falsely claimed that it expelled an American warship from the South China Sea (SCS) on Tuesday, the US Navy has said, adding that Beijing’s statement was an effort to assert its illegitimate claims in the maritime region.China on Tuesday said its military had “expelled” a US Navy guided-missile destroyer sailing near the Nansha Islands – also known as Spratly Islands - in the South China Sea in a fresh escalation of tensions between the two countries.Beijing said the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) southern theatre command deployed ships and aircraft to warn US destroyer USS John S. McCain as it sailed through disputed waters of the South China Sea.“The PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) statement about this mission is false. USS John S. McCain was not ‘expelled’ from any nation’s territory,” Lieutenant Joe Keiley, US Navy’s 7th Fleet spokesperson, said in a statement.“The PRC’s statement is the latest in a long string of PRC actions to misrepresent lawful US maritime operations and assert its excessive and illegitimate maritime claims at the expense of its southeast Asian neighbours in the SCS,” Keiley added.China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, but that claim is disputed by several maritime neighbours, including the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia, besides Vietnam and Taiwan.It is understood that the PLA did contact the US destroyer over “bridge-to-bridge” radio, asking for the American ship to leave; a PLA destroyer also shadowed it during the operation.However, the US Navy spokesperson said that its ship conducted its operation and left “on our timeline’’ and was not “expelled”.“USS John S. McCain conducted this FONOP (freedom of navigation operation) in accordance with international law and then continued to conduct normal operations in international waters. The operation reflects our commitment to uphold freedom of navigation and lawful uses of the sea as a principle,” Keiley said.“The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, as USS John S. McCain did here,” Keiley added. “The PRC’s behaviour stands in contrast to the United States’ adherence to international law and our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.”On November 24, the same US destroyer was caught in a similar incident with the Russian navy. Moscow had said at that time one of its warships caught and chased off the USS McCain operating “illegally” in its territorial waters in the Sea of Japan.The US Navy had denied wrongdoing, accusing Moscow of making excessive maritime claims.In April, China had scrambled aircraft and deployed ships to track and expel a frontline US warship from near another Beijing-controlled region called Paracel Islands - also known as Xisha Islands in China and Hoang Sa Archipelago in Vietnam - in the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/america-denies-china-expelled-us-navy-warship-near-spratly-islands/story-nUt9p30cOyfnH0IAOCn3CK.html
23-12-2020||World||Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai released on bail||Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai was granted bail on Wednesday, nearly three weeks after he was remanded in custody over fraud and national security-related charges.Lai, an outspoken advocate for democracy in Hong Kong, was charged with fraud on December 3 for allegedly violating the lease terms for office space for his media company, Next Digital. He was later charged again on December 12 under the national security law, on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security.Lai appeared in court Wednesday and was granted bail by the High Court. He had been kept behind bars since December 3.He is among a recent string of pro-democracy activists and supporters arrested by Hong Kong police in recent months, prompting concerns that Hong Kong is cracking down on dissent following Beijing’s imposition of a national security law on the semi-autonomous Chinese territory in June.Beijing imposed the national security law in response to protests in Hong Kong that began in June 2019 over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.The legislation outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong’s internal affairs.In certain cases, those charged under the national security law could also face trial in mainland China, where the legal system is highly opaque. Serious offenders of the law could face life imprisonment.Earlier this month, Hong Kong sentenced prominent pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow to jail for their roles in an anti-government protest outside police headquarters last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-released-on-bail/story-9zKPq1Z8RVDigJM2YV45DP.html

A lava lake has formed, rising about 440 feet (134 meters) from the bottom of the crater.Since the eruption began Sunday night, Kilauea has spewed some 2 billion gallons of lava (10 million cubic meters), enough to cover 33 acres (13 hectares). The lava has been contained inside the deep crater.It isn’t threatening to get close to people or cover property, like when Kilauea erupted from vents in the middle of a residential neighborhood in 2018 and destroyed more than 700 homes.Still, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has warned residents to beware of potentially high levels of volcanic gas, rockfalls and explosions.When erupting, Kilauea tends to spew large volumes of sulfur dioxide, which forms volcanic smog, or vog, when it mixes with oxygen, sunlight and other gases in the air. The state Department of Health warned residents to reduce their outdoor activities if they encounter volcanic smog conditions.Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes, having erupted some 50 times in the last century. Between 1983 and 2018, it erupted almost continuously. It had a lava lake in its crater for the last decade of that eruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hawaii-volcano-erupts-after-two-years-forms-lava-lake/story-vyaPcaxvO7c504OXenpkjL.html
23-12-2020||World||Joe Biden calls cyber attack grave risk to national security||The recent cyber security breach against the US companies constitutes a grave risk to the national security, President-elect Joe Biden has said, alleging that the Trump administration failed to prevent it.Recently, the US officials said that multiple federal agencies were targeted in a sophisticated, months-long cyber security attack. The massive breach, which is termed as one of the biggest ever cyber-attacks in the US, is being blamed on Russia.Commenting on the breach, Biden described it as a major challenge which his administration will confront on a bipartisan basis.“There’s still so much we don’t know including the full scope of the breach or the extent of the damage it has caused, but we know this much, this attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security who carefully planned and carefully orchestrated,” Biden told reporters at a news conference in Wilmington, Delaware on Tuesday.The cyber attack was carried out by using sophisticated cyber tools, and the attacker succeeded in catching the federal government off guard and unprepared, he said.“Foreign actors have been working on this breach since last -- late last year, at least last year setting the landscape to compromise our systems, scraping up sensitive information from our world-class tech sector and from private businesses and from the United States government agencies,” Biden said.“The truth is this, the Trump administration failed to prioritise cybersecurity, it did that from eliminating or downgrading cyber coordinators in both the White House and at the State Department, the firing of director of Cyber, Space, and Infrastructure Security Agency, to President Trump’s irrational downplaying of the seriousness of this attack.“Enough is enough. In an age when so much of our lives are conducted online, cyber-attacks must be treated as a serious threat by our leadership at the highest levels,” he said.This cannot be let go unanswered, Biden said, adding that means making clear and publicly who was responsible for the attack and taking meaningful steps to hold them in account.Initial indications, including from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr, suggest that Russia is responsible for this breach, he said.“It certainly Russia’s long history of reckless, destructive cyber activities, but the Trump administration needs to make an official attribution. This assault happened on Donald Trump’s watch when he wasn’t watching. It is still his responsibility as president to defend American interest for the next four weeks but rest assured that even if he does not take it seriously, I will,” Biden said.Noting that he is disappointed by Trump’s response, Biden said he was pleased to see leaders in both parties in Congress speak out loudly and clearly on this attack.“Again, I want to thank prominent Republicans in the Senate particularly for speaking out. It’s a sign, a sign that with a new administration, we can confront these threats on a bipartisan basis with a united front here at home. That should be encouraging to the American people and a warning to our adversaries,” he said.Responding to a question, Biden said that the damage done remains to be determined.“We have to look at very closely the nature of the breaches, how extensive they are, and what damage has been done. And thirdly, there’s going to be a necessity as (former) president (Barack) Obama and I and our administration talked about, we need international rules of the road on cyber security.“We have to bring along our allies and our friends so we hold everyone accountable if it breaches any of these basic fundamental rules,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-cyber-attack-grave-risk-to-national-security/story-Lkw9o9OHNKH1PjBPZGRx0H.html
23-12-2020||World||Dubai prepares to offer free Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine shots||Dubai plans to start a free vaccination campaign from Wednesday using the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE.“Extensive vaccination campaign against Covid-19 kicks off in Dubai on Wednesday,” the city’s media office tweeted. “Vaccination will use Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine and is free of charge.”Pfizer and BioNTech have said their vaccine is 95% effective in preventing the illness. The United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is a part, has been conducting trials on China’s state-backed coronavirus vaccine and earlier this month said the shot protected 86% of people against Covid-19.Dubai, the Middle East’s business hub, locked down the city for about a month earlier this year to halt the spread of the virus. Its flagship Emirates airline grounded passenger flights and the Expo 2020 exhibition scheduled to start in October was delayed by a year. Flights have since resumed operations.The UAE diagnosed over 195,000 people with the virus since the start of the outbreak. The Gulf nation reported more than a thousand cases a day for the past two months after they dropped to as low as 164 in August. The country has a case-fatality rate of 0.3%, among the lowest globally, according to data from Johns Hopkins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-prepares-to-offer-free-pfizer-biontech-coronavirus-vaccine-shots/story-11QSOHdn4SF4vJ44txdQsO.html
23-12-2020||World||Vaccine makers preparing for mutant coronavirus strains||Drugmakers who designed the first Covid-19 vaccine to gain clearance from Western regulators say they could reset the shot to counter a new strain within just six weeks, if needed.BioNTech SE Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said he’s confident that the inoculation his company developed with Pfizer Inc. will work just fine against the fast-spreading coronavirus variant that’s raising alarms in the UK and beyond. If the current shot fails to be adequately protective, though, the company could tweak it by updating small bits of genetic information called messenger RNA that their vaccine uses.“The beauty of the messenger RNA technology is that we can directly start to engineer a vaccine, which completely mimics this new mutation,” Sahin said at a press conference Tuesday morning. Moderna Inc. meanwhile indicated that it thought its vaccine would still shield people from the virus and that it was running tests to confirm.Authorities ranging from the European Medicines Agency to the UK government have said there’s no evidence to suggest that the strain, called B.1.1.7, is likely to evade coronavirus vaccines. Most Covid shots target the spike protein that the virus uses to enter cells, and only small changes have been detected in new versions, according to Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger.Full Immunogenicity“All the currently identified strains, including B.1.1.7, only carry sporadic point mutations in the spike protein that are believed to be unlikely to disrupt the full spectrum of their immunogenicity,” Risinger said in a note.Moderna sank 9% in New York, Pfizer fell 1.7%, and BioNTech’s American depositary receipts dropped 5.5%. Moderna has risen more than six-fold since the beginning of the year, while BioNTech’s ADRs have almost tripled.Countries around the world are restricting travel to and from the UK because of concerns about the variant, which officials have said may be up to 70% more transmissible than others. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has put London into lockdown, citing the threat of the strain.UK authorities have said that while the variant is widespread in London and southeast England, there’s no reason to believe it causes more serious disease than earlier versions. Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser of Operation Warp Speed, the US Covid vaccine and drug acceleration program, said there’s no hard evidence that it’s more transmissible.Still, drugmakers are conducting tests to determine how well their shots will defend against new strains. AstraZeneca Plc, the University of Oxford’s partner, said in a statement that it’s investigating the impact of the mutation, and the company doesn’t believe it will hurt its shot’s effectiveness. BioNTech said its tests will take about two weeks. Paris-based Sanofi said it will test its experimental vaccine’s efficacy against any new variant that emerges.Constant TestingModerna has tested its vaccine against previous strains and expects that it “would be protective against the variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus recently described in the UK,” according to an emailed statement. “We will be performing additional tests of the vaccine in the coming weeks to confirm this expectation.”German biotech CureVac NV said it’s constantly testing its experimental Covid-19 shot against different mutations. While it doesn’t think its product will be less effective against the UK. variant, it also could come up with a new version within six weeks, the company said in an emailed statement.If companies like BioNTech do need to need to update their vaccines, the most likely scenario is regulators would approve newer versions rather quickly -- without another round of large-scale clinical trials, according to Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmaco-epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. The messenger RNA platform from BioNTech -- along with another one from Moderna -- has already proved itself to be largely safe, and the review would be analogous to that of annual flu vaccines, he said.It’s likely that Covid shots will be redesigned in the future to keep them highly effective against new viral strains, Evans said.Staying in Tune“To me it’s like a motorcar -- I tune the engine to get better performance, but in terms of its overall safety, that makes very little difference,” Evans said. “We know that these mRNA vaccines are pretty safe.”For updates, developers would probably only need to show that their products are raising a comparable immune response, something that could probably be done with fewer than 100 human volunteers, said Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London.“That alone would be enough to allow the new evolution of the vaccine to be licensed,” Openshaw said. “I see absolutely no reason that any regulator would insist that they would have to go right back to square one.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-makers-preparing-for-mutant-coronavirus-strains/story-5hzznv2QTwl63FD7AnJeAL.html
23-12-2020||World||Donald Trump grants full pardon to two convicted in Russia probe||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday granted full pardons to two more persons convicted in the 2016 Russia poll meddling case. The move came at a time when he faced renewed criticism for not standing up to Moscow, this time over a sweeping hacking of government and private sector computer systems. Trump granted full pardons to George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to his 2016 campaign, and Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch attorney. Papadopoulos served 16 days in jail and Van der Zwaan 30 days.Both had pleaded guilty to lying about their contacts with people that the FBI suspected of being Russian spies. Both were among first convictions obtained by special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference.Trump had earlier pardoned his National Security Adviser Michael Flynn who had pleaded guilty to lying in the same Russia investigation and then backtracked. Also, he had commuted the jail sentence of Roger Stone, a longtime ally, for lying to congress in relation to the Russia probe.The new pardons were announced just hours after President-elect Joe Biden slammed the incumbent for not speaking out against Russia for the recent, large-scale hacking effort that has been described by experts as the worst ever.“It certainly fits Russia’s long history of reckless disruptive cyber activities, but the Trump administration needs to make an official attribution,” Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware. “This assault happened on Donald Trump’s watch when he wasn’t watching. It’s still his responsibility as president to defend American interests for the next four weeks.”Trump, who has been seen to be reluctant to criticise Russia, has suggested that the hacking could be the handiwork of China, disagreeing with secretary of state Mike Pompeo and attorney general William Barr, who have both pointed to Russian involvement.The US president granted full pardon to 13 others and commuted the jail sentences of five. Among those pardoned were three Republican members of the House of Representatives - Chris Collins, who was convicted for insider trading; Duncan Hunter, who was convicted for misusing campaign funds; and Steve Stockman, who was convicted on charges of fraud and money laundering. Trump also granted presidential pardons to four government contractors for a controversial security firm Blackwater, who were convicted for a 2007 massacre in Baghdad that had left more than 12 people dead. One of the four men was serving a life sentence, while the other three were in for 30 years each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-grants-full-pardon-to-two-convicted-in-russia-probe/story-EWE48xudD1sLZdUs0EtQ4N.html
23-12-2020||World||EU vows ‘final push’ in UK trade talks but fish rift threatens deal||The European Union is making a “final push” to strike a Brexit trade deal with Britain, although there are still deep rifts over fishing rights, the bloc’s chief negotiator said on Tuesday.Britain will complete its departure from the EU on December 31 when its current free trade arrangements expire. The two sides have been struggling for months to define a new relationship covering everything from trade to transport and energy.The much-delayed final stages of the already tortuous negotiations now coincide with a fresh crisis after EU members and other countries suspended most travel to and from Britain to curb a new, more contagious variant of the coronavirus.“We are really in a crucial moment. We are giving it a final push,” said the negotiator, Michel Barnier, as he arrived to update the bloc’s 27 national envoys on Brexit.Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin said he believed negotiators were more likely than not to strike a deal, but that talks may go beyond December 25.Barnier told the closed-door gathering that the UK’s latest offer on sharing out the fish catch from British waters from 2021 was “totally unacceptable”, according to EU diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity.“Barnier is walking a tightrope between London and Paris,” said one diplomat in Brussels, a reference to the small but politically prominent fishing community in northern France that would be affected by any reduction of the EU catch.A senior diplomat who took part in the meeting with Barnier said the EU’s latest offer on fish was its final one, and added that there was still concern around regulating production standards and state aid to ensure corporate fair play.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who campaigned for Brexit in a 2016 referendum, arguing that it would restore Britain’s sovereignty, has repeatedly said it must control its waters and who fishes there. EU officials and diplomats said the bloc could be willing to cut the value of its fish catch in British waters by around 25%, while Britain was demanding a 30-35% cut.But the sources said the length of the fisheries transition regime was also an obstacle, as was the question of EU retaliation if London excludes its vessels from British waters afterwards - something that Britain says is excessive.The UK wants to gradually curb EU access to its fishing waters over three years, while the bloc is proposing six years, to give its fishing industry longer to adjust.While EU sources said an agreement was getting closer, they warned it might not come in time.“The EU will not close its door to the UK, and remains ready to negotiate even beyond the 1st of January,” said a third EU diplomat. With London refusing to request an extension of Britain’s transition out of the EU beyond the end of this year, that would mean a dramatic rupture in trading ties in just nine days’ time. Around $900 million in annual trade is at risk if Britain, the world’s sixth biggest economy, and the EU - a trading bloc of 450 million consumers - fail to craft a new accord.Calls between Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, head of the executive European Commission, which is negotiating with Britain on behalf of the member states, will take place as needed, EU officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-vows-final-push-in-uk-trade-talks-but-fish-rift-threatens-deal/story-cIBlA3btjSHzfhDaoe7YTI.html
23-12-2020||World||Lawmakers urge US govt to further tighten restrictions on China’s SMIC||Two key Republican lawmakers on Tuesday urged the Trump administration to strengthen new rules adopted Friday aimed at preventing China’s biggest chipmaker SMIC from getting access to advanced US technology.Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Michael McCaul said the Entity List designation by the US Commerce Department was not strict enough and should be rewritten to close “dangerous loopholes that would allow nearly all sales to SMIC to continue without restriction and support the (Chinese Communist Party’s) stated goal of military preeminence.” The letter said they were concerned that without changes the rules would be “utterly ineffective in addressing this growing national security threat.”The Commerce Department declined to comment, but Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday the designation was a “necessary measure to ensure that China, through its national champion SMIC, is not able to leverage US technologies to enable indigenous advanced technology levels to support its destabilizing military activities.”The lawmakers are concerned because the restrictions apply only to technology “uniquely” required to produce semiconductors at 10 nanometers and below. The administration “seems to be allowing SMIC access to nearly all semiconductor manufacturing equipment,” they wrote.The lawmakers said they were concerned the new rules were “done for show and parochial commercial interests at the expense of US national security.”SMIC said Sunday that being put on a US trade blacklist would pose a significant adverse impact to its research and development in its 10-nanometer and more advanced chip technology, but said it did not expect the US decision to have a major negative impact on its short-term operations and finances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmakers-urge-us-govt-to-further-tighten-restrictions-on-china-s-smic/story-Q4oRN4Fti4IEmRhF27nwCL.html
23-12-2020||World||Trump threatens to torpedo Covid relief with new demands||President Donald Trump late Tuesday threatened to torpedo Congress’ massive Covid-19 relief package in the midst of a raging pandemic and deep economic uncertainty, suddenly demanding changes fellow Republicans have opposed.Trump assailed the bipartisan $900 billion package in a video he tweeted out Tuesday night and suggested he may not sign the legislation. He called on lawmakers to increase direct payments for most Americans from $600 to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for couples.Railing against a range of provisions in the bill, including for foreign aid, he told lawmakers to “get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill.”Trump did not specifically vow to veto the bill, and there may be enough support for legislation in Congress to override him if he does. But if Trump were to upend the sprawling legislation, the consequences would be severe, including no federal aid to struggling Americans and small businesses, and no additional resources to help with vaccine distribution. In addition, because lawmakers linked the pandemic relief bill to an overarching funding measure, the government would shut down on December 29.The relief package was part of a hard-fought compromise bill that includes $1.4 trillion to fund government agencies through September and contains other end-of-session priorities such as money for cash-starved transit systems, an increase in food stamp benefits and about $4 billion to help other nations provide a Covid-19 vaccine for their people.Lawmakers spent months in a stalemate over pandemic relief funds, even as Covid-19 cases soared across the country. Democrats had pushed for higher payments to Americans, but compromised with Republicans to allow a deal to proceed.Following Trump’s interjection, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi all but dared Trump’s Republican allies in Congress to meet the president’s demand for far higher payments.“At last, the President has agreed to $2,000. Democrats are ready to bring this to the Floor this week by unanimous consent. Let’s do it!,” Pelosi said in a tweet. An aide said she would put the proposal forward Thursday for a vote.Republicans have been reluctant to spend more on pandemic relief and only agreed to the big year-end package as time dwindled for a final deal. And Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, said that “Trump needs to sign the bill to help people and keep the government open,” and Congress would step up for more aid after.Trump’s call for changes to the legislation will test his sway with a Republican Party he has held tight control of throughout his presidency. Several Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have begun to gingerly break with Trump and acknowledge his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden, a step Trump has refused to take. McConnell has also warned Republicans against disputing the election on January 6, when Congress must formally affirm the results.Shortly after castigating the relief bill, Trump challenged McConnell and Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican who has also said any effort to overturn Biden’s victory would be futile. Trump said he would back a primary challenge to Thune when he is up for re-election in 2022.Trump’s threats to hold up the pandemic legislation could also complicate matters for Republicans in Georgia, where two runoff races to determine control of the Senate will be held in January. Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler have been running as ardent supporters of Trump and will now face questions about whether they will back his call for more money for Americans.Jon Ossoff, Perdue’s Democratic opponent, tweeted simply on Tuesday night: “$2,000 checks now.”The relief package was brought forward Monday afternoon and sped through the House and Senate in a matter of hours as lawmakers worked to close the books on the year. While many lawmakers complained about being given so little time to read the bill, they overwhelmingly voted for it as local businesses and constituents seek economic relief from the pandemicThe Senate cleared the huge relief package by a 92-6 vote after the House approved it by another lopsided vote, 359-53. Those votes totals would be enough to override a veto should Trump decide to take that step.After months of partisanship and politicking about pandemic relief, the logjam broke after Biden urged his party to accept a compromise with top Republicans that is smaller than many Democrats would have liked.The relief bill Trump is criticizing would establish a temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefit and a $600 direct stimulus payment to most Americans, along with a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants and theaters and money for schools, health care providers and renters facing eviction.Earlier in the day, Biden applauded lawmakers for their work. He described the package as far from perfect, “but it does provide vital relief at a critical time.”He also said more relief would be needed in the months ahead. “We have our first hint and glimpse of bipartisanship,” Biden said. “In this election, the American people made it clear they want us to reach across the aisle and work together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-threatens-to-torpedo-covid-relief-with-new-demands/story-KFik497Or1T31tfmJ3iXhI.html
23-12-2020||World||US Covid-19 cases surge as hospitals overwhelmed before holidays||Americans were warned again on Tuesday not to travel for Christmas as the latest Covid-19 surge left hospitals struggling to find beds for the sick and political leaders imposed restrictions to try to curb new infections, making for a grim holiday season.A new, even more contagious variant of the coronavirus quickly spreading across Britain caused more fear in Americans already weary from nine months of the pandemic and prompted talks among top US officials to ban travel from the United KingdomThe new coronavirus variant has emerged as the United States grapples with a nationwide spike in infections that added more than a million new cases in just six days, according to a Reuters tally, a total of more than 18 million since the pandemic began.In California, an epicenter of the latest surge, intensive care unit (ICU) beds were scarce and hospitals said they lacked enough doctors and nurses to care for patients.“The whole California ICU capacity has been going down. We are all struggling,” said Dr. Imran Mohammed of Sutter Roseville Medical Center, north of Sacramento. “We really don’t want to see more than this. We will be challenged to see further ICU patients and we will have no place eventually.”Many U.S. states and cities have imposed lockdowns and business closures to try to get a handle on a wave of illness driven by last month’s Thanksgiving gatherings.Political leaders have asked Americans to stay home for the upcoming holidays to prevent a surge upon the surge threatening to overwhelm healthcare systems, a request that many have defied.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Tuesday that the altered coronavirus had not yet been detected in the United States.US Health Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which received US emergency use authorizations this month, should work against the new variant. Moderna Inc and BioNTech SE, which worked with Pfizer Inc to develop its vaccine, are scrambling to test their shots against the new virus mutations, but expressed confidence in them.“Scientifically it is highly likely that the immune response by this vaccine can also deal with this virus variant,” BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told reporters.More than 600,000 Americans had received their first Covid-19 vaccine doses as of Monday, according to the CDC.The first wave of shots have so far gone to healthcare workers and nursing home residents, as well as some top government officials. Americans in “non-essential” jobs have been told they would likely wait months for their turn.Azar and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official, received the Moderna shot on live television on Tuesday. President-elect Joe Biden was inoculated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in front of cameras on Monday.The White House coronavirus task force has no plans to restrict travel from the UK, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.But Michael Osterholm, one of Biden’s pandemic advisors, said all options needed to be considered, suggesting that the U.S. government could mandate a 14-day quarantine for visitors from the UK.Washington Governor Jay Inslee has ordered a 14-day quarantine for travelers arriving from the UK, South Africa or other “countries with circulation of a new, potentially more contagious Covid-19 variation.”New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he asked airlines to add his state to a list of 120 countries that require Covid-19 screening for incoming air travelers.“The United States should say the same thing that New York said. Say that people need to test before they come from the UK,” Cuomo said on a Tuesday call with reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-surge-as-hospitals-overwhelmed-before-holidays/story-MqwYfTgdOFtG1lnGsxagrL.html
23-12-2020||World||US loses one life every 33 seconds to Covid-19 in deadliest week so far||In the United States last week, someone died from Covid-19 every 33 seconds.The disease claimed more than 18,000 lives in the seven days ended Dec. 20, up 6.7% from the prior week to hit another record high, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county reports.Despite pleas by health officials not to travel during the end-year holiday season, 3.2 million people were screened at US airports on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.Health officials are worried that a surge in infections from holiday gatherings could overwhelm hospitals, some of which are already at capacity after Thanksgiving celebrations. And while the country has begun to administer two new vaccines, it may be months before the inoculations put a dent in the coronavirus outbreak.The number of new Covid-19 cases last week fell 1% to nearly 1.5 million. Tennessee, California and Rhode Island had the highest per capita new cases in the country, according to the Reuters analysis. In terms of deaths per capita, Iowa, South Dakota and Rhode Island were the hardest hit.Across the United States, 11.3% of tests came back positive for the virus, down from 12% the prior week, according to data from the volunteer-run Covid Tracking Project. Out of 50 states, 31 had a positive test rate of 10% or higher. The highest rates were in Iowa and Idaho at over 40%. The World Health Organization considers positive test rates above 5% concerning because it suggests there are more cases in the community that have not yet been uncovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-loses-one-life-every-33-seconds-to-covid-19-in-deadliest-week-so-far/story-Zr0RrGTwA9FZCmMPeVzfQN.html
23-12-2020||World||Biden hopes virus deal is glimpse of deal-making to come||For President-elect Joe Biden, Washington’s year-end burst of deal-making brought renewed hope for a productive, successful first 100 days in office.The city’s fever broke, at least momentarily, as longtime combatants finally forged a Covid-19 relief deal that carried with it dozens of smaller bills, offering proof that Capitol Hill’s damaged systems and norms can still produce meaningful legislation — at least when backed up against the wall.Most of Biden’s 36 years in the Senate came in an era when Washington functioned far better. As president he will be seeking to restore at least the veneer of good faith and bipartisanship that defined those times and cast aside the divisions of the tea party era and four years of President Donald Trump.Just as lawmakers celebrated their success, Trump on Tuesday night demanded changes to the bill — boosting direct payments to individuals from $600 to $2,000 — and suggested he might not sign it. The bill passed by veto-proof margins, but if Trump were to succeed in killing the bill, resuscitating the measure would likely be job No. 1 in a Biden-led Washington. In prior will-he-or-won’t-he high-wire acts, Trump has signed big spending bills, but it’s anybody’s guess now.In that context, the year-end deal — powered by the imperative to deliver pandemic relief to a struggling nation — is a good omen. At the end, it featured good-faith negotiation among Capitol Hill’s skilled but battling leaders as well as a productive role for moderates and pragmatists in both parties whose efforts are often brushed aside.“We have our first hint and glimpse of bipartisanship,” Biden said Tuesday. “In this election, the American people made it clear they want us to reach across the aisle and work together.”The demand for bipartisanship is a common refrain that often comes as a throwaway line from Washington pols who have little experience in delivering it. But Biden has made it the centerpiece of his transition message — and he has a track record in the Senate and in the Obama administration of following through.He also has no choice. The election delivered Democrats the narrowest House majority of the modern age and a narrowly divided Senate that demands bipartisanship, even if Democrats win control of a 50-50 chamber after next month’s twin Georgia runoff elections.Biden said there is much more work to do and spoke optimistically of lawmakers coming together again in January or February to pass another package — and the template for success is there.There are few measures of success greater than a big, bipartisan vote. By that metric, the 5,593-page, end-of-session behemoth — combining a $900 billion Covid-19 relief deal, a $1.4 trillion catchall spending bill, and dozens of late-session add-ons — was a smash hit. The 92-6 Senate vote and a pair of lopsided House tallies on the final bill came after months of indecision and deadlock were replaced with frenzied deal-cutting and compromise.Yet there are those in Biden’s party deeply skeptical that bipartisanship can take root in such a starkly polarized country. Republicans are certain to feel the pull of their far-right flank in the coming era, shifting the party to a debt-and-deficits focus that may well be incompatible with much of Biden’s agenda.And then there’s the Capitol itself. The pain-inducing process that led to the final virus package offered almost daily lessons in Congress’ capacity for dysfunction and wheel-spinning. And enormous power remains concentrated in the hands of only a few leaders.Top Republicans, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who will be a critical power broker during Biden’s first two years in office, credited Biden with getting Democratic leaders such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to accept a bill that was smaller than those she rejected in the summer and fall.“The new president was helpful in suggesting that we ought to go ahead now and I think that may have had an impact on the speaker,” McConnell told reporters Monday.Biden and McConnell have a long relationship and worked out several deals on taxes and spending during President Barack Obama’s first term. The polarization of the parties and the scorched-earth politics of the past decade won’t make that success easy to replicate, but Biden is all-in.“They know I level with them,” Biden said of Republicans. “They know I never mislead. They know I tell them the truth, and they know I don’t go out of my way to try to embarrass.”Bipartisanship and deals with McConnell were hardly the message voiced by most Democrats during a campaign in which liberals schemed to get rid of the Senate filibuster to power through their agenda.But when Pelosi pulled back from demands for more than $2 trillion in Covid-19 relief earlier this month, there was little public backlash from arch progressives. Instead, Democrat after Democrat issued praise for the legislation even though it offered less direct aid to struggling people than they wanted.The optimistic take is that Covid-19 relief, with its near-universal support in Congress, amounts to training wheels for a post-Trump Washington to find its way. While topics like immigration and taxes may be too tough to tackle, there’s genuine hope in areas like infrastructure.Pelosi is Biden’s most powerful asset but she will have her hands full managing the smallest House majority of modern times. Her caucus increasingly tilts to the left and it sustained deep losses in swing districts and Trump country in the fall. But there’s no sense, it seems, in catering to the left under the looming balance of power — and a mid-term election in 2022 that will determine whether Biden’s Democrats lose control of the House.Pelosi and McConnell have a strained relationship, but when their interests align and when they work in tandem, they are an unstoppable force. The pending new agreement started out as one to work out the annual appropriations bills. It quickly became clear that momentum could be sustained as senior lawmakers were given opportunities to find agreement on taxes, education, energy, and appropriations.The skill is there. Finding the will and the way is the challenge.Democratic lobbyist Steve Elmendorf said Biden and his team are going to be highly engaged and that gives him reason for optimism.“These people are obviously dysfunctional and have some challenging relationships,” he said of Trump and his team and allies. “The fact that it took so long to get them in a room is everybody’s fault. Well, Joe Biden’s not going to let that happen.”Washington, however, rarely rewards those who suspend their cynicism. Democrats who give grudging respect to McConnell say the best hope for bipartisanship may be his desire to do what’s best for the GOP’s hopes to hold the Senate — just as they detect the politics of the Georgia runoff races as a reason for McConnell’s flexibility now on pandemic relief.“We’re accustomed to each other but he’s got a pretty big job,” McConnell said of Biden. “So we’ll see how that works out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-hopes-virus-deal-is-glimpse-of-deal-making-to-come/story-IoylDaAi1yVSl5oYxr04qI.html
23-12-2020||World||Bhutan PM announces 7-day nationwide lockdown amid new Covid-19 cases||Bhutan will go on lockdown for seven days starting from Tuesday amid rising case of Covid-19 cases, announced Bhutan Prime Minister Lotay Tshering.In a statement, Tshering announced that a nationwide lockdown will be enforced for seven days, starting December 23, adding that the lockdown will enable the government to control the spread of the disease and also discern the extent of transmission in the communities.“In continuation to the inter-district movement restriction imposed this morning, the national Covid-19 Taskforce decided the need for a more stringent action after detection of sporadic cases in flu clinics in Thimphu and Paro, and also in Lhamoizingkha, which is evident of local transmission,” the statement read.As per a bulletin by Ministry of Health of the Himalayan Kingdom on December 22, the total number of Covid-19 cases stood at 479 out of which 430 have recovered. Bhutan is yet to record a Covid-19 fatality.While only designated shops within the zones and essential services will be available, all schools, institutions, offices and business establishments should remain closed.Similarly, movement of individuals with the card within the zones and delivery of essentials will start in Thimphu tomorrow, as it completes the third day of lockdown. However, zone relaxation will not apply to houses under isolation, the statement noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhutan-pm-announces-7-day-nationwide-lockdown-amid-new-covid-19-cases/story-ZfEAnV4yi6a4U6URJaSpwO.html
23-12-2020||World||Pfizer close in on deal to supply additional vaccine doses to US||Pfizer Inc. is moving closer to finalizing a deal to supply the US government with as many as 100 million more doses of the drugmaker’s coronavirus vaccine, according to a person familiar with the matter.Such a pact could expand the number of shots available to the government as it ramps up its immunization drive in the coming year. While talks were continuing on Tuesday evening, a deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the discussions are private.The deal would involve the US government using its authority to help prioritize Pfizer’s orders with suppliers of various components needed to make the vaccine. An agreement could still be delayed, according to the person.Operation Warp Speed, the US vaccine-development program, initially agreed in July to buy 100 million doses of Pfizer’s two-dose regimen, which the New York drugmaker developed with German partner BioNTech SE. The $1.95 billion contract came with an option to buy 500 million more doses.The Pfizer-BioNTech shot was expected to be one of a half dozen the US would deploy to immunize its population. But some competing vaccines that the government had been relying on to fill out its lineup are taking longer than expected to develop, raising questions about how quickly the US could reach herd immunity and begin to return to some semblance of normalcy.The two sides have been inching toward a deal after finding themselves at odds over reports that the government declined an offer earlier this year from Pfizer to buy more doses, and that Pfizer would need to fulfill commitments to other countries before it could get more shots to the US.The U.S. effort to stock up isn’t limited to Pfizer. Earlier this month, the US exercised an option to buy 100 million additional vaccine doses from Moderna Inc., doubling the number it has on order from that company to 200 million. Moderna’s vaccine is also a two-shot regimen, but it doesn’t have to be stored at the same ultra cold temperatures as the Pfizer shot.Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser to Operation Warp Speed, said in an interview with Bloomberg last week that Pfizer had asked the US to exercise the Defense Production Act in order to get additional equipment and materials so it could scale up quickly and deliver more doses in the second quarter of 2021.The US vaccine distribution effort has been gaining steam since Pfizer’s shot gained its emergency clearance earlier this month and Moderna’s was authorized last week. This week, 7.9 million vaccine doses are expected to be shipped in the US, including 2 million Pfizer shots and 5.9 million from Moderna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-close-in-on-deal-to-supply-additional-vaccine-doses-to-us/story-ivr7d5j1S46XowsggeUPdP.html
23-12-2020||World||Chinese ambassador steps up as Nepal’s communist party stares at a split||Chinese ambassador Hou Yanqi on Tuesday evening met Nepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari at the presidential palace Shital Niwas, people familiar with the matter said. The hour-long meeting comes two days after the President signed off on Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s recommendation to dissolve parliament, a precursor to the split in Nepal’s communist party that the Chinese leadership had been trying to avert.The Nepal Communist Party was formed less than three years ago with the merger of PM Oli-led Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre. The power tussle between PM Oli and Prachanda intensified over the last several months after Prachanda accused the prime minister of violating their power-sharing pact.Chinese envoy Hou had been able to convince the two sides to patch up on previous occasions this year but has been less than successful over the last few months, particularly after Beijing indicated that it wasn’t averse to a change of prime minister if it keeps the communist party intact.There was no official word about the Chinese envoy’s discussions with the President on Tuesday. One version swirling in Kathmandu’s political circles was that Tuesday’s meeting was to discuss supply of Covid vaccines. But this version is viewed suspiciously.Also Read | Nepal PM Oli seeks control of communist party, rivals ‘sack’ him as party bossWhen a controversy had erupted in July this year around ambassador Hou Yanqi’s meetings with President Bhandari and other political leaders including PM Oli and his rivals, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Zhang Si had told the Kathmandu Post that China did not wish to see the Nepal Communist Party in trouble and wished that leaders would resolve their differences and stay united. “The embassy keeps good relationships with Nepali leaders and is ready to exchange views on issues of common interest at any convenient time,” Zhang had said.Tuesday’s meeting coincided with PM Oli and the rival faction led by former prime ministers Prachanda, Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal fighting to consolidate their control over the communist party.The Prachanda-led faction, which has majority support in most key party bodies such as the standing committee and the central committee, announced that the party had decided to replace PM Oli as the NCP’s co-chairman with Madhav Nepal.Also Read | Nepal’s unconstitutional turnPM Oli, on the other hand, insisted that party meetings convened without his approval were illegitimate. At a meeting that he had called a few hours earlier, PM Oli had inducted his loyalists into the communist party’s central committee to shore up his support within the crucial body.It isn’t clear if ambassador Hou will be meeting PM Oli as well. But their last meeting in November didn’t go too well after it became clear that Beijing was indifferent to his continuation in the government.Prime Minister Oli is believed to have indicated to ambassador Hou that he is capable of handling challenges within his party without any assistance from other countries. This approach also fitted well with PM Oli’s efforts to reclaim the nationalist agenda that was the mainstay of his campaign that led to the NCP’s win in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-envoy-meets-president-as-nepal-s-communist-party-is-headed-for-a-split/story-foF1MunNgzorJHVNRtmuRL.html
23-12-2020||World||Donald Trump must blame Russia for cyber attack on US, says Joe Biden||President-elect Joe Biden said on Tuesday he had seen no evidence that a massive cyber attack against the United States is under control and warned that the breach will not go unanswered once he takes office on Jan. 20.Biden, the Democratic former vice president, said President Donald Trump needs to squarely place blame for the hack on Russia - something he has yet to do even though both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr have accused Moscow.Trump has floated the idea on Twitter that China might be responsible for the hacking spree. Uncovered last week, it breached at least half a dozen US government agencies and left thousands of American companies exposed.“It is a grave risk and it continues,” Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware. “I see no evidence that it’s under control. I see none. Heard of none. Department won’t even brief us on many things. So I know of nothing that suggests it’s under control.”Biden faulted Trump for stripping US defenses against cyber attacks, saying: “This assault happened on Donald Trump’s watch, when he wasn’t watching.”Responding to the cyber attack is among a host of issues Biden faces when he starts work in the Oval Office. After defeating Trump in a November election, he also must fight the coronavirus pandemic and work with Congress to battle the economic damage from Covid-19 lockdowns.Biden said on Tuesday his administration will put forward another Covid-19 relief package next year, including a new round of stimulus payments, after Congress passed an $892 billion relief package this week.The next Covid relief bill should address vaccine distribution, unemployment, a moratorium on evictions for people who cannot pay their mortgages, and PPE and other supplies to businesses, he said.HOW TO RESPONDBiden said his administration will take meaningful steps to respond to the cyber breach.The incoming White House chief of staff said on Sunday that Biden’s response to the hacking campaign would go beyond sanctions. Ron Klain said Biden was mapping out ways to degrade the capacity of foreign actors to engage in cyber attacks against the United States.Options being mulled by the Biden administration to punish Moscow for its alleged role include financial penalties and retaliatory hacks on Russian infrastructure, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.The Kremlin denies any role in the hacking.“The question of the damage done remains to be determined. We have to look at, very closely, the nature of the breaches, how extensive they are, and what damage has been done,” Biden said.As Biden closes in on his final selections for his Cabinet, he will introduce his pick for US Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, at an event in Delaware on Wednesday, his transition team said.Cardona is a veteran teacher and school administrator, a choice that would align with a pledge Biden made during his presidential campaign to appoint a teacher as education secretary.Biden has not yet nominated an attorney general or director of the Central Intelligence Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-must-blame-russia-for-cyber-attack-on-us-says-joe-biden/story-nyieqkmgzqOhnHlg19524M.html

But an uptick in travel to and from the region this spring and early summer have heightened infection risk.An Army press officer said the first Covid-19 cases had been reported in mid-December, when two soldiers fell ill.The Magallanes region, one of the closest populated areas to Antarctica and take-off point for many boats and planes headed to the continent, is among the hardest-hit in Chile.Much of the area, blasted by cold winds off the ocean, mountains and glaciers, has been under quarantine restrictions for months.Chile’s Navy reported it too had detected three cases of Covid-19 among 208 crew members of a ship that had sailed in the Antarctic region between Nov. 27 and Dec. 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-reaches-end-of-earth-as-first-outbreak-hits-antarctica/story-Zry0h6Qqpglcu6nVzO6IUP.html

23-12-2020||World||Reversing Trump border policies will take months, says Joe Biden||President-elect Joe Biden says it will take months to roll back some of President Donald Trump’s actions on immigration, tempering expectations he generated during his campaign and one that may rile advocates pushing for speedy action on the issue.His Tuesday comments echo those made by two of his top foreign policy advisers in an interview with Spanish wire service EFE on Monday hitting the brakes on rolling back Trump’s restrictive asylum policies. Susan Rice, Biden’s incoming domestic policy adviser, and Jake Sullivan, his pick for national security adviser, as well as Biden himself, warned that moving too quickly could create a new crisis at the border.Speaking to reporters in Wilmington, Delaware Wednesday, Biden said he’s already started discussing the issues with the Mexican president and “our friends in Latin America” and that “the timeline is to do it so that we in fact make it better not worse.”“The last thing we need is to say we’re going to stop immediately, the access to asylum, the way it’s being run now, and then end up with 2 million people on our border,” Biden said.He noted that more funding is needed for more asylum judges to process claims, and promised that while he will work to loosen Trump’s asylum restrictions, “it’s going to take probably the next six months to put that in place.”His comments come as interceptions along the border have increased in recent months. US authorities encountered migrants at the border with Mexico more than 70,000 times in October and in November, four times April’s tally. Some experts predict the surge could increase in the early months of Biden’s presidency, as a response to the damage wrought by the two hurricanes that have pummeled Central America and the economic fallout from the pandemic, as well as expectations of a more humane approach to immigration from the Biden Administration.Sullivan and Rice both said in their interview with EFE that Biden will take executive action where possible to address issues with the immigration system, and emphasized plans to provide humanitarian aid and help bolster Latin American economies to try to address the root cause of the influx of immigrants to the US.Biden “will work to promptly undo” Trump’s deals with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador that let the US transfer asylum seekers to those countries, and will “follow through” on his commitment to end a Trump-era program that returns undocumented border crossers to Mexico to await their legal proceedings, Sullivan said. On his campaign website, Biden promised to end the agreement with Mexico, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, within the first 100 days of his presidency.But Sullivan emphasized that many of those reforms will take time.He cautioned that “increasing processing capacity and changing policy at the border will take time,” and warned those considering fleeing for the US to wait, predicting it will take “months” for the Biden Administration to fully implement their plans with respect to Latin America.“Given the pandemic and the large number of migrants already waiting in northern Mexico, now is not the time to undertake the dangerous trip to the United States,” he said. It will take months until we are able to fully implement our plans.”Rice said that “processing capacity at the border is not like a light that you can just switch on and off.”“Our priority is to reopen asylum processing at the border consistent with the capacity to do so safely and to protect public health, especially in the context of Covid-19. This effort will begin immediately but it will take months to develop the capacity that we will need to reopen fully,” she said.But Michele Heisler, medical director of Physicians for Human Rights, expressed concerns about the pace of change during a conference call with reporters Tuesday and said there should be no “public-health rationale” to maintain extraordinary powers to immediately expel people from the United States without an opportunity to seek asylum.Rice was noncommittal about when Biden would withdraw that authority, which Trump introduced in March on grounds that it would contain the coronavirus even though reporting by The Associated Press and others has found that government scientists saw no evidence for it.Still, other pro-immigrant advocates said Tuesday that while they understood it would take time to untangle some of Trump’s changes at the border, they underscored a sense of urgency. They hailed Biden’s emphasis on working with Mexico and Central America on joint solutions.“The Biden administration’s work to end cruelty must start immediately,” said Linda Rivas, executive director and managing attorney of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas. “Human rights and dignity must take center stage.”Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, said it was a “matter of life and death,” with many asylum-seekers waiting in extremely violent Mexican border cities for their cases to be heard in the United States.She said in a conference call with reporters that she was concerned about how many asylum-seekers will be allowed in by Biden “but we are here, ready, determined that the process works for all those that are impacted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reversing-trump-border-policies-will-take-months-says-joe-biden/story-h1x6vZXSbN26XAjCbA9AxK.html
23-12-2020||World||Feds sue Walmart over role in opioid crisis||The Justice Department sued Walmart on Tuesday, accusing it of fueling the nation’s opioid crisis by pressuring its pharmacies to fill even potentially suspicious prescriptions for the powerful painkillers.The civil complaint filed points to the role Walmart’s pharmacies may have played in the crisis by filling opioid prescriptions and Walmart’s own responsibility for the allegedly illegal distribution of controlled substances to the pharmacies at the height of the opioid crisis. Walmart operates more than 5,000 pharmacies in its stores around the country.The Justice Department alleges Walmart violated federal law by selling thousands of prescriptions for controlled substances that its pharmacists “knew were invalid,” said Jeffrey Clark, the acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department’s civil division.Federal law required Walmart to spot suspicious orders for controlled substances and report those to the Drug Enforcement Administration, but prosecutors charge the company didn’t do that.“Walmart knew that its distribution centers were using an inadequate system for detecting and reporting suspicious orders,” said Jason Dunn, the U.S. attorney in Colorado. “For years, Walmart reported virtually no suspicious orders at all. In other words, Walmart’s pharmacies ordered opioids in a way that went essentially unmonitored and unregulated.”The 160-page suit alleges that Walmart made it difficult for its pharmacists to follow the rules, putting “enormous pressure” on them to fill a high volume of prescriptions as fast as possible, while at the same time denying them the authority to categorically refuse to fill prescriptions issued by prescribers the pharmacists knew were continually issuing invalid invalid prescriptions.The suit highlighted alleged problems in Walmart’s compliance department, which oversaw the dispensing nationwide of controlled substance prescriptions. In particular, even after Walmart pharmacists informed the compliance unit about “pill-mill” prescribers whose practices raised egregious red flags, Walmart allegedly continued to fill invalid prescriptions issued by those prescribers, according to the suit. The suit said that only later did Walmart allow pharmacists to do blanket refusals for these suspect practices.Walmart fought back in an emailed statement to The Associated Press, saying that the Justice Department’s investigation is “tainted by historical ethics violations.” It said the “lawsuit invents a legal theory that unlawfully forces pharmacists to come between patients and their doctors, and is riddled with factual inaccuracies and cherry-picked documents taken out of context.”Walmart noted it always empowered its pharmacists to refuse to fill problematic opioids prescriptions, and said they refused to fill hundreds of thousands of such prescriptions. Walmart also noted it sent the Drug Enforcement Administration tens of thousands of investigative leads, and it blocked thousands of questionable doctors from having their opioid prescriptions filled at its pharmacies.In a corporate blog post published late Tuesday, Walmart argued that many health regulators, medical groups, doctors and patients criticize the company for going too far in refusing to fill opioid prescriptions. Some even say Walmart is improperly interfering in the doctor-patient relationship, the company said.AP reported the news of the lawsuit ahead of the Justice Department’s public announcement, citing a person who could not discuss the matter publicly before the announced move. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Walmart filed its own preemptive suit against the Justice Department, Attorney General William Barr and the Drug Enforcement Administration nearly two months ago.In its lawsuit, Walmart said the Justice Department’s investigation — launched in 2016 — had identified hundreds of doctors who wrote problematic prescriptions that Walmart’s pharmacists should not have filled. But the lawsuit charged that nearly 70% of the doctors still have active registrations with the DEA.“Blaming pharmacists for not second-guessing the very doctors the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) approved to prescribe opioids is a transparent attempt to shift blame from DEA’s well-documented failures in keeping bad doctors from prescribing opioids in the first place,” the company said in its statement.Walmart’s lawsuit alleged the government was blaming it for the lack of regulatory and enforcement policies to stem the crisis. The company is asking a federal judge to declare that the government’s suit has no basis to seek civil damages. That suit remains ongoing.The initial investigation was the subject of a ProPublica story published in March. ProPublica reported that Joe Brown, then US attorney for the Eastern District of Texas office, spent years pursuing a criminal case against Walmart for its opioid prescription practices, only to have it stymied after the retail giant’s lawyers appealed to senior officials in the Justice Department.Two months later, Brown resigned. He didn’t give a reason for his departure except to say he would be “pursuing opportunities in the private and public sectors.” Brown went into private practice in the Dallas area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/feds-sue-walmart-over-role-in-opioid-crisis/story-RrcoHbtbqaY6xVy497IKSP.html
23-12-2020||World||Donald Trump pardons 15, including Republican allies||President Donald Trump on Tuesday pardoned 15 people, including Republicans who were strong and early supporters, a 2016 campaign official ensnared in the Russia probe and former government contractors convicted in a 2007 massacre in Baghdad.Trump also commuted the sentences of five others. While it is not unusual for presidents to grant clemency on their way out the door, Trump has made clear that he has no qualms about intervening in the cases of friends and allies whom he believes have been treated unfairly. Despite speculation, though, not on the list were members of Trump’s own family, his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and the president himself.The pardons included former Republican Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York. Trump also commuted the sentence of former Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas and pardoned a current state representative, Phil Lyman of Utah, who led an ATV protest through restricted native lands.Collins, the first member of Congress to endorse Trump to be president, was sentenced to two years and two months in federal prison after admitting he helped his son and others dodge $800,000 in stock market losses when he learned that a drug trial by a small pharmaceutical company had failed.Hunter was sentenced to 11 months in prison after pleading guilty to stealing campaign funds and spending the money on everything from outings with friends to his daughter’s birthday party.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the pardons for Hunter and Collins were granted after “the request of many members of Congress.” She noted that Hunter served the nation in the US Marines and saw combat in both Iraq and Afghanistan.In the group announced Tuesday night were four former government contractors convicted in a 2007 massacre in Baghdad that left more a dozen Iraqi civilians dead and caused an international uproar over the use of private security guards in a war zone.Supporters of Nicholas Slatten, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard, the former contractors at Blackwater Worldwide, had lobbied for pardons, arguing that the men had been excessively punished in an investigation and prosecution they said was tainted by problems and withheld exculpatory evidence. All four were serving lengthy prison sentences.The pardons reflected Trump’s apparent willingness to give the benefit of doubt to American servicemembers and contractors when it comes to acts of violence in warzones against civilians. Last November, for instance, he pardoned a former US Army commando who was set to stand trial next year in the killing of a suspected Afghan bomb-maker and a former Army lieutenant convicted of murder for ordering his men to fire upon three Afghans.Trump also announced pardons for allies ensnared in the Russia investigation. One was for George Papadopoulos, his 2016 campaign adviser whose conversation unwittingly helped trigger the Russia investigation that shadowed Trump’s presidency for nearly two years. He also pardoned Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer who was sentenced to 30 days in prison for lying to investigators during special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Van der Zwaan and Papadopoulos are the third and fourth Russia investigation defendants granted clemency. By pardoning them, Trump once again took aim at Mueller’s probe and pushed a broader effort to undo the results of the investigation that yielded criminal charges against a half-dozen associates.The pardons drew criticism from top Democrats. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said the president was abusing his power.“Trump is doling out pardons, not on the basis of repentance, restitution or the interests of justice, but to reward his friends and political allies, to protect those who lie to cover up him, to shelter those guilty of killing civilians, and to undermine an investigation that uncovered massive wrongdoing,” Schiff said.Last month, Trump pardoned former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and months earlier commuted the sentence of another associate, Roger Stone, days before he was to report to prison.Trump has granted about 2% of requested pardons in his single term in office, and had done 27 before Tuesday’s announcement. By comparison, Barack Obama granted 212 or 6%, and George W. Bush granted about 7%, or 189. George H. W. Bush, another one-term president, granted 10% of requests.Utah state Rep. Phil Lyman was serving as a county commissioner in 2014 when he led a protest of about 50 ATV riders in a canyon home to Native American cliff dwellings that officials closed to motorized traffic. The ride occurred amid a sputtering movement in the West pushing back against federal control of large swaths of land and came in the wake of an armed confrontation Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy had with Bureau of Land Management over grazing fees.Lyman spent 10 days in prison and was ordered to pay nearly $96,000 in restitution. The Trump administration in 2017 lifted a ban on motorized vehicles in parts of the canyon but left restrictions in place through other areas where Lyman led his ride.Two former US Border Patrol agents were also pardoned, Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, convicted of shooting and wounding a Mexican drug smuggler near El Paso, Texas, in 2005.Others on the list included a Pittsburgh dentist who pleaded guilty to health care fraud, two women convicted of drug crimes, and Alfred Lee Crum, now 89, who pleaded guilty in 1952 when he was 19 to helping his wife’s uncle illegally distill moonshine.Crum served three years of probation and paid a $250 fine. The White House said Crum has maintained a clean record and a strong marriage for nearly 70 years, attended the same church for 60 years, raised four children, and regularly participated in charity fundraising events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pardons-15-including-republican-allies/story-lJsjrB4UlSWEaxdYzoQYAL.html
23-12-2020||World||US negotiating for millions more Covid vaccine doses from Pfizer||The US government is negotiating with Pfizer to acquire tens of millions of additional vaccine doses in exchange for helping the pharmaceutical giant gain better access to manufacturing supplies.A person with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the deal is under discussion but has not been finalized. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to describe ongoing deliberations.Pfizer’s vaccine was the first to gain approval from the Food and Drug Administration and initial shipments went to states last week. It has now been joined by a vaccine from Moderna, which was developed in closer cooperation with scientists from the National Institutes of Health.A law dating back to the Korean War gives the government authority to direct private companies to produce critical goods in times of national emergency. Called the Defense Production Act, it could be used to help Pfizer secure supplies ranging from needed chemicals to vials to containers and materials to keep its vaccine super-cold. The person who spoke to the AP about the negotiations described using the defense law as an option under consideration.Moderna’s vaccine was developed in close collaboration with the government’s own effort, which is called Operation Warp Speed. It was designed to have millions of vaccine doses ready and available to ship once a shot received FDA approval.Pfizer has a contract to supply the government with 100 million doses of its vaccine under Operation Warp Speed, but government officials have said it’s more of an arms-length relationship with the company and they don’t have as much visibility into its operations.Having tens of millions more doses from Pfizer would help the US keep up the pace of vaccinations through the winter and into the spring, moving the nation closer to the goal of vaccinating all Americans.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said last week that the government was negotiating with Pfizer for more doses, but details provided Tuesday about the company’s desire for better access to supplies are new.Earlier, US officials had said they were discussing the purchase of another 100 million doses of Pfizer vaccine for delivery as early as the middle of next year. Those details and timing may have changed.Pfizer said in a statement that “we continue to work collaboratively with the US government to get doses of our Covid-19 vaccine to as many Americans as possible. The company is not able to comment on any confidential discussions that may be taking place with the US government.”The vaccine from Pfizer and German pharmaceutical BioNTech immediately raised hopes of taming a pandemic that has killed nearly 320,000 people in the US and hobbled much of the national economy. Health care workers and nursing home residents topped the list as local TV stations across the country began broadcasting scenes of the first vaccinations. Some polls show skepticism about getting vaccinated may be easing.After early failures with testing, Trump administration officials are hoping to write a very different ending with vaccines. Operation Warp Speed has financed the development, manufacture and distribution of millions of doses, with the goal of providing a free vaccine to any American who wants one.Operation Warp Speed is on track to have about 40 million doses of vaccine by the end of this month, of which about 20 million would be allocated for first vaccinations. Distribution of those doses would span into the first week of January. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two shots to be fully effective.The New York Times first reported the new details of negotiations between Pfizer and the Trump administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-negotiating-for-millions-more-covid-vaccine-doses-from-pfizer/story-lvdWTEEnKZjosmNUWJyviM.html

Its key exports to the United States include garments, electronics and wooden products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-voices-concern-about-vietnam-s-trade-deficit-in-call-with-pm/story-1VyNHVurYGpkIWrAeEDihI.html
23-12-2020||World||Israel to hold snap election, with Netanyahu facing new challenges||Israel will hold a snap election in March after parliament failed on Tuesday to meet a deadline to pass a budget, triggering a ballot presenting new challenges for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Campaigning in Israel’s fourth parliamentary election in two years gets underway with Netanyahu facing public anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and while he is engaged in a corruption trial, the first against an Israeli prime minister.Israel’s longest-serving leader will also have to contend with a new rival from the right, Gideon Saar, a defector from Netanyahu’s Likud party. An opinion poll on Israel’s Kan public TV on Tuesday showed Saar drawing even with the prime minister.Netanyahu, who has denied any criminal wrongdoing, and the current defence minister, centrist politician Benny Gantz, established a unity government in May after three inconclusive elections held since April 2019.But they have been locked in a dispute over passage of a national budget, key to implementing a deal in which Gantz was to have taken over from Netanyahu in November 2021. A new election means that “rotation” will never happen.Some political analysts said Netanyahu had hoped to use the budget dispute to force an election that would get him out of the power-sharing deal with Gantz. But they said he had preferred a ballot in May or June, when a vaccination campaign now underway could bring him more voters.“If an election is forced upon us, I promise you that we will win,” Netanyahu said in a televised speech on Tuesday, blaming Gantz - who has plunged in the polls - for the early ballot.“Netanyahu is taking us to an election for the sole purpose of not going to jail,” Gantz wrote on Twitter, alleging that Netanyahu hoped for a new government to promote legislation quashing legal proceedings against him.Netanyahu will remain prime minister until a new government is formed after the March election. Now 71, he first served in the post from 1996 to 1999 and has held the office since 2009.In his TV address, and effectively kicking off his campaign, Netanyahu said he had arranged for millions of doses of coronavirus vaccine to be delivered to Israel. He also hailed US-brokered diplomatic deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with President Donald Trump, who made a number of pro-Israel moves during the previous elections. But with US President-elect Joe Biden set to take office in January, Netanyahu will lose a major campaign asset, said Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-hold-snap-election-with-netanyahu-facing-new-challenges/story-LwKRHkBgANpz8VxWTwRzwI.html
23-12-2020||World||France reopens border with UK after paralyzing busiest port||Critical trade and transportation links between the UK and continental Europe are to resume after France agreed to end a suspension that crippled Britain’s busiest port at a time of high political drama over Brexit.European Union citizens and residents able to show negative Covid-19 tests will be able to travel from the UK, according to French Prime Minister Jean Castex. The objective is now to have freight traffic moving by Wednesday morning, a French official said.France cut off shipments from Dover in southeast England on Sunday because of concern over a faster-spreading variant of Covid-19 that prompted the UK government to lock down London and surrounding areas.What followed was two days of cross-Channel political bartering over the reopening of routes just as negotiations with the EU over a post-Brexit trade deal intensified. With less than 10 days to go before a transition period ends on Dec. 31, the upheaval gave a snapshot of the potential pain Britain’s closest continental neighbor can unleash.The UK found itself effectively isolated as more than 40 countries restricted flights, including many EU members.Almost 3,000 trucks have been stuck in southeast England, threatening a deficit of some fresh food items in British supermarkets. German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG said it would airlift fresh produce to the UK on Wednesday to ease any potential shortages.Testing TalksBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson called French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday to try to find a solution and both sides had promised to resolve the border issue within hours. Instead, the impasse dragged on over a disagreement on how to ensure truck drivers were not carrying the new coronavirus strain into France.The French side was pushing for haulers to take PCR tests, which give a result in between 24 and 48 hours, two people familiar with the matter said. The UK preferred lateral flow tests that are less accurate, but take only about 15 minutes -- so could ease the blockage faster.The British military and National Health Service will establish multiple testing sites in Kent, the county where Dover is located, Sky News reported.The new travel restrictions will apply until at least Jan. 6, the French government said. The British side asked to publish any announcement late in the day to avoid too many trucks driving to Kent, according to a person familiar with the matter.“Truckers shouldn’t, and it’s important, gather at departure points in Kent to avoid saturating the system we’re putting into place,” Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, French junior transport minister, told BFM TV.UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps echoed that request in a statement on Tuesday evening. “This protocol will see the French border reopen to those traveling for urgent reasons, provided they have a certified negative Covid test,” Shapps said. “We continue to urge hauliers not to travel to Kent until further notice as we work to alleviate congestion at ports.”Isolating BritainEU ambassadors meeting in Brussels agreed to continue monitoring the epidemiological situation closely and the EU’s crisis response unit is ready to meet if necessary in the coming days, EU diplomats said. The envoys stressed the importance of maintaining the flow of freight into and out of the UKDoug Bannister, chief executive of the Port of Dover, said earlier that the backlog of cargo could be quickly cleared once France reopens its border. After a security-related shutdown was lifted in September, 4,500 trucks boarded ferries in just 12 hours, he said.“Glad it’s finally been reopened,” said Duncan Buchanan, policy director of the Road Haulage Association, which represents UK trucking firms. “It was an unsustainable position to blockade the UK like that. Testing is a waste of time, but if you have to, you have to.”Earlier on Tuesday, the European Commission called on member states to reopen critical trade and passenger transport links to the UK while discouraging non-essential travel.Non-essential travel between the UKand the EU is set to be temporarily restricted anyway from Jan. 1, when Britain leaves the continent’s customs union. As a so-called third country, the UK will be subject to Covid-related restrictions.With 2021 looming, the broader contours of Britain’s future relationship with the EU are still being thrashed out by negotiating teams holed up in Brussels trying to finalize a trade deal.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said Britain and the EU are giving negotiations on a trade deal “a final push,” while officials on both sides talked of a possible agreement as soon as Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-reopens-border-with-uk-after-paralyzing-busiest-port/story-z4E5J5Qm3X87DckNUQIsOO.html
23-12-2020||World||Covid-19: Pfizer, Moderna testing vaccines on new strain||Pfizer and Moderna are testing their Covid-19 vaccines against the new fast-spreading variant of the virus that has emerged in Britain, CNN reported on Tuesday.Moderna expects immunity from its vaccine to protect against the variant and is performing more tests in the coming weeks to confirm, the company said in a statement to CNN. Pfizer, meanwhile, said it is “generating data” on how well blood samples from people immunised with its vaccine “may be able to neutralise the new strain from the UK,” according to the report.Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.The discovery of the new coronavirus strain sowed a fresh wave of panic in a pandemic that has killed about 1.7 million people and infected more than 77.15 million worldwide. BioNTech: Covid vaccine for new strain in 6 weeks The co-founder of BioNTech said on Tuesday it was “highly likely” that its vaccine against the coronavirus works against the mutated strain detected in Britain, but it could also adapt the vaccine if necessary in six weeks. “It is highly likely that the immune response by this vaccine also can deal with the new virus variant,” said Ugur Sahin. But if needed, “the beauty of the messenger technology is that we can directly start to engineer a vaccine which completely mimics this new mutation. We could be able to provide a new vaccine technically within six weeks”.The World Health Organization (WHO), which has said the situation is not “out of control”, will convene a meeting of members to discuss strategies to counter the new strain, its European office said on Tuesday. It did not give a date yet.Meanwhile, at least five countries suspended flights from South Africa after a new and different coronavirus variant was discovered in the country. Germany, Turkey, Israel, Switzerland and Saudi Arabia have announced a ban on flights from the southern African nation.The Vatican said on Tuesday that Pope Francis will deliver his Christmas Day message indoors due to restrictions even as two cardinals close to the pontiff have tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pfizer-moderna-testing-vaccines-on-new-strain/story-9l8hg7Li4J9L5FsEx7JxFO.html
