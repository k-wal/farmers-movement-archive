He urged “early consultation with our European partners on our common concerns about China’s economic practices.”The EU wants the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment to open up China’s market and eliminate discriminatory practices, but critics say that it would in turn reward Beijing with preferential access to European markets despite moves to crush dissent in places from Hong Kong to Xinjiang. A deal would be a “symbolic victory” for China, and could make it harder to forge transatlantic unity on China, according to Mikko Huotari, director of the Mercator Institute for China studies in Berlin.Both sides have set a deadline of the end of the year, but the negotiations could yet stumble if Beijing refuses to budge over key demands on how it treats its workers. The European Parliament passed a resolution on December 17 condemning China’s use of forced labour in Xinjiang, and called for the investment accord to include commitments to respect international conventions banning such practices.‘Totally Baseless’“There is no such thing as so-called forced labour in Xinjiang,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday. “The relevant accusation is totally baseless. It smears and slanders against the Xinjiang region and the Chinese side.” Wang didn’t say what commitments China would be prepared to make on labour issues.Several European lawmakers and China analysts have expressed concern that the EU and especially Germany, as holder of the bloc’s rotating presidency and the EU nation with the deepest trade ties to China, may be prepared to set aside labour issues in its rush for a deal by year’s end. They urge holding off until talks can take place with the Biden administration on a common approach to China. The European Parliament will have a say in approving any EU-China deal.Bernd Lange, a German Social Democrat who chairs the European Parliament’s trade committee, said the fact an agreement was near despite such concerns was “clearly worrying.”“Trade policy does not take place in a vacuum,” he said on Twitter. “How the question of forced labour is addressed will determine the agreement’s fate.”No SurprisesChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi discussed the negotiations for an agreement during a working lunch on Monday with EU country ambassadors as well as Nicolas Chapuis, head of the EU delegation in Beijing. In a statement, the EU noted progress in the ongoing talks and said that both sides are in “continuous contact to address outstanding issues.”Human-rights activists say the so-called re-education centers and vocational training programs in the mainly Muslim Xinjiang region are de facto detention camps, while a recent report by prominent researcher Adrian Zenz claimed that slave labour is deployed to pick cotton in the region. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has repeatedly denied such claims.Among the key items Brussels had been seeking from China was the ratification of International Labour Organization fundamental conventions, including the ability for Chinese workers to form independent labour unions.Communist CollapseChina has only one official trade union that covers all industries. Beijing has long been spooked by the prospect of organized labour and how it could evolve into a political force, much like the Polish labour union Solidarity did, eventually triggering the collapse of the Communist Party across the eastern bloc. At least one analyst at a Chinese think tank has described the EU’s demand on labour unions as “unlikely or impossible” for China to accept.“We believe as long as both can accommodate the other side’s concerns and meet each other half way, we will be able to achieve the targets set by our leaders,” the Foreign Ministry’s Wang Wenbin said on Monday, describing the talks as “in the final stage.”Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet, said he thinks it’s possible that a deal can be concluded soon but warned that any demands such as those on labour show a lack of understanding of China’s situation. “We have to be realistic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-camp-adds-pressure-on-eu-to-hit-brakes-on-china-deal/story-nm8oBpkj13CP3FJltvorLP.html
22-12-2020||World||Russia hits more EU officials with entry bans over the Union’s stance on Alexei Navalny’s poisoning||Moscow is expanding the list of European officials barred from entering Russia in response to the European Union’s (EU) sanctions over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Russia’s Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday.The move comes a day after Navalny, a longtime adversary of President Vladimir Putin, released a recording of a phone call he said he made to an alleged state security operative — who was identified by media as a member of a team that has reportedly trailed the politician for years. In the recording, the man indicated his involvement in covering up the supposed poisoning and revealed some details of the alleged operation.Last month, the EU imposed sanctions on six Russian officials and a state research institute over what German authorities said was a poisoning in Russia with a nerve agent.In a statement Tuesday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry called the sanctions “a confrontational political decision” and announced that it was expanding “the list of representatives of EU member states and institutions who will be denied entry to the Russian Federation.”The Ministry didn’t reveal either the names of the EU officials or the exact number who would be barred from Russia. But it did say that the list includes “those who are responsible for promoting anti-Russian sanctions initiatives” in the 27-member bloc.Navalny fell sick during the Aug. 20 flight in Russia and was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.Diplomatic missions of the three countries, as well as the Delegation of the EU to Russia, have been notified of the measures taken in response to the EU sanctions, the Ministry said.According to the German Foreign Ministry, the German chargée d’affaires in Moscow was told that Russia has issued entry bans against “German government agencies” but no further details were given.The ministry said that the pattern of Russian retaliatory measures is familiar, but it still considers them “unjustified.” It reiterated the German position that the Navalny case is not a bilateral matter, but has a wider international import due to the use of a chemical agent. It renewed calls for Russia to clear up what happened, and said that Moscow so far has shown no readiness to do so.Last week, a joint investigation by the research group Bellingcat and several media outlets alleged that operatives from Russia’s FSB domestic security agency followed Navalny during his trips since 2017. The investigation said the operatives “specialized training in chemical weapons, chemistry and medicine,” and some of them were “in the vicinity” of Navalny in the timeframe “during which he was poisoned.”Navalny, who is currently convalescing in Germany, said the report proved beyond doubt that FSB operatives tried to kill him on Putin’s orders. The video of his phone call to one of the alleged operatives, dismissed by the FSB as a fake, received nearly 13 million views on YouTube 22 hours after it was posted.Russian authorities have repeatedly denied any involvement. Putin charged last week that the investigation relied on data provided by US spy agencies and rejected the allegations.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said that “neither the Kremlin, nor anyone can speak definitively about some kind of poisoning,” because Russia hasn’t received any “information” to that effect from the three countries or the OPCW.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-hits-more-eu-officials-with-entry-bans-over-the-union-s-stance-on-alexei-navalny-s-poisoning/story-Jr8JshhPVo6y8Z5kzhJ0BN.html

Most issues are preliminarily closed or close to being agreed. However, differences on fisheries remain difficult to bridge,” said one EU diplomat. “Unfortunately, the EU is not moving enough yet to clinch a deal on fisheries.”The diplomat, who spoke under condition of anonymity, said EU negotiators were “in a last push” to seal an agreement but added: “The EU will not close its door to the UK and remains ready to negotiate beyond the 1st of January.”Another diplomat said after Barnier’s comments behind closed doors: “The negotiations are ongoing, the main problem remains fisheries. Neither side seems to want to stop the negotiation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-eu-ready-to-continue-talks-with-britain-past-year-end-says-officials/story-HecIUqGDRJTdEjldbosuNO.html
22-12-2020||World||EU vows ‘final push’ in UK trade talks as rifts over fishing narrow||The European Union is giving a “final push” in a bid to strike a Brexit trade deal with Britain, the bloc’s chief negotiator said on Tuesday.Britain is set to complete its departure from the EU when it leaves the bloc’s single market and customs union on Dec. 31, meaning its current free trade arrangements expire. The two sides have for months been struggling to seal a new framework for their relations, going beyond trade to transport to energy. But the much-postponed final stages now coincide with a cross-Channel crisis as EU and other countries suspend most travel to and from Britain to try to curb a much more contagious variant of the coronavirus.“We are really in a crucial moment. We are giving it a final push,” said the negotiator, Michel Barnier as he arrived to update the bloc’s 27 national envoys on Brexit.Barnier told the closed-door gathering that fisheries remained a stumbling block and that the UK’s latest offer on sharing out the catch from 2021 was “totally unacceptable”, according to an EU diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.“Barnier is walking a tightrope between London and Paris,” said another EU diplomat, a reference to the small but politically prominent fishing community in northern France that would be affected by any reduction of EU catch.EU officials and diplomats said the EU could be willing to cutting the value of its fish catch in British waters by around 25% from 2021.But the sources said that was only one piece of the puzzle. The length of the transition on fishing rights beyond Dec. 31, as well as how the EU could retaliate if London cut its vessels out of British waters afterwards, were equally important.Earlier in the day, EU diplomats and officials said an agreement was getting closer but also warned it might not come together in time to come into force on Jan. 1.TRADE RETALIATIONThe UK’s offer to gradually curb EU access over three years was also deemed too short for the bloc, which wants a longer-term business perspective for its fishing industry. London has said the bloc’s proposal of six years is too long.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who campaigned for Brexit in a 2016 referendum, arguing that it would restore Britain’s sovereignty, has repeatedly said it must control its waters and who fishes there. London has hence seen the EU’s effort to enshrine trade retaliation in their agreement in the event of losing access to UK waters as excessive, a disagreement that has also played out prominently in another area of trade talks related to ensuring corporate fair play on production standards and state aid.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Johnson spoke on Brexit, as well as the coronavirus, in a phone call on Monday, according to EU sources. More calls would come as needed, they said.Britain, the world’s sixth biggest economy, left the EU, a trade bloc of 450 million consumers, last January. Around $900 million in annual trade is at risk if they fail to craft a new accord by the end of this year. A senior British minister on Tuesday ruled out prolonging Britain’s transition out of the EU beyond Dec. 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-vows-final-push-in-uk-trade-talks-as-rifts-over-fishing-narrow/story-sEvZXAbijSzCxc8IdVjrtI.html

Gautam Raghavan, who was born in India, will be the deputy director of the office of presidential personnel, and Vinay Reddy will be director of speechwriting.Raghavan, an Obama White House alumnus and former chief of staff to Representative Pramila Jayapal, will be heading a powerful department that is entrusted with selecting political appointees to federal positions. Every incoming administration has to fill roughly 4,000 such posts.Reddy, who has worked with Biden since he was vice-president and was on his campaign staff, will be head of the team of speechwriters, a very senior position that reflects the president-elect’s close personal equation with him.Biden announced four more appointments on Tuesday. Anne Filipic, another Obama alumnus, will be director of the office of administration and management that runs the executive wing; Ryan Montoya, a veteran of Clinton and Obama administrations, will be director of scheduling and advance; Bruce Reed, a long-time Biden associate, will be deputy chief of staff; and Elizabeth Wilkins will be senior adviser to the chief of staff.“These experienced individuals are joining my administration to carry out policies that will put our nation on a path to building back better than ever before,” Biden said while announcing the new appointments. “They are respected leaders whose values and priorities align with my own and who will dutifully execute their roles to serve the American people.”The president-elect Biden had on Monday named Indian-American Bharat Ramamurti, a long-time congressional aide to Senator Elizabeth Warren, as deputy director of the National Economic Council, the key department that advises the American president on domestic and global economic policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-names-two-more-indian-americans-to-top-positions/story-IUKkGMOwzOKvHOuWUBzEFK.html
22-12-2020||World||‘Assume it’s already in US’: Dr Fauci calls UK travel ban ‘dramatic step’ to contain new Covid variant||Top infectious disease expert of the United States, Dr Anthony Fauci, on Tuesday said that it’s “certainly possible” that the new variant of coronavirus found in Britain has already reached the US as dozens of countries announced travel bans from the United Kingdom.During an interview on ABC’s Good Morning America, Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, called travel ban a “dramatic step”, but indicated that there could be a requirement to test travellers before they arrive in the country.“When you have this amount of spread within a place like the UK, that you really need to assume that it’s here already, and certainly is not the dominant strain, but I would not be surprised at all if it is already here,” he said.Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that the new variant has not been identified in the United States through sequencing efforts. However, the CDC, in a scientific brief posted on its website, highlighted that viruses have only been sequenced from about 51,000 out of the 18 million Covid-19 cases recorded in the country so far. It further added that the variant could already be in the US without having been detected, given the small fractions of infections that have been sequenced.“Ongoing travel between the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the high prevalence of this variant among current UK infections, increase the likelihood of importation,” said the public health institute.Also Read | Over 40 countries ban travel from UK to contain new Covid-19 variant. Here’s the listThe United States has recorded over 18 million Covid-19 cases and more than 319,000 related deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Research Center. The CDC said that the scientists are working to learn more about this variant to better understand its impact on the transmission rate and vaccine efficacy.Earlier, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had said that the new variant of the coronavirus is 70% more transmissible than existing strains, prompting several countries to ban travel from Britain. India has also suspended all flights from the UK, from December 22 to December 31, to contain the spread of new Covid-19 variant, which is believed to have originated in southeast England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/assume-it-s-already-in-us-dr-fauci-calls-uk-travel-ban-dramatic-step-to-contain-new-covid-variant/story-u7UQmv20Ttgpy8hZjAmqqI.html

The announcement was posted by the department on Twitter on Monday.Accordign to Al Rawahi, Oman’s health ministry has formulated a vaccination strategy to cover 60 per cent of the population. He also said that the vaccination programme will be divided into phases, and the first one will start with 20 per cent “due to the limited supply at the current period”.High-risk groups of people, including frontline medical workers, as well as individuals suffering from chronic diseases and elderly persons are set to be inoculated during the first stage.The vaccine will be administered in two doses, with the second one being given after a 21-day period.After the United Kingdom warned that a new variant of the virus seemed to be spreading much faster than previous kinds, India, Pakistan, Russia, Jordan and Hong Kong joined European countries in suspending travel from Britain, and Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman closed their borders completely.Oman’s one-week closure of all official ports of entry began on Tuesday “to protect community members from the severity of infection and the speed of spread”.The sultanate’s decision to impose an international travel ban followed an announcement by its neighbour Saudi Arabia late on Sunday that it would shut its borders for a week or until clearer details emerged about the more contagious variant of the virus that has hit the UK.Last week, Saudi Arabia became the first Arab country to start a nationwide vaccination campaign with the Pfizer/BioNtech shot.Oman has struggled to contain a major outbreak that has infected over 1,27,900 people, although cases have declined in recent months.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oman-to-receive-first-batch-of-covid-19-vaccine-on-wednesday/story-5jjHaBC1iRR2I9bnaDYBrJ.html

In a televised address to the nation, PM Oli later defended his decision, insisting that he was “forced to seek a fresh mandate through elections as attempts were made against my government, not to allow it to function properly.”“The dissolution of parliament and fresh elections were not my choice,” PM Oli said in his first comments after the decision. The attempt to induct PM Oli’s loyalists in key party panels such as the central committee started soon after.The two factions of the communist party - one headed by PM Oli and the other by rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal - held meetings of their factions. Dahal’s faction has the majority support in most party panels including the 446-member central committee that met on Tuesday.At the end of the central committee meeting, the Dahal faction announced the decision to replace KP Sharma Oli with Madhav Kumar Nepal as chairman of the Nepal Communist Party. “A total of 315 Central Committee Members have voted in favour of Madhav Nepal,” the spokesperson said, declaring that PM Oli will also have to face disciplinary action.Just a few hours before this meeting, PM Oli had also presided over a party meet that he had called. This one announced a 1,199 member committee to organise the party’s general convention to strengthen his hold, adding The newly-formed committee by the Oli faction adds 556 members to the existing 446-member Central Committee of the ruling party to give the prime minister majority control.But the Kathmandu Post, however, quoted experts who insisted that PM Oli’s move to induct 556 members may not be successful.The election commission can only recognise the expansion of the central committee if it has been expanded by a majority vote of the existing central committee or on the basis of the statute of the party that authorises Oli, as a chair of the party, to nominate new members in its Central Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-oli-seeks-control-of-communist-party-rivals-sack-him-as-party-boss/story-VlbsPomIyTzJkI7Gu9zhkK.html

Subsequent deliveries of 250,000 doses a month and expected approval of other vaccines under regulatory review held out hope that all who wanted a free jab could get one by mid-2021, health agency officials have said.Covid-19 cases in Switzerland and neighbouring Liechtenstein have surpassed 400,000 and the death toll has topped 6,000, prompting the government last week to close restaurants for a month and urge people to stay home.Switzerland has a contract with Pfizer and BioNTech to get 3 million doses of the vaccine, enough to give 1.5 million two jabs three weeks apart. It has ordered 15 million vaccine doses in all including deals with Moderna and AstraZeneca .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-starts-rolling-out-covid-19-vaccine-elderly-to-get-initial-jabs/story-bwVjPXaMHF5rfMMJFCYIxO.html
22-12-2020||World||In Greece, wastewater analysis gives clues to Covid-19 viral load||Shortly before a surge in infections prompted Greece to impose a second coronavirus lockdown in early November, chemists at a wastewater treatment plant had already concluded that tougher restrictions would likely be necessary.Their clue? Samples of sewage from the capital Athens. Daily collections of wastewater are analysed at the University of Athens to determine the level of viral load and the expected Covid-19 infections in the community.Greece fared better than most EU countries during the first wave of the pandemic, but has seen a rapid rise in infections since October, forcing it to impose a second nationwide lockdown in early November.To the analytical chemists looking at the wastewater samples before that decision, a second lockdown had started to look very likely.“Before this announcement the total viral load in the wastewater was really, really high,” says analytical chemist Ekaterini Galani, a PhD candidate at the University.“Some weeks after the lockdown we observed a really important decrease of the viral load of SARS-COV-2 in wastewater samples, reflecting that the restrictions were really important for the population.”Chemists doing the analysis say that wastewater-based epidemiology is a non-invasive tool to monitor the pandemic by calculating the real number of infections, both of symptomatic and asymptomatic people.“The epidemiological information obtained from this analysis is used by the respective authorities to adapt measures at the right time and control the ongoing pandemic,” says Galani.The wastewater treatment plant in Athens is designed to serve more than four million people and is one of the largest in Europe.Since its first Covid-19 case was detected in February, Greece has seen a total of 129,584 confirmed infections and 4,044 related deaths.While vaccinations are likely to start in late December and point to light at the end of the tunnel, caution should prevail, said Nikolaos Thomaidis, analytical chemistry professor at the University of Athens.“I think there will be a third wave again in January, but I think that the curve will be less severe and acute and that it will flatten in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-greece-wastewater-analysis-gives-clues-to-covid-19-viral-load/story-HealdT8X86somI5zSZIWZJ.html
22-12-2020||World||Israel set for snap election as budget deadline nears||Israel on Tuesday was on the brink of a fourth national election in two years after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main governing partner, Benny Gantz, failed to resolve a dispute over the budget.Parliament voted late on Monday against an attempt by both men to delay a deadline of midnight on Tuesday for approval of the fiscal package.Under the law, failure to pass it by then would mean Israel going to the polls in March, and neither parliament nor the cabinet has passed it yet, a process near impossible to complete in a single day.Barring a last-minute surprise, an election would plunge Netanyahu into a battle for survival as public anger has mounted over his handling of the coronavirus crisis and criminal corruption charges that he faces at court.Though polls show Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party emerging as the largest faction in parliament, surveys also predict a strong showing for parties across the political spectrum seeking to unseat him.Netanyahu and defence minister Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White faction, established a unity government in May after three inconclusive elections held since April 2019.But unlike those campaigns, Netanyahu now faces political challengers from Israel’s right-wing in a ballot that will be held in the shadow of the pandemic which has hit Israel’s economy hard.Likud and Blue and White’s coalition deal involved Gantz taking over from Netanyahu as prime minister in November 2021, and passing a bi-annual budget for 2020 and 2021, a de-facto insurance for the power-sharing deal.But even as that accord was being inked, many analysts argued that Netanyahu would not relinquish his powerful post, and Likud has since demanded to pass the budgets separately while Blue and White insisted Netanyahu stick to their deal.Analysts said Netanyahu had been pushing for an election in May or June next year, after the coronavirus crisis was expected to ease and the economy to begin to recover, hoping to win a parliamentary majority that would grant him immunity and put off his trial. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.But a March vote appears far riskier for Israel’s longest-serving leader.“It’s a whole new ball-game,” said Reuven Hazan, professor at the Hebrew University’s political science department. “Netanyahu is far more vulnerable now,” said Hazan. “The chances of him not being prime minister are higher than they were.”Netanyahu has denied pushing for an early election and has blamed the political turmoil on Gantz’s Blue and White. The deadlock has plunged Israel into more economic uncertainty at the end of a year when a pandemic-induced slump is expected to shrink gross domestic product by 4.5% with the jobless rate standing at 12.1%.In an upcoming election, Netanyahu would likely play up the country’s vaccination drive which began this week, as well as his diplomatic credentials following a string of diplomatic deals with Gulf states, Sudan and Morocco, that were brokered by the United States, Hazan said.Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with President Donald Trump, who made a number of pro-Israel moves during the previous elections. But with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden set to take office in January, Netanyahu will lose a major campaign asset, Hazan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-set-for-snap-election-as-budget-deadline-nears/story-4s43MS7AT653sdj55OU5tK.html
22-12-2020||World||Black service members more often investigated, punished: US Air Force report||Black service members in the Air Force are far more likely to be investigated, arrested, face disciplinary actions and be discharged for misconduct, according to a new report that looked at racial disparities across the service.The report by the Air Force inspector general, released Monday, said Black members of the Air Force and Space Force are less likely to be promoted to higher enlisted and officer ranks, and one-third of them believe they don’t get the same opportunities as their white peers. And it concluded that “racial disparity exists” for Black service members, but that the data did not explain why it happens.The report comes as the Pentagon struggles with a broader effort to expand diversity within the ranks. The Defense Department last week endorsed a new slate of initiatives to more aggressively recruit, retain and promote a more racially and ethnically diverse force. And it called for a plan to crack down on participation in hate groups by service members and draft proposed changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.The Air Force IG report outlined data for racial inequities that have long been suspected. It said that a large number of Black service members reported experiences with bias and racism. And while those reports were difficult to validate within the study, the review concluded that it was “reasonable to conclude that individual acts of racism have occurred in the Department of the Air Force.”One Black squadron commander who was interviewed, for example, said the only mentoring he received throughout his career was from other Black leaders. And he said at times Black service members make one mistake, and it ends their career.“You might get left behind if you don’t have someone that looks like you helping to propel you,” he said. “Black service members need to work twice as hard and you can’t mess up.”Discrimination beliefs cut across the ranks. As many as half of the Black survey respondents said they had been discriminated against because of their race. And 45 percent of Black general officers — they include one-star to four-star generals — said they had experienced discrimination. In contrast, 94% of the white general officers said they didn’t face discrimination based on their race.Senior Air Force and Space Force leaders asked for updates within 60 days on how to address a number of the issues, including the disparity in discipline and the fact that 60% of the Black service members surveyed said they don’t get the same benefit of the doubt as their white peers if they get into trouble.Gen. Charles Brown Jr., chief of staff of the Air Force, said service leaders must rebuild trust with their force.“Racial disparity isn’t an easy topic and something we don’t traditionally talk about much throughout our levels of command,” said Brown, the first Black man to lead the Air Force. “Now we must all move forward with meaningful, lasting, and sustainable change.”Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett added that leaders will take appropriate actions to remove barriers and expand mentorship and other programs to encourage diversity.The IG review examined the military justice process data going back to 2012, looked at promotion rates and other opportunities given to service members, conducted interviews, and received more than 123,000 responses to a survey. Officials said it focused solely on Black service members to get the review done quickly, but subsequent changes would be applied more broadly to other minority groups.Specifically, the review found that enlisted Black service members were 57% more likely than whites to face courts-martial and 72% more likely to get nonjudicial punishment as a result of an investigation. Black troops were twice as likely to be apprehended by security and young Black enlisted members were twice as likely to be involuntarily discharged for misconduct. Black troops also are investigated and found guilty of sexual harassment more often.The report noted, however, that recruits who join the force with a moral waiver — whether they are Black or white — are more likely to face discipline problems. Recruits with previous criminal convictions such as assault, drunk driving or marijuana use require a moral waiver to enlist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-service-members-more-often-investigated-punished-us-air-force-report/story-plH2RHZ9MyTlVi39qvkqqI.html
22-12-2020||World||Pakistan opposition alliance releases schedule for second round of anti-government protests||Pakistan’s Opposition alliance has announced the schedule of its second wave of protests to oust the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government, starting with a public meeting in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s central city, Mardan, on Wednesday. The steering committee of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) -- an 11-party Opposition alliance -- met on Monday to decide the future course of the ‘struggle’ against the government, The News quoted PDM spokesman Mian Iftikhar Hussain in a report on Tuesday. The second phase of the movement will start with a public meeting in Mardan in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa on December 23. It would be followed by another public meeting in Larkana in Sindh on December 27 on the eve of the death anniversary of Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The PDM steering committee has decided to expand public meetings in smaller cities as well. The protests will be held in Bahawalpur on December 30, Malakand January 3, Bannu January 6, Khazdar January 9, Loralai January 13, Tharparkar January 16, Faisalabad January 18, Sargodha January 23 and Sialkot on January 27. The paper also reported that the PDM is still in a quandary on whether to leave the field of Senate elections open for the ruling the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) does not want to leave the field open for the ruling PTI and its allies to get maximum seats in the Upper House of the Parliament in the upcoming polls. It is expected that the issue of Senate elections will come under discussion in the next meeting of the PDM’s leadership, which is scheduled to be held after December 27 or in early January. Besides discussing the PDM strategy for Senate elections, the PDM, in its meeting, will also decide to take part in the bye-elections which are being held in Sindh on three seats as the PPP is in favour of participating in it as has been already written to the Chief Election Commissioner for holding bye-elections. According to a notification issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the bye-elections in Sindh and Balochistan will be held on February 16, while in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on February 19. The Opposition alliance had earlier announced that their lawmakers will resign en masse by the end of this month from Parliament to paralyse the government and force Prime Minister Khan to call snap polls. Though the PPP is following the PDM’s decision on resignation, it wants the move to be well calculated instead of one made in haste, the report said. According to PPP insiders, the party will discuss all the options in the meeting of its Central Executive Committee, which is expected to be held within this week. The PPP has also a chance of becoming the second largest party in the Senate, the paper added. The PDM has been formed against the Pakistan Army’s interference in politics and installing “puppet” Prime Minister Khan through a manipulated election.

Nepal President Bidhya Devi Bhandari ratified the proposal of Prime Minister Oli for the dissolution of Parliament and announced dates for an election.In a live broadcast on state-owned Nepal Television, Oli asked everyone to be prepared for the elections on April 30 and May 10 next year.The decision to dissolve the Lower House, an unprecedented move, had enraged the public as well as his party insiders. A total of 12 writ petitions have been filed at the Supreme Court against Oli’s move, which has widely been claimed to be unconstitutional.Oli-led Nepal Communist Party weighed heavily in both the lower and upper houses with a huge majority secured during the 2017 general election. Protesting the latest move of Oli, a majority of ministers in his cabinet resigned en-masse on Sunday.Hundreds of people took to the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday afternoon denouncing the latest move of Prime Minister Oli and an early election as a constitutional coup.Protestors chanted slogans against KP Sharma Oli and President Bidhya Devi Bhandari for proposing and ratifying the proposal to dissolve parliament and call a fresh election for next year. They termed the move as “a Constitutional Coup” and demanded both the state and executive head of the nation not to go ahead.Oli, who has been losing support within his own party, has been long criticised for making unilateral decisions while making key appointments and decisions. He has also been widely criticised for mishandling the pandemic and saving ministers accused of corruption.The Himalayan nation nestled between India and China has seen 26 prime ministers in about three decades. The nation was expected to get out of the tumultuous situation after the election of 2017 where Oli’s party secured a majority of nearly two-thirds of votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madhav-kumar-nepal-replaces-pm-oli-as-nepal-communist-party-chairman/story-hDjIgzzGXUHPrqpGcVOhGJ.html
22-12-2020||World||Putin signs law letting ex-presidents become senators for life||President Vladimir Putin signed legislation on Tuesday that allows former presidents to become lawmakers for life in Russia’s upper house of parliament once they leave the Kremlin, a government website showed. The legislation follows sweeping changes to the Russian political system initiated by Putin this year that, among other things, allow him to run for two more six-year terms in the Kremlin if he chooses. He had been due to step down in 2024. The reforms are being closely parsed for clues as to what Putin may do at the end of his current presidential term, his second consecutive and fourth overall. Tuesday’s legislation would allow presidents to name up to 30 senators to the Federation Council, Russia’s upper house, and also to become a senator themselves once they have left office. Other legislation that is yet to be signed into law, but has already been backed by the lower house of parliament, would grant ex-presidents immunity from prosecution for any offences committed in their lifetimes, not merely while in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-signs-law-letting-ex-presidents-become-senators-for-life/story-YO1nnQNBZ4IWPqLyzAAnUI.html

The US-China relationship has become increasingly fraught as the two countries battle over issues from human rights to the coronavirus and trade.Previous visa restrictions and financial sanctions applied to officials “involved in the horrific abuses taking place in Xinjiang, restrictions on access to Tibet, and the destruction of Hong Kong’s promised autonomy,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in Monday’s statement.“Today’s action creates additional restrictions applicable to all (Communist Party) officials engaged in such repressive activities, no matter their location,” he said.Wang criticized the US for having “weaponized“ visa policy.“The issues of Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong concerning Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity are purely internal affairs of China, and no foreign forces should interfere,” he said.Earlier in December, the US announced plans to limits visas for members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families to one month, instead of 10 years. The State Department also said it would deny visas to Chinese citizens linked to overseas influence operations involving violence and other means of intimidation.The US side has also put economic restrictions on Chinese companies. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the US market and the US has lobbied other countries to follow suit, with mixed results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-accuses-us-of-weaponizing-visa-policy-imposes-new-visa-limits/story-NP1Z2Ne5OdFbtBBqfLpVqN.html
22-12-2020||World||‘There could be some modest hit in vaccine efficacy’: Expert on new Covid-19 strain||The new variant of SARS-CoV-2, which is said to have originated in southeast England, has raised concerns over the effectiveness of the vaccines developed to provide immunity against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). According to a CNN report, Pfizer Inc. has started working on generating data to analyse how well blood samples from people inoculated with its vaccine, BNT162b2, against Covid-19 “may be able to neutralize the new strain from the UK.”What are the chances Covid-19 vaccines won’t work against new virus strain?Earlier on Monday, US President Donald Trump’s Covid-19 vaccine czar said the chances that one set of mutations would completely alter the structures against which the vaccines induce an immune response is “extremely low.” During a press briefing, Dr Moncef Slaoui, chief science advisor to Trump’s vaccine program Operation Warp Speed, told reporters that he expects Pfizer’s and Moderna’s Covid-19 shots will be effective against the new variant of coronavirus found in Britain.Meanwhile, Moderna said the biotech firm expects that the vaccine-induced immunity against Covid-19 would be protective against the variants found in the UK. It further added that the company will be performing additional tests in the coming weeks to “confirm this expectation.” The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised only the two Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna.Some researchers who are analysing the genome of the new variant have suggested that there may be “modest reductions” in vaccine efficacy due to “antigenic drift.” Trevor Bedford, an associate professor in the vaccine and infectious disease division of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, told CNN that there could be “some modest hit in vaccine efficacy, which wouldn’t be good, but I don’t think it would break the vaccine.”In a series of tweets, Bedford had said that the vaccine developers will likely need a process in the coming years to update the spike variant used in the vaccine to best match circulating viruses. He also suggested connecting immunisation records to genomic surveillance to identify variants involved in breakthrough infections. Going forward, I suggest:1. Emerging variants should be assayed against sera from recovered and vaccinated individuals to test for antigenic effects2. Immunization records should be connected to genomic surveillance to identify variants involved in breakthrough infections18/18Dr VK Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog, on Tuesday said the new virus strain has no impact, as of now, on the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines developed in India and around the world. India has suspended all flights to and from the UK, starting 11.59pm on December 22 till 11.59 pm on December 31 after several countries announced a ban on inbound travel from the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/there-could-be-some-modest-hit-in-vaccine-efficacy-expert-on-new-covid-19-strain/story-iJS64sqyt7fd28CIuTOKAM.html
22-12-2020||World||BioNTech to boost vaccine capacity, sees shot beating new strain||Pfizer Inc. partner BioNTech SE is pursuing all its options to make more Covid-19 vaccine doses than the 1.3 billion the companies have promised to produce next year, according to the German firm’s chief executive officer.The companies will probably know by January or February whether and how many additional doses can be produced, Ugur Sahin said late Monday in an interview. “I am confident that we will be able to increase our network capacity, but we don’t have numbers yet.”Sahin also said the vaccine will probably work against the new SARS-CoV-2 strain that has emerged in the UK Lab tests of the vaccine’s performance have already been done against 20 mutant versions; the same tests will now be run against the new UK version, and should take about two weeks, he said.Efficacy results of more than 90% and approvals around the world have set off a race between countries for additional supplies of the precious shots, with the US seeking to exercise an option for a hundred million. Most of the doses anticipated for next year -- enough to immunize 650 million people -- have already been spoken for.More than 2 million people in six countries have already gotten their first shot of the standard two-dose regimen, according to data collected by Bloomberg.BioNTech is seeking more of the raw materials it needs for its mRNA vaccine, more clean rooms and more cooperation partners, Sahin said. The company also needs additional space to formulate the shots, put them into containers and prepare them for shipping, he said. Pfizer is producing vaccine at three sites in the US and one in Europe, while BioNTech has two manufacturing sites in Germany.The vaccine’s EU approval and an inoculation campaign set to start there on Dec. 27 promise to further draw on stocks. By the end of 2020, BioNTech expects to ship 12.5 million doses to the EU and 20 million to the US, the company said in a press conference on Tuesday. The partners have already begun shipping shots to the UK, where Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Monday tweeted that some 500,000 people had gotten their first dose.New Strain TestsIf the vaccine turns out to be ineffective against the mutant strain circulating in the UK, BioNTech could, in theory, produce a new Covid vaccine to fight the variant within six weeks, Sahin said at the Tuesday briefing. How fast the new inoculation could get to patients would depend on the speed of regulatory review.But so far, Sahin sees no reason to doubt that the existing shot will be effective. Most vaccines target the spike protein, which allows the virus to enter cells.“This virus has multiple mutations, but as far as we know, 99% of the spike protein is not mutated,” he said late Monday. “Let’s do the experiment and get the result. That’s always the best answer, but I would emphasize just to stay calm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biontech-to-boost-vaccine-capacity-sees-shot-beating-new-strain/story-7ejma06o7KsvAbhwQ7jp0M.html
22-12-2020||World||UK turns to cargo jets, freight trains after new coronavirus strain prompts France to bars trucks||UK firms desperate to maintain supply lines after France blocked truck traffic are looking at switching to cargo jets and freight trains to keep goods flowing.J Sainsbury Plc and Tesco Plc are exploring all options to keep supplies flowing, including the use of planes for some fresh-vegetable shipments instead of truck ferries, while Deutsche Lufthansa AG may add dedicated freighter flights to the UK Eurotunnel, which operates the Channel Tunnel rail link between Britain and France, said talks are underway about running extra freight trains.“There’s been a great deal of discussion with a number of companies contacting us, both existing customers and potential new ones,” Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said. “We’d already seen an increase in demand because of the Brexit deadline but there’s plenty of spare capacity.”Trucks bound for the continent are lined up on the M20 motorway outside Dover, Britain’s busiest ferry port, after a new coronavirus strain prompted France on Sunday to bar drivers from crossing the Channel. The ban, which also applies to Eurotunnel’s truck shuttles, threatens to disrupt just-in-time supply chains and to create shortages of some foods and perishable goods.Sainsbury said it’s exploring alternatives to trucks to keep its stores stocked with lettuce, cauliflowers, broccoli and citrus fruits from the Continent. Air-freight is an option, though the grocer hopes that France and Britain will reach an agreement to reopen links, spokeswoman Victoria Durman said.Tesco, Britain’s biggest supermarket, has “plenty of food for Christmas,” said Shona Buchanan, a spokeswoman. But if the disruption continues beyond the next two days, “there may be reduced supply on a few items later this week.”Grocers cannot stockpile perishable fresh produce, meaning regular replenishment of supplies is essential. Alternative supply routes being considered alongside air freight include the use of ferries sent directly from Spain and increasing stock from Holland and the UKDedicated FreightersLufthansa will continue to fly passengers to Britain unless there’s a ban on doing so, according to spokesman Helmut Tolksdorf. The aircraft will return to Germany empty, though, after it and others closed their borders to arrivals from the UK Operating a dedicated cargo service would help plug the gap should inbound flights to London, Manchester and Edinburgh also have to cease. Lufthansa Cargo operates planes including Boeing Co. 777Fs capable of carrying 100 metric tons.Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. said cargo-only flights between Britain and Europe that use belly-space in Airbus SE A350 passenger jets currently surplus to requirements sold out this morning. The carrier is looking to add as many services as possible for Tuesday, spokeswoman Laura Brander said.Chunnel TrainsEurotunnel currently operates four or five dedicated freight trains a day, carrying bulk products including car parts, steel, aluminum and liquids. That compares with six shuttle trains an hour during normal times carrying trucks through the sub-sea rail route. Before the service was halted, traffic on those trains had increased 11% from a year earlier as companies rushed to stock up ahead of the December 31 no-deal deadline.Spokesman Keefe said freight services have seen a pickup in chilled foods sent to Britain from more distant parts of Europe as a result of earlier concerns about delays at Dover.Running more trains through the tunnel would be a simple matter, he said, though securing pathways across Europe can take a few weeks in normal times. Channel Tunnel cargo services are operated by GB Railfreight and Deutsche Bahn AG’s DB Cargo.Other options for offsetting the loss of truck traffic might including sending more goods in containers, usually the reserve of long-distance shipments from Asia. Felixstowe, Britain’s biggest container port, has been suffering delays and snarlups of its own amid a surge in volumes from restocking before Christmas and the Brexit deadline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-turns-to-cargo-jets-freight-trains-after-new-coronavirus-strain-prompts-france-to-bars-trucks/story-BtBam69cjWcVZY3D1WelYN.html

We greatly appreciate your commitment to a strong U.S.-India partnership,” the US Ambassador wrote in a tweet.He added, “Similar awards were given to PM (Shinzo) Abe and PM (Scott)Morrison, recognizing our leaders’ shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.”United States President Donald Trump has presented Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the prestigious Legion of Merit, a top US honour, for his leadership in elevating India and US strategic partnership, National Security Advisor Robert C. O’ Brien informed.Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu accepted the medal on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Legion of Merit Medal was established by Congress on July 20, 1942.It is awarded to members of the US military and foreign military members and political figures who have displayed exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services and achievements. It is one of the highest military medals that can be awarded to foreign officers.The Legion of Merit Medal is a five-rayed white cross, edged with red, resting on a green wreath with a blue centre containing 13 white stars.The Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander, is a rarely-awarded, prestigious decoration that can only be bestowed by the President, typically to Heads of state or Heads of Government of other countries.The Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander is a domed five-pointed American white star plaque of heraldic form bordered in purplish-red enamel 215/16 inches circumscribing diameter with 13 white stars on a blue field emerging from a circle of clouds; backing the star, a laurel wreath with pierced, crossed arrows pointing outward between each arm of the star and the wreath. The reverse is engraved with the words “United States of America.”The citation with the award states “for exceptionally meritorious service as the Prime Minister of the Republic of India from May 2014 to August 2020. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s steadfast leadership and vision have accelerated India’s emergence as a global power and elevated the strategic partnership between the United States and India to address global challenges.”“Prime Minister Modi’s superior effort, personal leadership, and unwavering commitment to advancing strategic cooperation between the United States and India and promoting global peace and prosperity reflect great credit upon himself, the Indian armed forces, and his country,” the citation read.

22-12-2020||World||40,000 lemons missing: UK port chaos upends Brexit planning||In 2019, Nimisha Raja’s Brexit headache was a 24-tonne mountain of beetroot. This year, it’s a hunt for 40,000 lemons.Raja, chief executive of snack producer Nim’s Fruit Crisps, was trying to stockpile to ensure she could fill orders in January without disruption. Instead, like other companies trying to do the same, her plans were completely upended. Delays because of delivery volumes were then compounded after a mutant strain of Covid-19 prompted France to shut down truck travel across the Channel.The problems highlight the difficulties facing businesses as they try to prepare for Brexit with no idea whether a deal will be reached amid a global pandemic that’s strained supply chains. The ban is threatening fresh-food supplies and just-in-time manufacturing, and led to hundreds of trucks stuck on the motorway into Dover, Britain’s busiest ferry port.“It’s been a nightmare, really,” said Raja, who was forced to cancel her delivery. “If it’s stuck at port for two days, do we still have the right to say I don’t want it because I know half of its going to be rotten?”The snack company, based south east of London, has managed to stay open throughout the virus without furloughing any of its workers. But now Covid and Brexit are combining in a nightmare scenario.As industry groups have warned of looming shortages on Monday, some companies have been looking at alternative delivery arrangements. Supermarket chain J Sainsbury Plc said it’s studying the use of planes for some fresh-vegetable shipments instead of truck ferries.It’s not the first time a Brexit deadline has caused problems for Raja. Worries about disruption around the U.K.’s original March 2019 departure date caused her to stockpile beetroot, leaving the company scrambling to make them into crisps before they could rot.After that experience, the business decided not to stockpile ahead of other deadlines. But with Brexit going down to the wire, Raja succumbed to warnings from suppliers to get ahead of the import issues anticipated in early January.Suppliers have promised replacement lemons from Egypt but after that Raja needs three tonnes of cucumber if she’s to meet orders. She’s now considering whether she can avoid importing anything from the EU in the coming months.“We can’t go on like this,” she said. “We’ve got so much work to do preparing for Brexit. It’s costing us a lot of money and a lot of time, and that’s the worst thing of all for a small business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/40-000-lemons-missing-uk-port-chaos-upends-brexit-planning/story-IKnFuiXIAKMf23CfmLYYfK.html
22-12-2020||World||US Congress stings China with new Tibet law on the next Dalai Lama||The US Congress has passed a bill that reaffirms the right of Tibetans to choose a successor to their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. The law has been described by Dharamshala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile, as a historic move and a clear message to China.The Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 (TPSA), which was passed by the US Senate, calls for the establishment of a US consulate in Tibet’s main city of Lhasa and underlines the absolute right of Tibetans to choose a successor to the Dalai Lama.“The TPSA makes it official United States policy that decisions regarding the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama are exclusively within the authority of the current Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhist leaders and the Tibetan people,” said a statement by the Central Tibetan Administration after the Senate approval. The House of Representatives has already cleared the bill.“Any interference by Chinese government officials will be met with serious sanctions and deemed inadmissible into the United States,” the statement said.Stung by the US move, the Chinese foreign ministry accused the US of meddling in its internal affairs and asked the Donald Trump administration against signing the legislation into law. “We urge the US side to stop meddling in China’s internal affairs and refrain from signing into law these negative clauses and acts, lest it further harms our further cooperation and bilateral relations,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.Lobsang Sangay, president of the Central Tibetan Administration, described the legislation as a victory for the Tibetan freedom struggle. “We have been pushing for this for the last two years,” he said. He said the move by the US Congress was a tribute to the great legacy of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and to the courage and solidarity of six million Tibetans inside Tibet.The Dalai Lama, then 23, had crossed into Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang in April 1959 to escape the Chinese that had invaded Tibet nine years earlier and had brutally suppressed the uprising against Beijing’s rule. The Dalai Lama and the thousands of Tibetans who followed him were settled in the Himalayan town of Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh where he has been living in exile ever since. There are over 80,000 Tibetans living in exile in India; 150,000 more around the world particularly in the US and Europe.China has been attempting to dismantle Tibetan Buddhism since then. It arrested Gedhun Choekyi Nyima in Tibet, just three days after he was proclaimed as the 11th Panchen Lama, the second highest Lama of Tibetan Buddhism, in May 1995. He has never been seen since. Instead, Beijing selected its own six-year old Gyaltsen Norbu as the 11th Panchen Lama six months later and enthroned him at Shigatse monastery.The US law is significant because China has already started the process to identify its version of the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama. China has said its leaders have the right to approve the Dalai Lama’s successor, which many see as a coercive attempt to control Tibet, where ethnic Tibetans make up about 90% of the population, a Reuters report said.This means if the Tibetan people decide to continue with the institution of the Dalai Lama, there could be two Dalai Lamas. Just as there are two Panchen Lamas and two claimants to the title of the 17th Karmapa, the head of wealthy Karma Kagyu school.Sangay said the TPSA sends a loud and clear message to China that Tibet remains a priority for the United States and that it will continue its steadfast support for His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the CTA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-stings-china-with-new-tibet-law-on-the-next-dalai-lama/story-bmWOjVlH6l9VflfTTsm8TI.html
22-12-2020||World||China ‘expels’ US Navy’s frontline destroyer from South China Sea||Beijing on Tuesday said its military has “expelled” a US Navy destroyer sailing near Nansha Islands – also known as Spratly Islands – in the South China Sea in a fresh escalation of tensions between Beijing and Washington.China said the southern theatre command of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) deployed ships and aircraft to warn US destroyer USS John S. McCain as it sailed through the disputed waters of the SCS.The incident took place as Shandong, China’s second aircraft carrier, was said to be conducting drills in the SCS region after sailing through the Taiwan Strait on Sunday.China claims nearly the entire SCS but that claim is disputed by several maritime neighbours including the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia, besides Vietnam and Taiwan, which China says is a breakaway region.“The Chinese PLA on Tuesday expelled US destroyer USS John S. McCain after it trespassed into China’s territorial waters off Nansha Islands in the South China Sea,” said Senior Colonel Tian Junli, a spokesperson for the PLA southern theatre command.China firmly opposes the US warship’s trespassing, said Tian, warning that the US moves undermine the peace and stability of the region.“Such actions by the US have seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security and severely undermined peace and stability in the SCS,” Tian added.The US guided-missile destroyer had last week practised anti-submarine warfare with a French submarine and Japanese carrier in the Philippine Sea.A statement from the US 7th Fleet Public Affairs said the warship was conducting freedom of navigation operations in the SCS.“On December 22, USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the Spratly Islands, consistent with international law. This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging restrictions on innocent passage imposed by China, Vietnam, and Taiwan,” the statement said.“All interactions with foreign military forces were consistent with international norms and did not impact the operation,” it added.The US statement added that unlawful and sweeping maritime claims in the SCS pose a serious threat to the “…freedom of the seas, including the freedoms of navigation and overflight, free trade and unimpeded commerce, and freedom of economic opportunity for SCS littoral nations”.In April, China had scrambled aircraft and deployed ships to track and expel a frontline US warship from near another Beijing-controlled region called Paracel Islands - also known as Xisha Islands in China and Hoang Sa Archipelago in Vietnam - in the SCS.Accusing the guided-missile destroyer USS Barry of carrying out a “provocative act” and violating Chinese sovereignty, the PLA’s southern command had then said the intrusion of the American warship prompted it to “track, monitor, verify, identify and expel” it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expels-us-navy-s-frontline-destroyer-from-south-china-sea/story-ZNC8ikeIcpD4fYjXZAVJlJ.html
22-12-2020||World||New Covid-19 strain in South Africa: Countries that announced flight suspensions||Countries across the world are implementing ad hoc air travel suspensions from and to other countries where cases of the new Covid-19 strain have been reported. After much of Europe and other countries stopped air travel from the United Kingdom, at least five countries have banned flights from South Africa.South Africa’s health minister had earlier said that scientists have found out that the increase in the number of Covid-19 infections in the country is being driven by the new strain of the virus, according to a news report by Bloomberg.Germany, Turkey, Israel, Switzerland and Saudi Arabia have barred flights from South Africa to reduce the spread of the new mutation of the coronavirus, news agency ANI reported. Measures for passengers who are already travelling to these countries from South Africa have also been announced by the respective departments. Also Watch | ‘No evidence that new COVID strain causes severe disease, mortality’: WHOGermanyGermany was among the first few nations to close air travel with South Africa. “Because of the reported coronavirus mutation, the federal government intends to restrict travel options between Germany and Great Britain and South Africa,” Martina Fietz, a government spokesperson, was quoted as saying by ANI.IsraelIsrael’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the country is closing its air space for many foreign nationals following the spread of the more infectious coronavirus variant. “We’ve got a new pandemic spreading, with a virus we don’t really know about. This mutation could be a coronavirus two. Therefore, we have implemented the decision to close Israel’s skies,” he said, according to AFP.The PM also mentioned that while there would be some exceptions, the decision otherwise would continue for 10 days and could also be extended further, according to the AFP report.TurkeyTurkish health minister Fahrettin Koca announced on Twitter that “With the instruction of our President and with the coordination of our Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, A temporary suspension has been decided for flights from England, Denmark, the Netherlands and South Africa to our country.” The Turkish Airlines too, announced on Twitter that it is suspending flights following the government order.Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has said international flights are being suspended and also the country is closing its land borders to prevent the spread of the virus. It has also suggested measures for international travellers arriving in the country after the ban, according to a report by Reuters.Switzerland Switzerland officials suspect that the new virus strain might already exist in the country and suspended all flights from England and South Africa. Patrick Mathys, assistant head of communicable diseases at the Federal Ministry of Health in Switzerland said that the new mutation of the virus is more infectious, as per a Reuters report. While India is yet to announce any air travel restrictions for flights from South Africa, few other countries including Uzbekistan and the Netherlands have also closed their air spaces for South African flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-strain-in-south-africa-countries-that-announced-flight-suspensions/story-hp6Ce0tkPyr5TrU7PQI0lI.html
22-12-2020||World||UK GDP grew by record 16% in third quarter but still recovering from crash||Britain’s economic recovery from its coronavirus crash was quicker than expected in the third quarter, according to official data, which again showed government borrowing soaring to pay for the coronavirus crisis.Gross domestic product grew by a record 16.0% from July to September, revised up from a previous estimate of 15.5%.But that still did not make up for its 18.8% slump in the second quarter, when much of the economy was shut down.Britain’s economy was hit harder than most others by the pandemic, which has led the deaths of more people than any other country in Europe after Italy.The country’s initial coronavirus lockdown lasted for longer than most others and now London and nearby areas are back under tough restrictions as the government tries to slow the spread of a new variant of the virus that spreads more easily.The economy almost ground to a halt in October, according to previously published figures, and the Bank of England thinks GDP will shrink again in the fourth quarter as worries about the Dec. 31 deadline for a Brexit trade deal with the European Union compound the damage from Covid-19.Tuesday’s data showed the economy was 8.6% below where it was at the end of 2019, less than an initial estimate of 9.7%.It also showed household incomes grew over the summer as many workers returned from temporary layoffs.Consumer spending rose by almost 20% in the third quarter as households ran down some of the savings that piled up in the second quarter, when people were ordered to stay at home and many non-essential retailers and others businesses were closed.The savings ratio fell to 16.9% from a record 27.4% in the second quarter.The Office for National Statistics also said Britain borrowed a record 241 billion pounds ($323 billion) in the first eight months of the financial year, nearly 190 billion pounds more than in the same period a year earlier.The country’s budget forecasters think the deficit will hit almost 400 billion pounds in the 2020/21 year, close to 20% of GDP, or double the hit from the global financial crisis.Public debt stood at almost 2.1 trillion pounds or 99.5% of GDP, the highest ratio since 1962.Finance minister Rishi Sunak reiterated his pledge to tackle the huge shortfall, but not immediately.“When our economy recovers, it’s right that we take the necessary steps to put the public finances on a more sustainable footing so we are able to respond to future crises in the way we have done this year,” he said in a statement.The International Monetary Fund has said Britain will probably need to raise taxes after the pandemic to fill the gap.The ONS also said on Tuesday that Britain’s current account deficit - typically one of the economy’s weak spots - widened to 15.7 billion pounds, or 2.9% of GDP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-gdp-grew-by-record-16-in-third-quarter-but-still-recovering-from-crash/story-oGRBlVpj5jvk2B1OB6fcaM.html
22-12-2020||World||Pakistan uses China’s financial assistance to repay Saudi loan||Pakistan has been paying back a $3-billion loan extended by Saudi Arabia in 2018 using emergency financial assistance from China against the backdrop of strained ties between Islamabad and Riyadh, people familiar with developments said on Tuesday. Islamabad has so far paid $2 billion to Riyadh after Saudi Arabia insisted on the repayment of the loan earlier this year in the wake of bilateral ties being strained over Pakistan’s efforts to forge an alternative front of Muslim nations through an outreach to Turkey and Malaysia. The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that Pakistan plans to repay the remaining $1 billion by early next year. “This is simply a case of putting off a major economic problem for some more time. The Saudis may have been repaid but the other loan will become due some day,” one of the people cited above said. Also Read: Prominent Baloch activist found dead in mysterious circumstances in CanadaEarlier this month, China bailed out Pakistan by enhancing the size of a 2011 bilateral currency swap agreement by 10 billion yuan or about $1.5 billion, The Express Tribune newspaper had reported, citing sources in the finance ministry and the State Bank of Pakistan. This assistance was used to repay the Saudi loan. China increased the currency swap arrangement instead of extending a commercial loan so that the new $1.5-billion loan wouldn’t reflect on the books of the Pakistan government or be treated as part of country’s external public debt. Pakistan has used the currency swap facility since 2011 to repay foreign debt and keep its foreign currency reserves at comfortable levels, the report said. Saudi Arabia has also been upset by Pakistan’s criticism of the kingdom’s handling of the Kashmir issue, especially after the Indian government scrapped the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019. For instance, the Kashmir issue wasn’t on the official agenda of a meeting of foreign ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held in Niger in November. After hectic lobbying by Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the meeting adopted a resolution on Kashmir that experts said was no different from hundreds of similar documents adopted by the OIC over the years that have had no impact. The strain in Pakistan-Saudi Arabia ties is evident from the fact that Riyadh didn’t roll over the period for the $3-billion loan against the backdrop of economic difficulties created by the Covid-19 pandemic. A $3.2-billion oil credit facility extended by Saudi Arabia to Pakistan in 2018 was also suspended after a year. “Saudis, moreover, in the past never insisted on the repayment of loans, but that did not happen this time. The message from Riyadh was clear that it wanted its money back,” the Dawn newspaper reported on Tuesday. “The Saudi attitude, some say, stemmed from its unease over Pakistan’s foreign policy direction, especially its relations with Turkey and Iran,” the report added. The Indian Army chief’s recent visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia has also spurred efforts by Islamabad to repair ties with Riyadh. On Monday, Saudi Arabia’s envoy to Pakistan, Nawaf bin Saeed Al-Maliki, met Prime Minister Imran Khan to discuss bilateral cooperation. “The resolve to further strengthen the strong, longstanding Pakistan-Saudi Arabia fraternal ties was reaffirmed,” Pakistan’s Foreign Office said in a statement. A Saudi Arabian delegation, possibly led by the foreign minister, is expected to visit Pakistan before the end of the year, and this is likely to be followed by a visit to the kingdom by a delegation led by a senior Pakistani minister, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-uses-china-s-financial-assistance-to-repay-saudi-loan/story-NjhagUNJTuqjSpE3sREAkP.html

Milewski has not commented on the matter.“MLI’s report is defamatory, malicious, misleading… feeds into a narrative that is being propagated by the government of India. Contrary to MLI’s allegations, Khalistan Referendum is a gross root initiative led by Sikh sovereigntists,” SFJ’s general counsel Gurpatwant Singh Pannun said in a statement.In an interview with Hindustan Times at the time the report was released, Milewski had said his objective behind bringing out the report at this time was because of the Punjab Referendum 2020, which was originally scheduled for November this year but had been postponed to next year. That referendum is being organized by SFJ.Milewski had pointed out that election results in India have clearly shown that Khalistan has little popular support, and even within the community in Canada, the vast majority will not participate in the process. However, that will ensure the results are skewed totally in favour of those that actually support Khalistan. “The problem is, it’s a referendum of the people that support the referendum,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-think-tank-mli-slams-sikhs-for-justice-for-filing-defamation-case/story-X6ROlsh19kBXZafHmuVitM.html
22-12-2020||World||Prominent Baloch activist found dead in mysterious circumstances in Canada||Prominent Baloch activist Karima Baloch was found dead in unexplained circumstances in the Canadian city of Toronto on Monday, a day after she was reported missing by the local police. Karima Baloch, a former chairperson of the Baloch Students Organization-Azad (BSO-Azad), is the second prominent Baloch campaigner to be found dead in a foreign country this year. In April, the body of Baloch journalist Sajid Hussain Baloch was found outside Uppsala in Sweden, weeks after he went missing. Toronto police had reported that Karima, 37, had gone missing in the city’s waterfront area on December 20. The police later said she was “located” but didn’t offer more details. Also Read: Baloch activists want support from India without ‘Kashmir lens’Karima’s death was reported by both Balochistan Times and The Balochistan Post, leading news websites aimed at the Baloch community. Balochistan Times reported she was “found dead in Toronto” and that her “family has not provided more details and asked for privacy”. “Her sudden and unexplained disappearance and death has raised serious concerns,” The Balochistan Post reported. Other reports said Karima’s husband Hammal Haidar and her brother identified the body. Amnesty International said in a tweet: “The death of activist #KarimaBaloch in Toronto, Canada is deeply shocking and must be immediately and effectively investigated. The perpetrators must be brought to justice without recourse to the death penalty.” Karima was included in BBC’s list of 100 inspirational and influential women for 2016, in which she was described as a campaigner “for independence for Balochistan from Pakistan”. She fled Pakistan in 2016, saying she feared for her life due to threats from the army and intelligence agencies, and sought refuge in Canada. She was seen as a pioneer of women’s activism in Balochistan and had raised the issue of Balochistan in UN sessions in Switzerland. In 2014, she became the first woman chairperson of BSO-Azad, which has been proscribed by the Pakistan government as a terror group. Karima’s asylum request was suspended by the Canadian province of Ottawa in 2016 because of BSO-Azad’s involvement in “subversion” against the Pakistan government but she was allowed to remain in the country, according to Canadian media reports. In 2016, Karima recorded a video message on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, in which she called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “brother” and asked him to become the voice of the Baloch movement. This was days after Modi raised the Balochistan issue in his Independence Day speech. “We appeal to you that, as our brother, you speak about the genocide and war crimes in Balochistan on international forums and become the voice of the sisters of Baloch...We will fight this on our own, we just want you to become the voice of our struggle,” Karima said in the message. At an event held by Baloch Canadians in Toronto in 2018 to mark what they claimed to be the 70th anniversary of the illegal occupation of Balochistan by Pakistan, Karima said: “We want India to raise the issue as a human rights cause.” She felt this was an “important role” India could play, since atrocities against the Baloch were not on the world’s radar. Karima also said at the time that India had the reach to raise what she described as the “genocide” of the Baloch people. Baloch journalist Sajid Hussain Baloch was reported missing in Sweden in March, and his body was later found in a river. His family and friends alleged he was murdered. Reporters Without Borders (RSF), the journalists’ organisation, said his mysterious disappearance and subsequent death could have been organised by Pakistani intelligence agencies because of his work as a journalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prominent-baloch-activist-found-dead-in-mysterious-circumstances-in-canada/story-xHe4sN3Mlp8w5C8k921kJL.html
22-12-2020||World||Isolated UK battles to reopen trade route after day of chaos||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he’s trying to re-open trade routes to France “as fast as possible” after a day of cross-Channel political bartering failed to end the chaos at the UK’s busiest port.France shut down freight traffic from Dover in southeast England at midnight on Sunday because of fear over a faster-spreading mutant strain of Covid-19 that forced the UK government to impose a strict lockdown on London and surrounding areas. Spain and Portugal, meanwhile, joined dozens of countries restricting flights and effectively isolating the UKJohnson said he’d spoken with French President Emmanuel Macron while Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had been in talks with his counterpart. “We both understand each other’s positions and want to resolve these problems as fast as possible,” Johnson told a press conference Monday.The government is drawing up contingency plans to test truck drivers for coronavirus before they leave the UK, the Telegraph newspaper reported late Monday, citing an official it didn’t identify.The search for a solution to keep goods flowing in and out of Britain comes after another taxing weekend for the UK at the end of a torrid year. A spike in coronavirus infections forced Johnson to backtrack on allowing people to spend the festive period together while talks with the European Union on a post-Brexit trade deal missed another deadline.Brexit WarningThe upheaval just 10 days before Britain’s post-Brexit transition period is due to end also gave the country a foretaste of what could ensue. Without an accord, the UK will default to trading with the EU on World Trade Organization terms, with the imposition of costly tariffs and quotas, and the threat of more tailbacks at ports as haulers cope with new bureaucracy.The economy is already buckling again, with London, the most critical dynamo for growth, in lockdown. Bloomberg Economics revised its outlook on Monday to predict another recession at the start of 2021. The pound plunged against the dollar, marking its worst day since the coronavirus hit markets in March.Outside Dover, trucks lined up on the M20 highway as an emergency plan was triggered with drivers unable to board ferries. The Department for Transport also prepared to open Manston airport in Kent, which is being overhauled to accommodate as many as 4,000 vehicles as part of Britain’s planning for a no-deal outcome from the EU trade talks.Johnson sought to downplay the crisis, stressing the closure only applies to “a very small percentage” of food entering the UK “The vast majority of food, medicines and other supplies are coming and going as normal,” he said. “The government has been preparing for a long time for exactly this kind of event.”Vaccine ShipmentsThe UK this month became the first Western country to authorize a coronavirus vaccine. Johnson’s spokesman, Jamie Davies, told reporters that the program would be unaffected because the nation already has the majority of this year’s supply from Pfizer Inc.Shapps earlier said the border snarl-up only affects about 20% of incoming trade, and that haulers are accustomed to disruption across the Dover-Calais strait because of the weather and strikes.Nevertheless, the latest challenge is exposing Britain’s trade vulnerabilities just as a 4 1/2-year odyssey to leave the EU moves from political rhetoric to economic reality. Container ports and ferry terminals were already congested because of stockpiling ahead of the Dec. 31 deadline marking a final break from the European single market.Why the UK’s Mutated Coronavirus Is Fanning Worries: QuickTakeBusiness groups facing catastrophic losses urged the government to act soon, with the 18,000-member Logistics UK calling for rapid Covid-19 testing of truckers departing the country as the quickest way of protecting supply chains. Meanwhile, there were long queues at some supermarkets in London, with fresh produce fast disappearing from shelves.French Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said European nations are working on “a solid health protocol” to be implemented “in the coming hours.”But a meeting of the EU’s crisis response experts in Brussels on Monday ended without a decision on how to proceed, according to an EU official, who spoke on condition of an anonymity. Some members of the group called for an urgent discussion at political level to resolve the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/isolated-uk-battles-to-reopen-trade-route-after-day-of-chaos/story-LYjO96C5hCCddLFP4EYZyO.html
22-12-2020||World||US senate passes giant package wrapping relief, funding, tax breaks||The Senate Monday night passed a giant year-end spending bill combining $900 billion in Covid-19 relief aid with $1.4 trillion in regular government funding and a bevy of tax breaks for businesses.The House passed the combined bill earlier, and the legislation now will go to President Donald Trump, who aides said would sign it when it arrives at the White House this week. The House and Senate also cleared a seven-day stopgap funding bill to avert a partial government shutdown while the broader legislation is prepared for the president.The bill, which totals more than $2.3 trillion, contains the second-largest economic relief measure in US history -- after the $1.8 trillion Cares Act passed in March as the pandemic throttled the world’s biggest economy. Economists say the aid should be enough to avert a double-dip recession next year, though risks remain.“This latest fiscal rescue package will add approximately 1.5 percentage points to annualized real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2021 and close to 2.5 percentage points to calendar-year 2021 growth,” said Mark Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics. “If lawmakers had not come through, the economy probably would have suffered a double-dip recession in early 2021.”The legislation would provide direct payments of $600 to most Americans and their children. Those with incomes of more than $100,000 would be excluded, as would undocumented immigrants. The payments will go out as soon as next week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday.For the unemployed, a $300-per-week in enhanced unemployment benefits will be put in effect through March. Unemployment insurance programs for gig workers and the long-term unemployed also would be extended. There’s $284 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program that provides forgivable loans to small businesses. Companies that previously had a PPP loan can qualify for a new one, and their PPP grants would be made tax deductible.The package includes money for transportation -- including for $15 billion for airlines -- vaccine distribution, schools and universities, farmers and food aid.The relief plan is attached to a $1.4 trillion bill that would fund the federal government through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2021. That bill adheres to budget caps set in place during the 2019-debt ceiling fight, including by keeping $12.5 billion in veterans health spending under the cap -- something that cropped up as a last-minute fight. The bill has $1.4 billion for Trump’s border wall and related spending, although the incoming Biden administration could stop construction.The bill also includes an extension of tax breaks -- for the alcohol and renewable-energy industries, among others -- a law to curb surprise medical bills, a water-infrastructure measure and an intelligence-agency policy bill, among its provisions.The haggling over the relief package forced Congress to repeatedly pass temporary funding for government operations. Late Sunday, Trump signed a one-day extension of government funding, giving lawmakers time for votes on Monday.While the bill clears the decks for the incoming Biden administration by wrapping up the fiscal 2021 budget process, it leaves Democrats ready to push for more stimulus after the Jan. 20 inauguration. Many of the aid provisions will expire in the first quarter of next year, so additional relief could be needed by MarchHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said that the $900 billion relief bill is just a first step, and vowed to make another package the top priority in the new Congress. That effort is likely to include a push for infrastructure spending, which has bipartisan appeal, but is already facing skepticism from Republicans, with Mnuchin saying Monday that this week’s measure is likely the last aid bill needed to address the pandemic.Critical to the outlook will be whether Democrats manage to win the two Georgia runoff elections for the Senate on Jan. 5 -- giving them control of both chambers of Congress.“I think we are going to have a much easier time than we had with a Republican president and a Republican Senate” said Pelosi.However, even if Democrats defeat the two Republican incumbents in Georgia, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, the Senate would be split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast a tie-breaking vote. Meanwhile, because of Democratic losses in the November election, Pelosi will be working with a narrower majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-passes-giant-package-wrapping-relief-funding-tax-breaks/story-RBgt0xuRsiSQc6zFT52J2I.html
22-12-2020||World||New coronavirus variant can be stopped using same preventive measures: WHO||A World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist has said people can protect themselves from the new variant of the coronavirus by following social distancing rules and maintaining practices like washing hands regularly and wearing masks.Maria Van Kerkhove was speaking to CNN on Monday regarding the spread of the infection in the UK as she outlined that the reproduction rate, also known as an infected person’s ability to spread the virus. She said the reproduction rate of the new variant has increased from 1.1 to 1.5. She also said that the new variant has made no impact on the vaccine or vaccination process. “We do not anticipate any impact on the vaccine and the vaccination,” Kerkhove said.Thank you @CNN @NewDay for having me on to explain more information about what we know this new #SARSCoV2 virus variant reported from 🇬🇧 Quick segment below for more info 👇@WHO https://t.co/fbP4SAMc7zVan Kerkhove also said that WHO and doctors in the UK have set up a surveillance system to study the new variant. “So far we do not see any increase in disease severity or clinical picture. We are also looking at the body’s ability to develop antibodies. The studies are ongoing,” she added. “We have to work a little bit harder as the new Covid-19 variant is spreading. These are in the presence of interventions that are put in place across England. Viruses mutate, they change all the time.”“The interventions that work for preventing the spread of this variant also work for the viruses that are circulating around. So, this is physical distancing, making sure we avoid crowded spaces. We do things indoors as opposed to outdoors,” Van Kerkhove said.The discovery of the new Covid-19 strain B117 has led to a Christmas lockdown in London and southern England. UK prime minister Boris Johnson made the announcement regarding the new lockdown on Sunday and asked people to remain indoors during Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Several nations have also banned flights from the UK over fears of the new coronavirus strain, which experts claim is 70% more transmissible.The global health body has said that the new coronavirus variant discovered in Britain with a higher transmission rate is not yet out of control. “We have had a much higher (contamination rate) at different points in this pandemic and we’ve got it under control.

Transportation Minister Ong Ye Kung said a local facility was producing four tonnes of dry ice each day to properly refrigerate the goods. Singapore will further ease social distancing restrictions from December 28 after weeks of barely any local coronavirus infections.Authorities initially kept Covid-19 in check through rigorous contact tracing but the virus later swept through dormitories housing low-paid migrant workers.The city has reported more than 58,000 virus infections but a relatively low 29 deaths. Its borders remain closed to most international visitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-gets-asia-s-first-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-doses/story-ilG3hQDkiGPNiOEadxFfBK.html

It also outlined that the flights will be allowed only in exceptional circumstances.“An official source in the Ministry of Interior: The Kingdom decides to suspend all international flights for travelers - except in exceptional cases - temporarily for a week, which may be extended for another week (loosely translated from Arabic),” GACA tweeted on Monday.Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman were among the Gulf nations whose governments announced that they would ban entry and exit via their land and sea borders barring cargo movements and cancel commercial travel. An AFP report said that the ban will not apply to international aircraft currently in the kingdom, which will be allowed to leave. The report also said that cargo from nations where the new strain has not caused an outbreak will be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia.Several nations in Europe and the Middle East have closed their doors to the UK and temporarily halted international commercial travel as a fast-spreading strain of coronavirus put several parts of the United Kingdom in a lockdown. The UK government on Sunday had told the media that the new strain of coronavirus is out of control.India also suspended all flights from the United Kingdom from December 22 to December 31 over fears of the new Covid-19 strain. Poland, Russia, Hong Kong, Germany, Italy, Morocco and several other countries have stopped operations to and from the UK in order to limit the spread of the new strain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-suspends-air-india-other-flights-for-a-week/story-9pvChFDxpz0yMstPUsR3vK.html
22-12-2020||World||Canada’s Ontario to go on province-wide shutdown from Dec 26||Ontario on Monday announced a province-wide shutdown because of a second wave of Covid-19 in Canada’s most populous province. The lockdown will be put in place for southern Ontario from December 26 until January 23, but will lift for northern Ontario on January 9. Health officials criticized the delay, with top one infectious disease doctor saying it was ridiculous to wait until the day after Christmas to shut down. Ontario has had seven straight days of more than 2,000 cases a day. Modeling shows that could more than double in January. Health officials earlier said a four- to six-week hard lockdown could significantly stop the spread of Covid-19. Toronto, Canada’s largest city, had already closed restaurants for indoor dining but schools remained open. All high schools in Ontario will now be closed for in-person learning until January 25. Elementary schools will be closed until January 11. After Covid-19 cases surged in the spring, Canada flattened the epidemic curve with a lockdown. But as in other countries, Covid fatigue set in, restrictions were relaxed and a second wave was unleashed. “We have flattened the curve before and we can do it again,” Health Minister Christine Elliott said. Dr Barbara Yaffe, Associate Chief Medical Officer of Health, said Ontario is in a very challenging and precarious situation. “There are outbreaks anywhere people congregate,” Yaffe said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the delay until December 26 will allow businesses outside the current lockdown zones to get ready for it. He said it allows restaurants a chance to sell off some of their inventory. “I’m not comprising anything,” Ford said. “I have to be fair to these businesses who have massive inventory.” Dr Andrew Morris, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Toronto and the medical director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at Sinai-University Health Network, said Ford is prioritizing the economy over health by delaying.“Ridiculous. Costing lives. For what?!” Morris said. The Ontario Hospital Association said in a statement that it was “surprised and disappointed” the lockdown won’t happen for another five days. “People across this province need clear public health communication, and the December 26th implementation date sends a confusing message about what they should and shouldn’t do at this crucial moment. We are already hearing from hospital and health system leaders who are shocked that the restrictions will not come into effect until after Christmas,” the association’s president, Anthony Dale, said in the statement. Dr Naveed Mohammad, CEO of the William Osler Health System that operates hospitals in a Toronto suburb, said people need to act as if the lockdown had already started. “Until the people of this province realise what each trip out their home risks for themselves and their loved ones, we won’t get through this,” he said, noting that hospitals in Brampton, Ontario, are grappling with capacity. “Please stay home, starting today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-ontario-to-go-on-province-wide-shutdown-from-dec-26/story-ECcHp0iOo6XlsigGvQWFkK.html
22-12-2020||World||US president-elect Joe Biden receives Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine shot on live television||US President-elect Joe Biden received his first injected dose of the Covid-19 vaccine live on television on Monday in an effort to boost confidence in its safety ahead of its wide distribution next year.Biden has said he would make the fight against the coronavirus, which has killed more than 315,000 Americans and infected more than 17.5 million, his top priority when he takes office on Jan. 20. At age 78, he is in the high-risk group for the highly contagious respiratory disease.A Democrat, Biden will inherit the logistical challenges of distributing the vaccine to hundreds of millions of Americans, as well as the task of persuading people who worry its development was rushed for political reasons to take it.His black long-sleeved shirt rolled up, Biden received the injection from Tabe Mase, nurse practitioner and head of Employee Health Services at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware, in front of reporters. Images were carried live on television. After getting the shot, a dose of the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc, Biden praised medical professionals as “heroes”.“I’m doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it’s available to take the vaccine. There’s nothing to worry about,” Biden said. His wife, Jill Biden, who got the injection earlier in the day, stood by.But Biden also noted that the vaccine would take time to roll out and that people should listen to medical experts and not travel for the upcoming holidays if possible.He credited the scientists who worked on the vaccines, adding: “I think that the (Trump) administration deserves some credit, getting this off the ground with Operation Warp Speed.”Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would likely get the vaccine next week, Biden’s transition team said.Republican President Donald Trump frequently has played down the severity of the pandemic and overseen a response health experts say was disorganized, cavalier and sometimes ignored the science behind disease transmission. New American economyEfforts to limit the economic fallout on Americans from the pandemic were boosted on Sunday when congressional leaders agreed on a $900 billion package to provide the first new aid in months, with votes likely on Monday.Biden on Monday also named additional members to his National Economic Council (NEC), rounding out his economic policymaking team with people his transition office said would help lift Americans out of the economic crisis.David Kamin, an official in former President Barack Obama’s White House, will be NEC deputy director, and Bharat Ramamurti, a former top economic adviser to Senator Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign, will serve as NEC deputy director for Financial Reform and Consumer Protection, Biden’s team said in a statement.Joelle Gamble will be special assistant to the president for economic policy.“This is no time to build back the way things were before — this is the moment to build a new American economy that works for all,” Biden said in the statement.Biden had already named Brian Deese, who helped lead Obama’s efforts to bail out the automotive industry and negotiate the Paris climate agreement, to lead the council, which coordinates the country’s economic policymaking.Much of the fate of Biden’s White House agenda will hinge on the outcome of a pair of Senate runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will determine which party controls the upper chamber of the US Congress.Harris traveled on Monday to Columbus, Georgia, to campaign on behalf of Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, the Democratic candidates locked in tight races with incumbent Republicans.At a drive-in rally for the candidates, Harris, currently a California senator, said she would return to Washington later in the day to vote on the stimulus package.Asked by one journalist whether there were plans to “fumigate” the White House over virus concerns before the Biden administration moved in, Harris said: “I don’t have the current status for that.”Trump was briefly hospitalized in October with Covid-19, and many of his advisers and White House staff have also contracted the virus.Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and White House adviser, was also set to campaign in Georgia for Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.The outgoing president, making unsubstantiated claims of widespread electoral fraud, has focused on trying to overturn his election loss even as daily Covid-19 deaths soared. His campaign’s latest long-shot effort was a petition to the US Supreme Court on Sunday that legal experts said would fail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-elect-joe-biden-receives-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-shot/story-dBL8empjp8rdT3TdTZH15J.html

India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, accepted the award on behalf of the prime minister from the US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien at the White House. President Trump “presented the Legion of Merit to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his leadership in elevating the US-India strategic partnership,” O’Brien said in a tweet. Modi was presented with the highest degree Chief Commander of the Legion of Merit which is given only to the Head of State or Government. He was given the award in recognition of his steadfast leadership and vision that has accelerated India’s emergence as a global power and elevated the strategic partnership between the United States and India to address global challenges. O’Brien in another tweet said that Trump also presented the Legion of Merit to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The awards were received by their respective ambassadors in Washington DC. President Trump “awarded the Legion of Merit to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for his leadership and vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he said. Trump awarded the Legion of Merit to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for his leadership in addressing global challenges and promoting collective security, O’Brien tweeted. The United States is the latest country to confer its highest award to the Indian prime minister. Other awards include Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud by Saudi Arabia in 2016, State Order of Ghazi Amir Amanullah Khan (2016), Grand Collar of the State of Palestine Award (2018), Order of Zayed Award by United Arab Emirates (2019), Order of St Andrew by Russia (2019), Order of the Distinguished Rule of Nishan Izzuddin by Maldives (2019).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-trump-presents-legion-of-merit-to-pm-modi/story-xNqBlK6CLMBZGRT6JCH2qO.html
22-12-2020||World||Westerners wary of travelling to China amid worries threat of detention||As the research director of an activist investor, Anne Stevenson-Yang made business trips to China from the US almost monthly before the coronavirus hit. But the J Capital Research co-founder has strong reservations about going back, even after the pandemic subsides.Some who do business with China are increasingly worried about the risk of being swept up by security agents and becoming casualties of geopolitical tensions between Beijing and the West.Stevenson-Yang’s concerns, which previously focused on run-ins with local officials, grew after the detention of two Canadians in late 2018. An Australian citizen, Cheng Lei, has been held since August on national security concerns.“You may have a very small chance of being the one they decide to detain, but it’s years of your life,” said Stevenson-Yang, who moved to the northeast US with her Chinese spouse and children around six years ago, after a quarter of a century in China. “I have lots and lots of friends and relatives in China, as well as a business. But I feel like it’s just not worth the risk.”Interviews with a dozen executives, diplomats, consultants and academics show many of them believe there is an increased risk in traveling to China and -- since the passage of a security law in June -- the financial hub of Hong Kong. In China’s opaque justice system, the police, prosecutors and courts answer to a secretive Communist Party committee, and authorities can hold suspects for long periods without trial under increasingly broad national security laws.Haze Fan, a Bloomberg News staffer who is a Chinese citizen, was detained earlier this month in Beijing. While China has confirmed that Fan is being held by the Beijing Municipal National Security Bureau on suspicion of endangering national security, authorities haven’t released further details about her case.Concerns over travel will likely outlast President Donald Trump or any deal to end the US extradition proceedings against Huawei Technologies Co. executive Meng Wanzhou, the case Beijing blames for a collapse in ties with Canada, the country that originally detained her. How to ease the risk of arbitrary detention will be among the key challenges facing President-elect Joe Biden.Tensions between the US and China have continued to rise in the final weeks of Trump’s presidency, with his administration including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. -- China’s biggest chipmaker -- on a blacklist along with more than 60 other companies. China’s Ministry of Commerce has threatened to retaliate for the move, which denies companies access to US technology from software to circuitry.“Beijing’s record of detaining individuals in retaliation for the perceived transgression of their home government should be a geopolitical risk on the radar of every C-suite executive,” said Hugo Brennan, the principal Asia analyst at risk consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft.Separating political detentions from legitimate law enforcement can be difficult. China has rejected the label of “hostage diplomacy” as “totally groundless,” saying that no one who follows the country’s laws should fear arrest, and Chinese executives have expressed concern in turn about visiting the US Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying this month said Meng’s case was “100% a political incident.”Still, Chinese diplomats have indicated the fates of the two Canadians detained on Dec. 10, 2018 -- days after Meng’s arrest -- were open to negotiation. Zhao Lijian, another Foreign Ministry spokesman, told a briefing in June that political intervention to stop proceedings against Meng “could open up space for resolution to the situation” of the Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.“We have received calls from member companies about the possibility of arbitrary detentions,” Ker Gibbs, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said via email last month. “Our view is that the risk is small, but it’s not zero.”The Australian Strategic Policy Institute compiled data on eight categories of “coercive measures” in a recent report, noting such actions have risen sharply in the past few years: arbitrary detention or execution, popular boycotts, pressure on specific companies, state-issued threats and restrictions on official travel, investment, trade and tourism.One senior American executive said he and others -- especially former government officials working as consultants -- were increasingly wary. “I know a lot of business people who are out of China now and are very afraid of going back,” said the executive, who asked not to be identified discussing an issue that could impact business.Although China hasn’t arrested any Americans, the State Department warned US citizens in July they face the risk of arbitrary arrests and exit bans. Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper, said in October it was “common sense” for the US to worry after pursuing criminal cases against Chinese scholars with military links.Australians have also found themselves under pressure. The Australian government is embroiled in disputes with China over issues including Canberra’s support for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. Two prominent Chinese-born Australian citizens -- Cheng and Yang Hengjun -- are in detention on national security charges, and in September the last two journalists working for Australian media outlets in China were flown out of the country after being visited by security agents in the middle of the night.The risks may stretch beyond China’s mainland. In October, Chinese Ambassador to Canada Cong Peiwu warned that Ottawa’s acceptance of political refugee claims from Hong Kong protesters could threaten the “good health and safety” of more than 300,000 Canadian passport holders there.“It works because, while it is shocking, deeply harmful for the detainee and places enormous political pressure on the foreign government, it is also judged by foreigners as sufficiently rare as to be a manageable risk, something that doesn’t really disrupt profitable business for China,” said David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China.J Capital Research’s Stevenson-Yang said it’s no longer as crucial for her to visit China because her business is less reliant on the country. The company has however compartmentalized information to protect the organization on the ground, “because you never know what can be construed in the wrong way,” she said.“We’ve become very careful about that sort of thing,” Stevenson-Yang said. “And we didn’t used to be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/westerners-wary-of-travelling-to-china-amid-worries-threat-of-detention/story-dncvmp7WEE6N5SwXTtVJvL.html
22-12-2020||World||Hacking company NSO faces legal battle from Microsoft, Google, Cisco, Dell||Tech giants including Microsoft and Google on Monday joined Facebook’s legal battle against hacking company NSO, filing an amicus brief in federal court that warned that the Israeli firm’s tools were “powerful, and dangerous.”The brief, filed before the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, opens up a new front in Facebook’s lawsuit against NSO, which it filed last year after it was revealed that the cyber surveillance firm had exploited a bug in Facebook-owned instant messaging program WhatsApp to help surveil more than 1,400 people worldwide.NSO has argued that, because it sells digital break-in tools to police and spy agencies, it should benefit from “sovereign immunity” - a legal doctrine that generally insulates foreign governments from lawsuits. NSO lost that argument in the Northern District of California in July and has since appealed to the Ninth Circuit to have the ruling overturned.Microsoft, Alphabet-owned Google, Cisco, Dell Technologies-owned VMWare and the Washington-based Internet Association joined forces with Facebook to argue against that, saying that awarding soverign immunity to NSO would lead to a proliferation of hacking technology and “more foreign governments with powerful and dangerous cyber surveillance tools.”That in turn “means dramatically more opportunities for those tools to fall into the wrong hands and be used nefariously,” the brief argues.NSO - which did not immediately return a message seeking comment - argues that its products are used to fight crime. But human rights defenders and technologists at places such as Toronto-based Citizen Lab and London-based Amnesty International have documented cases in which NSO technology has been used to target reporters, lawyers and even nutrionists lobbying for soda taxes.Citizen Lab published a report on Sunday alleging that NSO’s phone-hacking technology had been deployed to hack three dozen phones belonging to journalists, producers, anchors, and executives at Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera as well as a device beloning to a reporter at London-based Al Araby TV.NSO’s spyware was also been linked to the slaying of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. Khashoggi’s friend, dissident video blogger Omar Abdulaziz, has long argued that it was the Saudi government’s ability to see their WhatsApp messages that led to his death.NSO has denied hacking Khashoggi, but has so far declined to comment on whether its technology was used to spy on others in his circle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hacking-company-nso-faces-legal-battle-from-microsoft-google-cisco-dell/story-nky2pE2eeAtre4LluOBUZN.html

Officials aren’t certain whether it originated in the UK, Vallance added. But by December, he said it was causing over 60% of infections in London.Italy on Sunday said it has detected a new coronavirus strain with mutations in a person who recently returned from the UK. “The patient and their partner returned from the United Kingdom several days ago, landing in Rome’s Fiumicino airport. They are now isolated and have observed, together with family and close contacts, all procedures proscribed by the health authorities,” said an Italian ministry’s statement, according to Sputnik.South Africa has also announced that a new variant of the Covid-19 virus is driving the country’s resurgence of the disease, with higher numbers of confirmed cases, hospitalisations and deaths. According to officials in the country, the new variant, known as 501.V2, is dominant among new confirmed infections in South Africa’s current wave||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-strain-in-italy-netherlands-denmark-as-far-as-australia/story-A4Mtr05j7MDmLtLcMtmBxK.html

They said it could be up to 70% more transmissible than the old variant.There is, however, no evidence yet to suggest it is more lethal or causes more severe illness, or that vaccines will be any less effective against the new variant. The announcement forced countries around the world to soon announce restrictions on flights from the UK. Till Monday, the number of nations that unveiled such restrictions had grown to at least 33.

22-12-2020||World||‘Constitutional coup’: Nepal crisis in top court||Opponents of KP Sharma Oli turned to Nepal’s Supreme Court on Monday to challenge his dissolution of parliament, denouncing it as a “constitutional coup” even as the prime minister defended his move, insisting he was forced to seek a fresh mandate through elections as the rift within the ruling Nepal Communist Party was severely affecting his government’s functioning.Supreme Court spokesman Bhadrakali Pokharel said three petitions against the dissolution were “in the process of being registered”.“Under the constitution, the prime minister has no prerogative to dissolve parliament,” lawyer Dinesh Tripathi, one of the petitioners, told Reuters. “It’s a constitutional coup. I’m seeking a stay order from the court.”Oli on Sunday sprang a surprise on his rivals and got the President to dissolve parliament, a controversial move amid a prolonged tussle for power between him and former premier Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ within the ruling dispensation.In an address to the nation on Monday, Oli said he was forced to dissolve parliament after he learnt about a plan to move a vote of no-confidence against him. Oli, who is also one of the two chairmen of the ruling party, said that the intraparty rift in the ruling Nepal Communist Party severely affected the government’s functioning.“The elected government was pushed to a corner and picketed against and was not allowed to work so I decided to dissolve the house.” Experts say if the court registers the petitions it could take about two weeks for a decision.Oli said his government had done well in terms of safeguarding the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. “I was victimised for enhancing national pride by publishing a map with the inclusion of Kalapani and Lipulekh,” Oli added.In June, Oli claimed efforts were being made to oust him after his government redrew the country’s political map by incorporating three strategically key Indian territories. India had termed as “untenable” the “artificial enlargement” of the territorial claims by Nepal.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/constitutional-coup-nepal-crisis-in-top-court/story-gYemXTEqFDwOh9Zd5OMkkO.html

With their robust experience and qualifications, they will provide the needed voices to guide my administration in overcoming our nation’s unprecedented economic challenges,” Biden said while announcing the appointments.Ramamurti is currently managing director of corporate power programme at Roosevelt Institute, a think tank. He has previously served on a congressional commission overseeing the rollout of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the over $2 trillion stimulus package enacted in March to help struggling Americans and businesses. Ramamurti has also served as an aide to Senator Elizabeth Warren for seven years.Ramamurti’s parents came to the US from Tamil Nadu. His father Ravi Ramamurti did his doctorate at Harvard, and the younger Ramamurti studied at Harvard years later, and so did his twin siblings Gita and Arjun Ramamurti, according to Harvard Magazine.Biden has named a number of Indian-descent Americans to his team, starting with the historic pick of Kamala Harris, who is the first Black, woman and American of Indian, south Asian and Asian descent elected as US vice-president. He has nominated Neera Tanden as cabinet secretary in charge of budget and Vivek Murthy as surgeon general.

22-12-2020||World||UK hit by new coronavirus strain: Here’s a look at other mutations||Just as the world was starting to hope for vaccines to usher in a healthier 2021 UK on Sunday cautioned against a highly contagious and mutated strain of coronavirus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson placed London and surrounding areas under the most stringent lockdown since March, effectively cancelling Christmas. “When the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defense,” he said at a press conference on Sunday.As Europe and the rest of the world was waking up to a new nightmare and putting travel restrictions in place, the scientific community rushed in to comfort alarmed populations. Scientists emphasised repeatedly that all viruses mutate, it is in their nature, even the flu virus mutates and thus vaccines need to be frequently updated. The coronavirus has mutated before, once at the very start of the pandemic. “This thing’s transmitting, it’s acquiring, it’s adapting all the time,” Dr. Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at the University of Cambridge, told the New York Times. “But people don’t want to hear what we say, which is: This virus will mutate.” he added. ALSO WATCH | Covid: Will new virus variant impact vaccine? UK PM Boris clarifies amid alarm How many times has the Sars-CoV-2 virus mutated?So far, scientists have noted two distinct set of mutations in the virus that causes Covid-19, the H69/V70 deletion, and the D614G, both of which affects the spike proteins, which helps the virus to bind to the human cell, and infect it. It is this ability that vaccines seek to target and weaken. The H69-70 deletion affects antibody susceptibility, and has been seen three times so far- in Danish minks, in Britain, and in a patient who was rendered much less responsive to convalescent plasma therapy.The virus was first reported in Wuhan and since then, it is said to have mutated many times, most of which have gone unnoticed. The BBC reported that if the strain that’s infecting people now is compared to the first one that spread in Wuhan a total of 25 mutations will be visible, that’s a little over two mutations a month. As the human body gets more adept at identifying and fighting it, the virus too is expected to fight back, by trying to evade the body’s immune system. The D614G is the first known mutation that is suspected to have occurred in Eastern China in January and later spread through New York City and Europe. Within a few months of the pandemic this particular variant was found all over the world, as it had successfully replaced its predecessor, which had spread from Wuhan. Scientists have opined that the pandemic spread faster as a result of the 614G mutation, stating that some countries which were initially successful in containing the virus faltered later because of the new strain, which spread more rapidly. The H69-70 deletion occurred when the coronavirus spread from humans to minks in Denmark and later Utah. The coronavirus has a tendency to jump from humans to animals and vice versa, minks kept in crowded farms fell prey to the virus and thousands had to be killed to stop the mutated virus from spreading to humans. There is no proof so far of the mutations tampering with vaccine effectiveness. When the 614G spread scientists studied its effect on human lung tissues and hamsters, and found that even though it spread more quickly it did not alter or create new symptoms, nor did it cause a monumental spike in deaths. What is even more important than mutations is change in human behaviour, which scientists say affects how the virus spreads more than mutations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-hit-by-new-coronavirus-strain-here-s-a-look-at-other-mutations/story-zYo1syMagWYuIuou7Wr4qO.html
