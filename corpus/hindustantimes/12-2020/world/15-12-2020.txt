The country also decided to ‘ring-fence’ or isolate completely from exposure the elderly from Covid-19, however, the death toll increased amidst the elderly, especially in the nursing homes. While it did find some initial success in controlling the virus, mounting deaths prompted an investigation into the situation.The commission called out the previous and current governments for inaction over already known structural problems in the care system for the elderly and blamed them for being ultimately responsible. It also mentioned that the overall spread of the disease could be another leading cause for the death toll. “These shortcomings meant that elderly care was unprepared and ill-equipped to deal with a pandemic. The employees in elderly care were largely left alone to handle the crisis situation,” the commission said in a statement.Nursing home residents account for a little less than half of the almost 7,700 Covid-19 related deaths in Sweden. “We also assess that the measures were insufficient in several respects,” the commission noted when referring to the intervention by government and agencies in protecting the elderly and said that the measures had arrived too late.Prime Minister Stefan Lofven admitted the failure in protecting the older people but said that the regional authorities, and not the central government, are responsible for health and elderly care.The commission’s findings come after the Health and Social Care Inspectorate had warned of serious shortcomings in Sweden’s elderly care, noting that only six per cent of nursing home patients were examined by a doctor.Deaths per capita in Sweden is found to be more than its Nordic neighbours despite remaining lesser than some European countries that imposed lockdowns. Sweden has reported 320,098 overall Covid-19 cases and 7,667 total fatalities so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unprepared-ill-equipped-to-deal-with-pandemic-panel-finds-sweden-s-failure-to-protect-elderly-during-covid-19/story-StaqTcwaBBdifzY3XhQ6PJ.html

So today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden,” McConnell said on the floor of the Senate, and went on to congratulate Harris, adding, “Beyond our differences, all Americans can take pride that our nation has a female vice-president-elect for the very first time.”Only a handful of Republicans have acknowledged Biden’s victory, so as to not upset the president, including Senator Mitt Romney. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, has still not congratulated Biden.In a speech after the electoral college victory, Biden had for the first time shown impatience with Trump and his Republican allies’ refusal to accept the election’s outcome, and slammed them for launching an “assault on democracy” over their efforts to overturn the election result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-republican-breaks-with-donald-trump-congratulates-joe-biden/story-I6xz0WMYLJor0WNtiRKYQL.html
15-12-2020||World||Pakistan issues new law for speedy trials of alleged rapists||Pakistan’s president on Tuesday issued a much-awaited new law requiring the establishment of special courts to speedily conclude trials of people charged with raping women or children, a move hailed by rights activists.The law, which must be approved by Parliament to remain in effect, requires courts to conclude the trials of alleged rapists and issue verdicts within four months. It also prohibits the disclosure of the identity of rape victims, according to a statement released by President Arif Alvi’s office on Twitter.The statement provided few additional details. Leading Pakistani English-language newspaper The Dawn reported that under the new law any official who shows negligence in investigating rape cases could face a three-year prison sentence. The paper also reported that repeat offenders could be chemically castrated.Suspects found guilty of raping women and children potentially face a death sentence in Pakistan.The new law comes months after Prime Minister Imran Khan promised to remove deficiencies in existing laws to ensure speedy justice for rape victims.Khan recently also hinted at public executions or surgical castration of convicted rapists after two assailants gang raped a woman on a deserted highway near the eastern city of Lahore in September. The attack shocked Pakistan, even though attacks violence women is common in the deeply conservative Muslim country.Before the new law, rape cases could drag on for years, mainly because of faulty investigations and flawed laws, making it difficult for victims to come forward to share their ordeal.The new law will lapse if Parliament does not approve it within 120 days.Nearly 1,000 women are killed in Pakistan each year in so-called “honor killings” for allegedly violating conservative norms on love and marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-issues-new-law-for-speedy-trials-of-alleged-rapists/story-SqO3sjhmghEI9ueGAeLhaO.html
15-12-2020||World||Biden plans Cuba reset in rebuke of Trump’s sanctions strategy||President-elect Joe Biden’s team plans to bring the US closer to normalized relations with Cuba, reversing many of the sanctions and regulations imposed during the Trump administration, according to people familiar with the matter.That strategy includes reducing restrictions on travel, investment and remittances for the island nation that are perceived to disproportionately hurt Americans and ordinary Cubans, said the people, who requested anonymity because the new administration is still coming together. Other measures that target Cuba for human rights abuses would remain in place, the people said.The prospect of a détente between Washington and Havana rekindles memories of the thaw that Biden helped champion during the Obama administration, when the two nations restored diplomatic ties that had been broken for decades following Fidel Castro’s rise to power.But the president-elect is returning to an even messier scene: the Cuban economy is suffering its worst crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union amid fallout from Covid-19 and US sanctions. At the same time, Cuban intelligence officers have helped prop up Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, allowing his regime to consolidate its grip on power in defiance of demands for free and fair elections.With a packed domestic agenda, it’s unclear how quickly Biden will move on implementing his Cuba policy. Even if some changes happen early, the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown could delay the benefits of any measures that allow for greater travel to the island. It’s also unclear whether Biden will increase staffing at the US embassy in Havana. The Trump administration pared back diplomatic operations after strange illnesses, including brain trauma, afflicted some US diplomats and their families.Biden said in October that the US needed a new Cuba policy, though his team has been firm in condemning efforts by Havana to silence dissidents, including a recent raid on a house full of activists and artists.The president-elect has also denounced Venezuela’s Maduro as a dictator. Just as the Trump administration connected Cuba and Venezuela policy, using sanctions as a tool intended to spur political change, Biden’s team may try to leverage a rapprochement in exchange for the Cubans reducing their presence in Venezuela and supporting a diplomatic resolution to the crisis there, according to the people.Another complicating factor is Florida. While Biden’s advisers have criticized Trump’s Latin American policies for being heavily influenced by electoral politics, particularly the goal of winning the Sunshine State, they still face a sobering reality: The Democratic Party must defend a narrow House majority in 2022. Any policies that are perceived as easing pressure on Cuba and Venezuela without getting significant concessions from their left-wing governments could risk backlash at the polls.For their part, investors are showing an early vote of confidence in Biden’s potential Cuba policy. The $43 million Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, which is geared toward Cuba and the Caribbean, has surged 40% since the US election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-plans-cuba-reset-in-rebuke-of-trump-s-sanctions-strategy/story-WulMH84e5niiJapCdZui3N.html

Biden is the second Democratic candidate to win the Peach State since Bill Clinton in 1992.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump attacked Georgia’s Republican leaders for not overturning Biden’s win, and on Sunday sought to preemptively blame Governor Brian Kemp for a loss in the Senate races while demanding he call a special legislative session“What a fool Governor @BrianKempGA of Georgia is. Could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way. Demand this clown call a Special Session and open up signature verification, NOW. Otherwise, could be a bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th,” Trump tweeted.The Senate runoff elections will take place on January 5, which will decide the control of the Senate majority for the next two years. Warnock will be facing off against Senator Kelly Loeffler, while Ossoff will be challenging Senator David Perdue.Democrats need to win both seats in order to deadlock the Senate, in which case Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast the tie-breaking vote.Meanwhile, the final Electoral College results are 306 for Biden and 232 for Trump. The electoral votes will be sent to the US Congress for verification at a joint session, the final stage of the election, which is scheduled for January 6.Biden will be sworn in as the 46th US president on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-elect-biden-heads-to-georgia-to-campaign-for-democrats-in-upcoming-senate-runoffs/story-ykpMrKnwG65UiCJo3dOpNK.html

The deputy speaker’s post is vacant.“Today’s meeting of the Constitutional Council has discussed the appointments to various vacant constitutional commissions,” National Assembly chairperson Ganesh Prasad Timilsina said after the meeting, according to Nepali website Kantipur. He did not elaborate.Nepal watchers said PM Oli is keen to get the council to appoint former home secretary Prem Kumar Rai to head the powerful Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority as its chief commissioner. The commission is mandated by the Constitution to investigate persons holding public office and their associates for corruption.Leaders of Prachanda’s faction within the ruling party underline that any appointment by the Oli-led government before holding consultations with the Prachanda faction would be a violation of the peace pact between PM Oli and Prachanda.One of the conditions to let PM Oli continue as the NCP chairperson and the prime minister was that he would consult the party leadership before a policy decision or a key appointment.PM Oli’s rivals suspect that the prime minister would like the anti-graft commission to probe Prachanda and his associates who have been piling pressure on him to step down.The NCP was formed in 2018 with the merger of the PM Oli -fronted Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and the Prachanda-led Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre). The honeymoon, however, did not last long and the merged entity which came to power, the NCP, has been staring at a split for months.PM Oli’s rushed effort to get the anti-graft watchdog chief’s appointment through comes right ahead of the meeting of the communist party’s standing committee where Prachanda and his associates including former prime minister Madhav Nepal are expected to ramp up pressure on PM Oli to quit and go ahead with key appointments only after consulting them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-oli-races-to-get-new-anti-graft-watchdog-heads-for-a-showdown-with-prachanda/story-0nqEfgJMplKliYzlM0lunO.html
15-12-2020||World||Moderna Covid-19 vaccine boards safety wagon; roll out by next week likely||The US regulator on Tuesday released new data confirming Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine was safe and effective, a strong sign that it could receive emergency approval in days and be ready to roll out by next week.The Food and Drug Administration said there were “no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA (emergency use authorization)” and confirmed an overall efficacy of 94.1 percent.Distribution of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine began on Monday and if the FDA green lights Moderna’s, rollout of some six million doses could start next Monday.That would represent a powerful second weapon against the virus in the worst-hit country in the world, where more than 300,000 people have died from Covid-19 and a winter surge continues across much of the country.- Stops severe cases -The FDA document offered the clearest look yet into the Moderna vaccine, which was co-developed with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).On Thursday, an independent group of scientists will convene to debate everything known so far about the product, which Moderna and the NIH began developing in January using cutting-edge mRNA technology.The panel is expected to vote in favor of an EUA, and the FDA normally acts upon its recommendations.According to the new data release, the two-dose regimen protected younger people slightly better than it did older people.In a clinical trial of 30,400 people, 196 fell ill with Covid-19 by November 21 -- 11 in the vaccine group and 185 in the placebo group.Efficacy was 95.6 percent for people aged 18-65; 86.4 percent among those aged 65 and older; and 94.1 percent overall.Importantly, of 30 cases of severe Covid-19, all occurred in the placebo group.The FDA also looked at detailed safety data, at a median of nine weeks after participants had received the second shot, which is taken 28 days after the first.- Cutting-edge technology -The most common side effects associated with the drug, called mRNA-1273, were injection site pain in roughly 90 percent of cases; fatigue in 70 percent, headache in 60 percent, muscle pain in 60 percent, joint pain in 45 percent and chills in 45 percent.Few of these effects were classed as “severe” and when they were that tended to occur more in the young than in the old. Lymphadenopathy, or swollen lymph nodes occurred in 1.1 percent of the vaccine group compared to 0.6 percent of the placebo group.There was an imbalance in allergic or inflammatory reactions by the immune system -- which occurred in 1.5 percent of the vaccinated population compared to 1.1 percent of the non-vaccinated.But there were none that were classed as severe or anaphylactic.Throughout the follow-up period to date, there have been three reports of Bell’s palsy -- a facial paralysis condition -- in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group.The Pfizer trial saw four people get Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group, and none in the placebo group.In both cases, the FDA said there was insufficient information to determine that the vaccine was the cause of this paralysis, which normally resolves within three months.Andrew Morris, a University of Toronto professor of medicine who has studied the condition, told AFP however “it is becoming increasingly likely that there is an important relationship with Bell’s (facial) palsy.” “The absolute risk -- in light of the risks associated with Covid-19 -- is small,” he stressed.The frequency of life-threatening events was low, around one percent in each group, and there was no suggestion that the vaccine was the cause.Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) which makes human cells express a surface protein of the new coronavirus.This simulates an infection and trains the immune system to be ready in case it encounters the real virus. The mRNA is encased inside fatty particles. Both companies used a slightly different formulation resulting in different cold-storage requirements: -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) for Pfizer; -20 degrees Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) for Moderna.The US hopes to immunize 20 million people this month, with health care workers and long-term care residents at the front of the line. Authorities want to reach the rest of the population by summer, but much will depend on vaccine confidence. Experts estimate more than 70 percent of people will need to be vaccinated to bring the outbreak to a close.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-boards-safety-wagon-roll-out-by-next-week-likely/story-GA47rJ1rOJbnU3no1KMtwJ.html
15-12-2020||World||UK plans big fines for online companies over harmful content||Social media and other internet companies face big fines in Britain if they don’t remove and limit the spread of harmful material such as child sexual abuse or terrorist content and protect users on their platforms, officials said Tuesday.Separately, Irish regulators fined Twitter for a data breach, in the first penalty for a US tech company since Europe introduced strict privacy rules.Under legislative proposals that the UK government plans to launch next year, tech companies that let people post their own material or talk to others online could be fined up to 18 million pounds ($24 million) or 10% of their annual global revenue, whichever is higher, for not complying with the rules.The proposals, contained in the UK government’s Online Safety Bill, will have extra provisions for the biggest social media companies with “high-risk features,” expected to include Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.These companies will face special requirements to assess whether there’s a “reasonably foreseeable risk” that content or activity that they host will cause “significant physical or psychological harm to adults,” such as false information about coronavirus vaccines. They’ll have to clarify what is allowed and how they will handle it.All companies will have to take extra measures to protect children using their platforms. The new regulations will apply to any company whose online services are accessible in the UK and those that don’t comply could be blocked.The UK government is also reserving the right to impose criminal sanctions on senior executives, with powers it could bring into force through additional legislation if companies don’t take the new rules seriously - for example by not responding swiftly to information requests from regulators.The European Union is also expected later Tuesday to unveil its own long-awaited sweeping overhaul of digital regulations. The EU proposals will include measures aimed at reining in the tech giants. They will also update the bloc’s 20-year-old rules on e-commerce by making online platforms take more responsibility for their goods and services, such as weeding out shady traders and taking down illegal content such as hate speech.Meanwhile, the Irish Data Privacy Commission issued Twitter with a 450,000-euro ($540,000) fine for a security breach. The company triggered an investigation after reporting the breach in January 2019, which affected users of the social media company’s Android app.But it didn’t report it quickly enough, because of “an unanticipated consequence of staffing between Christmas Day 2018 and New Years’ Day,” the company said.“We take responsibility for this mistake and remain fully committed to protecting the privacy and data of our customers,” Twitter said.It’s the first punishment for a big U.S. tech company since the EU’s strict privacy rules, known as General Data Protection Regulation, took effect in 2018.Under GDPR, a single regulator takes the lead role in cross-border data privacy cases as part of a “one-stop shop” system. But the system has come under question, with Ireland’s watching facing criticism for taking too long to decide on cases. The Twitter decision was also delayed after regulators in other EU member states objected to Ireland’s draft penalty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-plans-big-fines-for-online-companies-over-harmful-content/story-OSDDogEJ8Q1zweYaKQJrqO.html
15-12-2020||World||Mitch McConnell recognizes Biden as President-elect||Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recognized Joe Biden as the winner of the US election the day after the Electoral College confirmed his victory — a pivotal moment that further cements President Donald Trump’s defeat.“Yesterday electors met in all 50 states, so as of this morning our country officially has a president-elect and a vice president elect,” McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday after listing Trump’s accomplishments. “Today I want to congratulate Joe Biden.”McConnell refused to acknowledge Biden’s win until now, saying Trump was entitled to pursue his claims in court, even as Trump-backed cases were dismissed by numerous judges. The Supreme Court last week turned away an effort backed by Trump to toss out election results in states won by Biden.While Trump’s allies could still mount protests next month after the new Congress is seated but before the Jan. 20 inauguration, there is no chance the Democratic-led House would indulge any further attempts to overturn the election results.Senate Republicans have hesitated to oppose Trump’s false claims about the election results in part because they need his base to show up for Georgia’s two Jan. 5 runoff elections. Those races will determine whether Democrats retake the Senate majority with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes.Trump’s efforts to fight the election results have been backed by both Georgia senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who face challenges from Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.McConnell’s recognition of Biden’s win comes as Congress and Trump have yet to agree on an omnibus spending package to fund the regular operations of government, as well as more than $900 billion in additional relief for the coronavirus-battered economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mitch-mcconnell-recognizes-biden-as-president-elect/story-q83gLBHP1dTjf9jhOtKkmI.html

The anti-fraud body then relayed the information to all 27 EU member states and OLAF spotted a suspicious shipment to Ireland at the end of September.The cargo was stopped in Dublin and analysis confirmed the presence of “unacceptably high levels of methanol,” said OLAF, adding that further investigation led to the discovery of other stocks of the same sanitiser, while a second shipment was also contaminated.The investigation later established that several companies based in the EU had ordered hand sanitizers from the same Turkish manufacturer operating under various names.“Since the onset of the pandemic, OLAF has been active in fighting illicit material related to COVID-19 such as counterfeit and substandard face masks, rapid tests, hand sanitizers,” said OLAF director-general Ville Itälä. “These products should protect people, not harm them. OLAF investigations have detected over 900 companies involved so far, and the list is growing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-thousands-of-liters-of-dangerous-hand-sanitiser-seized/story-sXqxgCLwp3uzBgdvT3JJ8J.html

Governments at all levels in Xinjiang fully respect ethnic minorities, and provide necessary training for voluntarily registered workers to improve their skills for employment,” Wang said.Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutors have rejected calls by exiled Uighurs to investigate China for alleged crimes against humanity in XUAR.Reports from The Hague said that members from Uighur exiled had handed a dossier of “evidence” to the court in July accusing China of locking more than a million Uighurs in re-education camps and of forcibly sterilising women.But the office of prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said on Monday it was unable to act because the alleged acts happened on the territory of China, which is not a signatory to The Hague-based ICC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/570-000-uighurs-forced-to-work-on-cotton-farms-in-xinjiang-think-tank-report/story-KXf5pVIZ4MjrGHB6ZDXNUO.html
15-12-2020||World||Moderna vaccine found safe, effective ahead of FDA review||Moderna Inc.’s vaccine is safe and effective for preventing Covid-19, US regulators said, clearing the way for a second shot to quickly gain emergency authorization and add to the country’s sprawling immunization effort.The Food and Drug Administration’s staff said in a report on Tuesday that the experimental vaccine is 94.1% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19, confirming earlier results released by the company.The report was posted online ahead of a meeting Thursday of agency advisers who will vote whether to recommend authorization before a final FDA decision. The agency doesn’t have to follow the advice of the independent vaccine experts, though it often agrees with its advisory panels. Last week, the FDA authorized a similar vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE after an advisory panel voted 17-4, with one abstention, to support its authorization.The FDA got a much deeper look at Moderna’s clinical-trial data than the numbers previously released to the public by the company. Notably, the agency was able to review the shot’s effectiveness across a broad range of racial, ethnic and age groups, and look at evidence of how well the shot worked for people with pre-existing medical conditions that make them more vulnerable to severe Covid-19.The agency found the shot was similarly effective across racial and ethnic groups and those with underlying medical conditions. It was 86.4% effective in people age 65 and over, according to the report, and 95.6% effective in those 18 to 65.Both the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine are based on messenger RNA technology that hasn’t been previously used in inoculations. Additionally, both are two-dose vaccines, meaning once people receive an initial shot they will need to return to their care providers weeks later for an additional injection.Between Pfizer and Moderna, Operation Warp Speed officials have said 20 million people in the US are expected to get their first shots by year-end.Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations are rising across the country, increasing pressure to get the pathogen under control. While health officials are hopeful that the immunization push will begin to slow a pandemic that has killed more than 300,000 Americans, it’s not yet known what effect the vaccines have on transmission of the disease.Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine was cleared first in the UK where there were a few reports of serious reactions that led regulators there to advise against anyone with a history of significant allergies getting the shot. The FDA did not take such a step, but told facilities where the vaccine would be administered to have medication on hand to treat possible allergic reactions, including a severe form called anaphylaxis.Moderna’s vaccine isn’t yet approved in any other countries and hasn’t yet been used on anyone outside of a clinical trial.Once the US grants authorization, advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must meet, as they did last week on Pfizer’s vaccine, to give Moderna’s shot the green light and provide offer specific recommendations for use and monitoring. Moderna’s vaccine will be distributed to sites around the country where health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, are expected to get the earliest doses.Pfizer and BioNTech’s first vaccines were sent to more than 600 sites around the country. The shot must be kept extremely cold and requires special freezers to transport, while Moderna’s can be kept in more traditional cold storage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-vaccine-found-safe-effective-ahead-of-fda-review/story-qjvIys4G5ZDp8InefWQpuL.html
15-12-2020||World||US ramps up vaccinations up as second Covid-19 shot nears||Hundreds more US hospitals are set to begin vaccinating their workers Tuesday as federal regulators issued a positive review of a second Covid-19 vaccine shot needed to boost the nation’s largest vaccination campaign.The Food and Drug Administration said in documents posted online that its initial review confirmed the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, bringing the shot to the cusp of US authorization.A panel of outside experts will offer their recommendation Thursday, with a final FDA decision expected soon thereafter.The positive news comes as hospitals across the US begin ramping up vaccinations with the shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech’s, which the FDA cleared last week.Packed in dry ice to stay at ultra-frozen temperatures, shipments of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine are set to arrive at 400 additional hospitals and other distribution sites, one day after the nation’s death toll surpassed a staggering 300,000. The first 3 million shots are being strictly rationed to front-line health workers and elder-care patients, with hundreds of millions more shots needed over the coming months to protect most Americans.A second vaccine can’t come soon enough as the country’s daily death count continues to top 2,400 amid over 210,000 new daily cases, based on weekly averages of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The devastating toll is only expected to grow in coming weeks, fueled by holiday travel, family gatherings and lax adherence to basic public health measures.The first vaccine deliveries have provided a measure of encouragement to exhausted doctors, nurses and hospital staffers around the country.Johnnie Peoples, a 43-year-old survival flight nurse, was excited and a little nervous Monday afternoon as he unzipped his flight suit and stuck out his left arm to become the first person to receive the vaccine at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor.“Just to be a part of it is a good feeling,’’ he said.Since March, he’s transported critically ill Covid-19 patients by jet from smaller hospitals around the state to the university medical center. It’s up-close-and-personal work that requires him to adjust ventilator settings and administer infusions to keep blood pressure from plummeting.In Florida, government officials expect to have 100,000 doses of the vaccine by Tuesday at five hospitals across the state.“This is 20,000 doses of hope,” said John Couris, president and chief executive officer, Tampa General Hospital, after the delivery of 3,900 vaccine vials on Monday. Each vial has five doses.Because the vaccine requires two rounds, the people getting injections now will need a second shot in about three weeks.Vaccinations were also expected to kick off Tuesday in New Jersey, which is dividing some 76,000 doses among health workers and nursing home residents. The federal government is coordinating the massive delivery operation by private shipping and distribution companies based on locations chosen by state governors.Following another initial set of deliveries Wednesday, officials with the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed in Washington said they will begin moving 580 more shipments through the weekend.“We’re starting our drumbeat of continuous execution of vaccine as it is available,” Army Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer for Warp Speed, told reporters Monday. “We package and we deliver. It is a constant flow of available vaccine.”Shots for nursing home residents won’t begin in most states until next Monday, when some 1,100 facilities are set to begin vaccinations.Perna and other US officials reiterated their projection that 20 million Americans will be able to get their first shots by the end of December, and 30 million more in January.That projection assumes swift authorization of the Moderna vaccine up for review this week. Like the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Moderna’s requires two shots for full protection.Last month, Moderna and NIH reported that their shot appeared to be nearly 95% effective across various ages and racial groups, according to results from an ongoing 30,000-person study. The main side effects were fatigue, muscle aches and injection-site pain after the second dose. Those flu-like reactions are common to many vaccines and are a sign the vaccine is revving up the immune system to help fight off the virus.Moderna reported no major safety problems from its study. But FDA’s panel is certain to scrutinize the data for any indications of possible severe allergic reactions or other rare side effects. Officials in the UK are investigating several adverse reactions there with Pfizer’s vaccine and FDA is closely monitoring the rollout here for similar reports.Both Moderna’s and Pfizer-BioNTech’s shots are so-called mRNA vaccines, a brand-new technology. They aren’t made with the coronavirus itself, meaning there’s no chance anyone could catch it from the shots. Instead, the vaccine contains a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ramps-up-vaccinations-up-as-second-covid-19-shot-nears/story-WZFJPLr3LuADm1tbnVWwQM.html
15-12-2020||World||UK’s Christmas plans will cost many lives, health journals say||Two of Britain’s most influential journals for healthcare and medical professionals jointly called on the government on Tuesday to scrap plans to relax Covid-19 restrictions for five days around Christmas or risk overwhelming the health service.In what was only their second joint editorial in more than 100 years, the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal said the government should be tightening the rules rather than allowing three households to mix over five days.“We believe the government is about to blunder into another major error that will cost many lives,” the editorial said.It argued that, far from giving people an opportunity to let their guard down over Christmas, Britain should be following the more cautious examples of Germany, Italy and the Netherlands which have just announced they were tightening restrictions.Britain has recorded 64,402 deaths from Covid, the second highest number in Europe.The article came a day after the government announced that due to a surge in cases London would be moving up into “Very High Alert” level, the most restrictive of England’s tiered system of rules to try to contain the virus.London mayor’s Sadiq Khan also said the government should look again at its Christmas plans and the call from the respected journals will add to mounting pressure on the government to change course. So far, ministers have deflected such calls by stressing the need for citizens to act responsibly.The two journals said that unless there was a change of policy the state-run National Health Service (NHS) would face a stark choice after Christmas: stop most elective and non-urgent work or become overwhelmed by Covid patients.“The main impact of a further surge in Covid-19 inpatients is likely to be felt most by those with other conditions,” the editorial said.It said the government had been too slow to introduce restrictions in the spring and again in the autumn, and accused it of “squandering money on failure” by lavishing funding on a national Track and Trace system that was ineffective.“It should now reverse its rash decision to allow household mixing and instead extend the tiers over the five-day Christmas period in order to bring numbers down in the advance of a likely third wave,” the editorial said.The government has said its plans are kept under review but has not indicated it would reverse its decision.“What we’re asking people to do is the minimum possible, there is scope for three households to come together during that period,” Steve Barclay, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, told LBC radio. “It is a difficult time so we don’t want to criminalise families for coming together at Christmas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-christmas-plans-will-cost-many-lives-health-journals-say/story-yBUsATlzbjMJ2PMNZDKojN.html

The Indo-Pacific region is also high on the UK’s agenda, and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab held talks with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in New Delhi on Tuesday.“We want to deepen our economic partnership,” Raab told reporters. “Working toward an enhanced trade partnership next year, which itself will be, we hope, a stepping stone toward a future free-trade agreement.”India is the UK’s 17th-largest trading partner and total trade between the two countries was worth $16.5 billion in 2019, according to Bloomberg data.It will be Johnson’s first major bilateral trip since becoming leader, his office said in an emailed statement. The UK has also invited India, alongside South Korea and Australia, to join next year’s G-7 summit as a guest country.‘Indispensable Partner’“India is an increasingly indispensable partner for the UK as we work to boost jobs and growth, confront shared threats to our security and protect our planet,” Johnson said in the statement.India has sought to forge strong ties with the UK, as well as France, as it seeks a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council amid months-long border tensions with China. New Delhi is also seeking more investment to shore up its Covid-hit economy.Jaishankar said both sides’ trade ministers are in talks and that India would work with the UK on a range of issues, including the United Nations.“The problem we have today about narrow representation at the leadership levels of the UN is in many ways a challenge to its credibility and its effectiveness,” Jaishankar said at Carnegie India’s technology summit on Monday, referring to the UN Security Council, whose five permanent members -- Britain, France, China, Russia and the US -- have veto powers. India has joined nations including Japan and Germany in calling for UNSC reforms.Johnson’s office said tackling climate change will be one of the focuses of his India visit, ahead of Britain hosting the UN COP26 climate summit in Glasgow next year. Johnson will also be the guest of honor at the annual parade in New Delhi to celebrate India’s Republic Day on Jan. 26.In preparation for the end of the Brexit transition period on Dec. 31, the UK has also signed deals with the likes of Canada and Japan, preserving the benefits of trade agreements it had as a member of the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-boris-johnson-to-visit-india-in-january-ahead-of-trade-talks/story-8hnLuepvNATDzFpWSVco2O.html
15-12-2020||World||Micromanaging every content online not effective approach of regulation: Facebook’s Nick Clegg||The most effective approach of regulation is not the one that seeks to “micro manage” every content online but rather the one that holds companies accountable and insists on a high level of transparency of systems and policies, Facebook Vice-President for Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg said on Tuesday. Speaking at the Facebook Fuel for India 2020 event, Clegg said the digital industry is still young and has had a profound impact on the way in which one works and interacts. He said it is right that rule makers and democratically elected rule makers should seek to introduce new guidelines and guardrails in the way in which the internet operates. “What I observe is that the most effective and intelligent approach to regulation is one that doesn’t seek to try and micromanage every post and every line of content online... but instead to hold companies like Facebook accountable, and insist on a high level of transparency for the systems and the policies that they have in place,” he added. Further, he said regulations that do not “hinder the way in which the international economy now relies on international data flows” would be a “sensible overall approach”. Currently, digital platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google are categorised as intermediaries and regulated by the IT Act, 2000 that defines their role to be limited to processing, storing and transmitting data of third party users.The Indian government is working on amending the IT rules for intermediaries to make them more responsive and accountable. The government is also crafting data protection law to ensure privacy, safety and security of user data. These include provisions around the handling of data of adults and minors, storage within the Indian borders and penalties for non-compliance. Facebook and WhatsApp have drawn flak in India over issues like handling of hate speech and misinformation on these platforms. Clegg noted that the company is “very responsive” to law enforcement requests in India or elsewhere for cooperation and that it disables a huge number of accounts and groups on Facebook and Instagram for nefarious behaviour. However, WhatsApp is a private, intimate messaging system that is quite different from the public or semi-public experience of Instagram and Facebook as it is end-to-end encrypted, he said. “What we say to policy makers in India and elsewhere is because we can’t see the content that doesn’t mean that we cannot use signals that we do pick up, what is called metadata. We can use metadata to pick up signals so that we can go after people on an encrypted messaging system,” Clegg said. He added that about two million WhatsApp accounts are removed every month, especially when they are used for bulk broadcast of messages, which is not the purpose of the app. “We will continue to explain to policy makers as best as we can, that we think that millions and billions of people around the world, expect the privacy of an intimate end-to-end encrypted messaging service, even as we continue to cooperate with them in other ways,” he emphasised. Asked if it would make sense to have India-specific community guidelines, Clegg said it is a complex issue. “The complex thing about all this is that Facebook as a company has been put under tremendous political pressure, whether its in India or elsewhere, by people who have different views and often conflicting views about what shouldn’t and shouldn’t be circulating freely on the internet, even though it is legal,” he said. Clegg said given that Facebook is a global company, it has community standards that it applies evenly and consistently. “It doesn’t mean that there aren’t national legislative requirements and other exceptional requirements that we don’t respond to,” he said. He cited the example of Germany where it is illegal to say certain things about the Holocaust, which was not the case in other countries, and so Facebook geo-blocked that content in Germany. “There is adaptability... they must be for specific circumstances,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/micromanaging-every-content-online-not-effective-approach-of-regulation-facebook-s-nick-clegg/story-ISANBijW9s8aQaejEFFCUP.html

15-12-2020||World||Bombs, shooting attack in Kabul kill 4: Officials||A bombing and a shooting attack in Kabul killed at least three people, including a deputy provincial governor, while a deputy provincial council chief was killed in western Afghanistan on Tuesday, officials said.The attacks are the latest in relentless violence in Afghanistan even as the Taliban and Afghan government negotiators hold talks in Qatar, trying to hammer out a peace deal that could put an end to decades of war.According to Tariq Arian, an Afghan interior ministry spokesman, a sticky bomb attached to the armored vehicle belonging to Kabul’s deputy provincial governor killed two people, and wounded two others.The deputy provincial governor and the apparent target of the attack, Mahbobullah Mohibi, was killed alongside his secretary while two of his bodyguards were wounded, Arian said. The bombing took place in the Macrorayan neighborhood of Kabul.Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, condemned the attack and said the recent increase in attacks across the war-torn country is a clear enemy of the Afghan peace process.Sima Samar, special presidential envoy and state minister for human rights, tweeted that the “people are tired of terrorist attacks every day.” Samar also urged the Taliban to agree to a ”cease-fire to stop the killing and more bloodshed.”Also in Kabul, gunmen shot and killed a police officer and wounded another policeman, said Ferdaws Faramarz, spokesman for Kabul’s police chief. An investigation was ongoing, he added.In violence elsewhere, a deputy provincial council head in western Ghor province was killed while another council member and their driver were wounded when a sticky bomb attached to their vehicle detonated on Tuesday, said Arif Aber, spokesman for the provincial governor.The slain council chief, Abdul Rahman Atshan, was the apparent target of the attack, which took place around noon in the provincial capital of Faroz Koh.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the Kabul or Ghor attacks. The Islamic Sate group has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in the capital in recent months, including horrific attacks on educational institutions that killed as many as 50 people, most of them students.The Taliban have waged bitter battles against IS fighters, particularly in IS strongholds in eastern Afghanistan, while continuing their insurgency against Afghan government forces.Separately, the Afghan defense ministry said Tuesday the army repelled a Taliban attack in the district of Arghandab, in southern Kandahar province. At least seven Taliban fighters were killed, it claimed.On Monday, the ministry announced authorities were investigating reports that an alleged airstrike over the weekend killed around a dozen civilians, including children, in Arghandab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bombs-shooting-attack-in-kabul-kill-4-officials/story-efTgEn1A7ZEfr171L5i59K.html
15-12-2020||World||China central bank urges wider acceptance of cash as payments go digital||China’s central bank has called for wider acceptance of cash in economic activities and vowed to punish those who refuse to accept cash payments in the wake of a widening gap in access to digital services.China’s online payments via barcodes and third-party payment apps such as Ant Group’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings’ Tenpay have gained in popularity over the years on government policies to promote innovation.Some merchants and institutions have become reluctant to accept cash due to reasons such as cost control or user experience, with the trend accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a notice on Tuesday.“Renminbi (yuan) cash is the most basic means of payment. Entities or individuals cannot refuse to accept it,” the PBOC said, adding that the central bank will investigate and punish firms or individuals that refuse to accept cash or adopt discriminatory measures against cash payments.In a separate statement, the central bank said payments of some basic public services such as medical treatment, water, electricity and gas fees have gradually migrated online.The transition has left the elderly behind, as it is more difficult for some of them to adapt to the new digital technologies compared with younger people, it said. “The innovation of consumption and payment methods should be conducive to...protect people’s livelihood and enhance the public’s sense of happiness,” the PBOC said in the notice.The PBOC urged that all entities and individuals should not discriminate or carry out any inconvenient measures to exclude cash payment and create “gaps of digitalisation”.“Non-bank payment institutions must not promote the concept of cashless or discriminatory means of cash payment in any forms,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-central-bank-urges-wider-acceptance-of-cash-as-payments-go-digital/story-I9sQIHPonUk2STfQwcG4hN.html
15-12-2020||World||Democrats squeezed as Covid-19 relief bill talks continue||Top Washington negotiators continued to reach for a long-delayed agreement on Covid-19 relief, but rank-and-file Democrats appeared increasingly resigned to having to drop, for now, a scaled-back demand for fiscal relief for states and local governments whose budgets have been thrown out of balance by the pandemic.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin by phone Monday evening and continues to press for help for struggling states and localities. But top Democratic allies of President-elect Joe Biden came out in support of a $748 billion plan offered by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and hinted they won’t insist on a pitched battle for state and local aid now.“We cannot afford to wait any longer to act. This should not be Congress’ last Covid relief bill, but it is a strong compromise that deserves support from both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. “We cannot leave for the holidays without getting relief to those Americans who need it.”The message from Coons, a confidant of Biden, and a similar message from Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., came as a bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a detailed Covid-19 aid proposal on Monday in hopes it would serve as a model for their battling leaders to follow as they try to negotiate a final agreement.But the group was unable to forge a compromise on GOP-sought provisions shielding businesses from Covid-19-related lawsuits, a key priority of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Kentucky Republican is pressing a lowest-common-denominator approach that would drop the lawsuit shield idea for now if Democrats agree to drop a $160 billion state and local aid package.Pelosi has insisted for months that state and local aid would be in any final bill, but as time is running out, Democrats appear unwilling to hold the rest of the package hostage over the demand. Several Democrats appeared at the bipartisan news conference endorsing the $748 billion package.“I found it interesting that they separated out the state and local and liability provisions. Senator McConnell had suggested that earlier,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “Seems to me that we’re making some progress on it.”Cornyn, a McConnell lieutenant, spoke after a dozen or so lawmakers unveiled two bills. One is a $748 billion aid package containing money for struggling businesses, the unemployed, schools and vaccine distribution. There is also $45 billion for transportation and transit assistance, funding for rural internet service and help for the Postal Service, among other provisions. The other bill proposes a $160 billion aid package for state and local governments and a modified liability shield that is backed by Republicans and Democratic moderate Joe Manchin of West Virginia, but it is probably too politically freighted to advance.The path forward for their proposals — and for Covid-19 aid more generally — remains unclear, though Cornyn said the bipartisan plan has lots of “good stuff” for any year end agreement.Any agreement is likely to be forged in parallel negotiations between Pelosi and Mnuchin — closely watched by McConnell.Outstanding issues in the leadership talks include a potential second round of direct payments to individuals, a plan for $300-per-week bonus unemployment benefits, state and local aid, and the GOP-sought liability shield against Covid-19-related lawsuits.Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she hoped that top Capitol Hill leaders and the administration will use the proposals as the basis for a Covid-19 relief package “that is urgently needed by our struggling families, our hard-hit small businesses, our stressed-out health care providers, our overwhelmed Postal Service, our challenged schools, and so many others.”Lawmakers also worked to finalize a yearend catchall funding package that will be the basis for the last significant legislation of the Trump presidency.There’s a hoped-for deadline of midnight Friday to deliver the completed package to President Donald Trump, which is when a partial government shutdown would arrive with the expiration of last week’s temporary funding bill. But there’s no guarantee that the massive year end measure will be completed in time. If the talks drag, further temporary bills could be needed.Negotiations on the $1.4 trillion catch all spending bill are “essentially finished,” said a congressional aide participating in the talks. While details are closely held, “the status quo is prevailing.” That means Trump would get another $1.4 billion or so for a final instalment to continue construction of his long-sought US-Mexico border wall.Republicans have succeeded in killing a $12 billion plan to break last year’s budget mini-agreement by using accounting maneuvers to pad veterans health care funding to accommodate big cost increases from expanding access to health care services from private providers. Instead, a different set of moves is being employed to provide for equivalent spending increases for other domestic programs.The post-election lame-duck session is the last chance to wrap up the unfinished work this year, a goal of all involved, though they have been slow until now to forge the often-tricky compromises required to pull the measure together.Pelosi has not thrown in the towel on her drive to obtain state and local aid, which was part of the almost $2 trillion CARES Act that passed the Senate unanimously in March. But many Republicans are adamantly against the idea now.President-elect Joe Biden wants as much Covid-19 relief as possible but has no direct influence on the negotiations. While he’ll empower Democrats after taking office next year, GOP leaders like McConnell are playing hardball and have forced Pelosi to scale back her demands. And while McConnell supported a $300-per-week bonus unemployment benefit this summer, he’s pulled back since the November election.No. 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland displayed flexibility in an appearance on CNN on Sunday that Republicans interpreted as a harbinger of further Democratic retreat.“The legislative process is a give and take and the items that I just mentioned are absolutely critical to get done, and although I think state and local assistance is critically important, the others are critically important too,” Hoyer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-squeezed-as-covid-19-relief-bill-talks-continue/story-aNAoy9p2zLGLnBcmXgNTLM.html
15-12-2020||World||SolarWinds Orion hack: Pentagon, White House and US army impacted||Communications at the US treasury and commerce departments were reportedly compromised by a supply chain attack on SolarWinds, a security vendor that helps the federal government and a range of Fortune 500 companies monitor the health of their IT networks.According to Reuters, which broke the news on Sunday, hackers believed to be working for Russia have been monitoring internal email traffic at the US treasury and commerce departments. Reuters reported that the hackers managed to hide malicious code in a software update for a tool called Orion, which is typically used to make IT simpler with a single panel for administering various parts of a network.Earlier this year, hackers believed to be sponsored by the Russian government managed to inject malware into Orion updates released between March 2020 and June 2020 which provided them with a strong foothold for future hacking.SolarWinds, publicly-listed in Austin, is a Texas-based company with a value of over $6 billion. According to the company, it has over 300,000 customers including more than 425 of the US Fortune 500 all ten of the top 10 US telecommunications companies, all five branches of the US military, all five of the top five US accounting firms, the Pentagon, the State Department, the National Security Agency, the department of justice and the White House.The Pentagon is the biggest customer, with the army and the navy being big users. The department of veterans affairs, which is heavily involved in the US response to Covid-19, is another Orion customer and the biggest spender on the tool in recent years. The National Institutes of Health, DHS and the FBI are also amongst the many branches of the US government that have previously bought the tool.The immediate impact of the revelations is expected to be purely operational as Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) has recommended government civilian agencies to stop using SolarWinds Orion. “The compromise of SolarWinds’ Orion Network Management Products poses unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks. Tonight’s directive is intended to mitigate potential compromises within federal civilian networks, and we urge all our partners—in the public and private sectors—to assess their exposure to this compromise and to secure their networks against any exploitation,” CISA’s acting director Brandon Wales said. This is the fifth emergency directive issued by CISA under the authorities granted by Congress in the cybersecurity act of 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solarwinds-orion-hack-pentagon-white-house-and-us-army-impacted/story-Ckx6ToAZfPwuNG5oRJW7ZL.html

Trump and his allies are still protesting the result, but with more than 50 post-election lawsuits rejected, including by the US Supreme Court, they have no viable path to overturn it.Polish President Andrzej Duda, who considers himself a political ally of Trump, also congratulated Biden after the Electoral College vote. In a letter, he said Poland and the US were “strategic partners” joined by the values of “freedom, justice, democracy and the primacy of international law.”Russia, which was accused by US intelligence agencies of intervening in 2016 to help get Trump elected, has been wary of Biden, who is likely to seek to emphasize his support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and traditional US allies. Russia is also concerned about the risk of new sanctions by the incoming administration.Putin’s telegram came a day after hackers tied to the Russian authorities were suspected of involvement in one of the most audacious attacks on US government agencies in recent memory, as part of a global campaign involving malware inserted into updates by a software maker.

15-12-2020||World||Brazil says China ‘not transparent’ on Covid-19 vaccine emergency use||Brazil’s health regulator Anvisa said on Monday China’s health authorities are not transparent in their authorization of Covid-19 vaccines for emergency use, a statement that may further inflame political tension in the South American country.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a consistent critic of China, has repeatedly cast doubt on the CoronaVac vaccine being developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd.Meanwhile, Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, a Bolsonaro enemy, said the state expected to start vaccinating its residents in January, though Brazil’s most populous state will not be able to use CoronaVac until it is approved by Anvisa.“Brazil is the international leader in the evaluation process for CoronaVac,” Anvisa said in a statement on its website on Monday.“The vaccine has had an emergency use authorization in China since June of this year. The Chinese criteria for granting emergency use authorization are not transparent, and there is no available information about the criteria currently in use by Chinese authorities to make these decisions.”China’s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbing said on Tuesday China had been attaching “great importance” to the safety and efficacy of its vaccines.While Brazil’s health regulator has long been largely apolitical, Bolsonaro has been appointing allies to it in recent months, stoking fears among health professionals that its decisions may be affected by political considerations.At least tens of thousands of people have taken the Sinovac vaccine in China’s emergency use programme, officially launched in July, that targets limited groups of high-risk people.China has not made public details of how it determines whether a novel coronavirus vaccine is qualified for emergency use. Its National Health Commission did not respond to a request for comment. A Sinovac representative declined to comment but referred to a news conference in October at which a health official said the emergency inoculation was launched after stringent reviews and in accordance with China’s laws and World Health Organization’s rules.These vaccines showed “very good safety and immunogenicity readings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials”, the official said at the time. CoronaVac is undergoing Phase 3 testing in Sao Paulo.Doria said earlier on Monday that efficacy data would be released on December 23, eight days later than initially planned, to allow for a larger sample size and more complete analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-says-china-not-transparent-on-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use/story-c6TftwNSBRNCHTneoSuGZI.html
15-12-2020||World||Poor countries face long wait for vaccines despite promises||With Americans, Britons and Canadians rolling up their sleeves to receive coronavirus vaccines, the route out of the pandemic now seems clear to many in the West, even if the rollout will take many months. But for poorer countries, the road will be far longer and rougher.The ambitious initiative known as COVAX created to ensure the entire world has access to Covid-19 vaccines has secured only a fraction of the 2 billion doses it hopes to buy over the next year, has yet to confirm any actual deals to ship out vaccines and is short on cash.The virus that has killed more than 1.6 million people has exposed vast inequities between countries, as fragile health systems and smaller economies were often hit harder. COVAX was set up by the World Health Organization, vaccines alliance GAVI and CEPI, a global coalition to fight epidemics, to avoid the international stampede for vaccines that has accompanied past outbreaks and would reinforce those imbalances.But now some experts say the chances that coronavirus shots will be shared fairly between rich nations and the rest are fading fast. With vaccine supplies currently limited, developed countries, some of which helped fund the research with taxpayer money, are under tremendous pressure to protect their own populations and are buying up shots. Meanwhile, some poorer countries that signed up to the initiative are looking for alternatives because of fears it won’t deliver.“It’s simple math,” said Arnaud Bernaert, head of global health at the World Economic Forum. Of the approximately 12 billion doses the pharmaceutical industry is expected to produce next year, about 9 billion shots have already been reserved by rich countries. “COVAX has not secured enough doses, and the way the situation may unfold is they will probably only get these doses fairly late.”To date, COVAX’s only confirmed, legally binding agreement is for up to 200 million doses, though that includes an option to order several times that number of additional doses, GAVI spokesman James Fulker said. It has agreements for another 500 million vaccines, but those are not legally binding.The 200 million doses will come from the Serum Institute of India, the company that will likely make a large portion of the coronavirus shots destined for the developing world. CEO Adar Poonawalla says it has a confirmed order for 100 million doses each of a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and one from Novovax.“We don’t have anything beyond that in writing,” he told The Associated Press. “If they want more, they’ll have to place more orders.”He said the lack of commitment from COVAX will mean a much longer wait for people in developing countries. Poonawalla also noted that his company’s first priority would be making shots for India, which has suggested it wants at least 300 million vaccines. It’s likely India would not be able to take all of those at once, but a big order could delay the distribution of vaccines for other parts of the developing world, Poonawalla said.Potentially further slowing down the process is that neither the AstraZeneca vaccine nor the Novovax one has been licensed by any regulatory agency yet — and any injection distributed by COVAX will likely need WHO approval. COVAX does not have any supplies of the two vaccines that appear to be most effective so far — the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and the Moderna one. The United Kingdom has already begun giving the Pfizer vaccine, and the United States and Canada are rolling it out this week. Some Gulf countries have also authorized it.Still, GAVI said they “aim to start rolling out safe and effective vaccines to COVAX (member countries) at scale within the first and second quarters of the New Year.”Even with vaccines in hand, the rollouts will take many months, even in rich countries, and many developing ones are facing serious logistical challenges that will add to delays, noted Dr. Gagandeep Kang, an infectious diseases expert at the Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India.Even senior officials at the WHO have acknowledged privately that attempts to fairly allocate vaccine through the initiative are flawed, despite publicly lauding its success.“The whole call for global solidarity has mostly been lost,” said Dr. Katherine O’Brien, WHO’s vaccines chief, during a recent internal discussion, a recording of which was obtained by the AP.Asked to clarify her remarks, O’Brien said in an email that “every country should have access to Covid-19 vaccines, as early as feasible.”Adding to COVAX’s difficulties, O’Brien noted at a news conference this month that it was still $5 billion short to buy the doses it’s planning to obtain next year.According to a report GAVI issued ahead of a meeting this week, the alliance itself concluded that the risk COVAX will fail is “very high,” saying it was “established in record time and has to navigate unchartered territory.”But John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, criticized Western countries for buying up the global vaccine supply “in excess of their needs while we in Africa are still struggling with the COVAX (effort).”With no certainty about which shots would work, governments scrambled in recent months to sign multiple deals to ensure their citizens would have at least some Covid-19 injections. Canada, for example, bought nearly 200 million vaccines — enough to cover its population of 38 million about five times over.Nkengasong called the idea that people in rich countries would get immunized while Africans go without “a moral issue.”Beyond the ethics, experts note that failing to protect people in the developing world will leave a reservoir of coronavirus that could spark new outbreaks at any time.Amid fears COVAX can’t deliver, some developing countries are pulling out entirely or seeking their own private deals. Earlier this month, the tiny Pacific island nation of Palau announced it was abandoning the initiative and would get donated vaccines from the U.S. instead. Other low and middle-income countries, including Malaysia, Peru, and Bangladesh, have stayed in the initiative but also recently inked their own deals with drugmakers as a Plan B.Anban Pillay of the South African Ministry of Health said that joining COVAX was just a stop-gap measure before signing bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies.Kate Elder, vaccines policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders, said “it’s increasingly looking like the ship has sailed on equitable vaccine distribution” — and GAVI, WHO and others need to discuss how to increase vaccine manufacturing.To that end, South Africa and India have asked the World Trade Organization (WTO) to waive some provisions regulating intellectual property rights to make it easier for manufacturers in poor countries to make Covid-19 drugs and vaccines. But many rich countries are reluctant to do that.As more countries in the West authorize the vaccine, “the difference between people in rich countries getting vaccinated and the lack of any vaccines for the developing world will become quite stark,” said Anna Marriott, health policy manager at Oxfam. “And it will only prolong the pandemic.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poor-countries-face-long-wait-for-vaccines-despite-promises/story-wcJQ5xkFIotslF5v2JIscN.html
15-12-2020||World||Australian PM says China coal ban would breach WTO rules||Australia’s prime minister said Tuesday that China would be violating World Trade Organization rules and a bilateral free trade agreement if it banned Australian coal.Prime Minister Scott Morrison was replying to a report in China’s state-owned Global Times newspaper that said Beijing’s main planning agency had given power plants approval to import coal without restrictions, except for Australian coal.Morrison said he was treating the report as “media speculation” because the Chinese government had yet to clarify its position.“If that were the case, then that would obviously be in breach of WTO rules,” Morrison told reporters. “It would be obviously in breach of our free trade agreement and so we would hope that’s certainly not the case.”China has targeted various Australian exports as relations with the country have deteriorated after Australia called for an independent inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic.Asked about the report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin gave no specifics but said China had “recently taken measures against some imported Australian products in accordance with law and regulations.”China has consistently said Australia is entirely responsible for disruptions in economic and political ties motivated by what it sees as anti-Chinese bias among Australian politicians, civic leaders and media outlets.Wang said China would “never accept” accusations of unfair trade practices, and accused Australia of having politicized bilateral exchanges in trade, investment, science and technology, while targeting Chinese companies with increased security checks on investments.“We hope that the Australian side will reflect on itself, be consistent with its words and actions, and effectively provide good conditions and atmosphere for China-Australia practical cooperation in various fields, rather than the other way around,” Wang told reporters at a daily briefing.China’s pique has pitted Australia’s most important trading relationship against its alliance with the US, which has rolled out increasingly harsh measures against Beijing over trade, technology and human rights.Beijing’s grievances against Australia range from accusations of Chinese meddling in Australian politics to the barring of tech giant Huawei and the government’s push for an independent investigation into the pandemic that is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Coal and iron ore, Australia’s most lucrative exports, appear to have suffered due to Chinese barriers, while wine, lumber and other products have also seen their Chinese markets reduced.Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said Australia was close to finalizing a complaint to the World Trade Organization over Chinese tariffs imposed on barley.“We see these reports and obviously are deeply troubled by them,” Birmingham told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. referring to the reported coal import ban.“They, if true, would indicate discriminatory trade practices being deployed by Chinese authorities and we would urge them to rule that out swiftly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-says-china-coal-ban-would-breach-wto-rules/story-OnMgTD3dfvRcR9g7Zv0MpK.html
15-12-2020||World||Covid-19 update: New variant of virus detected in London, doctors observe deadly fungal infection in patients||With nearly a year into the pandemic, the world is still reeling under the impact of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as it continues to infect thousands across the countries. In the United Kingdom, strictest restrictions were placed on Monday as the cases continue to grow in record numbers. In the United States, meanwhile, Pfizer Inc and partners delivered the first vaccines to 141 of 145 locations targeted by the US government for the first day of a nationwide rollout on Monday. Singapore became the first Asian country to approve the Pfizer vaccine and said it expects to start receiving shots by the end of the year. In India, the number of daily coronavirus cases dropped to lowest since July 6 as it recorded 22,065 fresh cases of the deadly virus. In Italy, the government is considering stringent nationwide restrictions as the Christmas holidays near. Here are the latest update in the Covid-19 pandemic:1) A new variant of coronavirus has been identified in London which is said to be responsible for the spike in cases. It was initially detected in southeast England, where the cases are now rising the fastest. However, there is no scientific evidence that the variant is more dangerous or infectious. “The variant may or may not be contributing to that,” Whitty said at a press conference, adding: “We don’t know what’s cause and effect,” England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on Monday as he cautioned against blaming it for the spike. 2) The World Health Organisation (WHO) also confirmed the new variant of Covid-19; the world health body said that it is aware of a genetic variant of the virus identified in about 1,000 individuals in the UK. During a press conference on Monday, WHO executive director Michael Ryan said, “This virus evolves and changes over time, and we’ve seen different variants emerge.” The WHO is working with an international laboratory network to see if the variant is becoming more prevalent internationally.3) In India, doctors from a Delhi hospital observed an increase in cases of a rare fungal infection in recovering coronavirus patients. As per hospital authorities, the deadly infection which if not detected early, can kill half the patients and lead to loss of vision or jaw in others, was triggered by Covid-19. In the last 15 days, ENT surgeons at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) have seen 13 cases of “Covid-19-triggered mucormycosis (Black fungus)”.4) A group of researchers in France have found that dogs can sniff out Covid-19 and identify patients including the asymptomatic ones. In the preliminary study in PLoS One and conducted in March, dogs who sniffed swab samples of armpit sweat could tell which samples came from Covid-19 patients and which were from people who tested negative for the new coronavirus. Dogs can identify infected individuals with 85% to 100% accuracy and rule out infection with 92% to 99% accuracy, news agency Reuters reported quoting Dominique Grandjean of Alfort Veterinary School in France.5) Singapore became the first Asian country to approve Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine and said it expects to start receiving shots by the end of the year. The government also said that it expects to have secured enough vaccines for everyone by the third quarter of next year.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-new-variant-of-virus-detected-in-london-doctors-observe-deadly-fungal-infection-in-patients/story-qTtzmM4mcVItHZhmDrkEPP.html
15-12-2020||World||A decade later, Arab Spring legacy lost in wars, repression||Was it real?It’s all been erased so completely, so much blood has been shed and destruction wreaked over the past decade. The idea that there was a moment when millions across the Middle East wanted freedom and change so much that they took to the streets seems like romantic nostalgia.“It was very brief, man. It was so brief,” said Badr Elbendary, an Egyptian activist.Elbendary was blinded on the third day of his country’s revolt in 2011, when security forces shot him in the face during clashes with protesters. Today, he’s in the United States. He can’t return home. Many of his comrades from the protests languish in prisons in Egypt.In December 2010, the uprising began in Tunisia and quickly spread from country to country in revolts against longtime authoritarian rulers. It became known as the Arab Spring, but for those who took to the streets, the call was “revolution.”The uprisings were about more than just removing autocrats. At their heart, they were a mass demand by the public for better governance and economies, rule of law, greater rights and, most of all, a voice in how their countries are run.For a time after 2011, the surge toward those dreams seemed irreversible. Now they are further than ever. Those who keep the faith are convinced that yearning was real and remains — or is even growing as people across the Arab world struggle with worsening economies and heavier repression. Eventually, they say, it will emerge again.“We have lowered our dreams,” said Amani Ballour, a Syrian doctor who ran an underground clinic treating casualties in the opposition enclave of Ghouta outside Damascus until it collapsed under a brutal siege by Syrian government forces in 2018. She has since left the country.“The spirit of the demonstrations may be over for now ... But all those who suffered from the war, from the regime’s repression, they won’t put up with it,” she said from Germany. “Even in the areas controlled by the regime, there is great frustration and anger building up among the people.”“Eventually” could be years.The region is traumatized by its most destructive decade of the modern era, perhaps the most destructive in centuries.Across Syria, Yemen, and Iraq, millions have lost their homes in war. Armed factions have proliferated in those countries and Libya. Poverty rates have risen around the region, especially with the coronavirus pandemic.Activists and analysts have had a decade to pore over why it went wrong.Secular liberals failed to present a cohesive front. Islamists like the Muslim Brotherhood overplayed their hand. Labor organizations, neutered by autocratic rule, couldn’t step up as a powerful mobilizer.The United States and Europe were muddled in their responses, torn between their rhetoric about backing democracy and their interest in stability and worries about Islamists. In the end, they largely listened to the latter.Gulf monarchies used oil wealth to smother any revolutionary tide and back reactionary powers. Russia, Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates waded into the region’s wars with military forces and arms for allies.Ultimately, few expected just how wide some leaders were willing to throw open the gates of Hell to keep power.Syria’s Bashar Assad proved the most ruthless. Faced with armed rebellion, he and his Russian and Iranian allies decimated cities, and he used chemical weapons on his own people, clawing back Syria’s heartland.After he was ousted in 2011, Yemen’s strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh tried to regain power by allying with the Iranian-backed Shiite Houthi rebels. Together, they captured the capital and Yemen’s north. The resulting civil war has been catastrophic, killing tens of thousands and pushing the population toward starvation in the world’s worst ongoing humanitarian disaster.In Libya, the US and European countries retreated from involvement after their bombardment helped bring down Moammar Gadhafi. The oil-rich Mediterranean nation promptly collapsed into a constantly shape-shifting civil war. Over the years, it has involved the many local militias, units of the old national army, al-Qaida, the Islamic State group, Russian mercenaries, and Turkish-backed Syrian fighters, with at least two — at one point three — rival claimant governments.Syria’s civil war gave the Islamic State group a theater in which to build strength. From there it burst out to overrun a swath of Syria and Iraq, opening up yet another war that wreaked destruction in Iraq.In Egypt, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi often points to the wreckage around the region to bolster one of his key claims to legitimacy — “without me, chaos.” He often says stability is needed while he reshapes the economy, an argument that resonates among many Egyptians.After crushing the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamists, his government has arrested secular activists and others, often bringing them before terrorism court.Still, uprisings erupt in the region, pointing to how the ambitions of the 2011 revolts still echo.Massive protests demanding the ouster of ruling elites spread around Lebanon and Iraq in late 2019 and early 2020. In Sudan, protesters forced out autocrat Omar al-Bashir, then tried to dislodge the military from power as well, with only partial success.“Change is not overnight. I don’t want to be all wonky and say the French Revolution took decades, but it did. It doesn’t happen over a year or two,” said Ramy Yaacoub, who was involved in Egypt’s protests and post-revolution politics during the heady days after Hosni Mubarak’s fall. He founded and now heads the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Studies in Washington.Some activists have turned to improving themselves, studying and building skills, keeping away despair.Elbendary, who has regained partial sight in one eye, has been doing consulting work on community organizing, policy research, independent media development and conflict resolution around the region.It’s a generational conflict, he said, and the hope lies with a generation gaining knowledge that can one day benefit their homelands.But when?Several years at the most optimistic, he said — not for real change, “for a slight opening, a slight margin where we can breathe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-decade-later-arab-spring-legacy-lost-in-wars-repression/story-8MclI7iV7huM7pTqRB4xQL.html
15-12-2020||World||UK unemployment rate highest since 2016 as pandemic impact worsens||UK unemployment surged in the three months through October, exposing the brutal impact of the coronavirus on the economy.The figures will revive criticism that Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak acted too late when he expanded programs to support jobs and businesses hit by the worst downturn in 300 years. Many firms had already taken the decision to axe jobs.The number of people looking for work jumped surged by 241,000 in the period, taking the jobless rate to 4.9%, the highest since 2016, the Office for National Statistics said Tuesday.It followed an increase of 243,000 in the third quarter, a rise last seen in the financial crisis of 2009. Job cuts, known as redundancies in the UK, increased by a record 217,000 through October, while the number of people on payrolls was 819,000 below pre-pandemic levels in November.The government expects the jobless rate to rise to 7.5%, and a potential no-deal exit from the European Union’s single market will make it even harder for the economy to bounce back.Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc is cutting more than 5,000 jobs this year as reduced air travel hammers its aerospace engine business. Heathrow Airport, Britain’s busiest, says it’s trying to avoid reducing staff by implementing wage cuts, prompting more than 1,000 employees to go on strike earlier this month.The Bank of England also added stimulus in November, increasing its bond-buying program by 150 billion pounds ($198 billion) and predicting contraction in the fourth quarter. Its next policy announcement is due Thursday.Since October, the emergence of vaccines for the virus have raised hopes that the UK economy can start getting back to normal in 2021, albeit with new barriers to trade from Brexit.Bloomberg Economics now sees unemployment peaking at 7% next year, instead of 7.3%. Nevertheless, the Confederation of British Industry doesn’t see output returning to pre-pandemic levels until the following year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-unemployment-rate-highest-since-2016-as-pandemic-impact-worsens/story-Ui1vSQ1fFcylbemCChO5gJ.html

Various testimonies surfacing from the non-Chinese world reveal that Beijing has in fact intensified its operations against Uyghurs by putting more people in internment camps during the pandemic times.In fact, the Uyghur Muslims in Chinese “re-education” camps are forced to eat pork every Friday, confirmed Sayragul Sautbay, who was one of the victims of the atrocities being committed by the Chinese government.Answering to a question of Schmitt regarding effects of coronavirus on churches, synagogues, worship places, which have been closed or shut down and how repressive regimes like China is using the situation to their benefit in suppressing Uyghurs, Pompeo upheld religious freedom as one of the fundamental rights.“I am incredibly proud of the work we have done on religious freedom. It’s this most fundamental right, this human right that - from which all others flow. If you get religious freedom rights and tolerance for people of faith, so many good things happen in your country. So we’ve worked on this - is so we’ve worked hard on religious freedom,” remarked Pompeo.He also rued the fact that leaders across the world are opening bars and casinos but places of worship were still not permitted to open.“It’s very discouraging to see leaders use an excuse of the coronavirus to allow bars and casinos to be open, but not permit places of worship, people to gather around their faith,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-slams-china-s-treatment-of-uyghurs-compares-it-to-nazi-germany/story-YGYwO20OXrsdP3pzhMFgXP.html
15-12-2020||World||Japan’s ‘Twitter killer’ given death penalty for nine murders||A Japanese man dubbed the “Twitter killer” was sentenced to death by a Tokyo court Tuesday for murdering and dismembering nine people he met online.Takahiro Shiraishi, 30, admitted killing and butchering his young victims -- all but one of whom were women -- who he met on the social media platform.His lawyers had argued he should receive a prison sentence because his victims, aged between 15 and 26, expressed suicidal thoughts on social media and so had consented to death.But on Tuesday “the death sentence was handed down” to Shiraishi, a court official told AFP.“None of the nine victims consented to be killed, including silent consent,” the judge said, according to public broadcaster NHK.“It is extremely grave that the lives of nine young people were taken away. The dignity of the victims was trampled upon,” the judge reportedly added.NHK said 435 people turned up to watch the verdict, even though the court only had 16 seats available for the public.Shiraishi used Twitter to contact users who posted about taking their own lives, telling them he could help them in their plans -- or even die alongside them.The father of one 25-year-old victim said in court last month that he “will never forgive Shiraishi even if he dies”, NHK reported at the time.“Even now, when I see a woman of my daughter’s age, I mistake her for my daughter. This pain will never go away. Give her back to me!” he said.Japan is one of few developed nations to retain the death penalty, and public support for it remains high.Years usually pass between sentencing and execution, and the last execution was in December 2019, when a Chinese man was hanged for the murder of a family of four.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-twitter-killer-given-death-penalty-for-nine-murders/story-mx47GBPFSJweAC9wqbzLhL.html
15-12-2020||World||Hong Kong becoming another Chinese-run communist city, says Mike Pompeo||Hong Kong is becoming just another Chinese-run communist city, US State Secretary Michael Pompeo said on Monday, adding that the United States has challenged the imprisonment of Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai under the National Security Law. Jimmy, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail on Saturday, after being charged with the draconian National Security Law.Lai was handcuffed and chained around the waist while being escorted to court earlier today, South China Morning Post reported.He is expected to spend the coming four months in detention while police comb through his social media posts and examine his overseas visits to gather evidence.Calling Jimmy Lai a “true patriot”, Pompeo said: “He cares deeply about the people of Hong Kong, as does our administration. This is another example where General Secretary Xi Jinping broke a promise. He made a 50-year commitment for freedom for the people of Hong Kong and he’s now bashed it. He’s now taken it away with his national security law that caused the imprisonment of Jimmy Lai, who was simply trying to speak about the basic rights for the people of Hong Kong.”In an interview with Newsmax, Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party cannot be trusted.“I fear that Hong Kong is becoming just another Chinese-run communist city, and that’s too bad. It’s inconsistent with what Xi Jinping had promised and it’s another example of the fact that you simply can’t trust with the Chinese Communist Party says. You have to verify every single thing that they assert,” he said. In August 2020, Jimmy was arrested under the new National Security Law.The charge stems from comments Lai purportedly made on Twitter and in interviews asking foreign countries to sanction the city.This comes after a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers were arrested in the month of October over protests after the draconian National Security Law was imposed on the city by Beijing.The law criminalizes secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces and carries with it strict prison terms. It came into effect from July 1.Several of those disqualified were sitting lawmakers, who were subsequently ejected from the parliament by Beijing overruling constitutional precedent and bypassing Hong Kong’s courts on November 11, sparking the mass resignation of the entire pro-democratic camp.

15-12-2020||World||New York governor Andrew Cuomo denies former aide’s sexual harassment allegations||New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday denied a former aide’s allegations over the weekend that he sexually harassed her by making inappropriate comments about her appearance.Cuomo told reporters the claims that former economic adviser Lindsey Boylan made in a series of tweets Sunday were “not true.”“I fought for and I believe a woman has the right to come forward and express her opinion and express issues and concerns that she has,” the 63-year-old Democratic governor said, making his first comments on the allegations. “But it’s just not true.”Cuomo’s press secretary previously denied the claims on his behalf.Boylan, who is running for Manhattan borough president, tweeted that Cuomo “sexually harassed me for years.” She added that “many saw it, and watched.”“I could never anticipate what to expect: would I be grilled on my work (which was very good) or harassed about my looks. Or would it be both in the same conversation? This was the way for years,” she continued.Boylan, 36, worked for the Cuomo administration from March 2015 to October 2018, serving first as executive vice president of Empire State Development and then as a special adviser to Cuomo for economic development.Earlier this month, Boylan tweeted that working in Cuomo’s administration was the worst job she ever had, calling the environment “beyond toxic.”Personnel memos written in 2018 and obtained by The Associated Press indicated that Boylan resigned after she was confronted about complaints about her own office behavior.Boylan did not provide details of Cuomo’s alleged harassment and didn’t respond to messages from The Associated Press.Boylan tweeted Sunday, “To be clear: I have no interest in talking to journalists. I am about validating the experience of countless women and making sure abuse stops.”Cuomo didn’t answer when asked Monday if he remembered instances where he commented on Boylan’s looks, instead reiterating that he denied her allegations.“On the tweets, I totally respect a woman’s right — fought for a woman’s right to express any concern, any issue she has in the workplace. I support that. But the tweets were simply not true.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-denies-former-aide-s-sexual-harassment-allegations/story-g40ObmZZFL9v3AUYWyB1HK.html
15-12-2020||World||Boko Haram claims kidnapping of hundreds of Nigerian students||Jihadist group Boko Haram on Tuesday claimed responsibility for the abduction of hundreds of school students in northwest Nigeria.“I am Abubakar Shekau and our brothers are behind the kidnapping in Katsina,” said the leader of the group behind the 2014 abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls in Chibok, in a voice message. At least 333 students are still missing since the attack late Friday on the all-boys Government Science Secondary School in northwestern Katsina state.The attack was initially blamed on armed groups locally known as “bandits”, who are active in the unstable region where kidnappings for ransom are common.The army said Monday it had located the hideout of the men, and that a military operation was under way.More than 100 gunmen on motorcycles stormed the rural school north of Kankara town, forcing students to flee and hide in the surrounding bush.A number of boys were able to escape, but many were captured, split into groups and taken away, residents told AFP.The kidnappings occurred in the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari, who condemned the attack and ordered security stepped up in schools, with those in Katsina state closed.Tuesday’s claim of responsibility marks a major turning point in the advance of jihadist groups in northwest Nigeria.Boko Haram, and a splinter group the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), are waging an insurgency in Nigeria northeast and are thought to have only a minor presence in the northwest.But concerns have grown of jihadist inroads into the region, especially after fighters claiming to be in the northwest released a 2020 propaganda video pledging allegiance to Boko Haram’s leader.Buhari has made the fight against the group a priority, but the security situation in northern Nigeria has deteriorated since his 2015 election.#BringBackOurBoys has been trending on social media since the weekend -- a reference to a similar hashtag used after the girls’ 2014 abduction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boko-haram-claims-kidnapping-of-hundreds-of-nigerian-students/story-mZ4DT1E8UeYqFTRsS5SYKP.html
15-12-2020||World||Optimism in Canada as 89-year-old Quebecer is first to get vaccinated for Covid-19||An 89-year-old resident of a long-term care home in the province of Quebec became the first Canadian to receive a Covid-19 vaccine shot as the country is among the first in the world to roll out its coronavirus vaccination programme.Gisèle Lévesque received the Pfizer-BioNTech jab in Quebec City and was applauded by a small group of health care workers who had gathered to mark the moment. Elderly and infirm residents of such facilities have been the most vulnerable demographic in Canada during the coronavirus pandemic.Lévesque was followed by Anita Quidangen, a health care worker in Toronto, the first person in Ontario to get the injection.The beginning of the historic vaccination programme was greeted by Anita Anand, Canada’s minister of public services and procurement, who tweeted, “Today, Canada is receiving 30K doses of the authorised Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.”That initial shipment of 30,000 is part of the first installment of 249,000 that will arrive in Canada in the days to follow as Anand said they will be available by December 31, with millions more doses expected by the end of the first quarter of 2021.The start of the vaccination has also led to a sharp rise in the number of Canadians “willing to be immunised against Covid-19 as soon as a vaccine is available to them”, according to the non-profit public polling agency Angus Reid Institute.About 48% of Canadians now want to be vaccinated immediately, an increase of 8% over last month, indicating that scepticism is gradually eroding as reports of vaccinations in the UK and the US come in along with announcements of the jabs being available in Canada.But the agency noted that “while more in this country express a desire for inoculation sooner rather than later, the number of those who say they will not get a vaccine has remained static at roughly one-in-seven”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/optimism-in-canada-as-first-quebecers-get-vaccinated-for-covid-19/story-8zuI1s8t8i8iKFpcPllGfM.html
15-12-2020||World||California subpoenas Amazon over worker safety in Covid-19 pandemic||California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has asked a judge to order Amazon to comply with subpoenas his office issued nearly four months ago as part of an investigation into how the company protects workers from the coronavirus.Becerra said on Monday the online sales giant hasn’t provided enough information on its safety steps and the status of infections and deaths at its shipping facilities across California. The attorney general is President-elect Joe Biden’s pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department; he’d be the first Latino in the post.“We’re investigating because we got reports, information, complaints about conditions, incidents,” Becerra said. “We believe that it merits looking into Amazon’s protocols, practices, based on information that we have received.” The court filing from Becerra lists media reports about three Amazon workers’ deaths but said the company mentioned none of them in its responses. It says he learned more about the company’s infection rate from its blog posts than from its subpoena responses.The company did not respond to a request for comment left through an email provided for reporters. Amazon said in a statement to The Sacramento Bee that it is “a leader in providing Covid-19 safety measures for our employees — we’ve invested billions of dollars in equipment and technology, including building on-site testing for employees and providing personal protective equipment. We encourage anyone to compare our speed and actions in this area to any other major employer.” Becerra wants a Sacramento County Superior Court judge to find that the company hasn’t given specific details on its coronavirus prevention efforts in response to subpoenas issued Aug. 19, including its sick leave policies and cleaning procedures. He also wants access to the company’s raw data on the number of infections and deaths at its facilities in California.“We urgently need to know about complaints made by Amazon associates to the company about working conditions, potential retaliation taken against employees who raise these workplace safety concerns,” he said. “We don’t have time to drag our feet ... our state finds itself in the thick of this pandemic.” His office wants to know which facilities have the highest infection rates, how the company defines which employees have been diagnosed with the virus, any contacts it has had with health officials, and documents related to any lawsuits or investigations by individuals or other agencies.Becerra routinely declines to comment on ongoing investigations but called a virtual news conference to criticize Amazon for making billions of dollars during the pandemic as consumers increasingly turn to online purchases over brick-and-mortar stores — profits that he said are built on the labor of employees who put themselves at risk.The company projects sales will top USD 100 billion in the final quarter of 2020, and in the third quarter, “its revenues soared while its profits tripled compared to 2019,” Becerra said.“While Amazon continues to operate profitably, it has been less than forthcoming about its operations and its practices to protect its workers,” he said.The attorney general said the subpoenas followed months of informal communications with the company over its health and safety policies.The company has missed several chances to comply, Becerra said, but he has made no decision on whether its practices are adequate — in part because he has not received enough information from the company.The probe began last spring, his office said in seeking the court order, and officials first sent Amazon a letter in May seeking information.Cal-OSHA, more formally known as the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, and the San Francisco Department of Public Health also have launched investigations. Officials in other states also are investigating Amazon workers’ complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-subpoenas-amazon-over-worker-safety-in-covid-19-pandemic/story-yrb9aEy0BQzgQE2H0ets2H.html

More than 40% of citizens were placed in the highest risk category.However London, whose 9 million people and world-leading financial centre make it the engine of the British economy, was initially left in the middle tier of restrictions.Tussle over SchoolsThe main difference between the top alert levels is that bars and restaurants, which can stay open under certain conditions in Tier 2, must close their doors in Tier 3 and can only operate takeaway services.There are also additional curbs on socialising in Tier 3, but workplaces and schools are told to remain open.Three local councils in the capital - Greenwich, Islington and Waltham Forest - unilaterally instructed schools in their boroughs to close, but were overruled by the national government which ordered that schools should remain open.The tussle between local and central authorities reflected the tensions and complexities involved in attempting to bring the virus under control whilst protecting certain aspects of life deemed vitally important, such as children’s education.Schools were closed to most pupils for several months during the first wave of the pandemic, when there was a strict national lockdown. Since they reopened in September, the government has emphasised it wanted children in school as much as possible.For other parts of London’s social fabric, especially pubs, restaurants and cafes that have been hard-hit since the start of the pandemic, the move into Tier 3 was expected to cause further hardship.“Moving into Tier 3 before Christmas will be deeply disappointing for Londoners, and a terrible blow to the capital’s hospitality, leisure and cultural sectors,” said John Dickie, director of Strategy and Policy at business campaign group London First.MutationsThe Tier 3 restrictions will come into force in the capital from 0001 GMT on Wednesday. England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said the detection of the new variant was not the reason for the decision to put London in Tier 3 - the reason was the sharp rise in infections.He said there was no evidence that the clinical outcome was different for the new variant.“There are many variants. It just happens that this one has quite a few more mutations than some of the other variants, so that’s the reason why we’ve taken it particularly seriously,” Whitty said during a news conference with Hancock.The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that Britain had reported the variant, but added that mutations were not uncommon, a view echoed by several other experts.Martin Hibberd, professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said the reports were “not surprising and it was too early to say how important it is yet,” adding it was believed that one previous mutation had let the virus to spread more easily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tighter-covid-19-restrictions-imposed-in-london-as-coronavirus-infections-surge/story-mV2x0YPOfI3g66U6Py5atN.html
15-12-2020||World||Joe Biden slams Donald Trump after securing electoral college vote; William Barr quits||US President-elect Joe Biden on Monday called upon the country to “turn the page” in a victory speech after the electoral college voted to reaffirm his 2020 White House win. He also went on to express rare outrage and impatience with President Donald Trump and his allies’ “assault on democracy” for their refusal to acknowledge his defeat. Shortly after the vote, William Barr, the once loyal attorney general who later disputed Trump’s election fraud claims, resigned, ending a souring relationship.Biden formally won 306 electoral college votes as electors voted in state capitals around the country either virtually or in person, fulfilling a pro forma responsibility that wouldn’t have received so much public attention but for Trump’s refusal to acknowledge his defeat. Trump expectedly won 232.ALSO WATCH | ‘Democracy prevailed’: Joe Biden after electoral college affirms his victory “If anyone didn’t know it before, we know it now. What beats deep in the hearts of the American people is this – democracy,” Biden said in remarks from Wilmington, Delaware. “And so, now it is time to turn the page, to unite, to heal.”Biden had been publicly patient with Trump’s constant efforts to question and overturn the election result, giving the president time to come to terms with his defeat. He had extended the same understanding to Republican lawmakers, a majority of whom have also not acknowledged Biden’s victory fearing Trump’s wrath.The dam broke on Monday, though. Biden ripped into Trump, mentioning him by name more times than he has before in any speech after winning the election, and also the Republicans, accusing them of launching an “unprecedented assault on democracy”. Biden listed out Trump’s efforts — the legal challenges that were heard and rejected by 80 judges around the country, including the Supreme Court, the multiple recounts, and the political pressure on elected Republican officials and election officials.“Every avenue was made available to President Trump to contest the results,” Biden said. “Respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy – even when we find those results hard to accept. But that is the obligation of those who have taken a sworn duty to uphold our constitution.”Biden became the “projected” winner of the election in the week of November 3, when polling closed. He was then “officially” the winner on December 8 when all 50 states and Washington, DC “certified” the election result setting up the electoral college vote for December 14. The electoral college votes cast on Monday will be counted by the House of Representatives on January 6, another formality elevated to prominence. Trump allies in the House expect to use that part of the process to try to overturn the election one last time. They will fail, as they have so far, and the president-elect will be sworn in on January 20.Shortly after the electoral college vote became clear in the evening, Trump announced the departure of Barr, who has publicly disputed Trump’s poll fraud claims, saying his department had found no evidence of irregularities of the scale that could change the outcome of the election.Barr’s exit had been imminent since his public break with the president. But instead of being hounded out of office like his predecessor Jeff Sessions, Barr managed a carefully choreographed exit that appeared amicable. So much so that Trump tweeted out Barr’s resignation letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-slams-donald-trump-after-securing-electoral-college-vote-william-barr-quits/story-iX2i3zUsko4sm40jtXmpJN.html
15-12-2020||World||US formally blames Iran for abduction, death of ex-FBI agent Robert Levinson||The Trump administration for the first time on Monday formally blamed Iran for the presumed death of retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, publicly identifying two Iranian intelligence officers believed responsible for his abduction and imposing sanctions against them.Levinson disappeared in Iran under mysterious circumstances more than a decade ago, and though U.S. diplomats and investigators have long said they thought he was taken by Iranian government agents, Monday’s announcement in the final weeks of the Trump administration was the most definitive assignment of blame to date.The announcement is the latest in a series of tough actions the Trump administration has taken toward Iran as it works to cement an aggressive posture that may complicate any efforts by incoming President Joe Biden and his national security team to radically change course once they take office next month. U.S. officials pre-emptively made clear Monday that no deal with Iran should be finalized without providing for the release of Americans who remain detained there.Besides calling out two high-ranking intelligence officers by name, U.S. officials also said the Iranian regime sanctioned the plot that led to Levinson’s abduction and lied for years about its involvement in his disappearance through disinformation campaigns aimed at deflecting responsibility and covering up the government’s role.“The abduction of Mr. Levinson in Iran is an outrageous example of the Iranian regime’s willingness to commit unjust acts,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.The Iranian intelligence officers, Mohammad Baseri and Ahmad Khazai, are alleged to have been involved in Levinson’s abduction and probable death. Under the sanctions, any property or assets they hold in the United States would be frozen. Though it’s unlikely they have bank accounts in the U.S., the sanctions could also limit their movements or financial dealing outside Iran. The men have met with intelligence officials from other countries and also led delegations, U.S. officials say.There was no immediate reaction in Iranian state media Monday night to the announcement.In a statement, the Levinson family thanked Trump administration officials and called Monday’s announcement “just one step in a long road toward achieving justice for him, but it is an important one.”“Robert Levinson will never come home to his family alive because of the cruel, cynical and inhumane actions of the Iranian authorities,” the family said. “Because of these men and others like them, our wonderful husband, father and grandfather died alone, thousands of miles from everyone he loved.”Monday’s announcement is the latest aggressive Trump administration action against Iran since the president two years ago withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, a signature foreign policy achievement of predecessor Barack Obama.Since then, the Trump administration has steadily ramped up pressure on Iran, re-imposing a wide swath of sanctions and taking other actions, including killing the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in a drone strike at the airport in Baghdad this year.That move, coupled with retaliatory attacks against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, stepped-up sanctions against Iranian proxies in Lebanon and Yemen and the recent killing of an Iranian nuclear scientist outside of Tehran that has been attributed to Israel, have left the impression that Trump is seeking to box in Biden when he takes office in January.Biden has said he wants to reenter the 2015 nuclear deal but also improve and expand on it. Those prospects may prove difficult to realize if the situation escalates in the next five weeks.Officials said they were announcing sanctions now, one month before Trump leaves office, not for any political reasons but simply because they had finally accumulated enough information to formally hold Iran accountable. They also said that no agreement with Iran should be reached in the next administration without a deal to free three Americans who they said remain imprisoned there.The announcement comes nine months after U.S. officials revealed that they had concluded that Levinson “may have passed some time ago” though they did not disclose at the time the information that led to that assessment. Officials on Monday would not describe any additional intelligence, except to say that all evidence they had pointed in the direction of Levinson having died in captivity.Levinson vanished on March 9, 2007, when he was scheduled to meet a source on the Iranian island of Kish. For years, U.S. officials would say only that Levinson was working independently on a private investigation. But a 2013 Associated Press investigation revealed that Levinson had been sent on a mission by CIA analysts who had no authority to run such an operation. He would be 72 years old now.FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement that “this situation is personal because Bob served as a special agent for 22 years and will always be a part of the FBI family.”The family received a video in late 2010 as well as proof-of-life photographs in 2011 in which he appeared disheveled with a long beard and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit like those given to detainees at the Guantanamo Bay prison. Even then, his whereabouts and fate were not known, and the Iran government has consistently denied having any information about Levinson.Earlier this year, a federal judge in Washington held Iran liable for his disappearance, saying the country was “in no uncertain terms” responsible for Levinson’s “hostage taking and torture.”____Associated Press writers Matthew Lee in Washington and Jon Gambrell in Dubai contributed to this report.Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-formally-blames-iran-for-abduction-death-of-ex-fbi-agent-robert-levinson/story-sQ7VZ7HNACIpcTpCB3x1QN.html
15-12-2020||World||Joe Biden says ‘democracy prevailed’ as he officially wins US presidential race||President-elect Joe Biden pointedly criticized President Donald Trump on Monday for threatening core principles of democracy even as he told Americans that their form of self-government ultimately “prevailed.”Also Read | Joe Biden clears 270-vote mark as electors affirm his victorySpeaking from his longtime home of Wilmington, Delaware, on the day that electors nationwide cast votes affirming his victory, Biden was blunt in critiquing the damage done by Trump’s baseless allegations that the contest was stolen. Such arguments have been roundly rejected by judges across the political spectrum, including the justices at the Supreme Court.Democracy, Biden said, has been “pushed, tested, threatened.” But he said it proved to be “resilient, true, and strong.”“The flame of democracy was lit in this nation a long time ago,” Biden said. “And we now know that nothing, not even a pandemic or an abuse of power, can extinguish that flame.”Biden and his team hope that the formal victory in the Electoral College combined with his record-setting 81 million-vote count will help the country unify and accept his presidency. But the challenge facing Biden was evident as many congressional Republicans, including some of the party’s top leaders, refused to officially accept Biden’s win. Trump, meanwhile, shows no sign of conceding.The president-elect acknowledged an irony in the circumstances, noting that he won with the same number of electoral votes — 306 — as Trump did four years ago. Trump hailed that win as a “landslide.”“By his own standards, these numbers represent a clear victory then, and I respectfully suggest they do so now,” Biden said.A candidate needs to win 270 electoral votes to clinch the presidency.The fact that Biden had to even give such a speech shortly after electors voted to make him the president — a usually routine and even mundane step — shows how extraordinary the post-election period has been, with Trump trying to thwart Biden at every turn.Despite that, Biden struck a familiar theme of his presidential campaign, pledging to be “a president for all Americans” who will “work just as hard for those of you who didn’t vote for me as I will for those who did.”“Now it is time to turn the page as we’ve done throughout our history,” he said. “To unite. To heal.”He said that was the only way the country could overcome the worst health crisis in more than a century, saying that in the face of the pandemic, “we need to work together, give each other a chance and lower the temperature.”Whether his message will have any effect remains to be seen. Top Republicans have mostly continued to back Trump and his unsubstantiated claims of a rigged election and, even once Biden takes power, are unlikely to give him any of the traditional honeymoon period.Biden recalled that one of his jobs as vice president four years ago was to formally recognize Trump’s electoral victory in the Senate after 2016, and he said he expected the same process to occur this time — saluting the small number of GOP senators who have acknowledged his victory. But there are many other leading Republicans who have continued to side with Trump.And after losing dozens of legal challenges on the state and federal level, Trump is expected to push forward with new litigation this week. Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani says he expects five more lawsuits at the state level.Even after he takes the White House, Biden faces a narrowly divided Senate. Next month’s runoff elections in Georgia will decide which party controls the chamber. There’s also a thinned Democratic majority in the House as the GOP picked up seats even as Trump lost.Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is set to hold a hearing Wednesday on election “irregularities.” Johnson has questioned why Congress wasn’t informed that the taxes of Biden’s son Hunter were under federal investigation during Trump’s impeachment trial last year.The president was acquitted in a Senate trial that centered on Trump’s dealings with Ukraine’s president and on whether he abused his office by seeking an investigation into the Bidens. Hunter Biden served on the board of directors of a Ukrainian energy company.The younger Biden said in a statement last week that he just recently learned that he was under investigation. He also said he committed no wrongdoing.Biden’s deputy chief of staff, Jen O’Malley Dillon, downplayed the notion that the investigation could hamper Biden’s ability to pursue his agenda.“The president-elect himself has said this is not about his family or Donald Trump’s family,” O’Malley Dillon said. “It is about the American people’s families. And I think we’re going to continue to stay focused on the issues that are impacting their daily lives.”___Weissert reported from Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democracy-prevailed-biden-aims-to-unify-divided-nation/story-4woraODusaGUWLCHIL9sgL.html
15-12-2020||World||South Korea criminalizes sending anti-Kim leaflets to North Korea||South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s progressive camp passed legislation that criminalizes sending leaflets to North Korea, months after Kim Jong Un’s regime demanded action to stop the “human scum” behind the messages.Moon’s Democratic Party and its allies, who wield a supermajority in parliament since an election in April, passed the “anti-leaflet” bill late Monday on a mostly party-line vote. Backers have said the leaflets conflict with agreements between the two Koreas and cast a pall over negotiations with Pyongyang.Conservatives launched a filibuster trying to halt the legislation and human rights groups have argued that it limits constitutionally protected free speech. The main conservative opposition People Power Party has said it might challenge the law in the Constitutional Court.The bill calls for prison sentences of as long as three years for those convicted of sending leaflets across the border to North Korea. It also bans propaganda broadcasts and anti-Pyongyang material postings at the inter-Korean border.While millions of leaflets have been flown across the border for more than a decade, Pyongyang stepped up its pressure on Moon over the messages around June -- a little more than a month after reports on Kim’s health raised questions about his grip on power. Defector-led groups largely responsible for the leaflets often include cash, rice and USB memory sticks to entice North Koreans to retrieve the balloons.Kim Yo Jong, the North Korean leader’s sister, warned in June that Moon’s government would pay a “dear price” if it continued to allow “mongrel dogs” to send the leaflets. Shortly after, North Korea blew up a $15 million joint liaison office built by South Korea north of the border that served as a de facto embassy -- destroying one of the most tangible symbols of Moon’s rapprochement efforts.US President-elect Joe Biden is set to shake up relations with Kim Jong Un. Biden has said he wants to “jump start” a campaign with US allies and others for denuclearization, and move away from the personal diplomacy embraced by outgoing President Donald Trump and Moon, which led to high-profile summits but no tangible steps to wind down Kim’s nuclear program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-criminalizes-sending-anti-kim-leaflets-to-north-korea/story-65lmErtUZVYdumcX9Po54O.html

Does it allow the virus to transmit more easily? Does it in any way interfere with diagnostics? Would it in any way interfere with vaccine effectiveness? None of these questions have been addressed yet, and we have no information to suggest that any of that is the case,” Ryan remarked.During his appearance in parliament earlier in the day, Hancock also revealed that London will be moved into the country’s highest coronavirus disease alert level tier from Wednesday, amid a surge of new cases in the UK capital.The UK began its mass vaccination program, using a vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech, this past Tuesday.

15-12-2020||World||US Attorney General William Barr to leave White House before Christmas, tweets Donald Trump||Attorney General William Barr, one of President Donald Trump’s staunchest allies, is departing amid lingering tension over the president’s baseless claims of election fraud and the investigation into President-elect Joe Biden’s son.Barr went Monday to the White House, where Trump said the attorney general submitted his letter of resignation. “As per letter, Bill will be leaving just before Christmas to spend the holidays with his family,” Trump tweeted.Trump has publicly expressed his anger about Barr’s statement to The Associated Press earlier this month that the Justice Department had found no widespread fraud that would change the outcome of the election. Trump has also been angry that the Justice Department did not publicly announce it was investigating Hunter Biden ahead of the election, despite department policy against such a pronouncement.Barr told the AP that U.S. attorneys and FBI agents have been working to follow up specific complaints and information they’ve received, but “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.”Barr’s resignation leaves Trump without a critical ally as he winds down his final weeks in office, and it throws into question open Justice Department investigations, especially the probe into Hunter Biden’s taxes.In his resignation letter, Barr said he updated Trump Monday on the department’s “review of voter fraud allegations in the 2020 election and how these allegations will continue to be pursued.” He added that his last day on the job would be Dec. 23.Trump said Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen, whom he labeled “an outstanding person,” will become acting attorney general. As the current second in command at the Justice Department, Rosen’s appointment is not likely to change much in the final weeks before the administration departs.Trump spent much of the day watching the Electoral College tally and calling allies but broke away to meet with Barr. His tweet about the Attorney General’s exit was a sober message from a president who is notoriously cold to his departing staff and quick to name-call and deride them once they say they are leaving.Trump has also has previously claimed he fired staffers who resigned to make himself appear more powerful, and others, like former attorney general Jeff Sessions, were mocked by the president for weeks before they left office.But despite Trump’s obvious disdain for those who publicly disagree with him, Barr had generally remained in the president’s good graces and has been one of the president’s most ardent allies. Before the election, he had repeatedly raised the notion that mail-in voting could be especially vulnerable to fraud during the coronavirus pandemic as Americans feared going to polls.But Trump has a low tolerance for criticism, especially public criticism, from his allies and often fires back in kind. The two had been at odds in the past few months and Barr was said to have been frustrated by Trump’s tweeting.Trump said on Fox News over the weekend that he was disappointed that the Hunter Biden investigation had not been disclosed. Hunter Biden himself announced it last week.“Bill Barr should have stepped up,” Trump said.One senior administration official not authorized to speak publicly and speaking to The AP on condition of anonymity said Barr had resigned of his own accord and described the meeting as amicable.Barr, who was serving in his second stint as attorney general, sought to paint himself as an independent leader who would not bow to political pressure. But Democrats have repeatedly accused Barr of acting more like the president’s personal attorney than the attorney general, and Barr had proved to be a largely reliable Trump ally and defender of presidential power.Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Republican leader of the judiciary committee, told reporters at the Capitol he was surprised by the news.“I think he did an incredibly good job trying to repair damage done to the Department of Justice, trying to be fair and faithful to the law. I think he’s got a lot to be proud of,” Graham said. “He fought for the president where he could, as every attorney general and administration should, but he also didn’t cross lines that he shouldn’t have crossed.” He said he was referring to disclosing the Biden investigation.Graham also praised Rosen as a “good man” who he said would “be an ethical leader and a steady hand” at the Justice Department.Democrats who had long criticized Barr did not lament his departure. “Good riddance,” tweeted House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who said the attorney general had “lied to cover for Trump, launched political investigations, subverted justice and the rule of law and violently cracked down on protestors.”House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who led an investigation of politicization of the department, said that “whomever Joe Biden chooses as the new Attorney General will have a tremendous amount of work to do to repair the integrity of the Department of Justice.”Before releasing special counsel Robert Mueller’s full report on the Russia investigation last year, Barr framed the results in a manner favorable to Trump even though Mueller pointedly said he couldn’t exonerate the president of obstruction of justice.He also appointed as special counsel the U.S. attorney who is conducting a criminal investigation into the origins of the FBI’s probe of the 2016 election that morphed into Mueller’s investigation of possible Trump-Russia cooperation, following Trump’s repeated calls to “investigate the investigators.”Barr also ordered Justice Department prosecutors to review the handling of the federal investigation into Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn and then sought to dismiss the criminal charges against Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump later pardoned Flynn.Barr’s break from Trump over election fraud wasn’t the first. Earlier this year, Barr told ABC News that the president’s tweets about Justice Department cases “make it impossible for me to do my job,” and tensions flared just a few months ago when the two were increasingly at odds over the pace of the Durham investigation.Trump had been increasingly critical about a lack of arrests and Barr was privately telling people he was frustrated by Trump’s public pronouncements about the case.Trump was also said to blame Barr for comments from FBI Director Chris Wray on election fraud and mail-in voting that didn’t jibe with the president’s alarmist rhetoric.___Associated Press writers Colleen Long, Eric Tucker, Jonathan Lemire, Mary Clare Jalonick and Zeke Miller contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-attorney-general-william-barr-to-leave-white-house-before-christmas-tweets-donald-trump/story-q5yEa8wmk92lSEJ2cJXHQM.html
15-12-2020||World||Hackers breach US agencies, Homeland Security a reported target||The US Department of Homeland Security was the third federal department to be targeted in a major cyberattack, US media reported Monday, a day after Washington revealed the hack which may have been coordinated by a foreign government.The Washington Post cited unnamed officials who said that the DHS -- which is in charge of protecting the country from attacks both online and off -- had been added to a growing list of targets in the attack, including the Treasury and Commerce departments.A statement from DHS Monday did not confirm the report, saying only that it was “aware of cyber breaches across the federal government and working closely with our partners in the public and private sector on the federal response.”Also Read: US government agencies hacked; Russia a possible culpritThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is attached to the DHS, on Sunday said it had ordered federal agencies to immediately stop using SolarWinds Orion IT products following reports that hackers had used a recent update to gain access to internal communications. “We urge all our partners -- in the public and private sectors -- to assess their exposure to this compromise and to secure their networks,” said CISA Acting Director Brandon Wales.SolarWinds over the weekend admitted that hackers had exploited a backdoor in an update of some of its software released between March and June.The hacks are part of a wider campaign that also hit major cybersecurity firm FireEye, which said its own defenses had been breached by sophisticated attackers who stole tools used to test customers’ computer systems.FireEye said it suspected the attack was state-sponsored, and warned it could have affected numerous high profile targets across the globe.“This campaign may have begun as early as Spring 2020 and is currently ongoing,” FireEye said in a blog post.Russia involved? The content the hackers have sought to steal -- and how successful they have been -- is not known at this time. “We believe this is nation-state activity at significant scale, aimed at both the government and private sector,” said IT giant Microsoft, which is also investigating, in a blog post. Also Read: US agencies hacked in monthslong global cyberspying campaignWhile Microsoft refrained from naming a country, several US media pointed the finger at the Russian group “APT29”, also known as “Cozy Bear.” According to the Washington Post, the group is part of Moscow’s intelligence services, and hacked servers at the State Department and the White House during the Obama administration.The Russian Embassy in the United States categorically denied the accusations in a statement on Facebook.Both the public and private sectors must be increasingly on guard against such hacks, warned Hank Schless, senior manager at Lookout, a California-based mobile security company. “Adversarial nation-states have recognized the value in targeting both sectors, which means neither is safe from the types of attacks that have government resources behind them,” he said.Matt Walmsley of Vectra, which provides cyberattack detection services from its base in California, agreed.“Security teams need to drastically reduce the overall risk of a breach by gaining instant visibility and understanding of who and what is accessing data or changing configurations, regardless of how they are doing it, and from where,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hackers-breach-us-agencies-homeland-security-a-reported-target/story-eTqYOct9N8NypUSwQXZUCN.html
15-12-2020||World||Indian-American among 3 astronauts selected for SpaceX Crew-3 Mission||The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and European Space Agency (ESA) have selected three astronauts to serve as crew members for NASA’s SpaceX Crew-3 mission to the International Space Station, which is expected to launch in the fall of 2021.According to the NASA, the trio will consist of its astronauts Raja Chari, an Indian-American US Air Force colonel, and Tom Marshburn, who will serve as commander and pilot, respectively, and ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer, who will serve as a mission specialist. A fourth crew member will be added at a later date, following a review by NASA and its international partners.Also Read: Indonesia asks SpaceX to study country as venue for launch siteThis will be the first spaceflight for Chari, who became a NASA astronaut in 2017. He was born in Milwaukee, but considers Cedar Falls, Iowa, his hometown. He is a colonel in the US Air Force and joins the mission with extensive experience as a test pilot. He has accumulated more than 2,500 hours of flight time in his career. Chari was selected earlier this month as a member of the Artemis Team and is now eligible for assignment to a future lunar mission.Marshburn is a Statesville, North Carolina, native who became an astronaut in 2004. Prior to serving in the astronaut corps, the medical doctor served as flight surgeon at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston and later became medical operations lead for the International Space Station. “The Crew-3 mission will be his third visit to the space station and his second long-duration mission. Marshburn previously served as a crew member of STS-127 in 2009 and Expedition 34/35, which concluded in 2013,” the NASA said. Maurer comes from Sankt Wendel, in the German state of Saarland. Like Chari, Maurer will be making his first trip to space with the Crew-3 mission. In 2016, Maurer spent 16 days on an undersea mission as part of a NASA’s Extreme Environment Mission Operations, or NEEMO, space analog.Also Read: Here’s how you can spot space station with 2 SpaceX Dragon capsules fly overheadWhen Chari, Marshburn, and Maurer arrive at the orbiting laboratory, they will become expedition crew members for the duration of their six-month stay. “The crew will have a slight overlap with the Crew-2 astronauts, who are expected to launch in the spring of 2021. This will not be the first commercial crew mission to overlap. The Crew-1 astronauts, who are currently on station, and the Crew-2 astronauts, also are expected to coincide in their sojourns for a short time. Increasing the total number of astronauts aboard the station is allowing the agency to boost the number of science investigations conducted in the unique microgravity environment.”This will be the third crew rotation mission of SpaceX’s human space transportation system and its fourth flight with astronauts, including the Demo-2 test flight, to the space station through NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The goal of the program is to provide safe, reliable, and cost-effective crew access to the space station and low-Earth orbit in partnership with American aerospace industry.Moreover, the station is a critical test bed for NASA to understand and overcome the challenges of long-duration spaceflight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-among-three-astronauts-selected-for-spacex-crew-3-mission/story-Sz5sl23PjlNK8wc55B94JJ.html
15-12-2020||World||US starts mass Covid-19 vaccination||A health care worker became on Monday the first to get a shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in New York, the city hit the hardest by the pandemic.“There’s light at the end of the tunnel ... I encourage everyone to take the vaccine,” said Sandra Lindsay, a critical care worker, after getting the first shot of the two-dose vaccine at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens, New York City. Many in the African American community are distrustful of vaccines due to a history of racially charged medical experiments.“First Vaccine Administered. Congratulations USA! Congratulations WORLD!” President Donald Trump tweeted. Earlier, he reversed a White House decision to vaccinate aides around him in the first lot. Reports said he may take the shot.Frontline health workers and residents of long-term nursing home facilities are prioritised for vaccination. The vaccine’s journey from Pfizer’s manufacturing facility in Michigan was followed breathlessly by news TV crews, for a nation starving for good news. Cameras recorded trucks carrying the vaccines emerging from the facility and cargo flights carrying them from a nearby airport for destinations.New York City, the hardest hit in the US, should be prepared for a full shutdown and start making plans to work remotely, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.London moved to Tier 3London will move into the toughest top tier of the three-level Covid-19 alert system from Wednesday as health secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday that there has been a “very sharp exponential” rise of cases.Hancock also revealed that a new variant of Covid-19 had been detected, which may have caused the spike in cases in London, Essex and Kent. The World Health Organization, he said, had been informed of the variant, which is unlikely to cause more serious disease than others.“We have identified a new variant of coronavirus, which may be associated with the fastest spread in the south-east of England,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-starts-mass-covid-19-vaccination/story-2D6HAFVzo7Yp8NPdye3TVK.html
15-12-2020||World||Top US officials expected to get Covid-19 vaccine this week||Senior US officials will begin receiving coronavirus vaccines this week as part of updated federal continuity of government plans that now include terrorism and pandemics as threats to the nation, and its leaders.The effort comes after President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that White House aides should receive the Covid-19 vaccine “somewhat later in the program.” Still, doses are expected to be administered at the White House, Capitol Hill and other facilities within the week, according to senior administration officials.Trump’s statement about moving more slowly was only expected to affect priority vaccination for a small subset of the hundreds, if not more, officials who are to be inoculated with the Pfizer vaccine, which received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration on Friday.Also Read| A weapon to ‘win the war’: US hospitals get initial Covid-19 shotsPublic distribution of the shot is initially limited to front-line health workers and people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities The exact number and role of officials set to receive the vaccine is classified, according to senior administration officials. It is not expected to include Trump and Vice President Mike Pence themselves at this point. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have yet to be informed how many doses they will receive and have yet to develop a vaccination plan, one official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-officials-expected-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-this-week/story-iB0sJzPkCozJCiXR117ueM.html
15-12-2020||World||New UK law set to fine social media firms up to £18mn for illegal content||Fines up to £18 million or ten per cent of annual global turnover of tech firms, whichever is higher, will be slapped on tech firms that fail to remove and limit the spread of illegal content under new laws and block non-compliant services from being accessed in the UK.The new rules, intended to enforce a ‘new age of accountability’ for social media, includes the power to hold senior managers of the tech companies liable. They will not affect articles and comments on news websites, and there will be additional measures to protect free speech.The Department of Culture, Media and Sport said in statement that the most popular social media sites, with the largest audiences and high-risk features, will need to go further by setting and enforcing clear terms and conditions which explicitly state how they will handle content which is legal but could cause significant physical or psychological harm to adults.“This includes dangerous disinformation and misinformation about coronavirus vaccines, and will help bridge the gap between what companies say they do and what happens in practice”, it said, adding that the measures will be set out in detail by home secretary Priti Patel and culture secretary Oliver Dowden on Tuesday.Social media sites, websites, apps and other services which host user-generated content or allow people to talk to others online will need to remove and limit the spread of illegal content such as child sexual abuse, terrorist material and suicide content. Ofcom, the UK’s communications regulator, will have the power to fine companies failing in their duty of care.Dowden said: “I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free for all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech”.Patel said: “We are giving internet users the protection they deserve and are working with companies to tackle some of the abuses happening on the web. We will not allow child sexual abuse, terrorist material and other harmful content to fester on online platforms. Tech companies must put public safety first or face the consequences.”The new regulations will apply to any company in the world hosting user-generated content online accessible by people in the UK or enabling them to privately or publicly interact with others online.It includes social media, video sharing and instant messaging platforms, online forums, dating apps, commercial pornography websites, as well as online marketplaces, peer-to-peer services, consumer cloud storage sites and video games which allow online interaction. Search engines will also be subject to the new regulations.Online journalism from news publishers’ websites will be exempt, as will reader comments on such sites. Specific measures will be included in the legislation to make sure journalistic content is still protected when it is reshared on social media platforms, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-law-set-to-fine-social-media-firms-up-to-18mn-for-illegal-content/story-EorSboXrSn8juwcYlyLsdI.html
15-12-2020||World||A weapon to ‘win the war’: US hospitals get initial Covid-19 shots||The first Covid-19 shots were administered by US hospitals Monday, the initial step in a historic drive to immunize millions of people this week as the Pfizer Inc. vaccine is distributed nationwide.In New York, an early epicenter of the US crisis, critical-care nurse Sandra Lindsay received the first shot in the state at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens. Governor Andrew Cuomo joined the event via video from his office in Albany, thanking the nurse for her work throughout the pandemic.“I believe this is the weapon that will win the war,” said Cuomo, who had asked an advisory group to independently review the safety of Covid-19 vaccines authorized by the Food and Drug Administration.The arrival of the Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine offers a glimmer of hope amid a pandemic that has already seen almost 300,000 Americans die. About 200,000 people are testing positive for the virus every day in the nation’s worst surge to date.The government plans to distribute at least 2.9 million doses to US states during the week ahead. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendeded that the first shots go to health-care workers and those in long-term care facilities, including the nation’s hard-hit nursing homes.Added ShipmentsGustave Perna, an Army four-star general and the Operation Warp Speed chief operations officer, said in a news briefing that 55 of 145 shipments scheduled for Monday had been delivered by around noon Eastern time, and that the deliveries set for Tuesday are packed and ready to go.“There is not one part of this country that’s not being touched today through Wednesday,” Perna said.Also Read: There’s light at end of tunnel, says first NYC recipient of Covid vaccineAdditionally, Perna said, the operation will send out an added 581 shipments after Wednesday. So far, he said, there’s been no reason to tap into a reserve of 500,000 doses being held back for emergency reasons.The government will announce new weekly allocations each Friday, Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services Department secretary, said in the briefing. Moving forward, the Trump administration wants to “ensure that any picture we give of this progress is accurate,” he added.Long-Term CentersSome states will start vaccinating residents of long-term care centers this week, according to Azar, with shots in another 1,100 nursing homes starting next week through the federal pharmacy partnership. Many tasks have to be achieved, such as receiving consent from residents, before vaccinators can walk into nursing homes, he added.The plan is to have 20 million people immunized in the month of December, with their second dose coming in January, he said. An added 30 million people will get initial doses in January and, by the end of March, a total of 100 million individuals will have had at least one dose.New York isn’t alone in celebrating the arrival of the vaccine.A masked Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who recently recovered from Covid-19, signed for the FedEx vaccine shipment that arrived at the state laboratory loading dock in Denver on Monday.Nine-Month Wait“I’ve been waiting to do this signature for nine months,” Polis told the driver. The governor also pushed the button to open the rolling door. A staff member carted the white cardboard container into the lab, where Polis opened it with a box cutter and pushed a button on a wireless device to alert Pfizer the shipment arrived.In Fargo, North Dakota, the Sanford Medical Center received its shipment three hours earlier than expected on Monday, said spokeswoman Angela Dejene. The hospital plans to give its first shot in the afternoon.Atrium Health, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, also said on Twitter Monday that it had received its first shipment, and Katie Passaretti, the system’s medical director of infection prevention, was first to get a shot.“I feel perfectly fine,” she said on Twitter, “Again, just a moment of cold,Michigan Medicine also received its doses, the system said on Twitter, noting they arrived at 9 a.m. local time.CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. are set to start vaccinating residents of nursing homes and assisted-living facilities on Dec. 21, using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. They are partnering with the federal government in the effort.Walgreens expects to receive shipments of Pfizer’s vaccine over the weekend so it can start administering, Rina Shah, the company’s group vice president of pharmacy operations, said in an interview Monday.The CDC plans to document receipt and integrity of the vaccines as they are delivered, according to Kristen Nordlund, a spokeswoman for the agency. “In addition,” she added, “these visits will allow the government to gather important information on the early shipments so we can continually improve the process.”Moderna ShotAnother shot, from Moderna Inc., could be made available as soon as the end of this week. Food and Drug Administration advisers are set to review the company’s application on Thursday.Moncef Slaoui, the scientific head of Operation Warp Speed, said in Monday’s briefing that the data on the Moderna vaccine is “remarkably aligned” with the data seen on the Pfizer-BioNTech product.Once it’s authorized for emergency use, distribution of Moderna’s vaccine will be more flexible, with smaller package sizes. The goal will be for the first of about 6 million Moderna shots to be available this time next week, Perna said. And as with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the administration plans to hold back some of the shots for unknown contingencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-weapon-to-win-the-war-us-hospitals-get-initial-covid-19-shots/story-a7vk4oJW14om2rX75gFHCO.html
15-12-2020||World||New Covid strain found in London that spreads rapidly; tough Tier 3 restrictions ordered||The British capital will move into the toughest top tier of the three-level Covid-19 alert system from early Wednesday after health secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons on Monday that there has been a “very sharp exponential” rise of cases in recent days.Hancock also revealed that a new variant of Covid-19 had been detected, which may have caused the spike in cases in London, Essex and Kent. The World Health Organization, he said, had been informed of the variant, which is unlikely to cause more serious disease than others.He said: “We have identified a new variant of coronavirus, which may be associated with the fastest spread in the south-east of England. Initial analysis suggests that this variant is growing faster than the existing variants”.“We’ve currently identified over 1,000 cases with this variant, predominantly in the south of England, although cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas, and numbers are increasing rapidly”.Also Watch | USA starts Covid vaccination; London scare; Sputnik V new trial report A city under Tier 3 is subject to the tightest restrictions, including the closure of pubs, cafes and restaurants; inability to mix indoors, in private gardens or in most outdoor venues, except within a household or bubble.Indoor entertainment venues - such as bowling alleys and cinemas - must also stay closed, and people are advised not to travel to and from Tier 3 areas. The review of the alert system was due on Wednesday, but was advanced due to the spike in new cases.Hancock called or continued vigilance in what he called “the final stretch”, since “it is not over yet…there is not a moment to spare”, but noted that the mass vaccination programme has begun, besides increased testing.Besides Greater London, the new areas under Tier 3 are parts of Essex and Hertfordshire.London mayor Sadiq Khan said: “The surge in coronavirus cases across our capital is deeply concerning…If the Government does decide to introduce further restrictions in London this week, the economic impact on businesses could be catastrophic with hundreds of thousands of livelihoods at stake”.“2020 has been a dismal year for our once-thriving hospitality sector and world-famous cultural scene, which both contribute billions to our economy and attract millions of visitors. Without protecting them, there can be no meaningful recovery”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/very-sharp-rise-in-london-prompts-toughest-covid-curbs-new-variant-found/story-4gsxKenwTpuxjxTATQpzPI.html
