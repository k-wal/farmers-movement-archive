The migrants came from impoverished villages and had paid people-smugglers thousands of dollars to take them on risky journeys to what they hoped would be better lives abroad.Prosecutors said Harrison drove the container to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge for transport to the UK Nica was described as the smuggling gang’s ringleader.Two other suspects, Christopher Kennedy and Valentin Calota, were also convicted of people-smuggling on Monday at the end of a 10-week trial.Several others have pleaded guilty in the case, including hauling company boss Ronan Hughes, 41, and truck driver Maurice Robinson, 26, who picked up the container in England and has admitted 39 counts of manslaughter.Prosecutors said all the suspects were part of a gang that charged about 13,000 pounds ($17,000) per person to transport migrants in trailers through the Channel Tunnel or by boat.Jurors heard harrowing evidence about the final hours of the victims, who tried to call Vietnam’s emergency number to summon help as air in the container ran out. When they could not get a mobile phone signal, some recorded goodbye messages to their families.The trapped migrants — who included a bricklayer, a restaurant worker, a nail bar technician, a budding beautician and a university graduate — used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof of the refrigerated container, but only managed to dent it.“There was no way out, and no-one to hear them, no-one to help them,” prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones said during the trial.The judge said the defendants would be sentenced in January. The maximum sentence for people-smuggling is 14 years in prison, while manslaughter carries a maximum life sentence.Kelly Matthews of Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service said that “nothing can bring back the lives lost on that day or the loss caused by the horrible, unlawful and dangerous actions of these defendants.“But we hope these convictions bring some measure of solace to the families in the knowledge that justice has been done,” Matthews said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-found-guilty-of-manslaughter-for-deaths-of-39-vietnamese-migrants-in-england/story-XeMcDJhpDBlXiUlv6y21KP.html

21-12-2020||World||Joe Biden names additional members to National Economic Council||U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden on Monday named additional members of the National Economic Council, rounding out his economic policymaking team with people his transition office said would help lift Americans out of the economic crisis caused by COVID-19.David Kamin, an official in former President Barack Obama’s White House, will be the NEC deputy director, and Bharat Ramamurti, a former top economic adviser to Senator Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign, will serve as NEC deputy director for Financial Reform and Consumer Protection, Biden’s team said in a statement.Joelle Gamble will be Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, it added.“This is no time to build back the way things were before — this is the moment to build a new American economy that works for all,” Biden said in the statement.The appointments would help “lift all Americans out of the current economic crisis — and build a strong, inclusive, and more resilient economy for the future,” the statement said.Earlier in December, Biden named Brian Deese, who helped lead Obama’s efforts to bail out the automotive industry and negotiate the Paris climate agreement, to lead the council, which coordinates the country’s economic policymaking.Biden, a Democrat, beat Republican President Donald Trump in November’s election, in part by running on a platform to ease U.S. economic inequality and reduce the country’s reliance on fossil fuels.U.S. congressional leaders reached agreement on Sunday on a $900 billion package to provide the first new aid in months to an economy and individuals battered by the surging coronavirus pandemic, the largest crisis facing Biden after his Jan. 20 inauguration.Outgoing U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview on Monday that he had spoken several times with Biden’s nominee to replace him, former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen.“We are cooperating with the transition team, and I’ve had several direct sessions with her to tell her about many of the Treasury priorities and what needs to be done,” said Mnuchin, who overlapped with Yellen during her last year on the Fed before Trump replaced her.

Advance purchase agreements have also been made with other promising candidates, including those from Moderna Inc. and Sinovac Biotech Ltd., he said.“The cargo arrived at Singapore’s Changi International Airport on Dec. 21 where DHL handled the customs clearance and final delivery to a designated location in Singapore,” the logistics company said. DHL will also “handle the return of these special shipper boxes to Europe.”Temperature trackers equipped with GPS were packed within each thermal shipping box to provide visibility throughout the vaccine’s journey, according to DHL’s statement.Singapore-based ground handling operator SATS Ltd. has increased daily production of dry ice to around 4.5 tons in anticipation of the vaccines, which must be stored at ultra-low temperatures.To provide global coverage over the next two years, DHL has estimated that about 15 million cooling boxes will be required across various supply chains.Singapore has set aside more than S$1 billion ($750 million) for vaccines and should have enough for its around 5.5 million-strong population by the third quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-batch-of-coronavirus-vaccines-arrive-in-singapore/story-zsqTpAS1wUjnLIdkN57tII.html

Until December 31, flights will be suspended while the passengers from all transit flights arriving from the UK scheduled to reach India by December 22 will be subjected to mandatory RT-PCR tests on arrival.The new variant of coronavirus is believed to spread faster than its previous strains. On Sunday, the authorities admitted that a more infectious new coronavirus strain was spreading “out of control” as they imposed strictest of measures to check the spread.The list of countries also includes Russia, Hong Kong, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Canada, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia etc. With this international airports of the UK are going to suffer a major drop in air traffic which was already suffering due to the pandemic. Here is the list of international airports to be impacted by the temporary suspension: London HeathrowBritain’s biggest and Europe’s one of the busiest by international passenger traffic, London Heathrow airport will see a significant drop in air traffic. It is the major international airport of London. Until 2019, the airport was handling a record 80.8 million passengers, as per a report.Gatwick AirportGatwick Airport is one of the six major international airports in the UK. It is the second-busiest airport by total passenger traffic in the UK, after Heathrow Airport and is tenth-busiest airport in Europe.Manchester airportIn 2019, the Manchester airport was the third busiest airport of the UK in terms of passenger number. It is the only airport after Heathrow to have two runways over 2,999 metre in length.London Stansted AirportLocated in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex, London Stansted Airport serves over 160 destinations across Europe, Asia and Africa. In 2015, it was the fourth busiest airport.London Luton AirportPreviously called Luton international airport, it is located in the east of Luton town of Bedfordshire.

21-12-2020||World||Switzerland impose entry ban on travellers from UK, South Africa||Swiss officials who banned travel from Britain and South Africa on Monday on fear of mutant coronavirus variants that are spreading rapidly in those countries believe a new strain is likely already in Switzerland, despite not having detected it.The Swiss government, among nations to levy travel restrictions, ordered people who have entered the country from the United Kingdom and South Africa since December 14 to undergo a 10-day quarantine and imposed a general entry ban for foreign nationals from the countries.The Swiss cabinet joined several countries in suspending travel for Britons after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the mutated variant, up to 70% more transmissible, had been identified.Though a mutant virus has yet to be found in Switzerland, officials said travel between the two countries in recent days and weeks means such a new strain is here but has likely simply not shown up in testing or on Swiss scientists’ radar.“The virus, unfortunately, is one step ahead of us again,” Patrick Mathys, assistant head of communicable diseases at the Federal Ministry of Health, told a news conference two days after Swiss regulators approved Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine against Covid-19.Asked if Switzerland was overreacting, Mathys said there was already growing evidence that the mutant form of the virus could spread from person to person quickly, necessitating quick action to prevent an explosion of new cases.“We know too little about the coronavirus, and we know even less about this mutant form,” he said. “But there are reliable signs emerging that it is more infectious.”Swiss officials said there were no plans to organise evacuation charter flights for Swiss stranded abroad, and that they were considering mass testing for thousands of Britons in hotspots like Verbier, a ski area popular with British tourists.Goods transport to and from Britain was still allowed, though the closure of the Channel Tunnel has exacerbated trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-impose-entry-ban-on-travellers-from-uk-south-africa/story-T0QmiXMHKoaypiRMMOMywI.html

Securing our key supply chains and fighting the coronavirus pandemic requires the full and undivided efforts of ministers more than ever before,” Khan said in a statement that was posted on Twitter.On Sunday, the UK Department of Health and Social Care reported 35,928 new positive tests for Covid-19, a new single-day record for the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-mayor-urges-uk-govt-to-seek-extension-to-brexit-transition-period/story-oKHVGVAVuEqrvKUDLBp7NJ.html
21-12-2020||World||Iran urged not to squander chance to salvage nuclear deal||Countries trying to keep alive the 2015 deal on Iran’s nuclear program agreed Monday to “positively address” the possibility of a US return to the accord under the Biden administration. Germany’s foreign minister urged Iran not to waste what he called a final window of opportunity.Monday’s virtual meeting of parties to the agreement — the first at the level of foreign ministers in over a year — came as the deal is in what German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called a “downward spiral” caused by a mixture of strong US pressure on Iran and Tehran’s violations of the accord.The remaining countries that signed the agreement with Iran — Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia — have been trying to keep it from collapsing after the unilateral withdrawal of the United States in 2018.The three European powers have expressed hope that with the change of administrations in Washington, the US could be brought back into the deal, whose goal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb — something Tehran insists it doesn’t want to do.President-elect Joe Biden has said he hopes to return the US to the deal, which was negotiated while he was vice president.Complicating that, Iran is now in violation of most major restrictions set out in the agreement, including the amount of enriched uranium it is allowed to stockpile and the purity to which it is allowed to enrich uranium.A joint statement released after Monday’s meeting said participants in the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA, “re-emphasised their commitment to preserve the agreement” and discussed the fact that “full and effective implementation of the JCPOA by all remains crucial.”“Ministers acknowledged the prospect of a return of the US to the JCPOA and underlined their readiness to positively address this in a joint effort,” the statement said.“We are standing at a crossroads today,” Germany’s Maas told reporters in Berlin, adding that the deal’s survival or otherwise will be determined in the coming weeks and months.The European powers stressed Monday that “just a commitment” to the accord on everyone’s part is not enough, Maas said.“To make possible a rapprochement under Biden, there must be no more technical maneuvers of the kind we have seen plenty in recent times — they would do nothing but further undermine the agreement,” he added.“The opportunity that is now being offered — this last window of opportunity — must not be squandered,” Maas said. “We made that very clear today to Iran in particular.”The deal promises Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, but with the reinstatement of American sanctions, the other nations have been struggling to provide Iran the assistance it seeks.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who also attended the meeting, tweeted that “I made it absolutely clear Iran must not implement the recently announced expansions to its nuclear programme. To do so would undermine the opportunities for progress we hope to see in 2021.”Despite Iran’s violations, the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that Tehran continues to give inspectors full access to its nuclear sites — a key reason the JCPOA member nations say it is worth preserving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-urged-not-to-squander-chance-to-salvage-nuclear-deal/story-a9egX42mMzTp1mF4n0H08J.html

21-12-2020||World||UK confronts threat of food crisis as coronavirus surge blocks trade||The UK confronted threats of food insecurity and panicked shopping days before Christmas as European nations restricted trade and travel to guard against a resurgent coronavirus, offering Britain a preview of the border chaos to come in the absence of a Brexit deal.Fearing a fast-spreading new strain of the virus that forced a strict lockdown across England, France on Sunday suspended travel from the UK for 48 hours and Germany halted arriving flights from Britain. The crisis gave renewed urgency to negotiations for a trade deal with the European Union (EU) that remained at a critical stage after weekend talks.The Port of Dover late Sunday halted freight moved by truck into France while allowing unaccompanied cargo to keep moving. Though traffic into the UK is unaffected, truckers often run supplies in both directions and the latest outbreak in the heart of the country may discourage them from entering the UKThe disruptions are exposing Britain’s trade vulnerabilities just as a 4 1/2-year odyssey to leave the EU moves from political rhetoric to economic reality. Business groups facing catastrophic losses urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government to act soon, with the 18,000-member Logistics UK calling for rapid Covid-19 testing of truckers departing the country as the quickest way of protecting supply chains.“This is the nightmare before Christmas,” said James Withers, chief executive officer at the Scotland Food & Drink industry group.Scottish SeafoodHe said there are more than 100 trucks laden with seafood due to cross the border into the EU, bound for Christmas wholesale markets in France and Spain that would normally be held on Wednesday. Fears are growing that live shellfish will spoil if they’re held up at the border, and the government needs to act today to ensure that the freight can keep moving, Withers said.Container ports and ferry terminals were already congested because of stockpiling ahead of the December 31 deadline marking a final break from the European single market.The border chaos comes at the tail end of a year that’s seen Johnson nearly die from the virus and come under heavy criticism over his response to the pandemic -- which has seen the UK suffer the worst hit to output of any major economy as well as a death toll second only to Italy in Europe.Grocers ScramblingBritish supermarket chain J Sainsbury Plc said it is considering using air freight for products sourced from Europe. If the situation doesn’t change, Sainsbury will start to see “gaps” in the coming days sourcing some fruits and vegetables, said Victoria Durman, head of corporate communications.Outside Dover, trucks began lining up on the M20 motorway as the “Operation Stack” emergency plan was triggered with drivers unable to board ferries. The Department for Transport was also preparing Manston airport in Kent, which is being overhauled to accommodate as many as 4,000 vehicles as part of Britain’s no-deal planning, according to the kent.gov.uk website.Richard Ballantyne, chief executive officer of the British Ports Association, urged travelers to follow the advice of their carriers. “There could be a period of disruption at some of the UK’s ferry ports for the next 48 hours,” he said. “We are confident that the UK will continue to be supplied.”UK travel, leisure, and retail shares slumped on Monday, while stay-at-home stocks, like Ocado Group Plc, got a boost. Airlines that were expecting a lift around the festive period were among the worst hit, with British Airways parent IAG SA falling as much as 20% and Easyjet Plc down as much as 18%.Weaker GrowthEconomists at Berenberg cut their 2021 growth forecast for the UK just last week to 7.3% from 8% because of new lockdowns. On Monday, chief economist Holger Schmieding said the news over the weekend “adds to the near-term downside risks” but that he expects “a rapid snapback of activity once restrictions can be eased again meaningfully by spring at the latest.”Transport Secretary Grant Shapps sought to downplay the urgency of the situation, telling Sky News the short straits between Dover and Calais account for about 20% of goods to and from the country.“It’s not the mainstay. Most goods actually come in and out by unaccompanied containers, and those will continue to flow,” he said. “We obviously don’t want these links to be closed for too long, but it’s not unusual for them to be closed and disrupted.”Asked about the vaccine, he said “virtually all” of it comes across via containers and is unaffected by the stoppage at Dover. Shapps said the French have told UK authorities they want to restart haulers crossing the channel “as quickly as possible.”Still, the economic drag of tougher lockdown and trade turmoil will only deepen the hole the country is in, unleashing more damage stretching from mom-and-pop retailers to already struggling European airlines. The UK was the busiest in the region on Saturday with more than 2,200 flights, according to Eurocontrol, with London Heathrow airport having one of its busiest weeks since the first UK lockdown.Grounded FlightsIreland banned flights with the British mainland at least until Tuesday. Germany did too, and the Transportation Ministry in Berlin cited an EU directive that could keep the suspension in place until December 31. Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium suspended air, train or ferry links.Eurostar International Ltd., which operates passenger trains through the Channel Tunnel, will scrap services from London to Brussels Monday. Even before the new curbs, Eurostar had been operating a minimal service of one train a day in each direction on most routes to allow for emergency travel. Anyone leaving London faced quarantining on their return as well as possible restrictions at their destination.Johnson abruptly cancelled plans to allow families to mix over the holiday period as the government warned over the weekend that the new strain of the virus is “out of control.” There were scenes of panic at train stations, with people defying social-distancing rules to get out of the capital.More than 16 million Britons are now required to stay at home, mainly in London and southeast England.The measures ban household mixing in the capital and the southeast, and restrict socializing to just Christmas Day across the rest of England.Until Friday, Johnson was adamant that close households would be able to mix over Christmas. It was the latest U-turn from a government that has been reluctant to impose limits to movement, unless forced. There is some unease among his Conservative rank-and-file lawmakers.Transmission RateThe Covid-19 virus strain said to have triggered the tighter curbs on London may be as much as 70% more transmissible than others currently circulating, preliminary analysis in the UK shows.The World Health Organization is working to understand the extent to which the virus may spread more easily, along with other human behavioural factors that may be driving transmission, Maria van Kerkhove, the body’s technical lead on Covid-19, told the BBC Sunday. She said that current information suggests that the new variant doesn’t have any impact on the vaccines being rolled out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-confronts-threat-of-food-crisis-as-coronavirus-surge-blocks-trade/story-x5DOYzvknXb0D1kztSAo2K.html
21-12-2020||World||China signals it won’t stop crackdown in Xinjiang despite international backlash||A Chinese Communist Party (CCP) official signaled Monday that there would likely be no let-up in its crackdown in the Xinjiang region, but said the government’s focus is shifting more to addressing the roots of extremism.“We cannot be complacent at this moment, because the threats are still out there,” Xu Guixiang, the deputy director-general of the Xinjiang Communist Party publicity department, said in an interview with The Associated Press in Beijing.China’s policies in the remote Xinjiang region, home to the Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, have become a major point of division with the US and other Western nations over alleged human rights violations.Analysts say China has detained more than a million people, forcing many to give up at least elements of their faith and traditions. Chinese officials tout the success of their effort to de-radicalize the population and provide job training, saying the region hasn’t had a terrorist attack in four years.Xu did not directly answer whether or not security measures would be relaxed, but said that “four years free of terrorism does not mean there is no threat or danger at all.”He said the party is exploring ways to achieve sustained stability in multi-ethnic, border areas such as Xinjiang, a far west region about 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) from Beijing.“We need to think more about the deep-seated issues, including the social foundation and the soil that give rise to extremism and terrorism,” he said.Xu repeated the government’s vehement denials of forced labour, in which vocational training graduates are allegedly pressured to work in factories both in Xinjiang and elsewhere in China.He said that 117,000 people have gone to work in other parts of China since 2014 through programs that have enabled them to develop skills and leave farms for higher-paying factory work.The US customs agency has blocked imports of clothing and other goods from Xinjiang this year over the forced labour issue, and UK politicians are demanding that British companies ensure their supply chains are free of forced labor.The US restrictions have driven some of the region’s firms to seek other markets, Xu said, both at home and abroad.“One can’t assume that Xinjiang companies can’t live without the US market or some US companies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-signals-it-won-t-stop-crackdown-in-xinjiang-despite-international-backlash/story-135MHSrl9T9ufiWZJ0MszH.html
21-12-2020||World||South Africa identifies another new coronavirus strain causing surge in cases||South Africa has announced that a new variant of the Covid-19 virus is driving the country’s current resurgence of the disease, which is seeing higher numbers of confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths.The new variant, known as 501.V2, is dominant among new confirmed infections in South Africa, according to health officials and scientists leading the country’s virus strategy.“It is still very early but at this stage, the preliminary data suggests the virus that is now dominating in the second wave is spreading faster than the first wave,” Professor Salim Abdool Karim, chairman of the government’s Ministerial Advisory Committee, said in a briefing to journalists.South Africa may see “many more cases” in the new wave than it experienced in the first surge of the disease, said Abdool Karim.South Africa currently has more than 8,500 people hospitalized with Covid-19, surpassing the previous high of 8,300 recorded in August.“We are seeing a much earlier and much sharper rise in the second wave or resurgence than we anticipated,” Prof. Ian Sanne, a member of the advisory committee, told South Africa’s News24.The new strain, different from the one in Britain, appears to be more infectious than the original virus. South African scientists are studying if the vaccines against Covid-19 will also offer protection against the new strain.Some of the vaccines, including the one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, are undergoing clinical tests in South Africa.The scientists studying the new variant emphasized that preventive measures like wearing masks and social distancing are vital.In response to the resurgence of Covid-19, the South African government has introduced tougher lockdown restrictions which include limited days and hours for the trade of alcohol and the closure of beaches in areas identified as hotspots.South Africa’s 7-day rolling average of daily new cases has more than doubled over the past two weeks, from 6.47 new cases per 100,000 people on Dec. 6 to 14.68 new cases per 100,000 people on December 20. The number of deaths has also increased with the 7-day rolling average of daily deaths in South Africa rising from 0.18 deaths per 100,000 people on December 6 to 0.34 deaths per 100,000 people on December 20.The country has recorded a total of 912, 477 cases, including 24,539 deaths.Abdool Karim and other experts have expressed concerns that more people may be infected over the holiday season, as many people travel and visit family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-identifies-another-new-coronavirus-strain-causing-surge-in-cases/story-P4ZdU3oY9ZM4yJMXQD0JmI.html
21-12-2020||World||Australia detects new Covid-19 strain, Hong Kong cancels Britain flights||Australia said on Monday it had detected cases of the new virulent coronavirus strain identified in the United Kingdom, while Hong Kong said it would suspend Britain flights.Two travellers from the United Kingdom to Australia’s New South Wales state were found carrying the mutated variant of the virus that Britain has said could be up to 70% more infectious. Both are in quarantine, and the recent spike in infections in Sydney are not linked to this, authorities said.The new strain has prompted Britain’s European neighbours and several others including Canada and Iran to close their doors to travellers from the country.Much is unknown about the strain, but experts said current vaccines should still be effective against it. Asian nations including Japan and South Korea said they were monitoring the new strain even as they battle a spike in infections at home.Hong Kong became the first city in the region to ban flights from Britain in a bid to curb already rising case numbers in the dense financial hub. The Chinese special administrative region said on Monday that people arriving from Britain before Dec. 22 would have to quarantine for three weeks instead of two.South Korea, which imposes a 14-day quarantine on everyone entering the country, said it was reviewing new measures for flights from Britain, and would test twice those coming in from there before they were released from quarantine.New cases climbed to over 1,000 a day in South Korea several times last week. It reported on Sunday an outbreak in a Seoul prison where 188 inmates and staff were infected. The country said on Monday Seoul will ban gatherings of more than four people later this week and double hospital beds for critical Covid-19 cases by year end. Taiwan, which also has a 14-day quarantine, said on Sunday there were no plans at present to stop flights from Britain. An Indian government committee tasked with monitoring the pandemic met on Monday to discuss the new strain, but did not offer clarity on whether flights to Britain would be halted. Britain is one of 23 countries that India shares an “air bubble” with. India’s health minister said the country was prepared to deal with the new strain and that there was no need to panic.Japan, where entry from Britain is already banned in principle, said it would keep in close touch with other countries as well as the World Health Organization to see how the new type of virus was spreading.AUSTRALIA, THAILAND BATTLE OUTBREAKSThe new strain in Britain comes as cases have surged recently in several Asian countries that successfully contained the pandemic earlier. The spikes have prompted localised lockdowns in some countries and more aggressive testing.Thailand said on Sunday it was testing tens of thousands of people, and extended curbs on movement, following its worst outbreak yet that began at a shrimp market in a province that is a centre of the seafood industry and home to thousands of migrant workers.Thailand, the first country outside China to report Covid-19 cases, has so far reported just 60 deaths from the virus among its 70 million population. On Monday, the country confirmed 382 new infections, mostly migrant workers. Thousands of workers in South East Asian countries such as Singapore and Malaysia have been infected in dormitories and factories, revealing often unsanitary living and working conditions even as overall numbers in these places have largely been contained.Australia, where cases in Sydney have flared in recent days, on Monday cancelled dozens of domestic flights.New South Wales, which reported 86 new local cases since Thursday, ordered more than a 250,000 people in Sydney’s northern beaches area into a lockdown, and urged people who had visited venues where confirmed cases were found to get tested and self-isolate. These cases are not part of the UK strain. Australian health authorities said a virus strain in northeastern Sydney matched a traveller from the United States, but how it got from the airport to the community was puzzling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-detects-new-covid-19-strain-hong-kong-cancels-britain-flights/story-skj9qprDHhFxeoCKR4YA0K.html
21-12-2020||World||China calls Trump’s cyberattack claims ‘a farce’||China on Monday said tweets by President Donald Trump suggesting Beijing was involved in a massive cyberattack on the US government were “a farce” concocted for political motives.A large-scale hack of US government agencies including the Treasury was “under control” as of Saturday, according to the outgoing US President. But in a tweet thread he undercut his own administration’s assessment that Russia was behind the cyberattack, instead saying China “may” also have been involved, without providing any evidence.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin stopped short of directly denying Beijing’s involvement, but called US accusations of cyberattacks “not serious, and self-contradictory.”“The accusations made by the US against China have always been a farce, out of political motives,” Wang told a press briefing.“The US has politicised cybersecurity issues, continuously spread false information without conclusive evidence... in an attempt to destroy China’s image and mislead the international community,” he added.In July, two Chinese nationals were indicted by the US for seeking to steal coronavirus vaccine research and hacking hundreds of companies -- prompting Beijing to accuse Washington of “slander”.Trump’s tweets on Saturday contradicted comments just a day earlier from his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the source and the severity of the cyberattack, leaving administration spokespeople scrambling to reconcile the conflicting takes.Pompeo earlier said the breach was “pretty clearly” Russia’s work, adding there had been a significant effort to use third-party software to “essentially embed code inside of US government systems”.Cyber experts said the attack could have far-reaching impact and take months to unravel.Several US officials had previously pointed the finger at Moscow, but none at Beijing.Russia has denied involvement in the latest attack. Trump as president has frequently played down apparent threats from Russia -- including his refusal to recognise interference by Moscow in the 2016 election despite the findings of US intelligence agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-calls-trump-s-cyberattack-claims-a-farce/story-eTsq32snHlOrrXZYoGuXDJ.html
21-12-2020||World||EU agreed 15.50 euros per dose for Pfizer vaccine, says document||The European Union has agreed to pay 15.50 euros ($18.90) per dose for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, an internal EU document reviewed by Reuters shows.The price, which is confidential and was negotiated for a total of 300 million doses, is slightly lower than the $19.50 per shot the United States agreed to pay for a first shipment of 100 million doses of the same vaccine, in line with what Reuters reported in November.The EU document dated Nov. 18 was circulated internally after the EU announced its supply deal with Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech on Nov. 11.The EU drug regulator is expected to decide on Monday on approval for the Pfizer vaccine after the shot was authorised in several countries, including Britain and the United States.On Thursday Belgian state secretary for the budget Eva De Bleeker published on Twitter a table with prices Belgium would pay pharmaceutical companies for their Covid-19 vaccines. She retracted the post shortly after publishing.In that table the Pfizer vaccine was indicated as costing Belgium 12 euros ($14.6) per dose, leading many to believe that was the full price agreed by the EU.Other vaccines in the table were also shown with prices lower than prices disclosed by EU sources.“There is always a total price and a price upon delivery,” an EU official involved in talks with vaccine makers told Reuters when asked to clarify the difference between the EU and Belgian prices.A spokesman for De Bleeker declined to comment on Monday, citing confidentiality requirements, but pointed to what De Bleeker told the Belgian parliament last week. In that public hearing, De Beeker said Belgium’s budgeted prices were still partial.Under EU advance purchase deals for Covid-19 vaccines, the bloc agrees upfront payments with companies to secure doses before they are approved. After approvals, EU governments can pay the remainder to buy reserved doses.The EU has not revealed the upfront payment agreed with Pfizer.However, it said in October that it paid about 1 billion euros in downpayments to AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson for their shots, with a further 1.45 billion euros budgeted for upfront payments to Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and CureVac .It has since agreed supply deals with all six companies and is negotiating a seventh agreement with Novavax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-agreed-15-50-euros-per-dose-for-pfizer-vaccine-internal-document/story-2DkfsWDq6s2WRUmmfdU2II.html
21-12-2020||World||‘Sick man of Europe’: UK cut off over fears about new Covid-19 strain||The United Kingdom stood shut off from the rest of Europe on Monday after allies cut transport ties over fears of a new coronavirus strain, sowing chaos for families, truckers and supermarkets just days before the Brexit cliff edge.France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Belgium, Israel and Canada were among those that shut off travel ties after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that a highly infectious new strain of the virus was a danger to the country.Johnson will chair an emergency response meeting on Monday to discuss international travel, in particular the flow of freight in and out of Britain. EU officials are due to hold a meeting at 1000 GMT on coordinating their response.France shut its border to arrivals of people and trucks from the United Kingdom, closing off one of the most important trade arteries with mainland Europe, a step Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said was surprising.“We’re doing everything we can to get that restarted,” Shapps told Sky. “They’ve said to us they want to restart the hauliers as quickly as possible.”As families and truck drivers tried to navigate the travel bans to get back home in time for Christmas, Britain’s second-largest supermarket chain, Sainsbury’s, said gaps will start to appear on shelves within days if transport ties are not quickly restored with mainland Europe.“If nothing changes, we will start to see gaps over the coming days on lettuce, some salad leaves, cauliflowers, broccoli and citrus fruit – all of which are imported from the continent at this time of year,” Sainsbury’s said.Shellfish producers in Scotland said they had tonnes of perishable products stranded on roads as the French border was closed. Disruption in Britain will also snarl supplies to Ireland.Hong Kong is also due to ban all flights arriving from the United Kingdom from midnight, becoming the first city in Asia to do so. Asian nations including Japan and South Korea said they were closely monitoring the new strain.The pound fell more than 2 cents to $1.3279 and the FTSE 100 fell 2% at the open, with travel companies such as British Airways-owner IAG tumbling 15%. The yield on 2-year UK gilts hit a record low.TRANSPORT CHAOSBritain’s Shapps said getting the bans lifted as swiftly as possible was his priority but that given British preparations for the end of the Brexit transition period, the country was well positioned for disruption.Johnson on Saturday cancelled Christmas plans for millions of British people due to what he said was a more infectious strain of the coronavirus, though he said there was no evidence that it was either more lethal or caused a more severe illness.The new variant contains 23 different changes, many of them associated with how it binds to cells and enters them. Shapps said Britain had done some of the best global analysis of the mutations of the virus so it was simply seeing what was already at large in other countries.The British government triggered plans it had for stacking up trucks in the southeast county of Kent - part of its plans for potential disruption when the United Kingdom exits the EU’s orbit with - or without - a trade deal at 2300 GMT on Dec. 31.Talks on a Brexit trade deal were due to continue on Monday.‘SICK MAN OF EUROPE’Trucks are being stacked on the M20 motorway through Kent, heading towards the ports, which is closed to normal traffic. A nearby airport will also be used to hold freight.“Sick Man of Europe”, the Daily Mirror newspaper said on its front page beside a picture of Johnson while the Sun newspaper said “French show no merci”.The closure of the Channel Tunnel and ports for onward travel to France will affect the export of goods such as fish and shell fish from Scotland to Europe, and the import of food for British supermarkets if, as expected, European drivers refuse to travel.Trucks have been told to avoid Kent to prevent any further build up of trucks.Jon Swallow, a director of the British logistics group Jordon Freight, said the move by France would deter European drivers from coming to Britain both now and after the end of the year for fear they will get stuck.“This is a serious situation as the stockpiled goods expected here are for Christmas and to help stabilise January,” he told Reuters. “This shows how fragile the cross channel route is.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sick-man-of-europe-uk-cut-off-over-fears-about-new-covid-19-strain/story-z0JRuS4ZWYXreBg8DiMEXP.html
21-12-2020||World||Japan to looking to reduce emissions beyond 2030 target||Japan will look at reducing greenhouse gas emissions beyond its current target for 2030 and lay out details next year on a carbon pricing scheme that won’t rule out a carbon tax, the environment ministry’s top bureaucrat said on Monday.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Monday instructed his environment and industry ministers to work on a plan next year to create a carbon pricing scheme, which will be part of efforts to meet his pledge to make Japan carbon-neutral by 2050.Suga’s instruction will have “huge implications” as it makes the idea official government policy, Vice Environment Minister Tokutaro Nakai told Reuters in an interview.“Both ideas will be on the table for debate next year,” he said, when asked whether the scheme would include a carbon tax and creation of an emissions-trading system.“Carbon pricing must be designed in a way so it serves as a tool of Japan’s growth strategy,” Nakai said. Even if a carbon tax were to be introduced, it should be timed in a way that does not hurt the economy, he added.Suga’s pledge to make Japan carbon neutral by 2050 brings it into line with the European Union. But Tokyo remains under pressure to take stronger steps towards a carbon-free society.Japan stuck to its 2030 target of cutting emissions by 26% from 2013 levels in an updated plan submitted to the United Nations in March, drawing criticism from investors for being too weak in its resolve to combat climate change.Nakai said Japan is discussing the possibility of setting a more ambitious target next year, as it succeeded in trimming emissions for six straight years.“We don’t have a specific number yet, but the direction is toward a reduction” in emissions beyond the 26% goal, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-looking-to-reduce-emissions-beyond-2030-target/story-EQlUN91Uwo7xdnhOADrHmM.html
21-12-2020||World||EU regulator meets to discuss approval of Covid-19 vaccine||The European Medicines Agency is meeting Monday to consider approving a coronavirus vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer that would be the first to be authorized for use in the European Union.The closed-doors meeting comes weeks after the shot was granted permission under emergency provisions by regulators in Britain and the United States.If EMA scientists conclude that the vaccine is safe, officials at the Amsterdam-based agency are expected to give conditional approval for it to be used across the 27-nation bloc. The European Commission must still rubber-stamp the decision before the vaccine can be rolled out, a process German officials say could begin Dec. 27. The pharmaceutical companies will also need to submit follow-up data on their vaccine for the next year.The European regulator came under heavy pressure last week from countries calling for the vaccine to be granted approval for use as quickly as possible. EMA had originally set Dec. 29 as the date for its evaluation of the vaccine made by Germany-based BioNTech, but moved the meeting forward after calls from Berlin and others to move quicker.The vaccine has already been given some form of regulatory OK in more than a dozen countries.Britain, Canada and the US authorized the vaccine to be used according to emergency provisions, meaning the shot is an unlicensed product whose temporary use is justified by the pandemic that has killed almost 1.7 million people worldwide to date, according to Johns Hopkins University.The EMA approval, however, is largely similar to the normal licensing procedure that would be granted to any new vaccine, only on an accelerated schedule.In a statement last week, the agency stressed that the vaccine would only be approved after a scientific assessment showed its overall benefits outweighed the risks.“A vaccine’s benefits in protecting people against Covid-19 must be far greater than any side effect or potential risks,” it said.So far, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says they have seen six cases of severe allergic reaction out of more than a quarter-million shots of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine given, including in one person with a history of vaccination reactions.BioNTech and Pfizer offered the EU 400 million doses of the vaccine, but the bloc’s executive Commission chose to buy only 200 million doses, with an option for 100 million more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-regulator-meets-to-discuss-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-dpZvp8chWhES7CCDz09EWJ.html
21-12-2020||World||After new Covid-19 strain, these countries have banned travel from UK||The new strain of the coronavirus that was discovered in the UK has forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce another lockdown despite plans to ease restrictions during the Christmas period. The new strain can reportedly be transmitted from one person to another much faster than the previous one and it might even compromise vaccines if they are not effective against it.The UK currently has 2,046,161 confirmed coronavirus infections and the death toll is 67,503, as per Johns Hopkins University.Since the discovery, several countries have suspended flights, trains and other modes of transport from the United Kingdom in fear of another widespread crisis from the virus.Here are the countries that have done so:1. Poland: A spokesperson for the Polish government announced via Twitter that flights from the UK were to be suspended from Monday over virus fears.2. France: France announced on Sunday that it will suspend all travel from Britain for 48 hours from midnight. This includes goods transport via road, air, sea or rail. Only unaccompanied freight would be allowed inside French borders.3. Germany: German Health Minister Jens Spahn said that the country was suspending all flights from the UK for 48 hours from midnight on Sunday. Only cargo flights would be exempt from this measure.4. Italy: Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza said that he had signed a decree that will block flights from England and will prohibit anyone who has stayed there during the last 14 days from entering Italy. One person has already been infected with the new strain.5. Ireland: Ireland said in a statement that all flights arriving from Britain from midnight Sunday would be banned for at least 48 hours.6. The Netherlands: The Dutch government has said that all passenger flights from Britain to the Netherlands would be banned until January 1. The country has reported one person with the new strain.7. Canada: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that all flights from the UK would be suspended for 72 hours and he instructed those recently returned from the country to take advanced safety measures.8. Iran: Iran’s health ministry has ordered flights from Britain suspended for two weeks, as per state news agency IRNA.9. Israel: A joint statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office and the Health Ministry said that Israel was suspending all flights from the UK, Denmark and South Africa.10. Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia announced on Sunday that it was halting all flights and suspending entry through its land and seaports for at least a week, with the option to extend for a further week. The ones who have arrived from Europe or anywhere where the strain was detected have been instructed to self-isolate for two weeks and undergo testing.11. Kuwait: Kuwait has added Britain to a list of “high-risk” nations and banned flights.12. El Salvador: President Nayib Bukele announced via Twitter that anyone who had been in Britain or South Africa in the past 30 days would not be allowed to enter the country.13. Argentina: Argentina suspended all flights from the UK, the government said in a statement on Sunday. The last flight would arrive on Monday.14.

21-12-2020||World||From UK to Australia: Countries that have reported new strain of Covid-19||Coronavirus is mutating and its latest strain said to transmit faster has spread fear across several countries ahead of Christmas. British prime minister Boris Johnson immediately responded to the new strain by imposing the strictest lockdown in London. The mutant virus that the UK officials say has 70 per cent transmissibility was found in southeastern England in September and has been moving around the world, as per an official of the World Health Organization (WHO), reported AP.Also Read | New coronavirus strain ‘out of control’ as England faces lengthy lockdownSeveral European nations and other countries have also tried to distance itself from the United Kingdom after the news of the super spreading virus strain trickled in. Many have imposed travel bans to tackle the crisis.Researchers in Sweden had found a new mutation in the virus as early as April. They observed two changes in the genetic material of the virus that seemed to make it two times more powerful in transmission, AP cited Dr Ravi Gupta, a virologist at the University of Cambridge in England, as saying. Gupta said that around 6,000 cases of the new virus worldwide were reported, mostly in Denmark and England.Many more variations in the genome have been discovered since then, it was also reported that people in Denmark got the new strain from mink farms. News about the new strain that is driving the second wave in South Africa was also reported on Friday. South African health officials believed that the newly found strain of coronavirus seems to spread faster but the severity of the disease due to the mutations are still unknown.Italy is another such country where the new strain of the virus discovered in the UK has been found. Italy on Sunday reported that it has found the new strain of coronavirus in a person who has recently returned from the United Kingdom.France on Monday also reported there is a possibility that the new strain of coronavirus is also spreading in the country. “It is entirely possible that the virus is circulating in France,” French health minister Olivier Veran was quoted as saying by Reuters. However, the recent tests have not detected the mutant yet.Australia too on Monday reported the mutant strain of coronavirus detected in the United Kingdom. Two returnees from the UK in Australia’s South Wales were identified carrying the new strain of the deadly virus, both are now in quarantine, reported Reuters. Viruses evolve through minor changes in a letter or two in their genetic database. The new modifications can become a major strain in a region because of its evolution there or due to any event that helped it spread. The pathogens mutate to survive in order to defeat the evolving human immune system as well as the vaccines that endanger its survival. These mutations determine the severity of the disease, the communicability of the virus as well as the relation of the virus with the human cell that can lead to infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-uk-to-italy-countries-that-have-reported-new-covid-19-strains/story-ubGHzK3IcRH8ZIXt8fHa2H.html
21-12-2020||World||Thailand considers more lockdowns as seafood workers hit by virus||Thailand said it may expand a lockdown, as health authorities search for more than 10,000 people with ties to a record cluster of coronavirus cases found in a coastal province near Bangkok.The country reported 382 Covid-19 new infections today, taking total cases linked to a seafood market in Samut Sakhon to about 1,000 in the last week since the first case was found December 17. Several cases were also found in nearby provinces of Bangkok, Nakhon Pathom and Samut Prakan. Thailand’s largest single outbreak brings to 5,289 the total of confirmed infections, based on Health Ministry data.A lockdown imposed in Samut Sakhon may be extended to other districts, Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said today. Officials will meet with Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha and a Covid-19 task force to consider steps to curb the contagion, he added.Thailand’s benchmark equities index sank as much as 3.7%. Thai Union Group Pcl, one of the world’s biggest tuna processors, dropped as much as 11%, while agro-industrial conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Foods Pcl, lost as much as 5.5%. Both firms have plants in Samut Sakhon Province.While a lockdown hasn’t been imposed in Bangkok, the capital’s chief administrator said residents with businesses in the neighboring province should work from home and ordered more stringent screening of migrant workers. The Health Ministry, meanwhile, advised the nation’s 1,580 fresh-food markets to enforce strict measures to prevent the virus from spreading.Migrant workers from Myanmar comprise about 90% of the infections found in the new cluster, with most employed at food-processing factories. The outbreak was tracked after a 67-year-old local fish merchant was confirmed to have the virus on December 17.“Migrant workers in the area live in crowded apartment, with about six people sharing a three-by-six room where they take turns using the room based on their morning or night shifts,” said Adisorn Keadmongkol, an official from Migrant Working Group Thailand. With the lockdown in place, they will be confined to their rooms and “the virus could spread further among people living in the communities,” he said.The lockdown will spark economic losses of about 1 billion baht ($33.3 million) a day, and cause a rise in seafood prices, Maria Lapiz, managing director of Maybank Kim Eng Thailand, said in a report on Monday. Samut Sakhon is home to about 6,000 factories and is the nation’s sixth-largest provincial economy, contributing about 2.5% of Thailand’s gross domestic product, the report said.Thailand was the first nation to report Covid-19 infections outside of China. It has been relatively successful in containing the virus -- the government has reported a total of 4,907 infections -- and was betting on a tourism industry revival to pull the economy out of recession.Thai Union Group, which owns Chicken of the Sea and John West brands, said in a statement on Monday that one of its workers tested positive for the virus, but all its domestic plants were still open.“Should the unlikely worst-case scenario happen involving the total shutdown of all Thai Union Samut Sakhon plants for two weeks, this would have an impact of less than 2% of total revenue,” said Thiraphong Chansiri, chief executive officer Thai Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-considers-more-lockdowns-as-seafood-workers-hit-by-virus/story-8QDChXOdWHahyUegiyILIP.html
21-12-2020||World||UAE top diplomat acknowledges visa restrictions on Pakistan||The United Arab Emirates’ top diplomat has publicly acknowledged a so-far unexplained ban on visitors from Pakistan, which travel agents say also targets tourists and laborers from a dozen Muslim-majority countries amid the pandemic and the UAE’s normalization of ties with Israel.Following a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart, Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan stressed “the temporary nature of recent restrictions imposed on the issuance of visas due to the outbreak of Covid-19,” the UAE’s state-run WAM news agency reported Sunday.He did not elaborate on the visa suspension, which has blindsided expats seeking entry to the federation of seven sheikhdoms, where foreigners outnumber locals nearly nine to one.The reported visa restrictions targeting countries such as Lebanon, Kenya, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen came just as tourists began arriving in the Persian Gulf country on Israeli passports following the normalization agreement. The Emirati and Israeli governments are hammering out a mutual visa waiver agreement to grant Israeli tourists visas on arrival.Saeed Mohammed, a travel agent at Arabian Nights Tours in Dubai, said Monday that the visa approval rate for families from Pakistan and a few other Mideast nations has increased over the past few weeks. But young, single men from the countries are denied entry, fueling speculation that the ban may be tied to security or visa overstay concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-top-diplomat-acknowledges-visa-restrictions-on-pakistan/story-mHkYIHmZXBpY1KbRqZBvKL.html
21-12-2020||World||New coronavirus strain ‘out of control’ as England faces lengthy lockdown||Britain’s health minister warned Sunday that a strict lockdown imposed on London and southeast England may last for months because a new strain of the coronavirus was “out of control”.Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Saturday that millions must cancel Christmas plans and stay at home from Sunday morning because the new strain was spreading far more quickly. Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that the strict measures that affect almost a third of England’s population could stay in place until the virus vaccine is fully rolled out.“We acted very quickly and decisively,” Hancock told Sky News, justifying the “stay at home” order, ban on family gatherings over Christmas and closure of non-essential shops.“Unfortunately the new strain was out of control. We have got to get it under control.”Around 16.4 million people entered the strictest “tier four” measures from Sunday, or 31% of England’s population. They are not allowed to hold family gatherings for Christmas, while in the rest of the country a limited number of households are allowed to mix on Christmas Day only, rather than the five days originally proposed. Hancock said the situation was “deadly serious”.“It’s going to be very difficult to keep it under control until we have the vaccine rolled out,” he said, adding: “This is what we face over the next couple of months.”The UK hopes to reach a figure of half a million vaccinations over the weekend, the health minister said.London’s Metropolitan Police said it would take action against those who “make reckless decisions that risk lives”.Other UK regions also tightened their anti-virus measures in response.Wales introduced a strict lockdown from Sunday, while Scotland banned travel to and from other UK regions for Christmas and announced it will double its police presence along the English border. Both Scotland and Northern Ireland are to enter fresh lockdowns on December 26. Northern Ireland was to introduce additional measures on Sunday.Scientists first discovered the new variant in a patient in September, Susan Hopkins of Public Health England told Sky News.She said that scientists in November found the new strain was behind a cluster of cases in Kent which spread into London and Essex and informed the government on December 11.Public Health England then again notified the government on Friday when modelling revealed the full seriousness of the new strain, she said.She confirmed the figure given by Johnson that the new virus strain could be 70 percent more transmissible while saying this was an initial figure.“I think 70% looks like a good number to land on at the moment,” she said.The virus has been found in all regions of England but in small numbers, Hopkins said.Hancock said cases had also been identified in Australia and Europe.Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said on Saturday that the new strain contained 23 differences, including to the way the virus binds to human cells and enters cells.Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading, told AFP that the mutations affect the “spike protein” that studs the virus and is targeted by vaccines.“If we look at the changes that those mutations make to the spike protein, which is target for the vaccine, then we don’t think they are sufficient enough to change the effectiveness of the vaccine,” he said.London Mayor Sadiq Khan told Sky News that London now has the same number of hospital patients with the virus as during the peak of the first wave in April. Cases have also grown rapidly among those aged 10 to 19, he said.The grave situation prompted widespread criticism of the Prime Minister for promising last week not to “cancel Christmas.”“Not much was understood about this mutant virus. But that uncertainty should have been enough for the PM to see that then was the time to call off Christmas,” wrote The Sunday Mirror weekly.Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer accused Johnson of being scared of taking unpopular decisions.London’s Oxford Street is usually packed with Christmas shoppers but was almost deserted on Sunday.Some passers-by said they backed the measures.“It was necessary to do it before and making wild promises hasn’t helped the situation at all,” said David, a 59-year-old working in insurance.But Richard Charles, a 32-year-old service industry worker, called the move overly rushed.“It shouldn’t be some sort of diktat that happens overnight,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coronavirus-strain-out-of-control-as-england-faces-lengthy-lockdown/story-osiyqPjSZOMU5btVmb8mfL.html
21-12-2020||World||Saudi, UAE govt spyware targets phones of Al-Jazeera journalists: Report||Dozens of journalists at Al-Jazeera, the Qatari state-owned media company, have been targeted by advanced spyware in an attack likely linked to the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a cybersecurity watchdog said Sunday.Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said it traced malware that infected the personal phones of 36 journalists, producers, anchors and executives at Al-Jazeera back to the Israel-based NSO Group, which has been widely condemned for selling spyware to repressive governments.Most unnerving to the investigators was that iMessages were infecting targeted cellphones without the users taking any action — what’s known as a zero-click vulnerability. Through push notifications alone, the malware instructed the phones to upload their content to servers linked to the NSO Group, Citizen Lab said, turning journalists’ iPhones into powerful surveillance tools without even luring users to click on suspicious links or threatening texts.The coordinated attacks on Qatari-funded Al-Jazeera, which Citizen Lab described as the largest concentration of phone hacks targeting a single organization, occurred in July, just weeks before the Trump administration announced the normalization of ties between Israel and the UAE, the archival to Qatar. The breakthrough deal took public what had been a long-secret alliance. Analysts say normalization likely will lead to stronger cooperation in digital surveillance between Israel and Persian Gulf sheikhdoms.Apple said it was aware of the Citizen Lab report and said the latest version of its mobile operating system, iOS 14, “delivered new protections against these kinds of attacks.” It sought to reassure users that NSO doesn’t target the average iPhone owner, but rather sells its software to foreign governments to target a limited group. Apple said it has not been able to independently verify Citizen Lab’s analysis.Citizen Lab, which has been tracking NSO spyware for four years, tied the attacks “with medium confidence” to the Emirati and Saudi governments, based on their past targeting of dissidents at home and abroad with the same spyware. The two countries are embroiled in a bitter geopolitical dispute with Qatar in which hacking and cyber surveillance have increasingly become favored tools.In 2017, the two Gulf nations and their allies imposed a blockade on Qatar over its alleged support for extremist groups, a charge Doha denies. The UAE and Saudi Arabia served the tiny country with a list of demands, among them shutting down its influential Arabic-language TV network, which the UAE and Saudi Arabia see as promoting a political agenda at odds with their own. The feud continues to fester, although officials recently have indicated a resolution may be within reach.Emirati and Saudi authorities did not respond to requests for comment.The NSO Group cast doubt on Citizen Lab’s accusations in a statement but said it was “unable to comment on a report that we have not yet seen.” The firm said it provides technology for the sole purpose of enabling “governmental law enforcement agencies to tackle serious organized crime and counterterrorism.” Nevertheless, it added, “when we receive credible evidence of misuse … we take all necessary steps in accordance with our product misuse investigation procedure in order to review the allegations.” NSO does not identify its customers.Prior to Sunday’s report, NSO’s spyware has repeatedly been found deployed to hack journalists, lawyers, human rights defenders and dissidents. Most notably, the spyware was implicated in the gruesome killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 and whose body has never been found. Several alleged targets of the spyware, including a close friend of Khashoggi and several Mexican civil society figures, sued NSO in an Israeli court over the hacking.The NSO Group’s surveillance software, known as Pegasus, is designed to bypass detection and mask its activity. The malware infiltrates phones to vacuum up personal and location data and surreptitiously control the smartphone’s microphones and cameras, allowing hackers to spy on reporters’ face-to-face meetings with sources.“It’s not only very scary, but it’s the holy grail of phone hacking,” said Bill Marczak, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab. “You can be using your phone normally, completely unaware that someone else is looking at everything you’re doing.”The Citizen Lab researchers connected the hacks to previously identified Pegasus operators in attacks attributed to Saudi Arabia and the UAE over the last four years.Rania Dridi, a newscaster at the London-based satellite channel Al Araby, never noticed anything amiss. Although she said she’s accustomed to Emirati and Saudi criticism over her reporting on human rights and the UAE’s role in wars in Libya and Yemen, she was shocked to learn her phone had been infected with invasive spyware on several occasions starting October 2019.“It’s a horrible feeling to be so insecure, to know my private life wasn’t private this whole time,” she said.The zero-click vulnerability is increasingly being used to hack cellphones without a trace, said Marczak. Last year, WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook filed an unprecedented lawsuit against the NSO Group, accusing the Israeli firm of targeting some 1,400 users of its encrypted messaging service with highly sophisticated spyware through missed calls. Earlier this month, an Al-Jazeera anchor filed another lawsuit in the US, alleging that the NSO Group hacked her phone through WhatsApp over her reporting on Saudi Arabia’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.With the UAE and Bahrain normalizing ties with Israel, the use of Israeli spyware in the region may accelerate, Marczak added, encompassing a “much wider range of government agencies and customers across the Gulf.”The Al-Jazeera attack represents the tip of the iceberg, said Yaniv Balmas, head of cyber research at Check Point, an Israeli security company.“These hacks are not supposed to be public,” he said. “We should assume they’re happening all the time, everywhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-uae-govt-spyware-targets-phones-of-al-jazeera-journalists-report/story-cWmAGTFMg1TSW3SHrsB4tM.html
21-12-2020||World||Can vaccines defeat the ever-mutating coronavirus?||London has gone into a complete lockdown this holiday season after a new variant of the Covid-19 virus was discovered in the United Kingdom. Prime minister Boris Johnson immediately imposed Tier 4 restrictions to suspend the rapid spread of the virus.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Scientists are not surprised by this new discovery. Researchers have observed thousands of changes in the genetic data of Sars-CoV-2 that causes the coronavirus disease and has been there all around the world since its spread in 2019. The mutations can affect how the virus infects the human cells, how severe the disease can get, how easily the virus spreads and its response to the immune system including to the vaccines.They believe due to vaccination and response of the human immune system, the survival of the pathogen becomes difficult causing it to evolve that can make it spread easily or go undetected by the immune system. “This thing’s transmitting, it’s acquiring, it’s adapting all the time. But people don’t want to hear what we say, which is: This virus will mutate,” Dr Ravindra Gupta, a University of Cambridge virologist told the New York Times.Muge Cevik, a scientific advisor to the British government and expert in infectious disease at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, told NYT that the new variant discovered in Britain has around 20 mutations, including some that can impact how the virus restrains the cells in the human body and infect. These modifications can enable the virus to spread efficiently and proliferate faster. He also said British officials believe that the variant is as much as 70 per cent more communicable, though this has not been confirmed in lab experiments yet.Responding to the greater concerns of the virus mutating to a level where it can get immune to the vaccine being developed around the world, scientists have said that it will take more than years for the virus to mutate to such extent. “We pay most attention to mutations in the gene that encodes the Spike protein, which is associated with viral entry into cells and it is relevant in the context of immunity and vaccine efficacy,” researchers of Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) said in a report.Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary biologist in Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in the US, told NYT that the new vaccines developed by Pfizer BioTech and Moderna are being made in a way that can be updated easily in comparison to the traditional vaccines. He said the new vaccines are capable of generating a great immune response to the virus so the coronavirus needs years of mutation for the vaccines to be modified.Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium collects, sequence, analyze the genomes of the coronavirus samples in the UK to add to the wealth of knowledge required to combat the disease. “As vaccines are rolled out, it will be important to sequence SARS-CoV-2 virus from infected people who have been vaccinated or have had a second episode of Covid-19. The aim is to detect variants that are evading the immune system elicited by past infection or vaccination,” the COG-UK report on the mutations said.The fears of the new variant have spread all across the globe that has isolated the UK. Many European nations, as well as countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Canada and others, have suspended their international flights. The new variant was found in the UK, South Africa and in Danish minks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-vaccines-defeat-the-ever-mutating-coronavirus/story-WhtG7sMxRw0t6lNeRMAvaO.html
21-12-2020||World||Donald Trump’s legacy: He changed the presidency, but will it last?||The most improbable of presidents, Donald Trump reshaped the office and shattered its centuries-old norms and traditions while dominating the national discourse like no one before.Trump, governing by whim and tweet, deepened the nation’s racial and cultural divides and undermined faith in its institutions. His legacy: a tumultuous four years that were marked by his impeachment, failures during the worst pandemic in a century and his refusal to accept defeat.He smashed conceptions about how presidents behave and communicate, offering unvarnished thoughts and policy declarations alike, pulling back the curtain for the American people while enthralling supporters and unnerving foes — and sometimes allies — both at home and abroad.While the nation would be hardpressed to elect another figure as disruptive as Trump, it remains to be seen how much of his imprint on the office itself, occupied by only 44 other men, will be indelible. Already it shadows the work of his successor, President-elect Joe Biden, who framed his candidacy as a repudiation of Trump, offering himself as an antidote to the chaos and dissent of the past four years while vowing to restore dignity to the Oval Office.“For all four years, this is someone who at every opportunity tried to stretch presidential power beyond the limits of the law,” said presidential historian Michael Beschloss. “He altered the presidency in many ways, but many of them can be changed back almost overnight by a president who wants to make the point that there is a change.”Trump’s most enduring legacy may be his use of the trappings of the presidency to erode Americans’ views of the institutions of their own government.From his first moments in office, Trump waged an assault on the federal bureaucracy, casting a suspicious eye on career officials he deemed the “Deep State” and shaking Americans’ confidence in civil servants and the levers of government. Believing that the investigation into Russian election interference was a crusade to undermine him, Trump went after the intelligence agencies and Justice Department — calling out leaders by name — and later unleashed broadsides against the man running the probe, respected special counsel Robert Mueller.His other targets were legion: the Supreme Court for insufficient loyalty; the post office for its handling of mail-in ballots; even the integrity of the vote itself with his baseless claims of election fraud.“In the past, presidents who lost were always willing to turn the office over to the next person. They were willing to accept the vote of the American public,” said Richard Waterman, who studies the presidency at the University of Kentucky. “What we’re seeing right now is really an assault on the institutions of democracy.”Current polling suggests that many Americans, and a majority of Republicans, feel that Biden was illegitimately elected, damaging his credibility as he takes office during a crisis and also creating a template of deep suspicion for future elections.“That’s a cancer,” Waterman said. “I don’t know if the cancer can be removed from the presidency without doing damage to the office itself. I think he’s done tremendous damage in the last several weeks.”Jeopardizing the peaceful transfer of power was hardly Trump’s first assault on the traditions of the presidency.He didn’t release his tax returns or divest himself from his businesses. He doled out government resources on a partisan basis and undermined his own scientists. He rage tweeted at members of his own party and used government property for political purposes, including the White House as the backdrop for his renomination acceptance speech.Trump used National Guard troops to clear a largely peaceful protest across from the White House for a photo-op. He named a secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, who needed a congressional waiver to serve because the retired general had not been out of uniform for the seven years required by law. In that one example, Biden has followed Trump’s lead, nominating for Pentagon chief retired Gen. Lloyd Austin, who also will need a waiver.Trump’s disruption extended to the global stage as well, where he cast doubt on once-inviolable alliances like NATO and bilateral partnerships with a host of allies. His “America First” foreign policy emanated more from preconceived notions of past slights than current facts on the ground. He unilaterally pulled troops from Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq and Syria, each time drawing bipartisan fire for undermining the very purpose of the American deployment.He pulled out of multinational environmental agreements, an action that scientists warn may have accelerated climate change. He stepped away from accords that kept Iran’s nuclear ambitions, if not its regional malevolence, in check.And his presidency may be remembered for altering, perhaps permanently, the nature of the U.S.-China relationship, dimming hopes for a peaceful emergence of China as a world power and laying the foundation for a new generation of economic and strategic rivalry.While historians agree that Trump was a singular figure in the office, it will be decades before the consequences of his tenure are fully known. But some pieces of his legacy already are in place.He named three Supreme Court justices and more than 220 federal judges, giving the judiciary an enduring conservative bent. He rolled back regulations and oversaw an economy that boomed until the pandemic hit. His presence increased voter turnout — both for and against him — to record levels. He received unwavering loyalty from his own party but was quick to cast aside any who displeased him.“President Trump has been the person who has returned power to the American people, not the Washington elite, and preserved our history and institutions, while others have tried to tear them down,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. “The American people elected a successful businessman who promised to go to Washington, not to tear it down, but to put them first.”At times, Trump acted like a bystander to his own presidency, opting to tweet along with a cable news segment rather than dive into an effort to change policy. And that was one of the many ways Trump changed the way that presidents communicate.Carefully crafted policy statements took a back seat, replaced by tweets and off-the-cuff remarks to reporters over the whir of helicopter blades. The discourse hardened, with swear words, personal insults and violent imagery infiltrating the presidential lexicon. And there were the untruths — more than 23,000, according to a count by The Washington Post — that Trump tossed out with little regard for their impact.It was that lack of honesty that played a role in his defeat in an election that became a referendum on how he had managed the Covid-19 pandemic, which has now killed more than 300,000 Americans.Day after day during his reelection campaign, Trump defied health guidelines and addressed packed, largely mask-less crowds, promising the nation was “rounding the corner” on the virus. He admitted that from the beginning, he set out to play down the seriousness of the virus.He held superspreader events at the White House and contracted the virus himself. And while his administration spearheaded Operation Warp Speed, which helped to produce coronavirus vaccines in record time, Trump also undermined his pubic health officials by refusing to embrace mask-wearing and suggesting unproven treatments, including the injection of disinfectant.“We have seen that Donald Trump’s style was one of the contributing factors to his failure as a president,” said Mark K. Updegrove, presidential historian and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. “His successor can look at his presidency as a cautionary tale.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-legacy-he-changed-the-presidency-but-will-it-last/story-g4KQfWF3FNz5UwkXjZZc0N.html
21-12-2020||World||Tesla’s rise made 2020 the year US auto industry went electric||Tesla Inc and Wall Street made 2020 the year that the US auto industry decided to go electric.Tesla’s market capitalization surged above $600 billion, making the once wobbly startup founded by billionaire Elon Musk worth more than the five top-selling global vehicle making groups combined. The exclamation point came on Friday when Tesla rose to a record high in frantic trading ahead of the stock’s much anticipated entrance into the benchmark S&P 500 index..For 2021, all signs point toward the industry accelerating its shift toward electrification, a turning point as historically momentous as the launch of Ford Motor Co’s moving assembly line for the Model T or General Motors ‘ 2009 bankruptcy.Tesla’s ascent came the same year that activist hedge funds and other investors ratcheted up pressure on corporations to fight climate change. Evidence is growing that more investors have concluded the century-long dominance of internal combustion engines - “ICE” in industry slang - is headed toward a close within a decade.From London to Beijing to California, political leaders also embraced plans to start phasing out internal combustion engine-only vehicles as early as 2030. Pressure to cut greenhouse gas emissions undermines the logic for significant new investments in ICE engines. Thousands of manufacturing jobs are currently tied to internal combustion in the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Japan and other countries.Other powerful forces also shook the auto industry’s status quo this year. The Covid-19 pandemic stripped away the sales and profits that incumbent automakers had counted on to fund methodical transitions to electric vehicles. China’s rapid recovery from the pandemic exerted an even more powerful gravitational pull on industry investment.This was the year GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and other top industry executives began to echo Tesla’s Musk, saying electric vehicle battery costs could soon achieve parity with internal combustion technology. Still, it remained to be seen whether consumers, particularly in the United States, are ready to say goodbye to petroleum-fueled pickup trucks and SUVs.The best-selling vehicles in the United States remain large, petroleum-burning pickup trucks. Demand for these vehicles powered a recovery for Detroit automakers after the pandemic forced factories to shut down in the spring.The best electric vehicle and battery makers could field models that match internal combustion upfront cost as soon as 2023, brokerage Bernstein wrote in a report.“ICE game over with BEV ~ 2030,” Bernstein’s auto analysts wrote, using the industry’s acronyms for internal combustion engine and Battery Electric Vehicle.The shift toward electric vehicles is speeding a parallel transformation of vehicles into largely digital machines that get much of their value from software that powers rich visual displays and features such as automated driving systems.Across the industry, century-old manufacturers such as Daimler AG are scrambling to hire programmers and artificial intelligence experts.The capability of software to manage autonomous driving systems, electricity flows from batteries and data streaming to and from vehicles is replacing horsepower as a measure of automotive engineering achievement.Tesla’s use of smartphone-style over-the-air software upgrades was once a unique feature of the Silicon Valley brand. In 2020, the best-selling model line in the United States, the Ford F-150 pickup, was redesigned to offer over-the-air software updates, making the technology as mainstream as it gets.In the best of times, traditional internal-combustion vehicles would have faced huge costs and disruptions to their workforces to evolve to electric, software-intensive vehicles. But the shock delivered by the coronavirus pandemic gave manufacturers much less money and time to adapt.Consultancy IHS Markit forecasts that global vehicle production will not match 2019 levels again until 2023. Automakers will have produced 20 million fewer vehicles by 2023 than they could have built had output stayed at 2019 levels.“Only the most agile with a Darwinian spirit will survive,” said Carlos Tavares, the Peugeot SA chief who will lead the combined Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler when that merger is completed.The pandemic also elevated the importance of China to the industry’s future. That country’s swift recovery from the pandemic amplified the gravitational pull of its huge market on automotive investment, despite anti-China rhetoric from US and European politicians.China’s drive to reduce dependence on petroleum is compelling automakers to shift investment toward battery electric and hybrid vehicles, and re-center design and engineering activities to Chinese cities from traditional hubs in Nagoya, Wolfsburg and Detroit. Tesla said it will establish a design and research center in China.Daimler AG Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius put it bluntly in October: “We need to look at our production footprint and where it makes sense, shift our production,” he said during a video call. “Last year we sold around 700,000 passenger cars in China. The next biggest market is the US with between 320,000 and 330,000 cars.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-s-rise-made-2020-the-year-us-auto-industry-went-electric/story-hjedpILktZ5mx7AJAkNRXN.html
21-12-2020||World||Japan’s $1 trillion budget highlights Covid-19 challenge to growth, debt||Japan’s cabinet approved on Monday a record $1.03 trillion budget draft for the next fiscal year starting in April 2021, the Ministry of Finance said, as the coronavirus and stimulus spending puts pressure on already dire public finances.The 106.6 trillion yen ($1.03 trillion) annual budget also got a boost from record military and welfare outlays. It marked a 4% rise from this year’s initial level, rising for nine years in a row, with new debt making up more than a third of revenue.From Europe to America, policymakers globally have unleashed a torrent of monetary and fiscal stimulus to prevent a deep and prolonged recession as the pandemic shut international borders and sent many out of work.In Japan, fiscal reform has been shelved as Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga prioritised efforts to contain the pandemic and boost growth, despite public debt at more than twice the size of Japan’s $5 trillion economy.“How to balance the coronavirus response with fiscal reform has hardly been debated in Japan,” said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research. “Ultra-low interest rates under the Bank of Japan’s prolonged monetary easing may have caused fiscal discipline to be paralysed.”The spending plan, which was in line with a Reuters report out last week, must be approved by parliament early next year.It will be rolled out along with a third extra budget for this fiscal year as a combined 15-month budget aimed for seamless spending to ease the virus pain and back Suga’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality and digital transformation.“We had to strike a right balance between the needs to prevent the spread of infections, revive the economy and achieve fiscal reform,” Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters after a cabinet meeting.“That was the most difficult task in compiling this budget.” The government’s fiscal 2021 primary budget deficit - excluding new bond sales and debt servicing - is seen at 20.4 trillion yen, more than double this year’s initial estimates, making the budget-balancing goal further elusive.Rating agency Fitch in July cut its outlook on Japan’s debt rating to negative from stable, warning of the Covid-19 impact on rising public debt.“The massive stimulus spending rolled out this fiscal year may raise worry about ‘fiscal cliff’, which could justify calls for more spending in the coming fiscal year,” said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-1-trillion-budget-highlights-covid-19-challenge-to-growth-debt/story-6VaM9tZXBVlBafq15XHCfL.html
21-12-2020||World||Google, Facebook laws critical for media future: Australia regulator chief||Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman (ACCC) Rod Sims said proposed laws that will make Australia the first country in the world to force Google and Facebook to pay for news were fair and critical for the survival of the media industry.Sims said he was surprised to hear criticisms from Google about the draft legislation unveiled by the Australian government earlier this month.Google last week declared the code unworkable, citing in particular a requirement to provide publishers with two weeks’ notice of certain changes to algorithms and internal practice. “We thought they were comfortable with that ... so we were very surprised that they’re still complaining about that,” Sims said in an interview on Monday for Reuters Next. Some media organisations, meanwhile, are unhappy that the code includes a “two-way value exchange” when deciding commercial agreements, which requires media companies to consider the value they receive from Facebook and Google users viewing their content. “To be honest, we never thought that value was very large, because if the platforms weren’t there, our judgment is people would go straight to the news media businesses website anyway,” Sims said, noting the first draft of the code employed a one-way value exchange. “But we do understand that there is some value in that, so it was only fair to recognise that, after all, we want a bargaining code that is seen to be fair and I think two-way value achieves that.”The ACCC has increasingly focused on the rapidly growing market power of Google and Facebook. It has two inquiries open into advertising technology and mobile app stores, with reports due in January and March, respectively. Sims, who expressed concern about excessive pricing and self-preferencing by the app stores, said the reports would put a spotlight on the state-of-play and added the regulator would continue to focus on data concerns in 2021. “I’m hopeful that not just Australia, but companies overseas will benefit from what we find,” Sims said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-facebook-laws-critical-for-media-future-australia-regulator-chief/story-6RqtRfkH8IB2d9cdQmZkCN.html
21-12-2020||World||What’s in the $900 billion US Covid-19 aid package||US congressional leaders reached an agreement on a $900 billion package on Sunday which will provide the first new aid in months to an economy hammered by the coronavirus pandemic. The US Congress was working under a deadline of midnight Sunday -- needing to reach consensus both on assistance to hard-pressed American households and companies and on the 2021 federal budget in order to avoid a government shutdown.“We have agreed to a package of nearly $900 billion. It is packed with targeted policies to help struggling Americans who have already waited too long,” Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement.Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer confirmed an agreement had been reached with Republicans and the White House on a deal that “delivers urgently needed funds to save the lives and livelihoods of the American people as the virus accelerates.”According to a summary released by Democratic house speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, here are the details of the package: Checks in the mail: The bill includes $166 billion in new direct payments of up to $600 per adult and child, for individuals making up to $75,000 a year and $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000 a year. The bill expands direct payments to mixed-status households.More unemployment benefits: An additional $300 per week for some unemployment recipients.US postal service grant: Congress agrees to convert a $10 billion loan approved in March into direct funding for USPS without requiring repayment.Payroll loans: $284 billion for government payroll loans, including expanded eligibility for nonprofits and newspaper and TV and radio broadcasters, $15 billion for live venues, independent movie theatres, and cultural institutions and $20 billion for targeted disaster grantsBack-to-school funding: $82 billion for colleges and schools, including for heating-and-cooling system upgrades to mitigate virus transmission and reopen classrooms, and $10 billion for childcare assistance. Includes $54.3 billion for K-12 schools and $22.7 billion for higher educationBusiness meal write-offs: A new tax break for business meal expenses, nicknamed the “three-martini” deduction.Ending surprise medical billing: Insured patients only need to pay in-network costs when an emergency or other issue forces them to use a medical provider who isn’t covered by their network.Transport industry help: $45 billion for transportation aid, including $15 billion to U.S. passenger airlines for payroll assistance, $14 billion for transit systems, $10 billion for state highway funding, $2 billion for airports, $1 billion for airline contractors and $1 billion for passenger railroad Amtrak.Rent and eviction aid: $25 billion for rent and utility payment assistance for people struggling to stay in their homes, and an extension of the eviction moratorium until Jan. 31. States will receive a minimum of $200 million in assistance.Vaccine distribution aid: $30 billion to support procurement and distribution of the vaccine, “ensuring it’s free and rapidly distributed to everyone,” as Schumer said.More to fight hunger: $13 billion for food assistance, including additional funding for food banks and senior nutrition programs, college student access to the federal government’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.Farm aid: Another $13 billion for direct payments, purchases and loans to farmers and ranchers.Expanded Pell Grants: New grants for college tuition, which would reach 500,000 new recipients.Internet access: $7 billion to give more Americans broadband internet access, including $1.9 billion to replace telecom network equipment that poses national security risks and $3.2 billion for a new temporary benefit program to help low-income Americans get access to broadband serviceGlobal virus alliances: $4 billion for an international vaccine allianceTax credits: Enhanced tax credits to encourage low-income housing construction, businesses to keep employees on the payroll, employers to provide paid sick leave, and for low-income workers.Minority-owned businesses: $12 billion for minority-owned and very small businesses that struggled to access earlier Payroll Protection Program financing.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-s-in-the-900-billion-us-covid-19-aid-package/story-ZnEWPPmGWElJiVSVf1nV5K.html
21-12-2020||World||US asked to prioritize frontline essential workers as distribution of Moderna shots begins||An advisory panel on Sunday recommended US frontline essential workers and people 75 and older should be next in line to get inoculated as the distribution of Moderna Inc’s vaccine, the second approved coronavirus vaccine, began across the country.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 13 to 1 to recommend 30 million frontline essential workers, which include first responders, teachers, food and agriculture, manufacturing, US Postal Service, public transit, and grocery store workers, have the next priority for the vaccines. In all, the move would make 51 million people eligible to get inoculated in the next round. It was not immediately clear when the next round would begin.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAbout 200 million people including non-frontline workers such as those in media, finance, energy and IT and communication industries, persons in the 65-74 age group, and those aged 16-64 years with high-risk conditions should be in the ensuing round, the panel recommended.States, which are the ones distributing shots to their residents, will use the advisory panel’s guidelines to decide on how to allocate the vaccines while supplies are scarce.Inoculation against the disease is key to safely reopening large parts of the economy and reducing the risks of illness at crowded meatpacking plants, factories and warehouses. However, confusion has broken out over who exactly is considered essential during a pandemic. Ahead of the vote, many companies and industry groups had been lobbying to get their US workers in line to receive the vaccines immediately after healthcare professionals and long-term care facility residents.Meanwhile, trucks of FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc started picking up the doses from warehouses for deliveries to hospitals and other sites.Vials of Moderna’s vaccine were filled in pharmaceutical services provider Catalent Inc’s facility in Bloomington, Indiana. Distributor McKesson Corp is shipping doses from facilities in places including Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis, Tennessee - close to air hubs for UPS and FedEx.Both FedEx and UPS said the shipments were running smoothly and everything was going exactly as planned.Separately, US health officials are monitoring the new strain of Covid-19 emerging in the United Kingdom, US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on Sunday, adding that any mutation shows people must keep protecting themselves from the novel coronavirus while awaiting vaccination.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and scientists announced on Saturday that the new virus strain had led to spiraling infection numbers, tightening the Covid-19 restrictions for London and nearby areas and disrupting the Christmas holiday plans of millions of people.Also Read: Health ministry meeting today after spread of mutant coronavirus strain in UKThe variant, which officials say is up to 70% more transmissible than the original, has prompted concerns about a wider spread. Several European countries, including Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, said they were taking measures to prevent people arriving from Britain, including bans on flights and trains.The distribution of Moderna’s vaccine to more than 3,700 locations in the United States will vastly widen the rollout started last week by Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE. US Covid-19 vaccine program head Moncef Slaoui said it was most likely the first Moderna vaccine shot, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Friday, would be given on Monday morning.“We look forward to the vaccine. It’s going to be slightly easier to distribute because it doesn’t require as low (a) temperature as Pfizer,” Slaoui said on CNN. The US government plans to deliver 5.9 million Moderna shots and 2 million Pfizer shots this week.Data from CDC shows 2.84 million doses have been distributed and 556,208 shots administered thus far.The start of delivery for the Moderna vaccine will significantly widen availability of Covid-19 vaccines as US deaths caused by the respiratory disease have reached more than 316,000 in the 11 months since the first documented US cases. Some states are choosing to use Moderna’s shots for harder-to-reach rural areas because they can be stored for 30 days in standard-temperature refrigerators. Pfizer’s must be shipped and stored at minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) and can be held for only five days at standard refrigerator temperatures. Initial doses were given to health professionals. Programs by pharmacies Walgreens and CVS to distribute the Pfizer vaccine to long-term care facilities are expected to start on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-asked-to-prioritize-frontline-essential-workers-as-distribution-of-moderna-shots-begins/story-inV8Krq38fNXpdN8PPpYWL.html

21-12-2020||World||What do we know about coronavirus’ latest strain found in UK||The United Kingdom announced a surprise lockdown on Saturday in London and parts of the country amid a surge in the cases of the coronavirus disease after the discovery of a new strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. According to experts, the new strain is 70% more infectious than other strains of the virus. It is believed that most of the new cases in the country are driven by this variant, with up to 60% of the cases in London being caused by it.Here’s everything you need to know about the latest strain of coronavirus in the UK:Why is the variant causing concern?There has been concern about the latest variant as it is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus and according to experts, this would result in its spread more easily. Although, nothing can be said with certainty but as a precautionary measure the country has been put into a fresh lockdown. “It is really too early to tell… but from what we see so far it is growing very quickly, it is growing faster than (a previous variant) ever grew, but it is important to keep an eye on this,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during a press conference.How new is the variant?The variant is not new. In fact, it was first detected in September. In November, around a quarter of cases in London were from the new variant. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December, according to a report in the BBC. Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, said, “The amount of evidence in the public domain is woefully inadequate to draw strong or firm opinions on whether the virus has truly increased transmission.”How far is the spread in the UK and the world?The variant has been found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, the South East and eastern England. Cases elsewhere in the country do not seem to have taken off. Data from Nextstrain, which has been monitoring the genetic codes of the viral samples around the world, suggest cases in Denmark and Australia have come from the UK. The Netherlands has also reported cases. A similar variant that has emerged in South Africa shares some of the same mutations, but appears to be unrelated to this one.Will the mutation be more deadly?There is no evidence to suggest the same, although this is being monitored. However, just increasing transmission would be enough to cause problems for hospitals. If the new variant means more people are infected more quickly, that would, in turn, lead to more people needing hospital treatment.Will the vaccines work against the new variant?Almost certainly yes, or at least for now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-do-we-know-about-coronavirus-latest-strain-found-in-uk/story-NXtJHgkY7v8HGknO5jyItK.html

21-12-2020||World||Surprise elections in Nepal next year||A little less than three years after he was sworn in as prime minister for the second time, Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli on Sunday morning dropped a bombshell on his rivals in the ruling Nepal Communist Party. PM Oli’s cabinet recommended dissolution of the 275-member House of Representatives that was elected in 2017, when the opposition Nepali Congress suffered a defeat by a landslide in the polls.PM Oli’s surprise move on Sunday sent his rivals within the ruling Nepal Communist Party running for cover, arguing that Nepal’s constitution did not have a provision for dissolution of Parliament by a Prime Minister at the head of a majority government.Bishnu Rijal, a central committee member of the ruling party, said that instead of seeking a compromise with his rivals in the party, PM Oli had chosen to dissolve Parliament. “The prime minister has lost the majority in the parliamentary party, central committee and the secretariat of the party,” a Reuters report quoted him as saying.President Bidya Devi Bhandari accepted the recommendation and announced national elections in two phases to be held on April 30 and May 10.People familiar with the matter said PM Oli’s move to dissolve Parliament would give him a free hand to run the government and split the party formed in 2018 by the merger of his Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal- Maoist Centre.For months, Prachanda had been trying to pin PM Oli down and had led several revolts against the prime minister, demanding a greater say in running the government. PM Oli, who had led them to victory on the basis of a nationalist agenda had refused to cede any space and dropped enough hints that he was prepared to split the Nepal Communist Party if he was pushed to the wall.This is an eventuality that the Chinese Communist Party had been struggling to avoid for months.Beijing had deputed its envoy to Nepal Hou Yanqi to hold a series of meetings in late April and early May — around the same time that China’s soldiers were crossing the line in eastern Ladakh — to hold consultations with Nepal’s communist leaders to get them to stay united.Ambassador Hou continued her interventions to keep the NCP united over the next few months. But PM Oli’s camp soon enough figured out that China was okay with the ruling NCP giving PM Oli the pink slip if this is what it would take to avoid a split in the party.PM Oli, who had spent 14 years in jail for opposing the now-abolished monarchy in the 1970s and 1980s, wasn’t ready to fade into oblivion yet.Nepal watchers said China, which initially seemed to back 68-year-old Oli, had changed tack earlier this year and was willing to sacrifice him if it would help keep the NCP united.Ambassador Hou was working on this pitch when last month, PM Oli is believed to have told her off, suggesting that he was capable of handling challenges within his party without any assistance from other countries.The Chinese envoy didn’t exactly back off but her subsequent interventions were done quietly. When meeting politicians from the ruling party, she would move around in unmarked cars or taxis in Kathmandu, said a Nepal watcher.“There were two other formulas that the Chinese envoy continued to work on,” a person who tracks developments in Nepal politics said on condition of anonymity. Apart from negotiating a format where the NCP’s former prime minister Dahal and Madhav Nepal hold the strings of power minus PM Oli, ambassador Hou also explored the possibility of the NCP shunting out PM Oli and promoting Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam instead.Since Gautam comes from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) that PM Oli headed before the 2018 merger, it was expected that this would minimise the damage that PM Oli could wreak on the party in case of a split. The fourth option that the Chinese envoy did explore was the possibility that the senior leadership of the NCP let the next generation leaders of the party who would be more amenable to a negotiated settlement take charge, the Nepal watcher said.PM Oli’s Sunday surprise, however, upended the Chinese efforts as well.Oli aide Rajan Bhattarai said the prime minister had made the move because of the backlash against him by his party, which had also asked him to consider quitting as its president.“So he decided to face the people in an election,” Bhattarai told Reuters. “This is the best way in a democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/surprise-elections-in-nepal-next-year/story-yVIPZsuXZDH5g3YFgPEh5L.html
21-12-2020||World||Biden unveils team to deal with climate crisis||President-elect Joe Biden on Saturday introduced key members of his environmental team and said his administration would make the fight against the climate crisis a pillar of his drive to rebuild the pandemic-hit US economy.Biden said these nominees will lead his administration’s “ambitious plan to address an existential threat of our time - climate change”.“Folks, we’re in a crisis,” Biden said at the event in Wilmington, Delaware. “Just like we need to be a unified nation to respond to Covid-19, we need a unified national response to climate change.”The nominees introduced on Saturday include Representative Deb Haaland as the new interior secretary. Biden also said he wants to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations and 1.5 million energy-efficient homes and public housing units.He said his administration will create a quarter million jobs “right away” by hiring people to plug millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that are deemed a health and safety risk.Biden repeated that he will rejoin the Paris climate accord, which President Donald Trump abandoned, and restore a slew of Obama-era environmental regulations that Trump eliminated.For other jobs, Biden said he has picked Gina McCarthy, Obama’s environmental protection agency administrator, to lead a new White House office of climate policy.Biden has also tapped Michael Regan, North Carolina’s top environmental regulator, to run the environmental protection agency and Brenda Mallory, an environmental attorney, to direct the council on environmental ouality. Regan and Mallory are Black. Biden said that with Saturday’s announcements, his Cabinet will feature six African-Americans.Cyberattack under control, says Trump Trump on Saturday downplayed a massive cyberattack on US government agencies, declaring it “under control” and undercutting the assessment by his own administration that Russia was to blame.“I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,” Trump tweeted in his first public comments on the hack, adding that “Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens” and suggesting without offering evidence that China “may” also be involved.“There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA,” he added, in his latest allegation of mass fraud in the November 3 election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-unveils-team-to-deal-with-climate-crisis/story-l5cFedaP8CUsdGjJ8pQq3O.html
21-12-2020||World||New UK coronavirus strain triggers alarm, curbs||Concerns over a new strain of the coronavirus that is feared to be more contagious forced at least five countries on Sunday to ban travel from the United Kingdom, with several others, including India, considering similar restrictions. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday that a new variant of the Sars-Cov-2 has spread rapidly in parts of the country, and was estimated by scientists to be 70% more transmissible. The announcement was made when the PM unveiled a new fourth tier of restrictions to come into force in UK’s capital and parts of the country’s south-east.Less than 24 hours following that announcement, Netherlands – which too has detected some cases of the new variant – suspended flights from the UK. Later in the day, Germany, Belgium, Austria and Italy announced they too will restrict travel.A similar decision could also be taken in India, where the government convened an emergency meeting on Monday morning. “We are watching the situation closely and do not rule out a travel restriction. A decision will be taken at the meeting,” said a senior government official, asking not to be named.Health ministry officials too said that they will hold a meeting to assess the threat from the new variant, news agency PTI reported. “The Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) chaired by the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) will hold a meeting on Monday morning to discuss the issue of the mutated variant of the coronavirus reported from the UK. WHO’s India representative Dr Roderico H Ofrin, who is also a member of the JMG, is likely to participate in the meeting,” PTI quoted an unnamed official as saying.The development came days after London confirmed that Johnson had accepted India’s invite to be the chief guest the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi on January 26. The travel curbs also compound problems for the United Kingdom as it finally exits the European Union on December 31 after a transition period this year. London and Brussels have so far failed to reach a post-Brext trade deal, raising the prospect of chaos in goods traffic. While Johnson and British scientists said it was too early to determine if the new variant was more deadly, other UK officials in London said on Sunday that it was “out of control”. Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show whether the virus is under control, Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock replied: “It is out of control and we need to bring it under control… The cases in the Tier 4 areas have absolutely rocketed in the last few days – the last two weeks or so. I am really worried about the NHS (National Health Service). “That is only just below the number there were at the first peak. It is another reason why everybody needs to follow the new rules and take that personal responsibility,” he added, describing the situation as “incredibly difficult”. Viruses mutate often as the biological process of replication within hosts they infect is not always a perfect process. The Sars-Cov-2 has also been mutating, but none of these changes have been seen as worrying as yet. One variant, however, overtook a previous variant of the virus early this summer.According to experts from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, the new variant is significant because it now “accounts for an increasing proportion of cases in parts of England”, “has an unusually large number of genetic changes, particularly in the spike protein”, and the mutations have “have potential biological effects”. Hancock said it was on Friday that scientists showed ministers evidence of the “causality” between the new fast-transmitting variant and the spike in new cases in London and south-east England, which prompted the measures outlined by Johnson on Saturday.London and south-east England have been placed in the new Tier 4 of the alert system, which has varying curbs, from Tier 1 (lowest) to Tier 4 (toughest; equivalent to full lockdown). People are prohibited from travelling to and out of Tier 4.Hancock indicated in Sunday media interviews that London’s lockdown could last months, until a vaccine is rolled out across the population. So far, 350,000 people have received the first of their two-dose vaccine delivered by Pfizer/BioNTech. “There are no easy answers or easy options. I think the mistake would be to ignore new scientific evidence”, he added.London’s airports, train stations and roads were clogged on Saturday night as thousands tried to escape the new lockdown restrictions that came into effect early on Sunday. Scotland Yard said the police would enforce Tier 4 rules from Sunday.People’s fury at Christmas plans being cancelled was reflected in screaming newspaper headlines on Sunday and veteran Conservative MP Charles Walker calling on Hancock to resign, amidst growing criticism in the ruling over party over handling of the virus situation.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-coronavirus-strain-triggers-alarm-curbs/story-oS9ZpGYFlyF1VokTHzxO7N.html
21-12-2020||World||Trump again turns to top court, challenging Pennsylvania loss||President Donald Trump’s campaign said it turned to the US Supreme Court to challenge the election results in Pennsylvania, filing yet another long-shot appeal despite weeks of courtroom defeats and an Electoral College vote last week that formalized Joe Biden’s victory.The latest filing, announced on Sunday, takes the unorthodox step of trying to overturn three separate Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions with a single appeal. Although all three decisions are weeks old, the campaign asked the court to put the cases on an ultra-expedited track with the goal of a ruling before Congress meets Jan. 6 to count the electoral votes.The Supreme Court has already rejected two efforts to overturn Biden’s victory in pivotal states, each time without any justice publicly dissenting. On Dec. 8, the court turned away a bid by Republican lawmakers to reverse Biden’s win in Pennsylvania. Three days later the court refused to let Texas sue to challenge the results in four states.The new Trump appeal centers on the 2.6 million mail-in ballots cast in Pennsylvania. The campaign is challenging an Oct. 23 ruling that said election officials shouldn’t try to verify that the signature on the ballot envelope matches the one on file. The appeal also seeks to overturn a Nov. 23 ruling that said officials shouldn’t reject ballots because they lack a name, address or date on the envelope.In addition, the appeal challenges a Nov. 17 ruling that said Trump campaign representatives had adequate access to observe the vote-counting process in Philadelphia. The campaign says the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unconstitutionally changed the election rules established by the state legislature.Overturning the Pennsylvania results wouldn’t be nearly enough for Trump to reverse Biden’s overall victory. Even if Biden somehow lost the state’s 20 electoral votes, he would still have 286 votes, comfortably above the 270 needed for victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-again-turns-to-top-court-challenging-pennsylvania-loss/story-lzj6y7cxGmTXmUESj2S69H.html
21-12-2020||World||Japan sets record $52 billion military budget with stealth jets, long-range missiles||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s government approved a ninth consecutive rise in military spending on Monday, funding the development of an advanced stealth fighter and longer-range anti-ship missile to counter China’s growing military power.The Ministry of Defense will get a record 5.34 trillion yen ($51.7 billion) for the year starting in April, up 1.1% from this year. With Suga’s large majority in parliament, enactment of the budget is all but certain.Suga is continuing the controversial military expansion pursued by his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, to give Japan’s forces new planes, missiles and aircraft carriers with greater range and potency against potential foes including neighbouring China.China plans to raise its military spending 6.6% this year, the smallest increase in three decades.Japan is buying longer-range missiles and considering arming and training its military to strike distant land targets in China, North Korea and other parts of Asia.A planned jet fighter, the first in three decades, is expected to cost around $40 billion and be ready in the 2030s. That project, which will be led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd with help from Lockheed Martin Corp, gets $706 million in the new budget.Japan will spend $323 million to begin development of a long-range anti-ship missile to defend its southwestern Okinawan island chain.Other big purchases include $628 million for six Lockheed F-35 stealth fighters, including two short-takeoff and vertical-landing (STOVL) B variants that will operate off a converted helicopter carrier.The military will also get $912 million to build two compact warships that can operate with fewer sailors than conventional destroyers, easing pressure on a navy struggling to find recruits in an ageing population.Japan also wants two new warships to carry powerful new Aegis air and ballistic missile defence radars that have much as three times the range of older models. The government has not yet estimated the cost of the plan, which replaces a project cancelled in June to construct two ground Aegis Ashore stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-sets-record-52-billion-military-budget-with-stealth-jets-long-range-missiles/story-tTdEkRJ4altHqqRrpGXryN.html
21-12-2020||World||US congress reaches deal on $900 billion pandemic relief plan||Congressional leaders reached a deal on a roughly $900 billion spending package to bolster the US economy amid the continued coronavirus pandemic giving lawmakers a short timetable to review and pass the second largest economic-rescue measure in the nation’s history.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced the accord Sunday. The legislative text was still being written, but the House was expected to vote on it Monday, followed by the Senate.The plan would provide direct payments of $600 to most Americans and $300-per-week in enhanced unemployment benefits through March, according to lawmakers and aides. Expiring programs for gig workers and the long-term unemployed also would continue.There would be $284 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program that provides forgivable loans to small businesses. The package includes money for transportation -- including for airlines -- vaccine distribution, schools and universities, and food aid.Negotiators couldn’t bridge partisan differences over a liability shield for companies wanted by some Republicans, and aid for state and local governments that Democrats had demanded, and left those out. A last-minute dispute over the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending authority threatened to derail an agreement until a compromise late Saturday cleared the way for the broader deal.The agreement came together after multiple rounds of negotiations over the past week among Pelosi, Schumer, McConnell and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also took part in the talks.The relief plan will be attached to a $1.4 trillion bill that would fund the federal government through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2021. The haggling over the relief package forced Congress to twice pass temporary funding for government operations. The current stopgap expires at midnight Sunday. The House passed another one-day extension to give time for votes on Monday; the Senate was expected to take it up Sunday night.“At long last we have the bipartisan breakthrough the country has needed,” McConnell said on the Senate floor.Pelosi and Schumer lauded the agreement, though they expressed disappointment that the package wasn’t bigger.“While this bill is far from perfect, nor is it the bill that we would pass if Democrats had a majority in the Senate. It is a strong shot in the arm to help American families weather the storm,” Schumer said at a news conference with Pelosi. “We will do more, we must do more.”The White House said President Donald Trump supports the deal.“President Trump has pushed hard for months to send Americans badly needed financial relief,” spokesman Ben Williamson said in an email. “We look forward to Congress sending a bill to his desk imminently for signature.”The deal came about after a months-long standoff that followed passage in March of the largest in a series of pandemic relief packages: a $1.8 trillion mix of spending and tax breaks that represented the biggest such measure in US history. Since then, the economy has struggled to fully recover and another round of lockdowns is threatening to put millions of jobs at risk as deaths from the novel coronavirus rise above 300,000.Pelosi and the Trump administration were close to a $2 trillion deal before the Nov. 3 election -- which Senate Republicans never fully embraced -- and the final agreement is less than half that.While the deal would represent a substantial infusion of aid, it also will put immediate pressure on the incoming Biden administration to spell out the next steps and then wrangle it through Congress.President-elect Joe Biden last week called the emerging deal an “important down payment on what’s going to have to be done at the end of January, the beginning of February.”McConnell has said he expects another relief proposal from Biden, but he hasn’t backed away from his opposition to direct aid to states and localities, or his insistence that employers be protected from Covid-19-related lawsuits. That signals the fight over any new round won’t be any less contentious.The accord comes as the economy is showing signs of deterioration.Some 7.8 million Americans have fallen into poverty since June as benefits from the previous covid relief package lapsed, according to an analysis of ongoing Census data by economists at the University of Chicago and University of Notre Dame.The 2.4 percentage point rise in the estimated US poverty rate through November is nearly double the largest annual increase since the 1960s, the economists said. The increase in poverty has been sharpest in states with more limited unemployment insurance benefits.Separately, a government report last week showed US retail sales tumbled much more than expected in November, while the latest weekly jobless claims figure jumped to the highest level in three months. Payrolls might even contract in December, said Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. The relief package “should be very helpful for the economy,” he said on Bloomberg TV.“Nine hundred billion is a large number,” Feroli said. “You’re talking about a 2% to 3% boost to GDP” over time, he estimated.The package also has implications for the still-unsettled contest for control of the Senate. McConnell told GOP senators on a private call Wednesday that passage will help Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who face Jan. 5 runoffs, according to a person familiar with the conversation.Democrats would gain control of the Senate if both lose. McConnell specifically mentioned that their Democratic opponents, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, were using the delay in getting a deal and additional stimulus payments as attack lines in their campaigns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-reaches-deal-on-900-billion-pandemic-relief-plan/story-5Bb9AIeekKyM6snL9WNevL.html

21-12-2020||World||Italy detects new mutated Covid-19 strain in UK returnee||Italy on Sunday said it has detected a new coronavirus strain with mutations in a person who recently returned from the United Kingdom.On Saturday, the United Kingdom government locked down parts of the country including London after admitting that more than half of all new Covid-19 cases had been caused by a mutated, more infectious coronavirus strain.“The patient and their partner returned from the United Kingdom several days ago, landing in Rome’s Fiumicino airport. They are now isolated and have observed, together with family and close contacts, all procedures proscribed by the health authorities,” Sputnik quoted the ministry’s statement.According to the communication, the genome of the UK coronavirus strain has been established by experts of the Celio military hospital in Rome.The new strain of Covid-19 is “out of control”, said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Sunday.“The only way you can do that is by restricting social contacts and essentially, especially in Tier 4 areas, everybody needs to behave as if they may well have the virus and that is the way that we can get it under control and keep people safe,” he added.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday announced new tier-4 Covid-19 restrictions in parts of England, including London, due to the rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus, limiting the celebrations.A growing number of countries on Sunday halted flights from the UK following the discovery of a new variant of Covid-19, which is said to spread faster than other versions of the virus.According to CNN, Italy Foreign Affairs Minister Luigi Di Malo on Sunday informed that the country will also suspend flights to and from the UK citing the new strain of the coronavirus, although he did not provide more details.CNN reported that the Netherlands government is banning all passenger flights coming from the UK from Sunday morning until the New Year in order to minimise the risk of the new strain from spreading in the country as much as possible, according to a press release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-detects-new-mutated-covid-19-strain-in-uk-returnee/story-Fz9jEM8BftuhfSKAcqgzbI.html
21-12-2020||World||Our investment plans on track, Indian economy has strength to bounce back: Saudi||Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, on Sunday said its investment plans in India are on track, noting that the Indian economy has the strength to recover from the adverse impact of the coronavirus crisis.In February last year, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced that Saudi Arabia would invest over USD 100 billion in India in petrochemicals, refining, infrastructure, mining and manufacturing, agriculture and several other sectors.“Our plans to invest in India are on track and we are in discussion to prioritise investment opportunities in several sectors in both countries,” Saudi Ambassador Dr Saud bin Mohammed Al Sati told PTI in an interview. Stating that Saudi Arabia values India as a strategic partner and a close friend, Al Sati identified ongoing cooperation in areas of training, knowledge sharing and combating terrorism as key elements of the partnership in defence and security sphere. Also Read: The Indian economy is bouncing back | OpinionAl Sati complimented India’s measures to revive its economy in view of the impact of the pandemic and said the economic recovery of both countries will help elevate other economies in the region as well.“The economic relief package provided by India for its most prominent sectors is commendable. As the fifth-largest global economy and the largest economy in South Asia, the Indian economy has the impetus to recover from the impact of the ongoing pandemic,” he said. Without commenting on Army Chief Gen MM Naravane’s visit to Saudi Arabia last week, the Ambassador said the setting up of the Strategic Partnership Council by the two countries opened new avenues of cooperation in several sectors including defence and security and counter-terrorism.“The Strategic (Partnership) Council set up by the two countries in 2019 has opened new avenues on partnership in strategic areas like defence, security counter-terrorism, energy security and renewable energy,” he said.Gen Naravane on Sunday held extensive talks with Commander of Royal Saudi land forces Gen Fahd Bin Abdullah Mohammed Al-Mutir as he began a two-day rare visit to the Gulf country to lay the ground for deeper military ties.In the first-ever visit by a head of the Indian Army, Gen Naravane travelled to Saudi capital city Riyadh last week where he held talks with top military brass.The two sides set up the Strategic Partnership Council during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Riyadh in October last year. The council is mandated to monitor the progress of strategic relationships in a whole range of key areas.  “The current decade has witnessed a remarkable stride in the relations between Saudi Arabia and India. What was once viewed as ties between two friendly countries is now a strong strategic partnership between two formidable economies,” Al Sati said.  “From energy cooperation, security and defense, burgeoning trade relations to health cooperation, the nature of this relationship has diversified immensely allowing for expanded growth. The leadership on both sides have heralded this transformation for Saudi – India ties,” he said.Also Read: India’s economy to struggle with effects of Covid-19 through 2025On trade partnership, the envoy referred to the decision by Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) to invest approximately USD 1.3 billion in Reliance Retail and USD 1.5 billion in Reliance’s Jio platforms “Saudi Aramco is committed to investing in India’s energy sector. Aramco’s decision to buy a stake in Reliance Industries Oil to Chemical business and Aramco’s commitment to invest in the West Coast refinery petrochemical project signifies the interest Saudi Arabia places in the development of India’s energy sector,” he said. Apart from this, Al Sati said Saudi Arabia is continuing to explore new investment opportunities in India. The envoy also highlighted Saudi Arabia’s recent Labor Reform Initiative (LRI), saying they will further help Saudi Arabia and India to cement their economic relationship. “It will enhance the contractual relationship between workers and employers, and will support the Kingdom’s vision of establishing an attractive job market, empowering and developing labour competencies and developing the work environment,” he said. “The initiative is a welcome step in improving the efficiency of the work environment in Saudi Arabia and will complement similar initiatives launched in this regard,” he said. Al Sati said the measures will also contribute towards reducing the disparity between Saudi workers and expatriates. “The positive economic benefits expected from LRI include the development of the local market and the flexibility of work, increase in productivity within the private sector attracting highly skilled talent, and will ultimately help in achieving the goals of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 through the national transformation programme,” he said.Asked about political developments in Yemen, the Saudi Ambassador said the forming of the new government in that country is an important step in the context of implementing the Riyadh agreement. “We hope that this step will help in realising peace and stability in Yemen and in achieving the aspirations of the Yemeni people for a political solution that ends the crisis in Yemen,” he said.The Riyadh agreement was pushed by Saudi Arabia in an effort to end hostilities between Yemen’s internationally recognised government and southern separatists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/our-investment-plans-on-track-indian-economy-has-strength-to-bounce-back-saudi-arabia/story-c8xKJfQppxh26CscfkcawI.html
21-12-2020||World||Europe isolates UK as Covid-19 cases touch new high||Several European countries banned flights and freight links with the UK on Sunday as the new Covid-19 variant sent the number of new cases to a record day-high of 35,928 and the lack of a deal with the EU added new uncertainty and urgency to the post-Brexit phase in 10 days from January 1.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minster, demanded that the Brexit transition period that ends on December 31 be extended, a demand Prime Minister Boris Johnson has so far resisted. She said: “It’s now imperative that PM seeks an agreement to extend the Brexit transition period. The new Covid strain - & the various implications of it - means we face a profoundly serious situation, & it demands our 100% attention. It would be unconscionable to compound it with Brexit”.France banned freight traffic through Eurotunnel for 48 hours from Sunday night over concerns over the spread of the new Covid-19 variant, leading to the closure of the Dover port, which could result in what industry called a “devastating effect”. It also suspended air traffic with the UK for 48 hours.Also Read: Unclear If US has UK Covid-19 mutation, says chief scientific adviser SlaouiRod McKenzie of the Road Haulage Association said: “It’s only 48 hours, but the French ban will have a devastating effect on the supply chain. We have seen in recent days the queues on both sides of the channel because of Brexit stockpiling and the Christmas rush and now border closures will mean everything including perishable food supplies will be impacted”.“We depend on the short straits for our daily supplies. What we are talking about is everything: factory parts, fresh and frozen vegetables, and all the Christmas deliveries,” he added.Other European countries such as Ireland, Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands also banned flights to and from the UK, while others were considering doing so. The Eurostar trains to Belgium are not operating, while Eurotunnel suspended access to the Folkestone terminal for traffic and freight heading to Calais.Johnson is scheduled to hold an COBRA emergency meeting on Monday morning, as the virus-related crisis is likely to be accentuated by uncertainty over trading and other arrangements when the Brexit transition period ends on December 31. Talks in Brussels are yet to reach a conclusion.The developments were triggered following the imposition of a new lockdown on London and south-east England from Sunday morning, and within hours of Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock stating that the new variant of the virus is “out of control”.The Port of Dover – one of the major access points with Europe for trade and road traffic – said in a statement: “Due to border restrictions in France access to the Ferry Terminal at the Port of Dover remains suspended to all accompanied traffic leaving the UK until further notice”.The developments led to concerns over potential disruption to food supplies, since the UK imports much of its food from Europe under smooth, tariff-free trade arrangements in place for decades during its membership of the European Union – which ends on December 31.Food and Drink Federation chief executive Ian Wright warned on Sunday: “Tonight’s suspension of accompanied freight traffic from the UK to France has the potential to cause serious disruption to UK Christmas fresh food supplies - and exports of UK food and drink.”Also Read: Israelis returning from UK to be sent to quarantine hotels“Continental truckers will not want to travel here if they have a real fear of getting marooned. The government must very urgently persuade the French government to exempt accompanied freight from its ban,” he added.Freight industry lobby group Logistics UK appealed for calm from shoppers, stating that it is “maintaining close contact with UK government to ensure that supplies of fresh produce are available throughout Christmas and the New Year.”The British Retail Consortium also appealed to the government to find a solution, but added that there should be no immediate shortages, since “retailers have stocked up on goods ahead of Christmas which should prevent immediate problems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-isolates-uk-as-covid-19-cases-touch-new-high/story-zcejuwRseKj3wRpIYBXnxI.html
21-12-2020||World||Longtime Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Abrahamson dies||Shirley Abrahamson, the longest-serving Wisconsin Supreme Court justice in state history and the first woman to serve on the high court, has died. She was 87.Abrahamson, who also served as chief justice for a record 19 years, died Saturday after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, her son Dan Abrahamson told The Associated Press on Sunday.Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement that Abrahamson had a “larger-than-life impact” on the state’s legal profession and her legacy is defined “not just by being a first, but her life’s work of ensuring she would not be the last, paving and lighting the way for the many women and others who would come after her.”Long recognized as a top legal scholar nationally and a leader among state judges, Abrahamson wrote more than 450 majority opinions and participated in more than 3,500 written decisions during her more than four decades on Wisconsin’s highest court. She retired in 2019 and moved to California to be closer with her family.In 1993, then-President Bill Clinton considered putting her on the US Supreme Court, and she was later profiled in the book, “Great American Judges: An Encyclopedia.”She told the Wisconsin State Journal in 2006 that she enjoyed being on the court.“It has a mix of sitting, reading and writing and thinking, which I enjoy doing. And it’s quiet. On the other hand, all of the problems I work on are real problems of real people, and it matters to them, and it matters to the state of Wisconsin. So that gives an edge to it, and a stress,” she said.The New York City native, with the accent to prove it, graduated first in her class from Indiana University Law School in 1956, three years after her marriage to Seymour Abrahamson. The couple moved to Madison and her husband, a world-renowned geneticist, joined the University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty in 1961. He died in 2016.She earned a law degree from UW-Madison in 1962, then worked as a professor and joined a Madison law firm, hired by the father of future Gov. Jim Doyle.Appointed to the state’s high court by then-Gov. Patrick Lucey in 1976, Abrahamson won reelection four times to 10-year terms, starting in 1979. She broke the record for longest-serving in justice in 2013, her 36th year on the court.Abrahamson was in the majority when the court in 2005 allowed a boy to sue over lead paint injuries even though he could not prove which company made the product that sickened him — undoing decades of precedent and opening paint companies to lawsuits seeking damages.But Abrahamson found herself in the minority on several high-profile cases later in her career, including in 2011, when the court upheld the law championed by Republican then-Gov. Scott Walker effectively ending public employee union rights, and again in 2015, when the court ended a politically charged investigation into Walker and conservative groups.Abrahamson’s health began to fail in 2018, and she frequently missed court hearings. That May, she announced she wouldn’t run again in 2019, and in August, she revealed she has cancer.Doyle, a former Wisconsin attorney general and two-term governor, called Abrahamson a pioneer and said he sought her advice when he first ran for Dane County district attorney in the 1970s. Doyle’s father, who was a federal judge, gave Abrahamson her first job out of law school, Doyle said Sunday.“She was just the warmest, funniest, dearest friend anyone could have,” Doyle said.Doyle has credited Abrahamson with working to demystify the court by holding hearings around the state and meeting with school groups and others to discuss its work.In addition to breaking barriers for women, Doyle has said Abrahamson was a champion of civil rights and civil liberties, a protector of basic constitutional rights, and a strong advocate for open government and public records.Dan Abrahamson, who practices law in California, said his mom kept her work and personal life separate.“She was always there for meals,” he said. “She was always there with me for homework. ... As a mother, all of the energy and all of the attention to deal and all the care she brought to her professional life she brought to her family as well.”Abrahamson wasn’t without her enemies, both on the court and among Republican lawmakers who pushed a constitutional amendment in 2015 that led to her ouster as chief justice. The voter-approved amendment enabled members of the court to choose the chief justice — who oversees the state court system — instead of requiring the title go to the most senior justice.Abrahamson, who became chief in 1996, was quickly voted out by conservative justices who held a majority on the court when the new law took effect in 2015. Justice Patience Roggensack has served as chief justice since then.Although she often clashed with more conservative members of the court, and drew support from liberals and Democrats, Abrahamson steadfastly maintained she was independent.“When I joined the court, I was given a voice — a voice that I have not hesitated to use,” Abrahamson said in May 2018. “The best expression of appreciation I can give the people who have elected and repeatedly reelected me is to continue to speak with the clarity, forthrightness and compassion that come from a life I have tried to devote to service and to justice for all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/longtime-wisconsin-supreme-court-justice-abrahamson-dies/story-mizBijUxqmmkNFgCINhc0O.html
21-12-2020||World||US lawmakers demand response to massive cyberattack||US lawmakers on Sunday called for a “strong response” to a huge cyberattack on government agencies and criticized President Donald Trump’s unwillingness to point the finger at Russia, which has been widely blamed for the hack.The comments -- from Republican as well as Democratic lawmakers -- came after Trump one day earlier downplayed the attack and undercut the assessment by his own administration that Moscow was to blame.“Russia acts with impunity,” Republican Senator Mitt Romney, a frequent Trump critic, told CNN’s “State of the Union,” saying the hack was worthy of a “wartime setting.”Calling it “extraordinarily dangerous” he said it will “have to be met with a very strong response.”Also Read| ‘It may be China’: Trump undercuts Pompeo’s assertion on cyberattackRomney spoke after Trump, in his first public comments on the attack, tweeted Saturday that he had been fully briefed “and everything is well under control.”“Russia Russia Russia is the priority chant when anything happens,” Trump continued, suggesting without offering evidence that China “may” also be involved.Romney said he was “disappointed” with the comment, but that it was expected, saying: “The president has a blind spot when it comes to Russia.”But the president “is not making our country safer” with such comments, warned the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner.Warner, speaking on ABC’s “This Week,” said he agreed with an earlier assessment by Trump’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that “all indications point to Russia” as being behind the attack.It was far from the first time the president has played down apparent threats from Russia, which has denied involvement in the hack.The attackers managed to breach computer networks using enterprise management network software made by the Texas-based IT company SolarWinds.Also Read: Biden’s options for Russian hacking punishment: sanctions, cyber retaliationUS government agencies including the Treasury were among those reportedly hit, but it also hit targets worldwide with the list of victims still emerging, researchers have said.Dramatic details about the extraordinarily wide attack have emerged even as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office next month amid already high tensions with Moscow.“Those who are responsible are going to face consequences for it,” Biden’s incoming chief of staff Ron Klain told CBS’s “Face the Nation,” vowing the Democrat would “take steps as president to degrade the capacity of foreign actors to launch these kinds of attacks on our country.”Warner said there was no indication classified networks were breached in the hack, and downplayed Romney’s wartime comparison.Still, he stressed, to let such an attack go unanswered “would be very bad American policy and, frankly, simply invite Russians or others to continue these kind of malicious activities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-demand-response-to-massive-cyberattack/story-MbYgrGEp9YxTv0vgmShDWO.html
21-12-2020||World||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The UK announced a surprise lockdown on Saturday in London and parts of the country. The decision was forced on the Boris Johnson government by a surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. The UK is now seeing its third wave of infections — or, a second wave which appeared to be waning till it suddenly gathered momentum — with the country recording around 35,000 new infections on December 17, the highest in one day.The UK’s sudden decision can be attributed to the discovery of a new strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes the coronavirus disease, and which, Johnson said while imposing the lockdown, was 70% more infectious than other strains of the virus. It is believed that most of the new cases in the country are driven by this variant, with up to 60% of the cases in London being caused by it.The London lockdown, which upends the Christmas and holiday plans of many of the city’s residents, was announced late Saturday afternoon, but came into effect only at midnight — resulting in a large-scale exodus from the city to the countryside, the kind of scramble avoided at any time, but especially when a viral pandemic is raging through the city and the country. Days before he announced the lockdown, Johnson said that it might be necessary to impose one after Christmas — but clearly, his hand was forced by fears of a mutant strain.Also Read: New variant makes Covid-19 ‘out of control’ in UK, flights bannedIt isn’t just the UK; South Africa announced on Friday that a new strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus has been detected in the country, and that this could be driving the second wave of infections in the country. The country has seen a spike in cases since mid-November, and the seven-day average of new cases is around 70% of the peak seen in the first wave, and rising.There are some interesting similarities between the new strains in the UK and South Africa. Both, health authorities in the two countries claim, appear to be spreading faster. The two strains appear to share a mutation, one that alters the structure of the spike protein of the virus. Health officials in both countries believe this could actually be helping the virus spread faster — after all, the spike protein is how the virus binds to receptors in human cells. In South Africa, scientists studying the variant claim that the new strain results in higher viral loads in patients — based on studies of swab samples.Here’s what we know: both new strains (the South African one would appear to be older and more widespread, based on what the country’s health authorities say) show a significant number of mutations, including a shared one (N501Y is what scientists are calling it) that affects the spike protein. And both strains appear to be more infective.Also Read: Unclear If US has UK Covid-19 mutation, says chief scientific adviser SlaouiViruses mutate, so the fact that Sars-CoV-2 is showing mutations is neither strange nor cause for alarm. But these mutations could have a bearing on its virulence as well as the effectiveness of vaccines and that is definitely something that merits further study.Here’s what we do not know: we do not know for sure if the new strain is more infective; we do not know for sure if the new strain results in higher viral loads in patients (which, in turn, makes it more infective); we do not know for sure if the new strain causes more severe forms of Covid-19 (initial evidence would seem to suggest it doesn’t, but we do not know for sure) and results in more deaths; and we do not know if the vaccines that have so far proved successful against the virus are effective against the new strain as well.That’s a lot of we-do-not-know-for-sures , but that is exactly the way science works. It will be interesting to see if the current strain(s) of Sars-CoV-2 being detected in India show any of the mutations seen in the new strain in the UK and South Africa, especially the N501Y one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-wJ26oKDKvCJzZ8vBMkgF0I.html
21-12-2020||World||3 rockets target US Embassy in Baghdad: Report||At least three rockets targeted the US Embassy in Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone on Sunday, Iraqi security officials said, sparking fears of renewed unrest as next month’s anniversary of the slaying of an Iranian general draws near.The embassy’s C-RAM defense system was used to destroy the rockets mid-air, three Iraqi security officials said, with damage caused to property and parked cars. It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.The C-RAM system was installed by the US over the summer as armed groups stepped up rocket attacks targeting the embassy and its premises.The US withdrew some staff from its embassy in Baghdad earlier this month, temporarily reducing personnel ahead of the first anniversary of the Washington-directed killing of Iranian General Qassim Soleimani outside Baghdad’s airport on Jan. 3. US officials said the decision stemmed from concerns about a possible retaliatory strike.Soleimani’s killing sparked outrage and led Iraq’s parliament to pass a non-binding resolution days later calling for the expulsion of all foreign troops from Iraq.The frequency of rocket attacks have frustrated the Trump administration. Iran-backed militia groups have been blamed for orchestrating the attacks.In September, Washington warned Iraq that it will close its embassy in Baghdad if the government fails to take decisive action to end rocket and other attacks by Iranian-backed militias on American and allied interests in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-rockets-target-us-embassy-in-baghdad-report/story-4t6MoIVCqUSk2OX6N0naPJ.html
21-12-2020||World||Nirav Modi’s brother Nehal charged with diamond fraud in New York||US prosecutors have charged Nehal Modi, the younger brother of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, with defrauding a New York wholesale supplier of diamonds worth $2.6 million. He has been charged with Grand Larceny in the first degree, which is theft of property worth more than $1 million, and it can land him in jail if convicted.The younger Modi is accused of procuring diamonds from LLD Diamonds USA, a wholesale company, between March 2015 and August 2015, for purported sale to Costco, a wholesale grocery retail chain, against deferred payment. He is alleged to have pawned off the diamonds instead, or sold them, and pocketed most of the proceeds for personal use or other businesses.LLD finally reported him to the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, in August.“As alleged, Mr. Modi conned a Manhattan diamond wholesaler into fronting him millions worth of diamonds for a purported deal with Costco that never existed,” Vance said on Friday, announcing the indictment (charges) filed in a New York Supreme Court. “While diamonds may be forever, this flawed scheme was not, and now Mr. Modi will face the clarity of a New York Supreme Court indictment. My office will not allow individuals who have the privilege of soliciting business in Manhattan’s iconic diamond industry to defraud our businesses or consumers.”Vance’s office has jurisdiction over New York City’s prime business area of Manhattan, where elder brother Nirav Modi launched his flagship jewellery boutique store in September 2015 with much fanfare, just the month after his younger brother was reported by LLD to Vance’s office. The elder Modi had then announced plans to open 100 more stores around the world.In February 2018, Indian authorities filed charges against the elder Modi for defrauding banks of millions of dollars and sought his arrest, as part of an expanding investigation. He has since fled to the UK, where he has sought political asylum and is fighting extradition to India.Nehal Modi was released without posting bail on Friday. His attorney Roger Bernstein told New York Post, “This is a commercial dispute” and his client is “not guilty”.According to the indictment announced by district attorney Vance, Nehal Modi first approached LLD in March 2015. His family connections - coming from a “well-known family in the diamond business” - helped, the district attorney’s office said in a statement. He is alleged to have asked the wholesaler for $800,000 worth of diamonds to show to Costco for a potential deal.He got back and is charged with falsely telling LLD that Costco had agreed. LLD allowed Modi to buy the diamonds on credit, to be paid fully within 90 days. “Modi then pawned the diamonds at Modell Collateral Loans, Inc. (‘Modell’) to secure a short-term loan,” the district attorney’s office said.Over April and May, Modi is alleged to have returned to the company three times and picked up diamonds worth more than $1 million for sale to Costco. Modi did make a “series of payments” to LLD, but is alleged to have “used the majority of the proceeds for personal use and other business expenses”.“To cover his fraud, Modi falsely claimed that he was encountering payment issues due to a ‘Costco fulfillment error’ and made repeated promises to satisfy the balance,” said the district attorney’s office.Modi returned to LLD again in August, and asked for more diamonds for sale to Costco. This time, in view of Modi’s spotty payment record, the wholesaler gave him the diamonds with the condition that they could not be sold with their authorisation. Modi was already in touch with Modell then and, the statement said, “after picking up the diamonds from LLD, Modi pawned the majority of the diamonds at Modell to secure two separate loans and sold the remainder of the diamonds to various retailers at a steep discount”.LLD reported the case to the district attorney after failing to get Modi to either return the diamonds or pay the outstanding balance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirav-modi-s-brother-nehal-charged-with-diamond-fraud-in-new-york/story-OB5uoMRyWTYnau5D4eJsgI.html
