12-12-2020||World||Geminid meteor shower over the weekend. Here’s how you can watch it||The Geminid meteor shower is an annual celestial event that occurs at the end of the year. And this year, it is expected to be a treat for stargazers across the globe due to some special natural conditions. The meteor shower is expected to peak from December 13 to December 14 and can be best seen between 1am and 4am.US space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has said the meteor shower will begin from 7:30-8:00pm CST on December 13 with an increasing rate of meteors towards 2am in the northern hemisphere. Stargazers observing from midnight to 4am can capture the best moments.The dazzling meteor shower is happening during the new moon phase this year making it special, that means the shower will be lightening the sky on a moonless night. The dark due to the absence of the moon will make it easier for the stargazers to observe the event. The space agency predicted that the skywatchers in the northern hemisphere can catch near to 60 meteors per hour; that is an average of one Geminid per minute during the peak time, while people in the southern hemisphere will see less than their neighbours in the north.Geminids are unique because they don’t belong to the parent body of a comet. As per meteor scientists, Geminids are the only shower having an asteroidal parent body. This asteroid parent identified in 1983 via a satellite is called 3200 Phaethon. A Geminid meteor shower is a result of burning up dust left by 3200 Phaethon when the Earth passes by the mighty asteroid. Geminids that are named after a constellation Gemini as they appear to radiate from that point, travel at a rate of 35 kilometres per second, 40 times faster than a speeding bullet.How to watch?It is recommended to get to a place with fewer trees, city lights and pollution to block the view, lie on the back and look up. The smartphone-addict generation is advised to let their eyes settle to dark for 30-35 minutes and as the eyes get adjusted, the stargazers will be able to watch more meteors. One can see a Geminid if they try to trace the meteor backwards and end up meeting with the constellation Gemini.Nasa too will live stream the meteor showers on the peak nights, capturing it from a meteor camera at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama from 8 to 4am CST that is 7:30am to 3:30pm IST on its Meteor Watch Facebook page.As per Nasa, the shower will begin at 1am UTC or 6:30am IST and skywatchers in India can see the shower as experts suggest that it will be visible in the north of the equator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/geminid-meteor-shower-over-the-weekend-here-s-how-you-can-watch-it/story-OG4ft75CVspx9tmc0GSfJM.html

12-12-2020||World||Americans will receive Pfizer vaccine for Covid-19 from Monday: Official||Americans will start receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, the official in charge of the distribution operation said Saturday. General Gus Perna told reporters the first doses will be shipped Sunday and that starting Monday morning, “We are operationally 100% confident that we will get the vaccines to the American people.”“Expect 145 sites across all the states to receive vaccine on Monday, another 425 sites on Tuesday. And the final 66 sites on Wednesday, which will complete the initial delivery of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,” he said.The first push will vaccinate about three million people. Federal health authorities have recommended that health care workers and nursing home residents be at the front of the line, but the decisions will be left to states. The US became the sixth country to green light the Pfizer vaccine on Friday night.It has been shown to be 95 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 infection compared to a placebo.But the FDA has advised people who have severe allergies to ingredients in the drug to avoid getting immunized for the time being.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-will-receive-pfizer-vaccine-for-covid-19-from-monday-official/story-fcQE71VSmu4gLVNdwnXSwI.html

Paris police made at least 81 arrests, the interior minister tweeted.Riot police escorted Saturday’s march through the rain-slickened streets in Paris.The proposed security law has been met by successive weekends of protests.The bill’s most contested measure could make it more difficult for people to film police officers. It aims to outlaw the publication of images with intent to cause harm to police. The provision has caused such an uproar that the government has decided to rewrite it.Critics fear the law could erode media freedom and make it more difficult to expose police brutality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-arrested-at-paris-protest-over-proposed-security-law/story-bARfR5k650lg2auNCK4RAN.html
12-12-2020||World||Pfizer vaccine cleared in US, a landmark in Covid-19 fight||Pfizer Inc. gained emergency US authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine on Friday, completing an unprecedented scientific sprint that could eventually help bring an end to a pandemic that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans.The Food and Drug Administration’s decision to authorize use of Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE’s vaccine will now set in motion a complicated immunization drive that will launch across the country in coming days.Gen. Gustave F. Perna, the chief operating officer for the government vaccine program Operation Warp Speed, said at a news briefing Saturday that vaccines are being packaged and will arrive at the first administration sites on Monday. Among the first to be inoculated will be health-care workers and seniors living in long-term care facilities.The shot is a landmark achievement, built from a breakthrough technology in a matter of months, in the face of a pandemic that has sickened millions worldwide. It has already been cleared by regulators in the U.K., Canada and other countries.“With science guiding our decision-making, the available safety and effectiveness data support the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine because the vaccine’s known and potential benefits clearly outweigh its known and potential risks,” Peter Marks, the head of the FDA’s office that oversees vaccines, said in a statement.The approval also caps a fraught political struggle that has seen President Donald Trump push drug regulators to swiftly clear a vaccine. In the final hours of the review Friday, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows suggested to FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn that failure to clear the vaccine for use soon could cost him his job. On Saturday, Hahn defended the agency’s thoroughness and transparency.“We worked quickly because of the urgency of this pandemic, not because of any external pressure,” Hahn said Saturday on a call with reporters.The FDA’s career scientists “conducted a fast but incredibly thorough review,” he said, adding they worked “around the clock including holidays, weekends and nights.” The agency is in the process of reviewing its response to Covid-19, including how it handles emergency authorization requests, Hahn said.Trump called the clearance “one of the greatest scientific accomplishments in history” in a video on Twitter, saying it will save millions of lives and end the pandemic.Distribution BeginsThe first doses will begin shipping throughout the country immediately, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said. Trucks will head out from manufacturing sites in Wisconsin and Michigan, packed with the shots, which must be stored at ultracold temperatures. Pfizer has developed special dry-ice containers to make it easier to store for facilities that don’t have the needed equipment.“We’re pretty convinced that we can make this happen here,” Marks said regarding maintaining cold storage. “We’re hopeful that this is going to work out.”The vaccine is expected to be given first to health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. Later on Saturday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will make its own recommendation on the vaccine, likely clearing the way for doctors to begin administering it.Health systems around the U.S. are preparing to begin immunizing people in the coming days. Sanford Health, based in the Upper Midwest, said that it had received notice from Pfizer that its order had been received and that it would be notified when its doses ship.“We could receive the vaccine in our hospitals in North Dakota and South Dakota as early as Sunday, and be putting shots in arms as soon as Monday,” said spokeswoman Angela Dejene.A shot similar to Pfizer and BioNTech’s made by Moderna Inc. is expected to gain U.S. clearance next week, providing the country with a potent combination for beating back the pathogen. More vaccines are also expected to be brought to market next year, expanding the arsenal doctors will have to rein in Covid-19.Pfizer’s vaccine, like Moderna’s, uses a new technology called messenger RNA that turns the body’s own cells into vaccine-producing factories to fight the coronavirus. In a trial of almost 44,000 people, it was 95% effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19, protecting people of all ages and ethnicities. Crucially, it was able to prevent the most severe infections.Pfizer and BioNTech plan to provide clinical-trial participants who received the placebo the authorized shot “at scheduled timepoints in the study,” the companies said in a joint news release, without elaborating. “The vaccine option will be voluntary and will be implemented in alignment with the regulatory authorities where the trial is conducted.”Allergy IssuesFollowing a Thursday vote by an advisory panel of outside experts backing the vaccine for use in people 16 and older, the FDA was weighing how to address reports of serious allergic reactions in the U.K., where the vaccine was approved earlier this month. Officials there have since told people with a history of significant allergic reactions not to get the vaccine.In a fact sheet for patients, the FDA said “there is a remote chance” the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction and told doctors in a similar document they should have medical interventions on hand to help treat such a side effect. The CDC, which is helping states with the vaccine rollout, will ensure each site has medication on hand to treat any allergic reactions, FDA’s Marks said Saturday.While serious allergic reactions were not seen in Pfizer’s clinical trials and Marks said the FDA is “comfortable” giving the vaccine to Americans, he added: “We’ll be monitoring very closely for them. I think we still need to learn more.”Many Americans have expressed skepticism about the vaccines being developed to fight the coronavirus. A wider campaign to convince the hesitant to get inoculated is expected in the weeks and months ahead.“As a physician, I have no hesitation recommending that my parents and my patients’ families receive the vaccine, and I encourage all Americans to get vaccinated in the order recommended by the CDC,” said Richard Besser, the president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC. “When my group is called, I will gladly roll up my sleeve.”Side effects in Pfizer’s clinical trial were mild and developed more frequently in younger participants in the study, specifically those aged 55 and younger, with no signs of serious safety concerns, according to an FDA staff report on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy.After the second injection, fatigue and headache were the most common systemic reactions, occurring in 59% and 52% of the younger participants, compared with 51% and 39% in those over age 56.Stopping SpreadIt isn’t clear whether the vaccine is effective at preventing Covid-19’s spread. It is possible the shot didn’t work as well at preventing cases where people didn’t have symptoms, meaning there will likely be a continued need for basic public-health measures such as wearing masks and social distancing.The FDA expects more data on the shot’s effect on Covid-19 transmission in a “few months,” Marks said Saturday.The vaccine showed some protection from symptomatic Covid-19 after one shot, but the FDA is recommending people take both doses to achieve the full 95% effectiveness of the vaccine, particularly given that Pfizer studied a two-dose regimen so it’s not known how long the reduced protection from one shot would last.Pfizer didn’t study the vaccine in pregnant or lactating women, though the FDA is leaving it up to those women as to whether they will receive the vaccine. The company also did not have much data on the shot’s use in 16 and 17 year olds but Marks said they’re comfortable with the safety profile for the age group.Global DemandAmong the vaccine front-runners, the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is the only one that didn’t take funding from the White House-led Operation Warp Speed program to accelerate development, manufacturing and distribution of Covid-19 shots. However, the two companies have secured a $2 billion deal to supply 100 million doses to the U.S., with an option for 500 million more.Countries around the world are clamoring for more doses of the vaccine, said Sean Marett, BioNTech’s chief business and commercial officer, in an interview.“Everybody wants all their doses on January 2nd of next year, but that’s not practical,” he said in an interview. “This is a new technology, there does not exist a manufacturing network. We are building it.”To help increase the number of shots on hand, the U.S. agreed to buy 100 million more doses of Moderna’s vaccine on Friday, doubling its initial order. The government has an option to buy another 300 million doses of the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-vaccine-cleared-in-us-a-landmark-in-covid-19-fight/story-49htqZCKv9lSY20tHGrTMO.html
12-12-2020||World||US President-elect Joe Biden vows to rejoin Paris Climate Accord on day one of presidency||US President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warmingHeads of state and government from over 70 countries were joining the online event hosted by France, Britain, Italy, Chile and the United Nations, to pledge greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.The United States, which quit the Paris accord under President Donald Trump, wasn’t represented at the federal level.In a statement, Biden noted that the US had been key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world.“The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,” he said. “I’ll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.”Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting US emissions to net zero “no later than 2050.”Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2C (3.6F), ideally no more than 1.5C (2.7F), by the end of the century.Achieving this will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world’s carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.“We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the US economy,” he said.American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and US business leaders, such as Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook.Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico, none of which has offered significant improvements on its existing emissions targets.Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil’s recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 percent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 — far later than most other countries.By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent’s 2030 targets from 40% to at least 55% compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.China, the world’s biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. Observers say this is likely a low offer that Beijing can significantly improve on in years to come.The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year due to the pandemic.The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year’s host, announced this month it is aiming to cut emissions by 68% over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.“Because if we don’t, the alternative is unthinkable,” she said. “None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-elect-joe-biden-vows-to-rejoin-paris-climate-accord-on-day-one-of-presidency/story-z6OIGy0GQJ8qQmYVXSYq3J.html
12-12-2020||World||Zodiac Killer’s victims, letters and the code||After 51 years, a team of mathematicians have finally cracked a cipher sent by the infamous serial killer who called himself the Zodiac. The Zodiac killer’s identity still remains unknown. The serial killer claimed to have murdered 37 individuals in total but investigators have only confirmed seven victims, two of whom survived the attempt. He primarily targeted young couples but had also murdered a cab driver once. The Zodiac killer operated in northern California, USA, from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. His five confirmed murders were committed between December 1968 and October 1969. Confirmed murdersLake Herman Road murders: The Zodiac killer’s first victims were a high school couple, Betty Lou Jensen and David Faraday on December 20, 1968. The two were on their first date and had driven out to Lake Herman Road, just within Benicia City limits, where they had parked their car. According to reports, the killer had pulled up his car beside the couple’s, before shooting Faraday in the head and Jensen five times in the back as she fled.  Blue Rock Springs murder: On July 4, 1969, Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau had pulled up at Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo, 6.4 km from the Lake Herman Road murder site. A car had pulled up beside theirs, only to drive off and come back within 10 minutes. The driver got out of the car with a flashlight and a gun before flashing the light at the couple and shooting them five times. While returning to his car, he heard Mageau moaning and shot him two more times.Lake Berryessa murder: This was the first incident where one of the victims had survived. Pacific Union College students Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard had gone to Lake Beryessa in Napa County on September 27, 1969. A man had approached them with a gun, wearing a black hood over his head and sunglasses. The man claimed to be an escaped convict and demanded a car to escape to Mexico. He ordered Shepard to tie Hartnell up before tying her up himself. On discovering that Hartnell was loosely tied, he stabbed the couple, Hartnell six times, and Shepard 10, before drawing his patented cross-circle symbol on Hartnell’s car, and writing beneath it: “Vallejo/12-20-68/7-4-69/Sept 27–69–6:30/by knife.” He then phoned the Napa County Sheriff’s office from a payphone, reporting the crimes and confessing to them before escaping the scene. Shepard died two days after being taken to the hospital while Hartnell survived. Presidio Heights murder: On October 11, 1969, the killer entered a cab driven by Paul Stine in San Farncisco and requested to go to Washington and Maple Streets in Presidio Heights. When Stine drove past Maple Street, he was shot in the head. The killer took his wallet and keys and tore away part of his bloodstained shirt. Three teenagers were witnessing the incident as it unfolded and called the police. Patrol officers responded to the call and even saw him, but he escaped.  Letters from the Zodiac KillerThree letters written by the Zodiac killer were received on August 1,1969 at the Vallejo Times Herald, the San Francisco Chronicle and The San Francisco Examiner. The killer had taken credit for the Lake Herman Road and Blue Rock Springs murders in them and each letter contained one-third of a 408-symbol cryptogram in which the killer claimed to have revealed his identity. On October 14, 1969, the San Francisco Chronicle received another letter from the killer along with part of Paul Stine’s shirt as proof that he was the killer.  On November 8, 1969, the killer sent a 340 word cryptogram which was recently solved after 51 years on December 5, 2020. On November 9, 1969, the killer sent a seven-page letter describing how he was stopped by two policemen and had even spoken to them after committing the Paul Stine murder. On December 20, 1969, a year after the lake Herman Road murders, the Zodiac mailed a letter to lawyer Melvin Belli with another part of Paul Stine’s shirt, he said that he wanted help.  The solved letterA team of codebreakers, David Oranchak, Sam Blake and Jarl Van Eycke, cracked the 340 word cryptogram on December 5 which the killer had sent to the San Francisco Chronicle on Novermber 8, 1969. The letter read: “ I hope you are having lots of fun in trying to catch me. That wasn’t me on the TV show which brings up a point about me. I am not afraid of the gas chamber because it will send me to paradice all the sooner. Because I now have enough slaves to work for me where everyone else has nothing when they reach paradice so they are afraid of death. I am not afraid because I know that my new life will be an easy one in paradice death.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zodiac-killer-s-victims-letters-and-the-code/story-8fxNwImx7WtpPAChbDmdLJ.html
12-12-2020||World||Italy’s staggering virus toll poses uncomfortable questions||Italy could soon reclaim a record that nobody wants — the most coronavirus deaths in Europe — after the health care system again failed to protect the elderly and the government delayed imposing new restrictions.This wasn’t supposed to happen. Italy was the first country in the West to be slammed by Covid-19 and, after suffering a huge wave of death in spring, brought infections under control.Italy then had the benefit of time and experience heading into the fall resurgence because it trailed Spain, France and Germany in recording big new clusters of infections. Yet the virus spread fast and wide, and Italy has added 28,000 dead since September 1.“Obviously there needs to be some reflection,” Guido Rasi, former executive director of the European Pharmaceutical Agency, told state TV after Italy reported a pandemic-high record of 993 deaths in one day. “This number of nearly 1,000 dead in 24 hours is much higher than the European average.” Italy added another 761 victims Friday, bringing its official total to 63,387, just shy of Britain’s Europe-leading 63,603 dead, according to Johns Hopkins University. Both numbers are believed to greatly underestimate the real toll, due to missed infections, limited testing and different counting criteria.Still, Italy could overtake Britain despite having 6 million people fewer than the UK’s 66 million, and would trail only the much larger US, Brazil, India and Mexico. Italy has the world’s second-oldest population after Japan, and the elderly are the most vulnerable to the virus.The average age of Italian victims has hovered around 80. In addition, 65% of Italy’s Covid-19 dead had three or more other health problems before they tested positive, such as hypertension or diabetes, according to Italy’s Superior Institute of Health.But that doesn’t explain the whole picture. Germany has a similarly old demographic and yet its death toll is one-third of Italy’s despite its larger population of 83 million. Germany recorded its highest daily number of coronavirus victims Friday — 598 — but has only 21,000 dead overall.Analysts point to Germany’s long-term higher per-capita spending on health care, which has resulted in greater ICU capacity, better testing and tracing capabilities and higher ratios of doctors and nurses to the population. But Germany also imposed an earlier, lighter lockdown this fall and is now poised to tighten it.“If you can act sooner, even a bit lighter in the measures, they work better than acting harshly a bit later or too late,” said Matteo Villa, research fellow at the Institute for International Political Studies, a Milan-based think tank.Italy, he said, waited too long after infections started ticking up in September and October to impose restrictions and didn’t reinforce its medical system sufficiently during the summertime lull.“If you look at France and the UK, you can see Italy did fare much worse,” he said. “And if you look at a comparable population with similar demographics, which is Germany, Italy did a lot worse.” With another wave of infections feared to be just around the corner with Christmas visits and the winter flu season, many are wondering how many more will die.Doctors have blamed systemic problems with Italy’s health care system, especially in hardest-hit Lombardy, for failing to respond adequately. They have cited the growth of private hospitals in Lombardy in recent years at the expense of public ones. Brain drain and bureaucratic obstacles have resulted in fewer doctors going into practice, while general practitioners have complained of a lack of support despite being the backbone of the system.Nearly 80,000 Italian health care workers have been infected and 255 doctors have died.“We asked for a lockdown at the start of November because the situation inside hospitals was already difficult,” said Dr. Filippo Anelli, head of the country’s doctors’ association. “We saw that it worked in the spring and allowed us to get out from under Covid. If this had been done, probably today the numbers would be coming down.” But the Italian government resisted re-imposing a nationwide lockdown this fall, knowing the devastating impact on an economy that was just starting to come back to life after the springtime shutdown.Instead, on November 3 the government divided the country into three risk zones with varying restrictions. But by then infections had been doubling each week for nearly a month and hospitals were already overwhelmed in Milan and Naples.Italy also went into the pandemic poorly prepared. It had fewer ICU beds than the average of developed countries. And in recent weeks, investigative news reports have noted that Italy hadn’t updated its influenza pandemic preparedness plan since 2006 — which could help explain its critical shortage of protective equipment early on and its chaotic initial response to the pandemic.A World Health Organization (WHO) report, which was posted and then immediately taken down from the WHO website, noted that Italy’s 2006 plan was merely “reconfirmed in 2017” without being updated. The report said the plan was “more theoretical than practical” and that when Covid-19 hit, all hell broke loose.“Unprepared for such a flood of severely ill patients, the initial reaction of the hospitals was improvised, chaotic and creative,” said the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-s-staggering-virus-toll-poses-uncomfortable-questions/story-0jt9C4IVw5zAcOr7J40vaJ.html

12-12-2020||World||Air India gets reprieve in UK court over aircraft lease payments||Air India has got some reprieve from a UK court as it allowed India’s flag carrier time until early January to make payments in a case of unpaid dues of over USD 17.6 million, with the judge accepting the “broad thrust” of the airline’s financial difficulties, especially due to the grounding of flights during the Covid-19 lockdown.Judge Simon Salzedo, however, issued a strong rebuke to Air India for its “unsatisfactory and discourteous” conduct in relation to the case by not engaging with the process in a timely manner.The hearing, held remotely at the Commercial Court division here on Friday, involved unpaid dues of over USD 17.6 million to China Aircraft Leasing Company Limited (CALC) as part of an aircraft lease agreement for rent and maintenance.“I accept the broad thrust of Air India’s submission of the financial difficulties it has been facing along with the rest of the aviation sector and also note that it has been making some payments to the lessors,” the judge noted, as he granted Air India until January 11, 2021, to clear the overdue payments.However, that extension is conditional on the airline paying in the already committed amount for the month of December, amounting to a total of USD 5 million.The counsel for CALC, a global aircraft leasing company, had sought immediate payment and argued that Air India being a state-owned airline can always seek funds from the Indian government and is only seeking to delay matters for its client, who has been waiting for nearly a year for the payments.Air India, on the other hand, argued that it does not dispute that the claimant is entitled to payments for leased aircraft, but as a result of severe constraints on the airline industry, most of its aircraft have remained grounded. The airline claimed that while it had managed to strike rent reduction and payment plans with other lessors, talks with CALC had been unproductive.It urged the court for time until January 29 for the payments in order to avoid disruptions to its UK and Europe operations, especially over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, which would go on to further “hinder” its ability to pay.The judge struck a compromise and has given Air India until January 11 to clear the sums outstanding.The Indian state-owned carrier has been seeking a buyer for some time now as the government wants to divest its 100 per cent stake in Air India and budget carrier AI Express.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-india-gets-reprieve-in-uk-court-over-aircraft-lease-payments/story-9B3OFvaN2RxRtTDffIxdfJ.html
12-12-2020||World||With Conservative Party at his back, Boris Johnson can’t cave in on Brexit||As UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces calls to compromise in order to secure a trade deal with the European Union (EU), one thing above all is limiting his room to move: the Conservative Party.At stake in the final days of the UK’s four-year divorce negotiations are the future of the country’s economy and Johnson’s own authority over the party he leads.For many pro-Brexit Tories who have waited years for Britain to break free of EU shackles, Johnson’s statement Friday that a split without a new trade deal is now “very likely” must seem like a dream. But that is a problem for the premier, who says he still wants to get an accord and has told his negotiating team this weekend to do whatever they can to come up with a last ditch agreement.Johnson would be “sowing the seeds of his own destruction” if he accepted the EU’s position, was the ominous warning of one MP, speaking privately.If Johnson does manage to pull off a deal at the eleventh hour, his struggle will switch from Brussels to London. Any agreement will need fast-tracking through Parliament so it can come into force by December 31 when the transition period expires and the UK finally leaves the EU single market.The Conservatives are split over Europe and while some will welcome any deal, the trickiest faction for Johnson will be the old guard of euroskeptic Tories. These MPs have built careers on taking hard-line views and no longer need to be loyal to the leader because their ministerial ambitions have been fulfilled, or faded away.Fringe MovementThe Brexiteers were once a fringe movement in the party but now are the mainstream. The new intake of more than 100 Conservatives in parliament, who stood on a clear pro-Brexit manifesto at the election exactly a year ago, will also need to be persuaded that an EU trade agreement is better than leaving the bloc on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms.“The prime minister has given me -- and colleagues -- his assurances he will deliver,” said Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, a constituency which voted to leave the EU in 2016. “Unless we get a fair trade deal -- and we all want a deal, so long as it’s a fair one -- then we will have no alternative but to trade on WTO or Australia terms.”Whatever happens this weekend, the final stage of the Brexit process puts Johnson’s politial credibility on the line. Brexit and Johnson are inextricably linked -- he was the face of the successful 2016 referendum campaign and won the Tories a historic election majority last year promising to “get Brexit done.”But his party has been critical of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic for months, and if his own side starts accusing him of betrayal over Brexit, too, his days in office may soon be numbered.The dilemma of whether to compromise for a deal is particularly sensitive for Johnson because the main hurdles to an agreement with the EU cut to the heart of the arguments in favour of Brexit -- restoring British sovereignty.‘Taking Back Control’The biggest disagreements are over a so-called level playing field of fair competition rules for businesses in Britain and Europe, how any deal would be governed, and access to fishing waters. Resolving these may require fixes that contradict the sovereignty principle of “taking back control” over British laws.For example, on the level playing field, the EU is pushing for ratchet clauses, which would require Britain to keep up with changes in EU laws in areas including environment and social protection. Otherwise, Britain would lose tariff-free access to the EU market.One Tory MP, newly elected in 2019, said they wouldn’t vote for any agreement that conceded this principle, and that they would rather have no trade agreement with the EU at all, and the tariffs that would follow, if it meant Britain had the full freedom to compete with the bloc.In a sign of the strength of feeling among Conservative lawmakers, scores of rank-and-file Tories urged Johnson to stand firm and not concede to the EU’s demands in public debates in Parliament this week.Danny Kruger, a newly elected MP in 2019, said the long-term consequences of a bad deal that keeps Britain in the EU’s regulatory orbit would be “far worse than any temporary short-term consequences that might flow from no deal”. Philip Davies, the Conservative MP for Shipley, said he wouldn’t support a deal that “leaves us shackled to EU rules and regulations in perpetuity.”Fisheries is another emotive issue where Conservative MPs are on alert for a sell-out. At least 20 to 30 Tory backbenchers would vote against any deal that is perceived to have conceded to the EU on fishing, predicted one Conservative lawmaker, who asked not to be identified.And while Johnson has a clear majority in Parliament, it only takes a rebellion by one-tenth of his MPs to endanger a win in the House of Commons. Earlier this month, 55 Conservatives voted against the government over its latest coronavirus restrictions, and the measures only passed due to a majority of the opposition Labour Party abstaining.On Brexit, the Labour Party is likely to either support Johnson or abstain. However, it would be gravely damaging for the prime minister if he relied on opposition votes to succeed, one senior MP said. Johnson would lose trust and authority and the wound would never heal, the MP said.Johnson is aware of the parliamentary dynamic and understands the need for any accord with the EU to command the support of his MPs, according to a person close to the trade talks, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.The UK and EU negotiators have been given until Sunday to make a breakthrough, at which point Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will take a view on whether the process should continue.On Friday, the prime minister said businesses should get ready for the talks to fail and for Britain to trade with the EU on WTO terms. This would be “wonderful for the UK,” Johnson told reporters. “We’d be able to do exactly what we want.”Euroskeptic Tories may get their dream Brexit at last.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-conservative-party-at-his-back-boris-johnson-can-t-cave-in-on-brexit/story-4PYWNCeb6rMO0StiNyISdI.html
12-12-2020||World||Ocasio-Cortez slams McConnell for bottlenecking Covid relief fund on Instagram live||US Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed Republican and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for warming up to the wealthy while explaining what was holding up the Covid -19 relief during a live session on Instagram. Ocasio-Cortez, commonly known as AOC, has been pushing for a direct payment of $1,200 to be included in the Covid-19 relief bill and pointed that some Republicans, including senator Josh Hawley, were in support of it, but McConnell was proving to be the bottleneck.According to Ocasio-Cortez, McConnell would only allow the $1,200 checks only if he gets to pass corporate liability protection in exchange. Corporate liability protection, or corporate immunity, if passed, would mean that big corporations, for five years, would be immune from Covid-19 related lawsuits from their employees for putting them in dangerous environments in a time when coronavirus infections are surging across the US.Dangerous environments include cramming a large number of people in close proximity without providing them with the necessary safety equipment as per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. As per Ocasio-Cortez, Democrats were against this proposal since a one-time $1,200 cheque and a ‘super short’ expansion of unemployment insurance were not worth people’s lives or hospital bills worth millions of dollars.“The deal is that you’re gonna end up behind, because you may get a $1,200 check on one hand, but you may also get a multimillion-dollar hospital bill with no recourse and no ability to protect yourself from a negligent corporation or employer. So that’s not worth it. Your check is not worth your life,” she said.She branded the situation ‘sad’ for being a partisan issue and slammed McConnell for wanting ‘yet another corporate bailout’ to improve people’s well-being and ability to survive. “The current $900 (billion) package that’s being negotiated has tiny unemployment expansion, to the tune of about $300 and no stimulus check. Is that enough?” Ocasio Cortez asked her viewers on Instagram.She went on to slam McConnell for warming up to the needs of the wealthy when she brought up the $4 trillion leveraged fund that was passed in March for Wall Street. “We don’t see this kind of austerity when it comes to things that the absolute wealthiest people in our society demand. She also said that this ‘austerity mindset’ is not visible while spending for the military. “We are voting, and have voted this year, in committees and on the floor in advancing a $740 billion defence bill.”The US has 15,851,014 cases of the coronavirus disease and 295,522 people have died, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ocasio-cortez-slams-mcconnell-for-bottlenecking-covid-relief-fund-on-instagram-live/story-2KoXXZtaY0BKV1htfphn9I.html

A French minister said on Thursday that France would compensate its fishermen and take other measures to help them if talks on a trade deal collapse, in an effort to avoid clashes at sea.Britain quit the EU in January but remains an informal member until Dec 31 - the end of a transition period during which it has remained in the EU single market and customs union.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday it was now unlikely a trade deal would be agreed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/royal-navy-to-protect-britain-s-fishing-waters-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit/story-6AwuHZRK4DiKhmS2MXgvWN.html
12-12-2020||World||Britain to end state support for fossil fuel sector exports||Britain said Friday that it is ending state support for fossil fuel industry exports, and shifting government assistance to low-carbon and renewable energy projects abroad.The announcement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson comes a day before he co-hosts a virtual summit with more than 70 world leaders to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate accord.Britain already declared earlier this month that it plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% by 2030.“By taking ambitious and decisive action today, we will create the jobs of the future, drive the recovery from coronavirus and protect our beautiful planet for generations to come,” Johnson said in a statement.The UK government said it will “end export finance, aid funding and trade promotion for new crude oil, natural gas or thermal coal projects, with very limited exceptions.” The policy means an end to government support in the form of overseas development aid, export finance or trade promotion for the extraction, production, transportation and refining of crude oil or thermal coal outside Britain. The same will apply to natural gas, except for some gas-fired power plants and other projects that would be in line with the phase-out of fossil fuels by mid-century laid out in the Paris accord.Fossil fuels have enjoyed a large share of UK export credits for decades — supporting 21 billion pounds ($27.8 billion) of oil and gas exports in the last four years alone.“The UK government has finally seen sense, that we need to match our action on climate change at home with an equivalent effort overseas,” said Alison Doig of the London-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. “Investing (...) in an international green energy transition will create new markets overseas and secure future trade and jobs for the UK; a win-win.” Mohamed Adow, head of the Nairobi-based group Power Shift Africa, also welcomed the move.“We need to make sure there’s no devil in the detail when the full policy is released, but on the surface it looks to be a hugely encouraging move and sets the tone for this weekend’s Climate Ambition Summit,” he said. “Now other countries need to follow suit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-end-state-support-for-fossil-fuel-sector-exports/story-7imnsCsOhMhsYsJ6YS68LI.html

That’s despite restrictions at the second-highest level of 2.5 out of a scale of 3 in the greater Seoul area since Tuesday.If the spread continues, the government will have no choice but raise measures to Level 3, Chung said in a meeting on Saturday, urging that efforts be made to curb the spread to reduce the impact that tighter limits would have on the economy and society. On his Facebook account, President Moon Jae-in referred to the Covid-19 situation as an “emergency” and ordered the mobilization of all resources to contain the virus.South Korea had been praised and emulated for its earlier success in slowing the virus’s spread without a lockdown, relying instead on rapid testing and contact-tracing to reduce flareups.Under South Korea’s Level 3 restrictions, gatherings of 10 people or more are prohibited, including all sporting events, while schools can only offer online classes. The public is advised to stay at home as much as possible, and companies are required to have non-essential employees work from home. There are no travel restrictions, although foreign visitors are required to be quarantined for 14 days unless they are exempt under cross-border agreements.The country in November modified its social-distancing system with a five-tier system that intensifies restrictions according to the severity of the outbreak. Level 3 is adopted when an “extreme” spike in locally-transmitted infections sparks a large-scale, nationwide outbreak, or when daily cases reach 800 or more, according to Korea Disease Control & Prevention Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-says-tightest-covid-restrictions-may-be-inevitable/story-W4lepMVv114ZPvdkIx2GhO.html

During his murderous spree, he sent a series of terrifying letters to the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper.Some of the notes were in code, including a particularly complex missive with 340 characters that became known as the 340 cipher. “I hope you are having lots of fun trying to catch me,” said the cipher, cracked last week by codebreakers David Oranchak, Sam Blake and Jarl Van Eycke, according to a video posted on YouTube by Oranchak. “I am not afraid of the gas chamber because it will send me to paradice (sic) all the sooner because I now have enough slaves to work for me.” Like the murders themselves, solving the Zodiac ciphers has become an international fixation for true-crime followers.Oranchak, whom the San Francisco Chronicle identified as a 46-year-old Web designer who lives in Virginia, said in the video he had hoped the cipher would yield information about the killer’s identity.“The message doesn’t really say a whole lot,” he said. “It’s more of the same attention-seeking junk from Zodiac.”The San Francisco office of the FBI on Friday confirmed that the group had cracked the coded message, and said the investigation into the half-century-old case was ongoing.“The FBI is aware that a cipher attributed to the Zodiac Killer was recently solved by private citizens,” the FBI said in a statement posted on Twitter. “The Zodiac Killer terrorized multiple communities across Northern California, and even though decades have gone by, we continue to seek justice for the victims of these brutal crimes.” No one was ever charged in the Zodiac case, and theories abound as to the killer’s real identity. The case has inspired numerous books and movies, including 1971’s “Dirty Harry” starring Clint Eastwood and 2007’s “Zodiac” with Robert Downey Jr.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-more-than-50-yrs-coded-message-sent-by-zodiac-serial-killer-solved-by-amateur-sleuths/story-P6tTUZAyRfb2YmRWozQFTJ.html
12-12-2020||World||Indonesian cleric turns himself in for Covid-19 violation||A firebrand Indonesian cleric turned himself in to authorities Saturday after he was accused of inciting people to breach pandemic restrictions by holding events with large crowds.Rizieq Shihab, leader of the Islamic Defenders Front, arrived at Jakarta police headquarters a day after police warned they would arrest him after he ignored several summonses.Wearing a white robe, turban and face mask, Shihab told reporters that he never ran away or hid from police.“With God’s permission, I can come to the Jakarta police for an investigation according to the laws and regulations,” he said ahead of questioning.Jakarta police spokesman Yusri Yunus told a news conference Friday that Shihab is accused of ignoring measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 by holding an event to commemorate Prophet Muhammad’s birthday and the wedding of his daughter last month that pulled in thousands of his supporters.He said Shihab could face up to six years in prison if found guilty of inciting people to violate health regulations amid an outbreak and of obstructing law enforcement.Shihab’s presence in several events in Jakarta and West Java attracted large crowds with attendants visibly ignoring physical distancing and many failing to wear masks.Jakarta Gov. Anies Baswedan and West Java Gov. Ridwan Kamil have been questioned as witnesses in the case.The gatherings took place less than a week after his arrival from a three-year exile in Saudi Arabia.Shihab left Indonesia in 2017 for a pilgrimage to Mecca shortly after police charged him in a pornography case and with insulting the official state ideology. Police dropped both charges a year later due to weak evidence, but authorities in Saudi Arabia had banned him from leaving the country without an explanation.The Islamic Defenders Front, known by its Indonesian acronym FPI, has a long record of vandalizing nightspots, hurling stones at Western embassies and attacking rival religious groups. It wants the Islamic Shariah law to apply to Indonesia’s 230 million Muslims.The group has gained significant influence in recent years through humanitarian and charity work. It was a key organizer of massive street protests in 2016 and 2017 against the Christian governor of Jakarta, who was subsequently imprisoned for blasphemy.Indonesia has reported more than 600,000 cases of the coronavirus, the largest tally in Southeast Asia and second in Asia only to India’s 9.8 million cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-cleric-turns-himself-in-for-covid-19-violation/story-favm4fFRjn04ZhuXVHRBHM.html

The notification regarding the ban claimed that speculative transactions also emerge out of the situation which jeopardizes the interest of the people and deprive them of their hard-earned money, thus creating panic and anxiety in the society.Likewise, the ban also extended over the use of cassette players sound, system, CD/DVD and other mediums for making objectionable/sectarian-related speeches, Dawn reported.This comes as Pakistan opposition’s 11-party alliance - Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) is set to hold its sixth power show in Lahore on Sunday, despite efforts by Prime Minister Imran Khan’s to block the rally proceedings.The Pakistan government also flooded the Minar-e-Pakistan lawns in a “failed effort” to stop PDM from holding their rally on December 13.The PDM has held five similar rallies in Peshawar, Gujranwala, Karachi, Quetta and Multan since October 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-opposition-rallies-in-pakistan-islamabad-extends-two-month-ban-on-gatherings-demonstrations/story-HC7P07MVnKncmdVEFL2ntK.html

Iraq topped the list of most dangerous countries for practising journalism, as 340 journalists lost their lives there, followed by Mexico (178 journalists), the Philippines (178 journalists), Pakistan (138 journalists)’In 2020, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) recorded the killing of 42 journalists and media staff so far in targeted attacks, bomb blasts and cross-firing incidents in 15 countries.“Mexico tops the list for a fourth time in five years with 13 killings, followed by Pakistan (five) the Philippines, Somalia and Syria (two each) while one journalist was killed in each of the six countries Cameroon, Honduras, Paraguay, Russia, Sweden and Yemen,” Dawn reported quoting the report.The report further stated that in the Indian sub-continent, murders of journalists in Pakistan have featured almost every year since 1990 adding that 40 per cent of the total deaths of journalists in the Asia Pacific region.Earlier this year, a report by Freedom Network said that Pakistan continues to be ranked as one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, as more than 140 journalists have been killed in the country since 2000.This year’s report on impunity against journalists facing trial by law in Pakistan will cause much distress to all those who consider the existence of a strong and independent media essential to good governance and social progress, writes IA Rehman, journalist and human rights advocate, for Dawn.Even as Prime Minister Imran Khan claims of no crackdown on Pakistan’s journalists, Mubashir Zaidi, a journalist, has revealed that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has registered cases against 49 journalists, as of September this year.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan also condemned the action of the PTI government demanding that the state should refrain from such actions and stop using the FIA to curb political dissent.“HRCP is alarmed by the news in circulation that the FIA is registering cases against 49 journalists and social media activists under PECA regulations. We demand that the state refrain from such action and stop using the FIA to curb political dissent,” it tweeted in September.Khan claimed that there is no crackdown on the media in Pakistan and yet the arrests clearly contradict the government claims.Pakistan is ranked 145th out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders’s (RSF) 2020 World Press Freedom Index, three places lower than in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ifj-lists-5-countries-including-pakistan-most-dangerous-countries-for-practice-of-journalism-in-the-world/story-z2QgXzxlXF0yBA2ER2ly0O.html
12-12-2020||World||How Germany lost its way on coronavirus||Chancellor Angela Merkel’s voice briefly cracked as she appealed to Germans this week to rein in Christmas celebrations to protect grandma and grandpa from the coronavirus.The trained physicist’s unusually emotional outburst during a debate in parliament was brought on by her failure to slow the spread of the disease. After comfortably handling the initial wave of the pandemic, the country is now lagging behind many of its neighbours and faces increasing pressure to tighten restrictions days before Christmas.Germany’s stumbles are a function of its complex and at times dysfunctional federal system, Merkel’s pursuit of open borders and political power plays ahead of next year’s elections. It puts Europe’s largest economy at risk of another blow to consumer and business confidence.Fresh off brokering a historic recovery package for the European Union(EU) in Brussels, Merkel is under pressure to reinvigorate Germany’s fight against the pandemic. She is expected to meet with the heads of the country’s 16 states over the weekend to impose stiffer measures, including closing non-essential shops and extending school holidays.Germany’s soft shutdown -- which closed bars, gyms, and theaters but allowed most of the economy to continue operating -- halted exponential growth in infections, “but as we can see, that’s not enough,” Martina Fietz, a government spokeswoman, said Friday. “The number of people voicing concerns about the tense situation in our hospitals is increasing, and they shouldn’t be ignored.”Merkel, who is in the final year of her 16-year tenure as chancellor, is partly to blame for the current situation. She effectively declared mission accomplished in the spring when she vowed to avoid reimposing a national lockdown -- which was already less harsh than in countries such as Italy and Spain.That created the feeling that the country could get away with looser restrictions that would do less damage to the economy. It also prompted a false sense of security during the summer months, in which Germany allowed people to travel freely throughout Europe while failing to properly prepare for the second wave by ramping up testing capacities faster, protecting the elderly and beefing up online-learning capabilities.The country’s situation at the heart of Europe -- bordering on the fall hot spots of Belgium and the Czech Republic -- may also have contributed to a stubborn outbreak, which has gotten worse since the partial shutdown was implemented in early November. On Friday, the country’s contagion rate climbed to more than triple the target rate set by Merkel’s government.When it became clear in mid-November that the infection rate was not coming down, Germany’s federalist system -- in which states control health policy and schools -- became a major stumbling bloc for a clear response. Merkel at the time pushed for much stricter curbs. But many regional state leaders resisted, afraid of alienating voters with further restrictions and angry about the way Merkel tried to force them into a decision.Others simply jockeyed for a role in the post-Merkel order.Bavarian Premier Markus Soeder, the current front-runner to become the next chancellor, backed Merkel’s tougher approach, as he used the pandemic to elevate his national profile. He cancelled Munich’s Oktoberfest already in the spring and imposed a curfew for hard-hit areas this week. On Friday, he called for a strict lockdown before Christmas.By contrast, Armin Laschet -- the head of North Rhine-Westphalia and a key rival to become the chancellor candidate for Merkel’s conservative bloc in September’s election -- argued for a quicker return to normalcy. But with deaths now at record levels and intensive-care capacity filling up, the signals are impossible to ignore.“We need a lockdown for all of Germany as quickly as possible,” Laschet said in a news conference on Friday. “We all wanted something else. We wanted to celebrate a carefree Christmas.”Instead of brightening the mood before the holidays by loosening curbs like in France and the UK, Germans face the psychological blow of tighter restrictions as 2020 draws to a close.Still, the gloom is relative. Germany’s outbreak never neared the highs in countries like France, the UK, and Spain, and contagion rates remain less severe than in more than half of Europe.Polls show that Germans are suffering from pandemic fatigue and that their sense of risk has changed, according to Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, noting that Germans have reduced their contacts by only about 40%, compared with a more than 60% reduction during the first-wave lockdown. And muddling through is not what the country is accustomed to.“The development is not what I would have wished for and not what probably everyone in this country would have hoped for,” Wieler said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-germany-lost-its-way-on-coronavirus/story-GmWvCPNxydcALZS1fNALdI.html
12-12-2020||World||Longest Arctic sailing season tops off a year of climate disasters||Thinning ice in the Arctic Ocean made this year’s navigation season for natural gas tankers the longest on record, the latest sign that the pace of climate change is accelerating in the Earth’s northernmost latitudes.The Northern Sea Route, stretching more than 3,000 nautical miles between the Barents Sea west of Russia and the Bering Strait in the country’s east, traditionally opens from June through October, when higher temperatures break up ice. This year, voyages started a month early and will continue until at least the end of December. Record warmth meant slower freezing during the autumn.“This year could potentially become a turning point for the Arctic,” said Samantha Burgess, deputy director at Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. “This was a fairly exceptional year in that the warmer-than-average condition was incredibly persistent throughout the whole year.”The length of the shipping season in the Arctic is one of the most tangible signs that the region is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the world. In a year that’s likely to rank among the three warmest on record—if not the hottest ever—it’s the Arctic that registered the most notable increases in what is emerging as an enormous climate-related disaster.Temperatures of more than 5 degrees Celsius above average for the first 10 months of 2020 fueled the most active wildfire season on record. High atmospheric temperatures led to an increase in water temperatures. Sea ice extent was the lowest on record for the month in July and October, and the second-lowest for most of the year. Thawing permafrost is threatening strategic oil, gas and civilian infrastructure in northern Russia, Canada and Alaska.What’s bad for the planet is an opportunity for the $100 billion-a-year liquefied natural gas industry, the quickest growing part of the fossil fuel business. To ship the fuel across an ocean or beyond where pipelines reach, the gas is chilled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 160 Celsius) until it turns to a fluid.The trade in LNG cargoes has surged in recent years, boosting the stream of tankers moving the commodity from fields in Africa, the Middle East and Australia to lucrative markets mainly in Asia. Melting ice in the Arctic reduces shipping costs for cargoes that would otherwise have to transit the Suez Canal or the southern tip of Africa.To the west, the Barents and Kara Seas remained largely free of ice as late as November, according to Copernicus, the European Union’s climate satellite program. To the east, ice cover in the Chukchi Sea between Russia and Alaska has dropped by more than 45% since the late-1970s, according to Rick Thoman, a climate specialist at the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.The longer the Northern Sea Route stays open, the more LNG cargoes can head directly to Asia, where it is consumed by industry and power generators in China, Japan and South Korea. Russia and the LNG industry are working to extend that shipping season, deploying the world’s biggest icebreaker starting in October to escort tankers for more months of the year.“Undoubtedly, such early and late navigation brings us closer to the implementation of one of the key goals of the Northern Sea Route development strategy—year-round navigation,” said the press office of Rosatom, Russia’s state-owned nuclear corporation in charge of managing the route.The nuclear-powered Arktika is capable of breaking through ice up to 2.9 meters thick (just under 10 feet), almost a third more than the current generation of ships in the Russian fleet. That will help Novatek PJSC move LNG cargoes to market from its giant fields on the Yamal peninsula in northern Russia.The Arktika will accompany ice-class LNG carriers to help make a path through this route and may enable a few journeys to Northeast Asia over December and through as late as April, consultants Energy Aspects Ltd. said in a note in November.This year’s extraordinary climate conditions have already allowed for a record number of voyages to Asia through the Northern Sea Route. About 30 will be made this season, five more than initially forecast, Mark Gyetvay, chief financial officer at Novatek said in November. That compares with 17 in 2019 and four in 2018. One last ship may finish the voyage through the Arctic route to Asia this month.For years, the gas industry and LNG exporters have promoted their fuel as a cleaner-burning alternative to coal. Novatek says its LNG plant is among the most efficient in the world, with some of the lowest carbon and methane emissions. It also uses tankers that burn LNG instead of ship oil, dramatically reducing pollution from its vessels. But while gas delivers lower carbon emissions than any other fossil fuel, policy makers worldwide are increasing their scrutiny of the business as they work toward slashing emissions that damage the atmosphere.The LNG industry’s success in the Arctic is a concern for scientists and environmental groups, who see a “feedback loop” with more ships speeding up the pace of warming in the region. The ice’s white surface reflects sunlight and helps cool the atmosphere. When it melts, it is replaced by ocean water, which is dark and absorbs solar radiation. More shipping traffic in the Arctic also brings higher emissions of polluting gases, which can boost temperatures and soften ice packs locally, Burgess said. The presence of the tankers also increases the risk of accidents and spills in an area where biodiversity is fragile, she said.“There’s a strong interest to take advantage of the more efficient shipping route,” Burgess said. “Equally, it’s important that there’s policy put in place to make sure that’s done legally and safely, with adequate measures put in place to protect these vulnerable ecosystems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/longest-arctic-sailing-season-tops-off-a-year-of-climate-disasters/story-rUjRr1PfvTq6x996GuqodL.html
12-12-2020||World||Donald Trump’s legal campaign ‘not finished’ after Supreme Court defeat, says Rudy Giuliani||Rudy Giuliani, US President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, on Friday indicated that the President’s legal team will continue to challenge the outcome of the presidential elections, even as the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit led by Texas to overturn the vote count in four battleground states, reported The Hill.“There’s nothing that prevents us from filing these cases immediately in the district court in which the president of course would have standing, some of the electors would have standing in that their constitutional rights have been violated,” he said in an interview. “We’re not finished... Believe me,” he concluded.This comes after the US Supreme Court rejected a bid by Texas’ attorney general to block the ballot of voters in battleground states that favoured President-elect Joe Biden.According to The Hill, the dismissal of the Texas-led lawsuit was the most significant legal setback suffered by the Republican legal campaign.The lawsuit was filed by Texas Attorney, a staunch supporter of Trump, seeking to invalidate the election results of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Wisconsin. Following this, 18 states had joined the state to halt presidential electors in the four states.An amicus brief was filed by the attorneys general of seventeen states where President Donald Trump was projected as the winner - Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia.This comes as the US President continues to repeatedly question the legitimacy of Biden’s win, accusing fraud and impropriety in the elections, and seeking recounts in several states, despite election officials in battleground states having already certified the President-elect’s victory in the presidential polls.Following a series of legal defeats, the US President has refocused his efforts on pressing state lawmakers to replace Biden electors with those who support him and urging members of Congress to decline to certify the election results in January, The Hill reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-legal-campaign-not-finished-after-supreme-court-defeat-says-rudy-giuliani/story-ERpDEBdSpM8a2morEvjt9I.html
12-12-2020||World||US proposes $1 billion arms sale to Morocco after Israel deal||The US has proposed selling as much as $1 billion in weapons including Reaper drones to Morocco, just a day after President Donald Trump paved the way for a diplomatic deal with Israel by recognizing the country’s claims of sovereignty over Western Sahara.The State Department sent informal notification of the proposed sale on Friday to Congress, which gets the ball rolling for formal processing of the sale, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing a sale that hasn’t been formally announced.The agreement includes four weapons-capable MQ-9 Reaper drones along with laser-guided munitions, the people said. Reuters reported earlier that the deal was in the works.On Thursday, Trump said Morocco and Israel agreed to establish full diplomatic relations and that he was recognizing Morocco’s sovereignty over the long disputed region of Western Sahara. That decision defied a global consensus and United Nations resolutions in which the international community declined to take sides in a conflict that has lingered in the years since a 1991 cease-fire.Sporadic fighting between Morocco and the rebel group known as the Polisario Front claimed about 9,000 lives over 16 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-proposes-1-billion-arms-sale-to-morocco-after-israel-deal/story-WmoCSpteuR1rAS8yKzqM4I.html
12-12-2020||World||Pro-Trump supporters to rally again in Washington||Supporters of President Donald Trump are returning to Washington on Saturday for a pair of rallies to back his desperate efforts to subvert the election that he lost.The rallies come a month after a pro-Trump demonstration that drew at least 10,000 people to the capital. The day began with Trump thrilling his supporters by driving by in his limousine and ended with scattered clashes between Trump supporters and local activists near Black Lives Matter Plaza.Saturday’s rallies are meant as a show of force just two days before the Electoral College meets to formally elect Joe Biden as the next president. Trump refuses to concede the election, citing baseless claims of fraud.The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a lawsuit to overturn Biden’s election victory, ending an attempt to get legal issues rejected by state and federal judges before the nation’s highest court.One of the rallies will be at Freedom Plaza downtown and the other nearby on the National Mall. The event on the mall, dubbed the Jericho March, is described on its website as a several-hour “prayer rally” with a series of sermons and speakers “praying for the walls of corruption and election fraud to fall down.” Organisers of the Freedom Plaza rally seem intent on avoiding confrontations, telling demonstrators to avoid certain hotels and marking off large chunks of downtown Washington as a “no-go zone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pro-trump-supporters-to-rally-again-in-washington/story-ZRYQK3au14hxVJC6yXVhKK.html
12-12-2020||World||Leading pro-China news channel in Taiwan is taken off air||Employees and supporters rallied for a Taiwanese pro-China cable news channel as it was taken off air Saturday, after the government refused to renew its license, citing accuracy issues.CTiTV’s channel 52 broadcast a countdown and then went black after midnight. The cable network, whose non-news channels were not affected, plans to continue putting news on YouTube and other digital platforms.A large crowd chanted “Hang on, CTiTV” and held up signs reading “Thank you CTiTV, we will see you again.” Employees, some tearing up, sang songs and swayed in unison wearing matching blue windbreakers.Liao Chia-yu, a language teacher, said she would keep watching CTiTV on YouTube. “I also hope they don’t forget their ideals,” Liao said. “They should put out whatever they want, and report on the truth.” The National Communications Commission cited repeated violations of rules on accurate reporting in rejecting the renewal last month. The station has been fined 25 times in the past six years for spreading inaccurate information.The station is owned by the Want Want China Times media group, which also publishes one of Taiwan’s main newspapers. It has long been associated with a Beijing-friendly political view, attributed partly to its extensive business interests in China.China regards democratic Taiwan as a breakaway province that is part of its territory and has been upping its threats to bring the island under control by force as economic and political enticements bear little fruit.In its ruling, NCC Chairperson Chen Yaw-shyang made no specific allegations of a pro-China bias, but said the channel appeared susceptible to outside influence.“The biggest problem is external interference into the TV station’s news production and broadcasts,” Chen said in announcing the denial of the renewal.CTiTV appealed the denial unsuccessfully and accused the Taiwanese government of endangering media freedom.Reporters without Borders, a media watchdog group, said in a statement that the decision did not go against press freedom, but expressed regret over its impact on the station’s staff.CTiTV owner Tsai Eng-meng, addressing the crowd, said, “To each who support us, CTiTV, maybe after we soon switch to become a new media, there will be things that we need to improve. But I feel that we will slowly become better and better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leading-pro-china-news-channel-in-taiwan-is-taken-off-air/story-NBFJQINgBAUJgeFWYconiP.html
12-12-2020||World||US top court rejects outright GOP suit to overturn poll outcome in 4 states||The US Supreme Court on Friday delivered a devastating blow to President Donald Trump by rejecting a lawsuit filed by his Republican allies seeking to overturn election outcomes in the four battleground states that swung the White House race in favour of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden.The court dismissed the lawsuit filed by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and joined by Republican counterparts from 18 other states, 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives and the president himself in his capacity as a candidate for re-election. The case was not even allowed to be filed, let alone be admitted and argued. It was rejected outright.“The State of Texas’s motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing,” the apex court said in a curt one-page order.“Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed as moot.”The unsigned order noted that two of the nine justices — Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, both conservatives — had differed. They said “we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction … (we) would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue.” They had differed only on a procedural point, that they would have allowed the lawsuit to be filed as it fell within the “original jurisdiction” of the court to hear disputes between states outside the appellate process.The remaining six justices, including the three conservatives appointed by Trump — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — concurred with the dismissal, as did Chief Justice John Roberts, also a conservative, and the three liberals Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.The Texas lawsuit had asked the Supreme Court to overturn election results in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — the key states that gave Biden the presidency — arguing that election rules that were changed there in view of the Covid-19 epidemic, essentially to make voting more convenient, were unconstitutional.In a blistering response, these states had argued among other thing that Texas had no standing — ground to sue — to challenge elections in other states because one it was not harmed or injured and, two, elections are conducted independently by states (unlike in India where elections are held by the Central Election Commission, a federal body).This was the second time this week that the apex court had spurned an attempt to overturn the election mounted by Republican allies of the president at his behest.Trump had pinned his hopes on this case to win back the presidency that he lost decisively to Biden, by 232-306 electoral college votes and more than 7 million popular votes. And he tweeted it up in anticipation. “If the Supreme Court shows great Wisdom and Courage, the American People will win perhaps the most important case in history, and our Electoral Process will be respected again,” he posted shortly before the order.Trump’s baseless claims and lawsuits alleging election fraud, echoed by his Republican allies, have been rejected by multiple courts — more than 50, by one count — but he has pressed on unperturbed. He has also tried to persuade Republican-led state legislatures to reject the poll outcome.All 50 states and the District of Colombia certified the election results on Tuesday, as required. And electors of the Electoral College will vote on Monday to declare Biden the victor. Trump’s Republican supporters in the House of Representatives will try and use the next stage in the process — the lower chamber’s endorsement of the electors’ vote — to change the outcome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-top-court-rejects-outright-gop-suit-to-overturn-poll-outcome-in-4-states/story-64ytr0tdHNRBIOfpOdIAYP.html

Charges should be dropped and he should be released immediately,’ Pompeo tweeted. Hong Kong’s National Security Law makes a mockery of justice. @JimmyLaiApple’s only "crime" is speaking the truth about the Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarianism and fear of freedom. Charges should be dropped and he should be released immediately.Jimmy Lai is set to appear in West Kowloon Court on Saturday after being charged with colluding with foreign powers under the Beijing-imposed national security law, an offense that carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, reported South China Morning Post.Earlier, Lai, the founder of the Apple Daily newspaper was reported to have been charged with fraud and then denied bail. In August 2020, the tycoon was arrested under the new National Security Law.The charge stems from comments Lai purportedly made on Twitter and in interviews asking foreign countries to sanction the city.This comes after a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers were arrested in the month of October over protests after the draconian National Security Law was imposed on the city by Beijing.The law criminalizes secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces and carries with it strict prison terms. It came into effect from July 1.Several of those disqualified were sitting lawmakers, who were subsequently ejected from the parliament by Beijing overruling constitutional precedent and bypassing Hong Kong’s courts on November 11, sparking the mass resignation of the entire pro-democratic camp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-slams-china-for-charging-jimmy-lai-under-national-security-law/story-hflSj4ymTNnrZWLRN4UCeN.html
12-12-2020||World||President Trump says US Supreme Court ‘let us down’ by rejecting lawsuit||President Donald Trump tweeted late Friday night that the Supreme Court “really let us down” by rejecting a lawsuit to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory. He added that the justices showed “No Wisdom, No Courage!” The Supreme Court really let us down. No Wisdom, No Courage!The Supreme Court’s order on Friday ended a desperate attempt to get legal issues rejected by state and federal judges before the nation’s highest court and subvert the will of voters. It was a stark repudiation of a legal claim that was widely regarded as dubious, yet embraced by the president, 19 Republican state attorneys general and 126 House Republicans.Friday’s order marked the second time this week that the court had rebuffed Republican requests that it get involved in the 2020 election outcome and reject the voters’ choice, as expressed in an election regarded by both Republican and Democratic officials as free and fair. The justices turned away an appeal from Pennsylvania Republicans on Tuesday.Trump had insisted the court would find the “wisdom” and “courage” to adopt his baseless position that the election was the product of widespread fraud and should be overturned. Trump had called the lawsuit filed by Texas against Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin “the big one” that would end with the Supreme Court undoing Biden’s substantial Electoral College majority and allowing Trump to serve another four years in the White House.In a brief order, the court said Texas does not have the legal right to sue those states because it “has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.”Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, who have said previously the court does not have the authority to turn away lawsuits between states, said they would have heard Texas’ complaint. But they would not have done as Texas wanted — setting aside those four states’ 62 electoral votes for Biden — pending resolution of the lawsuit.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the justices “dodged. They hid behind procedure. None of those justices gave a view on the facts of the case.” Appearing Friday night on Fox News Channel’s ”Hannity,” McEnany said the legal fight would continue in state courts.On Monday, the Electoral College meets to formally elect Biden as the next president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-says-us-supreme-court-let-us-down-by-rejecting-lawsuit/story-XGR3yDaqc3UOcoiXgg2hFI.html
12-12-2020||World||After FDA nod, Trump says US vaccine roll-out in ‘less than 24 hours’||The US regulator of drug and food safety on Friday approved the emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine, the third country to do so after the UK and Canada.Soon after Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised the vaccine, President Donald Trump said the shots will begin to be administered “in less than 24 hours.”“The first vaccine will be administered in less than 24 hours,” Trump said .Assuring that he had “made sure that this vaccine would be free to all Americans,” Trump said the administration has already begun shipping the vaccine to every state and zip code in the country.“Today our nation has achieved a medical miracle -- we have delivered a safe and effective vaccine in just nine months. This is one of the greatest scientific accomplishments in history. It will save millions of lives and soon end the pandemic once and for all,” he said in a video shared on Twitter.“When the China virus invaded our shores, I promised that we would produce a vaccine in record time before the end of the year. They said it couldn’t be done but with today’s announcement (by the FDA), we have achieved that goal,” he said.US President-elect Joe Biden urged Americans to have confidence in the vaccine developed by first-rate scientists without political influence.“These are first-rate scientists taking their time and looking at all of the elements that need to be looked at. Scientific integrity led us to this point. We know the payments challenges and hard work ahead,” Biden told reporters at Wilmington in Delaware on Friday.“As tough as things are now, I firmly believe better days are ahead. We got some good news yesterday. The FDA committee I should say recommended emergency use authorisation for Pfizer’s BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, but we are grateful for the scientists at these--not only there, but of their great organisations, researchers who developed this vaccine and several others on the way and we are just as grateful to the scientists and the public experts who evaluated its safety and efficiency free from political influence,” he said.Stephen M Hahn, FDA commissioner, said: “The FDA’s authorisation for emergency use of the first Covid-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world.” “Today’s action follows an open and transparent review process that included input from independent scientific and public health experts and a thorough evaluation by the agency’s career scientists to ensure this vaccine met FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorisation.”Before the FDA’s nod to the vaccine, Trump had posted an angry tweet, calling the agency a “big, old, slow turtle”.“Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr Hahn. Stop playing games and start saving lives.” The Washington Post said that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had ordered Hahn to approve the vaccine on Friday or submit his resignation, citing sources.As Biden noted, this week marked more than 3,000 deaths Covid in a single day in the US, the highest single death count during this pandemic.That’s more deaths in a single day than the US saw on 9/11 or at Pearl Harbour. According to the Johns Hopkins data, the US has recorded 15,834,965 Covid-19 cases and 294,874 deaths.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-fda-nod-trump-says-us-vaccine-roll-out-in-less-than-24-hours/story-012jlC7vHGiw6Jm1tiXJ6N.html
12-12-2020||World||Joe Biden urges people to have confidence in Covid-19 vaccine||US President-elect Joe Biden has urged Americans to have confidence in the Covid-19 vaccine developed by first-rate scientists without political influence, after it was allowed for emergency use in the country, worst-hit by the pandemic.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday issued emergency use authorisation (EAU) to the vaccine developed by American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, paving the way for its use in the country.“I want to make it clear to the public you should have confidence in this. There is no political influence,” Biden said amid the reports of White House pressure on FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn.“These are first-rate scientists taking their time and looking at all of the elements that need to be looked at. Scientific integrity led us to this point. We know the payments challenges and hard work ahead,” Biden, a Democrat, told reporters at Wilmington in Delaware on Friday.“You know, as tough as things are now, I firmly believe better days are ahead. We got some good news yesterday. The FDA committee I should say recommended emergency use authorisation for Pfizer’s BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, but we are grateful for the scientists at these--not only there, but of their great organisations, researchers who developed this vaccine and several others on the way and we are just as grateful to the scientists and the public experts who evaluated its safety and efficiency free from political influence,” he said.On Friday, President Donald Trump, a Republican, sent out an angry tweet calling the FDA a “big, old, slow turtle”, adding: “Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr Hahn. Stop playing games and start saving lives.” Trump has not yet conceded defeat to Biden in the November 3 US presidential election.The Washington Post said that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had ordered Hahn to approve the vaccine on Friday or submit his resignation, citing sources.Biden said that earlier this week, he had announced that his Covid response team will scale up the manufacturing, distribution, and injection of the vaccine.“We set a bold and doable challenge in my first 100 days, 100 million shots in 100 days, asking the American people to wear a mask for the first 100 days of our administration. If we get the necessary funding from Congress, we can get most of our schools opened in 100 days, but we need the help from the Congress and the funding,” he said.“The first 100 days won’t end the Covid-19, but meeting those goals can slow the spread, save lives and get us back to our lives with the people we love the most; and we will also be getting the right people confirmed during this period of time and in place to manage this robust aggressive plan to contain the virus, help us build back better than ever and make sure everyone is included,” said the president-elect.This week marked another tragic milestone in our fight against Covid-19, more than 3,000 deaths in one single day, the highest single death count during this pandemic, Biden, who is set to be inaugurated as the 46th US President on January 20, said.That’s more deaths in a single day than the US saw on 9/11 or at Pearl Harbour. “This is serious business, and the current director of these CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) said yesterday we can expect similar numbers of deaths or more every single day for the next 60 to 90 days,” he added.“We are in the teeth of a crisis right now, and this nation needs presidential leadership right now, presidential leadership that is willing to model the steps we should be taking for our--to save our own lives and the lives of our families. You know we can wish this away, but we have to face it head-on. We have to take it head-on using every power available to me as president. We will have a national coordinated strategy that will--that will beat this virus,” Biden said.Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said that they have brought together a healthcare team that will help contain this pandemic once and for all, an economic team that will help build an economy that works for working people and all those looking to work and a national security and foreign policy team that will help keep the nation safe and restore and advance American leadership around the world.According to the Johns Hopkins data, the US has recorded 15,834,965 Covid-19 cases and 294,874 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-urges-people-to-have-confidence-in-covid-19-vaccine/story-QP1HU4miXTWLXXXQoJ6h6N.html
12-12-2020||World||Iran executes journalist who encouraged 2017 protests||Iran on Saturday executed a once-exiled journalist over his online work that helped inspire nationwide economic protests in 2017, authorities said, just months after he returned to Tehran under mysterious circumstances.Iranian state television and the state-run IRNA news agency said that Ruhollah Zam, 47, was hanged early Saturday morning. The reports did not elaborate.In June, a court sentenced Zam to death, saying he had been convicted of “corruption on Earth,” a charge often used in cases involving espionage or attempts to overthrow Iran’s government.Zam’s website AmadNews and a channel he created on the popular messaging app Telegram had spread the timings of the protests and embarrassing information about officials that directly challenged Iran’s Shiite theocracy.Those demonstrations, which began at the end of 2017, represented the biggest challenge to Iran since the 2009 Green Movement protests and set the stage for similar mass unrest in November of last year.The initial spark for the 2017 protests was a sudden jump in food prices. Many believe that hard-line opponents of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani instigated the first demonstrations in the conservative city of Mashhad in northeastern Iran, trying to direct public anger at the president. But as protests spread from town to town, the backlash turned against the entire ruling class.Soon, cries directly challenging Rouhani and even Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could be heard in online videos shared by Zam. Zam’s channel also shared times and organizational details for the protests.Telegram shut down the channel over Iranian government complaints it spread information about how to make gasoline bombs. The channel later continued under a different name. Zam, who has said he fled Iran after being falsely accused of working with foreign intelligence services, denied inciting violence on Telegram at the time.The 2017 protests reportedly saw some 5,000 people detained and 25 killed.The details of his arrest still remain unclear. Though he was based in Paris, Zam somehow returned to Iran and found himself detained by intelligence officials. He’s one of several opposition figures in exile who have been returned to Iran over the last year.France previously has criticized his death sentence as “a serious blow to freedom of expression and press freedom in Iran.”A series of a televised confessions aired earlier this year over his work.During an interview on July, Zam said he has lost some 30 kilograms (66 pounds) since his arrest in October 2019. He said following the arrest that he could meet his father after nine years and his mother and sister after some six years.Zam is the son of Shiite cleric Mohammad Ali Zam, a reformist who once served in a government policy position in the early 1980s. The cleric wrote a letter published by Iranian media in July 2017 in which he said he wouldn’t support his son over AmadNews’ reporting and messages on its Telegram channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-executes-journalist-who-encouraged-2017-protests/story-bSOFDX2OdUStiouz7iodWK.html

The US appears close to authorizing emergency use of the shot.“This is the good news we all needed,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday. “But remember, this is only the first step in what will be a massive project over a long winter.”‘Fired Up’“There are going to be some bumps in the road. Please be patient with us. We are going to work through those bumps,” General Rick Hillier, head of Ontario’s vaccine distribution efforts, told reporters. On the ground, health-care workers who will administer the vaccines “are fired up, they can’t wait to start this program,” he said.Canada, which has secured more doses per person than any other country, has struggled to contain an autumn resurgence of the virus. With intensive care units filling up, provinces were forced to impose fresh lockdown measures that closed restaurants, retailers and churches in many parts of the country. Quebec’s Legault said he’ll decide early next week whether to announce still more restrictions.Canada’s health authorities warned on Friday that more efforts will be needed to slow the spread of infections as the holidays near.By Christmas day, deaths in Canada could rise to as many as 14,920, or 39 per 100,000 people, according to new projections released by Trudeau’s government. The ratio is 1.1 per 100,000 for South Korea, 25 for Germany, and 89 for the USSanofi SetbackCanada is due to receive 249,000 Pfizer doses by the end of the month. After an initial focus on the most vulnerable residents, the government hopes to get the population covered by the end of next year.That will depend on approval of other vaccines. Canada has secured 20 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. It is currently reviewing three other vaccine candidates, including one by Moderna Inc.But there have been setbacks. Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline Plc, which also have a supply agreement with Canada, said Friday they’re delaying advanced trials of their Covid-19 shot after it failed to produce a strong enough response in older people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-ready-to-start-vaccination-as-doses-make-way-from-belgium/story-crJwNNfQnl7LmqXLlYiqMI.html
12-12-2020||World||Joe Biden considering New York governor Andrew Cuomo for attorney general||President-elect Joe Biden is considering New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to be his attorney general, a person familiar with the matter said Friday night.Cuomo, a former attorney general of New York State, joins a small list of other candidates who Biden is weighing, including Alabama Senator Doug Jones, US Circuit Court Judge Merrick Garland and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates.If Cuomo were selected and confirmed, it would be his second stint in a presidential cabinet, after serving as Housing and Urban Development secretary during the Clinton administration.The Associated Press first reported that Biden is considering Cuomo.If nominated, Cuomo would face a difficult path to confirmation with opponents likely on both sides of the aisle.Cuomo has been governor of New York since 2011 and has signed into law same-sex marriage, a $15 minimum wage and restrictions on guns. But he has enemies on the left, who say he’s been insufficiently progressive.He drew national attention this year for his televised daily briefings on New York’s handling of the nation’s worst coronavirus outbreak. Critics pin responsibility on Cuomo for mishandling the state’s response and for creating unnecessary obstacles in New York City because of his strained relationship with Mayor Bill de Blasio.By contrast, Jones, who lost his re-election race in November, would likely draw bipartisan support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-considering-new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-for-attorney-general/story-s33iFYKKzJ1JtTItLtbF8J.html

In particular, California is not seeking to add any new facts or claims,” Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in the filing, adding that it would not delay the case.Google has denied wrongdoing, and the company has said that its search engine and other products are dominant because consumers prefer them.“People use Google because they choose to, not because they’re forced to, or because they can’t find alternatives,” a Google spokeswoman said. “We’ll continue to make our case in court.”The company must respond to California’s request to join the lawsuit by Dec. 18, said the judge in the case, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta.The Justice Department welcomed California’s entry to the case, which says Google broke antitrust law to build and maintain dominance in search and search advertising.“This landmark antitrust case reflects broad and bipartisan concerns that Google ... has maintained its monopoly power by cutting off its competition,” said spokesperson Brianna Herlihy. In November, Reuters reported a separate bipartisan group of states plan to file a related lawsuit. The group, made up of Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah, plans to combine its case with the federal government’s case.California’s Becerra has been picked by President-elect Joe Biden as his nominee for secretary of health and human services - a prominent member of the health team to lead the response to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-files-to-join-us-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google/story-dfSq6VT8qTcurIUFBKK6JN.html
12-12-2020||World||With US now in hand, BioNTech looks for more vaccine production||The chief executive of Germany’s BioNTech SE said the biggest challenge facing it and partner Pfizer Inc now that their Covid-19 vaccine is authorized for use in the United States will be to scale up manufacturing to meet huge demand.“We need to solve the manufacturing challenge,” Ugur Sahin told Reuters in an interview. “It is very clear that more doses are needed. And we are dealing with that question - how to produce more doses.”The companies have said they will produce up to 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine next year.The US Food and Drug Administration authorized the vaccine for emergency use on Friday, after Britain became the first country to begin deploying the shot outside of clinical trials earlier in the week.Sahin said he expects the companies will receive conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency by the end of the month and can begin rolling out vaccine in European countries early next year.One way he hopes to boost supply would be by bringing on earlier than projected the 750 million-dose-a-year plant BioNTech bought from Novartis AG in Marburg, Germany. BioNTech had said it would begin making the vaccine there in the first half of 2021, and Sahin said they are working to get it up and running on an expedited timeline.“The baseline plan is 1.3 billion doses,” Sahin said. “And we are working on an extended plan. I can’t tell you at the moment what is possible and how much we can expand the scale but we will try to do it significantly.”Supply of the vaccine will be limited at first in the United States, which has a population of roughly 330 million. The U.S. government has ordered 100 million doses of the two-dose vaccine and could negotiate for more. Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview with CNBC the company had offered to sell the United States more doses as recently as last month but had been turned down.In data released this week, Pfizer and BioNTech said their vaccine began conferring some protection to recipients even before they received the second shot. It seemed to begin to show some efficacy around 12 days after the first shot.Sahin said he was surprised by the data: “We know that the immune response is heavily boosted after the second dose.”He said the companies have not decided yet whether to evaluate a single-dose version of the vaccine. “This will be a discussion that we will certainly have with our partners Pfizer,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-us-now-in-hand-biontech-looks-for-more-vaccine-production/story-x9IKNARNvuzXl8olIxNwBJ.html
12-12-2020||World||US has authorized the first Covid-19 vaccine. What happens next?||The US authorized the first Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE , making it available for emergency use to patients aged 16 and older. In clinical trials, the vaccine was 95% effective at preventing illness and showed no short-term safety issues. The federal government plans to release the nation’s first 2.9 million doses within days of the authorization to 64 states, US territories and major cities, as well as five federal agencies. Although the federal government is coordinating distribution efforts, states have the final decision over who gets the first shots. The federal government is sending the first shipments to more than 600 locations. Who will get the vaccine first?States are prioritizing healthcare workers and elderly long-term care residents for the first vaccinations. There are about 21 million healthcare workers in the United States and 3 million nursing home residents. Most states anticipate they will be able to vaccinate only between 13% and 18% of their healthcare workers with the first distribution, a Reuters analysis found. The federal government has said it will continue to send out millions of doses each week but has not released exact figures. Who will get the vaccine after that?States have broad discretion over who will get the vaccine next. So far, a panel advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has only issued the guidance that healthcare workers and nursing home residents should be first. The CDC has laid out a possible framework of three distribution phases, suggesting essential workers and people aged 65 and older as the next priority. Some states have indicated they plan to give essential workers priority after healthcare workers and nursing home residents receive the vaccine. Will there be enough vaccines for everyone?Pfizer has said it would make 50 million doses this year - enough to inoculate 25 million people - about half of which would go to the United States. Pfizer has an agreement with the US government to supply a total of 100 million doses, enough for 50 million people to be vaccinated. The United States has an option to buy an additional 500 million doses. An panel of expert advisers to the FDA will review a second Covid-19 vaccine from Moderna Inc next week. If that vaccine is authorized, federal officials have said they will be able to vaccinate 20 million Americans in December, 30 million in January, and 50 million in February. Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc also have vaccines in late-stage trials. If those vaccines receive authorization early next year, officials said there would be enough doses to vaccinate about 75 million Americans a month by about March or April. Officials said by the middle of next year, the United States will have distributed enough vaccines for most Americans who want the vaccine to be inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-authorized-the-first-covid-19-vaccine-what-happens-next/story-BDHgwE4O2NvZQN1QHG0aGP.html
12-12-2020||World||Mexico approves Pfizer vaccine for emergency use as coronavirus surges||Mexico’s health agency Cofepris approved Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said at a press conference Friday night.The health agency began reviewing data on the vaccine Nov. 26 and a 24-member committee voted unanimously to approve its use, according to a statement. Mexico joins the UK, Canada and the US as countries that have granted emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine. It’s the first country in Latin America to do so.Lopez-Gatell made the announcement moments before presenting numbers that show Covid-19 is still spreading rapidly in Mexico, especially in its capital. The Health Ministry reported 12,253 new cases, bringing the total to 1,229,379, and making it the fourth day straight the country has seen infections rise by more than 11,000.Deaths rose by 693 to 113,019. Mexico has the fourth highest number of Covid-19 fatalities after the US, Brazil and India, according to Johns Hopkins University data.Hospitalizations in the capital of Mexico City have been accelerating, Lopez-Gatell said. Occupancy of beds with ventilators, used to care for patients with the most serious cases, has reached 62%. While Mexico has avoided enacting strict lockdowns to stem the spread of the virus, Lopez-Gatell implored Mexico City residents to stay home except for essential activity and avoid parties and gatherings.“Stay home, if you don’t have to go out, don’t go out,” Lopez-Gatell said. For those who do go out, they should wear a mask and maintain social distancing, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-approves-pfizer-vaccine-for-emergency-use-as-covid-surges/story-MV4zRTg0YLbxHC1J2rkleO.html
12-12-2020||World||Trump signs bill averting government shutdown; fight on coronavirus aid drags on||President Donald Trump, facing a midnight deadline on Friday, signed a one-week extension of expiring federal funding to avoid a government shutdown and to provide more time for separate talks on Covid-19 relief and an overarching spending bill.The Republican-led Senate passed the bill on Friday afternoon after the Democratic-majority House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the measure on Wednesday.Without this legislation, an array of government programs faced partial shutdown, ranging from some airport operations to national parks and State Department activities.With only a week before its next deadline on Dec. 18, Congress now will focus on passing a $1.4 trillion bill to keep federal operations running through September 2021.If it fails to reach an agreement by then, Congress would either have to pass another stopgap funding bill or trigger government closures.Meanwhile, negotiators were trying to reach a separate agreement on a new coronavirus aid bill, which they want to attach to the massive spending bill.Months of deep disagreements remained between the two political parties over the size and shape of such a bill, which would help stimulate the U.S. economy and bolster efforts to battle Covid-19.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has been pushing for a provision to shield businesses from lawsuits, which he argued are growing in the midst of the pandemic.Democrats largely oppose that measure as they fight for new federal funds for state and local governments that face laying off police, fire and public health officials due to decreased revenues. Many Republicans are balking at this initiative.Meanwhile, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent, and Republican Senator Josh Hawley on Friday threatened to block another stopgap funding bill next week -- if one is needed -- unless they got votes on legislation providing direct payments of $1,200 for adults and $500 for children to ease economic burdens during the Covid-19 pandemic.Such onetime direct payments occurred earlier this year as part of emergency coronavirus relief legislation enacted in March.Last spring, after approving more than $3 trillion in emergency aid, lawmakers had hoped that might be enough to address the worst public health crisis in modern history.Instead, Covid-19 cases are now running rampant throughout the United States, which has the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world, currently topping 293,000.Sanders described in a speech on the Senate floor the long lines of people seeking food donations in his home state of Vermont and elsewhere. “Economists tell us that working families today are in worse shape right now than any time since the Great Depression,” Sanders said, adding that millions of families “are scared to death that they are going to be evicted from their homes” because of joblessness during the pandemic.At the end of this month, a moratorium on such evictions expires, as well as supplemental federal unemployment benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-signs-bill-averting-government-shutdown-fight-on-coronavirus-aid-drags-on/story-8ntFoVM89jMiyxmyBI1v2N.html
12-12-2020||World||UK navy to help protect fishing waters in case of no-deal Brexit||Four Royal Navy patrol ships will be ready from Jan. 1 to help Britain protect its fishing waters in case of a no-deal Brexit, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK was likely to complete its EU exit in three weeks without a trade deal.The Ministry of Defence “has conducted extensive planning and preparation to ensure that defence is ready for a range of scenarios at the end of the transition period,” a spokesman said.“This preparation includes a standby package of 14,000 personnel to ensure that we are ready to support other government departments and authorities over the winter period, including with the EU transition, COVID-19 and potential severe weather events,” the spokesman said in an email to Reuters. The 80-metre-long vessels will have the power to stop, check and impound all European Union fishing boats operating within Britain’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which can extend 200 miles (320 km) from shore.The Guardian newspaper reported earlier that two vessels will be deployed at sea with two on standby in case EU fishing boats enter the EEZ.Britain quit the European Union in January but remains an informal member until Dec. 31 - the end of a transition period during which it has remained in the EU single market and customs union.There are concerns about possible skirmishes between British and foreign fishing if no trade deal is reached, with existing transitional rules that give EU boats access to British waters set to expire at the end of the year.A French minister said on Thursday that France would compensate its fishermen and take other measures to help them if talks for a post-Brexit trade deal collapse, in an effort to avoid skirmishes at sea between French and British boats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-navy-to-help-protect-fishing-waters-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit/story-kVKrHdfpdeDTdmq1fdUivL.html
12-12-2020||World||Canada could issue order to avoid tariffs on UK products||Justin Trudeau’s government expects to take stopgap regulatory measures to prevent the imposition of tariffs on UK products as it waits for Canada’s parliament to ratify a new trade pact with the European country, according to a senior government official.Britain and Canada announced a transitional trade agreement in November to cover more than C$29 billion ($22.7 billion) worth of bilateral trade. The accord would adopt the same terms as the EU-Canada free trade agreement, however Canadian lawmakers rose for holiday recess on Friday before the proposed deal could be passed.The most likely option available to Canada’s government is a so-called remission order, said the Canadian official, who isn’t authorized to speak publicly about the plans and asked to remain anonymous. That would allow Canada to exempt from tariffs any goods or services that are set to trade duty free under the new agreement.The UK government said Thursday it was concerned that if its post-Brexit agreement with Canada couldn’t be finalized before the year end, exports from both countries would be forced to trade under rules set out by the World Trade Organization. Without the new accord, the UK and Canada would face tariffs on trade from Jan. 1, when the Brexit transition period ends.Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng introduced the bill in the legislature on Wednesday, leaving just two days for parliamentarians to debate the matter.“We have been actively working to ensure that there is a smooth transition, and that Canadian businesses don’t experience any disruptions,” Youmy Han, spokesperson for Ng, said by email.The House of Commons resumes sitting on Jan. 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-could-issue-order-to-avoid-tariffs-on-uk-products/story-IFVzERIWXmxmYrUTWwYM6M.html

12-12-2020||World||US allows emergency Covid-19 vaccine in bid to end pandemic||The U.S. gave the final go-ahead Friday to the nation’s first Covid-19 vaccine, marking what could be the beginning of the end of an outbreak that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to discuss it publicly.Shots for health workers and nursing home residents are expected to begin in the coming days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of what promises to be a strongly protective vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech.Initial doses are scarce and rationed as the U.S. joins Britain and several other countries in scrambling to vaccinate as many people as possible ahead of a long, grim winter. It will take months of work to tamp down the coronavirus that has surged to catastrophic levels in recent weeks and already claimed 1.5 million lives globally.While the FDA decision came only after public review of data from a huge ongoing study, it has also been dogged by intense political pressure from the Trump administration, which has accused the agency of being too slow and even threatened to remove FDA chief Stephen Hahn if a ruling did not come Friday.The move sets off what will be the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history -- but it also has global ramifications because it’s a role model to many other countries facing the same decision.The world desperately needs multiple vaccines for enough to go around, and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is the first based on rigorous scientific testing to emerge from that worldwide race -- a record-setting scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.“I don’t think you would have found a scientist on this planet that would have predicted this 11 months ago,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who advises the FDA.The U.S. is considering a second vaccine, made by Moderna Inc., that could roll out in another week. In early January, Johnson & Johnson expects to learn if its vaccine is working in final testing.Europe is set to make its own decision on the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots later this month, an important step as some other candidates that multiple countries were anxiously awaiting have hit roadblocks. Friday, Sanofi and GSK announced a months-long delay after early tests showed their vaccine didn’t work well enough in older adults.And China and Russia didn’t wait for final-stage tests before beginning vaccinations with some homegrown shots.About 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are expected in the first shipments around the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s vaccine development program. A similar amount is to be held in reserve for those recipients’ second dose.A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee is poised to recommend who’s first in line. Expected to follow health workers and nursing homes are other essential workers, older adults and people at high risk because of other health problems. U.S. authorities don’t expect enough for the general population before spring, and that’s assuming there are no manufacturing glitches.In a still unfinished study of nearly 44,000 people, the FDA found the vaccine was safe and more than 90% effective across recipients of different ages, including older adults, races and those with health problems that put them at high risk from the coronavirus.Emergency use means the vaccine still is experimental. Most important for would-be recipients to know:--Some protection begins after the first dose, but it takes a second dose three weeks later for full protection. It’s unclear how long protection lasts.--The vaccine protects against Covid-19 illness, but no one yet knows if it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for roughly half of all cases. The ongoing study will attempt to answer that but for now, the vaccinated still will need to wear a mask and keep their distance.--Expect a sore arm and some flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache and chills after the second dose. While uncomfortable, those reactions only last about a day. “That’s just your immune system working. It’s a good thing,” Offit said.--Authorities are investigating several allergic reactions reported in Britain by people with a history of severe allergies. Offit said it is routine in the U.S. for the vaccinated to stick around for a half-hour so they could get prompt treatment if such reactions appear.If emergency use of Moderna’s vaccine also is authorized, the U.S. expects to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of December. They hope to have enough for another 30 million people in January and 50 million in February.Getting shots into arms is the big challenge, especially as a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found only half of Americans want the vaccine when it’s their turn. About a quarter say they won’t get it and the rest aren’t sure.Political interference has complicated health authorities’ message that the testing was rigorous and cut no corners.President Donald Trump bashed the FDA, again, Friday for taking too long, complaining that the agency “is still a big, old slow turtle.” One of his deputies even pressed Hahn to clear the shots by the end of the day or face possible firing, two administration officials said.The FDA is unique in analyzing drugmakers’ raw data, a process that takes longer than many other countries’ regulatory reviews. In addition, the FDA insisted that large Covid-19 vaccine studies track at least half the participants for two months to look for side effects, a time period when historically any vaccine problems appear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-allows-emergency-covid-19-vaccine-in-bid-to-end-pandemic/story-w7toqY24Up7QJSBw5ch5WL.html

The World Health Organisation (WHO) last week again stressed on the importance of wearing masks and following the Covid-19 guidelines after warning people that not everyone will be able to receive the vaccine early next year.“Vaccines do not equal zero Covid. Vaccination will add a major, major, powerful tool to the tool kit that we have. But by themselves, they will not do the job,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus too cautioned against the “growing perception that the pandemic is over.”Click here for full Covid-19 updatesMeanwhile, nations are gearing up for a massive rollout to tackle the surging infections. According to the Union health ministry, eight vaccine candidates are at various stages of trials in India and are in the line for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA). EUA is a mechanism by which regulatory authorities facilitate the availability and use of unapproved medical products such as vaccines during public health emergencies.Here is a list of vaccine candidates that are under regulatory review for emergency useor are likely to get a nod for it:Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine   The vaccine produced by Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech was submitted for emergency use authorisation in the US on Friday.

In India, VK Paul, who heads the group of experts on vaccine administration for Covid-19 that advises India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, told Reuters that the country may still consider granting Pfizer emergency use authorisation, despite it not having conducted safety and immune response trials in India, but said that decision would be taken by the drugs regulator.Also Read: India’s daily Covid tally falls below 30k for second time in 3 days, recoveries nearing 9.3 millionOxford/AstraZenecaSerum Institute of India (SII), which is conducting trials of Covid-19 vaccine Covishield in India, has said it expects approval for emergency use in the next two weeks. UK’s drug regulator Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has already given a nod to the vaccine candidate. ModernaUS drugmaker Moderna applied for emergency use authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine on Monday.

The incident occurred just after 4 p.m. at the corner of 39th Street and Third Avenue in the Murray Hill neighborhood adjacent to Midtown Manhattan, police said.None of the injuries appeared to be life threatening, and the motorist involved remained at the scene, police said. Few other official details were immediately available.Local media reports said six people were struck by the car, but it was unclear as to how many people were taken to hospitals.Some accounts on social media described a chaotic scene around a stopped car surrounded by protesters, before the vehicle lurched into the crowd, sending some people and bicycles tumbling. Those reports could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters.Police and several local media outlets said the protest was sponsored by the racial justice group Black Lives Matter.A Reuters photographer at the scene and at least one media outlet said that demonstration was held in solidarity with nine undocumented immigrants staging a hunger strike in a New Jersey lockup, in custody of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-plows-into-manhattan-protest-injuring-several-driver-detained/story-mAeETxAx1XTvdQJsXwF8pK.html

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based drugmaker will be able to provide a continuous supply of vaccine doses through the end of June, according to the U.S. government.Worry emerged this week that the U.S. might not have sufficient supply of Covid-19 vaccines following reports that the government had passed on an offer from Pfizer Inc. for more of the shot it developed with BioNTech SE, which is expected to gain authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.U.S. officials have said they have confidence the government will be able to meet nationwide demand, having secured supply agreements for six different experimental candidates.As part of Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. initiative to rapidly develop and secure vaccines for Covid-19, the U.S. has the option to buy another 300 million doses from Moderna at a fixed price of $16.50 per shot, the company said. The experimental messenger RNA vaccine, which is administered in two doses, is being evaluated by the FDA, and could receive an emergency-use authorization before the end of the month.“This new federal purchase can give Americans even greater confidence we will have enough supply to vaccinate all Americans who want it by the second quarter of 2021,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in the statement.Moderna shares gained 2.6% in late trading in New York. So far this year, the stock has surged in value by more than eightfold.Moderna has said it expects to produce 500 million to 1 billion total doses of its vaccine in 2021. It is currently making U.S. supply at its plant in Massachusetts and another factory in New Hampshire owned by manufacturing partner Lonza Group AG.

The Washington Post reported that the White House told the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief Stephen Hahn to submit his resignation if the agency does not clear the vaccine by the end of the day.Hahn later disputed the characterization of the call, but the alleged threat came as Trump tweeted that the agency was a “big, old, slow turtle” and told Hahn to get the “dam” vaccines out immediately.An expert committee had already voted to grant an emergency use authorization, which was expected within days, as the FDA worked to iron out last-minute details with Pfizer. These included a fact sheet for doctors. The FDA has said it wants to warn people with severe allergies to avoid the shots for now.Trump’s intervention reinserts politics into the scientific process, which could undermine vaccine confidence in the world’s hardest-hit country, where the death toll is nearing 300,000.It was also not clear whether having an EUA a day or two earlier than expected would change when the first Americans -- nursing home residents and health care workers -- would get their injections, which is expected Monday or Tuesday.The country hopes to have 20 million people inoculated this month. The government also said Friday that it is buying 100 million more doses of the Moderna vaccine candidate, amid reports the government passed on the opportunity to secure more supply of the Pfizer jab.The purchase brings its total supply of Moderna doses to 200 million, enough to immunize 100 million people with the two-shot regimen, which is yet to be green-lighted by authorities.Two other vaccine candidates stumbled Friday. France’s Sanofi and Britain’s GSK said on Friday their vaccine would not be ready until the end of 2021.New results showed a low immune response in older adults, researchers said.And in Australia, the development of a vaccine at The University of Queensland was abandoned Friday after clinical trials produced a false positive HIV result among subjects involved in early testing.The mixed news on the vaccine front comes as infections accelerated fast in North America and parts of Africa but started to stabilize in Europe and drop in Asia and the Middle East.Around the world more than 1.58 million lives have been lost to Covid-19 since it emerged in China a year ago, according to an AFP tally from official sources.The World Health Organization warned Friday that Christmas celebrations could turn to tears if people fail to keep up their guard against Covid-19 during the festive season.- Sputnik mix -Britain this week became the first Western country to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have also approved.The first vaccine shipments to 14 sites across Canada are scheduled to arrive Monday with people receiving shots a day or two later.Israel, which accepted its first shipment of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday, is targeting a rollout on December 27.And Hong Kong said Friday it had struck deals for two vaccines -- one from Pfizer and the other from Beijing-based Sinovac -- with plans to launch a campaign in early 2021.A new combined approach is also being tested by AstraZeneca, whose Russian operation said it would mix its shot with the locally-made Sputnik V vaccine in clinical trials.Russia and China have already begun inoculation efforts with domestically produced vaccines that have seen less rigorous vetting, while EU countries are eagerly awaiting clearance on two options. The EU’s watchdog said it would deliver decisions on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in late December and early January respectively.Yet many lingering questions about the vaccines remain.Key issues include whether more side effects will emerge with longer follow-up, how long the vaccine remains effective, whether it will limit transmission and how it will work in children, pregnant women and immunocompromised patients.- Carbon down -As Europe’s surge eases off slightly, France is planning to lift a six-week-long lockdown from Tuesday but impose a curfew from 8.00 pm, including on New Year’s Eve.Greece also announced new plans Friday to slash quarantine time for incoming travelers and reopen churches for Christmas.But Switzerland, which is seeing a sharp resurgence in cases, announced a 7.00 pm curfew for shops, restaurants and bars.“Our hospitals and our health workers are being stretched to the limit. We couldn’t wait any longer,” President Simonetta Sommaruga said.While lockdowns have brought economic pain, boredom and myriad other woes, the effect on the environment has been more positive. Carbon emissions fell a record seven percent in 2020 as countries imposed lockdowns, according to the Global Carbon Project.The biggest drops were recorded in the US, down 12 percent, and the European Union, down 11 percent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pushes-for-fast-pfizer-approval-as-other-vaccines-hit-snags/story-kll84o9FammgRwWs4aNAyO.html
12-12-2020||World||Number of Covid-19 vaccines growing but volume of doses remains concern, says WHO Adviser||The World Health Organization (WHO) is encouraged by the growth in the number of vaccines against COVID-19 that have performed well in clinical trials, although the organization remains concerned by the limited number of doses currently available, Bruce Aylward, a senior WHO adviser, said on Friday.A handful of candidate vaccines against Covid-19 have reported efficacy levels of greater than 90 per cent in clinical trials, and Aylward noted that multiple vaccine platforms have shown strong results.“If you look week by week at the number of companies that are announcing positive results in terms of the efficacy of vaccines, that number is increasing and what’s important is it’s increasing not just in terms of the number of products, but also the different technology platforms that they are being built on. As we’ve seen now, there are three different sorts of technology platforms, as we call them, that have reported very positive efficacy and safety data,” the WHO senior adviser told a media briefing.Over the past week, US media outlets reported that Pfizer is unlikely to meet its original supply targets for its vaccine against Covid-19, which is produced in conjunction with German firm BioNTech, due to supply chain issues.GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi also announced earlier on Friday that their candidate vaccine will likely not be available until the end of 2021 due to disappointing trial results, and Aylward noted the WHO’s concern over the actual number of available vaccine doses.“But at the same time ... there are real challenges with volumes. These are still very, very scarce products. And just as some companies are announcing successes, there are others - and we’ve had two over the last few days - that have said they have had challenges with their products either in terms of the volumes they can produce or in terms of some of the trial results,” the WHO senior adviser said.At the same media briefing, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed his belief that more countries will begin their mass coronavirus disease vaccination programs in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/number-of-covid-19-vaccines-growing-but-volume-of-doses-remains-concern-says-who-adviser/story-6UBFglnaVr0vsCI1P0UGJN.html
12-12-2020||World||White House threatens FDA chief’s job over vaccine approval||White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Friday pressed Food and Drug Administration chief Stephen Hahn to grant an emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine by the end of the day or face possible firing, two administration officials said.The vaccine produced by Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech won a critical endorsement Thursday from an FDA panel of outside advisers, and signoff from the agency — which was expected this weekend — is the next step needed to get the shots to the public.Meadows spoke to Hahn by telephone Friday, according to a senior administration official who was familiar with the call but was not authorized to discuss private conversations.The chief of staff also told Hahn his job was in jeopardy if the emergency use authorization was not issued before Saturday, said a second administration official familiar with the conversation.Hahn signaled that he would tell regulators to allow the vaccine to be issued on an emergency basis, the official said.Friday’s threat marked the latest attempt by the Trump administration to override government scientists working to combat the deadly pandemic. Even with an FDA decision expected within hours, President Donald Trump and his deputies proved unwilling to let regulators work through their careful review, which includes drafting safety warning labels and instructions for physicians.It was unclear if authorizing the vaccine Friday night would meaningfully expedite the vaccine’s rollout.Trump tweeted directly at Hahn earlier Friday, complaining that FDA “is still a big, old, slow turtle.” Trump has publicly bashed the pace of the FDA’s vaccine review process.“Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr. Hahn,” Trump tweeted Friday. “Stop playing games and start saving lives.”Hahn disputed characterizations of his conversation with Meadows.“This is an untrue representation of the phone call with the Chief of Staff,” Hahn said in a statement. “The FDA was encouraged to continue working expeditiously on Pfizer-BioNTech’s EUA request. FDA is committed to issuing this authorization quickly, as we noted in our statement this morning.”The FDA said earlier Friday that it “will rapidly work” to grant emergency use of the vaccine.Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s school of public health, called the pressure an “unforced error” by the White House that could chip away at public confidence in a vaccine.“It creates a veneer of political meddling,” Jha said. “Every time you see the president get involved, you see vaccine confidence drop by 10%.”Hahn and other top health officials have been working for months to boost public confidence in the government’s vaccine effort, which will eventually need to reach most Americans to suppress the virus.Recent polls show only about half of all Americans are ready to roll up their sleeves for a shot. Many have safety concerns and want to wait and see how the initial rollout fares. But concerns that a vaccine was rushed due to political pressure could further undermine the unprecedented vaccination effort.“The last thing this process needs now is to undermine the public’s faith in the vaccine with political pressure to hurry up an already rushed process with threats of firings,” said Carl Tobias, law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia.Jha added that FDA officials don’t need the added pressure. “They already feel the weight of what’s happening in our country,” he said.Trump’s frustration with the FDA has been mounting, particularly as other countries have beaten the U.S. in issuing emergency approvals for the vaccine. Meadows issued the ultimatum to Hahn at Trump’s direction, a senior administration official said.The FDA decision — when it comes — will kickstart an unprecedented vaccination campaign needed to eventually defeat the virus, now blamed for nearly 300,000 deaths in the U.S. And the agency’s greenlight of the vaccine was virtually assured after Thursday’s positive vote by agency advisers.The FDA’s review is critical to assuring the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine that will eventually be given to many millions of Americans..Among the final issues facing FDA scientists are whether to authorize the shot for use in pregnant women and teenagers, who were not extensively studied in Pfizer’s trial.The agency’s careful approach is unique around the world in that the FDA actually reanalyzes all company data to verify its accuracy. That’s different from the abbreviated process used by the U.K. and other countries, which rely on summary data produced by manufacturers.Hahn has stated for months that “science, not politics” would determine when the agency gives the vaccine the go-ahead.More than 150 FDA staffers have been working in shifts over nights, weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday to review tens of thousands of pages of Pfizer’s application.Hahn told The Associated Press earlier this week that his agency had already teed up authorization by prefilling all the necessary legal paperwork.“We’re doing everything we can to cut down on the red tape, which I think is really important,” Hahn told the AP.Trump has been livid with the FDA for not moving faster to approve the shots, blaming the fact that a vaccine was not available before the Nov. 3 election for his loss. Trump also has leveled unfounded claims that drug companies deliberately delayed vaccine development to hinder his reelection chances, though there is no evidence to suggest that took place.As he has refused to accept his loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, Trump also has told close confidants that he believes the vaccine is still being slow-walked in a bid to undermine his efforts to challenge the results.If the vaccine were shipped out sooner, he has argued, it would rally public opinion to his side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-threatens-fda-chief-s-job-over-vaccine-approval/story-w3131Pi3Z8ER5sYQI80dwO.html

The University of Michigan’s measure of sentiment unexpectedly increased in early December, with a gauge of current conditions hitting the highest level since March.EuropeMost Europeans want the economic recovery from the pandemic to promote growth that prevents climate change, the European Investment Bank found in a survey.A one-off 5% tax on wealth in the U. could raise more than 260 billion pounds ($348 billion) to help fix the coronavirus-hit public finances, according to a panel of experts.AsiaAsia’s head start in the economic recovery from Covid-19 is sending a warning to the rest of the world: inequalities exacerbated by the virus are unlikely to be reversed any time soon.China’s consumer prices fell for the first time in more than a decade in November, dragged down by a slump in pork prices after supplies recovered from last year’s swine disease.Japan expects its latest stimulus package will boost the economy by 3.6%, but analysts warn that the number should be approached with caution.Emerging MarketsBrazil’s central bank signaled it may be unable to fulfill its pledge to keep interest rates at a record low for long due to rising inflation expectations.South Africa’s economy may only get back to pre-Covid 19 levels by 2025 and remains vulnerable to a local resurgence of the pandemic, even after exiting its longest recession in 28 years.WorldWall Street’s biggest banks are predicting the coronavirus-hit world economy will crawl through the early days of 2021 before bouncing back. Vaccines and more fiscal stimulus will help fuel an expansion after the unanticipated shock of the deepest recession since the Great Depression.In the slow march toward equality over who wields global economic power, 2020 has seen more progress for women storming bastions of hitherto male-only dominance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/charting-the-global-economy-inflation-debate-picks-up-in-us/story-VDrM0G1BMVzxZlxk17Db5I.html
