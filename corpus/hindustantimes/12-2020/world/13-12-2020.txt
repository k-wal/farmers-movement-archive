Some flights will arrive tomorrow,” Major-General Dany Fortin told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The vaccines left Belgium, where they were produced, on Friday. The distribution timetable is going according to plans, and administration points for the vaccine will slowly be increased to some 200, starting this week, Fortin said on the Rosemary Barton Live morning show.“The intent here is to ensure that we continue to have regular drip feed of vaccines in the coming weeks,” with 249,000 doses expected to be in Canada by the end of the year, he said.Canada is expected to approve a second vaccine from Moderna Inc “reasonably soon” and the country will be ready to accept shipments of it by the end of the week, Fortin said.On the same show Supriya Sharma, senior medical adviser at Health Canada, said review of the Moderna vaccine was ongoing and a regulatory decision could come before the end of the year.Officials have said they expect to receive 6 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines before the end of March. Each vaccine requires two doses, given about three weeks apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-expects-first-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines-to-arrive-sunday/story-t7KB6vsoKWvoyhk2gFGigN.html
13-12-2020||World||US expects to have immunized 100 million against Covid-19 by March end: Official||The United States expects to have immunized 100 million people with the coronavirus vaccine by the end of March, the chief adviser for the US Covid-19 vaccine program said on Sunday.The first vaccine was authorized for emergency use by US regulators on Friday night and began shipping on Sunday.“We would have immunized 100 million people by the first quarter of 2021,” US Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui said in an interview with Fox News Sunday.He said the United States hopes to have about 40 million doses of vaccine distributed by the end of December, which would include the just authorized vaccine from Pfizer Inc and one from Moderna Inc expected to get a similar emergency use nod later this week.Another 50 million to 80 million doses will be distributed in January, and the same number in February, Slaoui said. The vaccine requires two shots per person.“We are working with Pfizer to continue helping them and supporting them achieve the objective of providing us with another 100 million doses in the second quarter of 2021,” Slaoui said. The first to be vaccinated would be front line healthcare workers, as well as residents of long-term care facilities, he added.For the United States to get “herd immunity,” which would halt transmission of the deadly virus, the country would need to have immunized about 75% or 80% of the population, he said, adding that he hoped to reach that point between May and June.“It is however critical that most of the American people decide and accept to take the vaccine,” Slaoui said. “We are very concerned by the hesitancy that we see.”He said he hoped people will keep an open mind, “listen to the data and openly agree that this is a very effective and safe vaccine and therefore take it.”In a large clinical trial, the Pfizer vaccine was 95% effective in preventing illness with few serious side effects.Slaoui downplayed suggestions that there might not be enough vaccine to go around. He noted that a vaccine from Johnson & Johnson is likely to be ready for authorization late in January or early in February, and that he expected AstraZeneca’s vaccine to be “potentially approvable somewhere late in February.”Political pressure for vaccines to be approved was “not helpful, because it’s not needed,” Slaoui said in response to questions about reports that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows called Food and Drug Administration head Stephen Hahn on Friday to urge him to authorize the vaccine that day or possibly lose his job.A tweet on Friday by President Donald Trump, who has been critical of both the FDA and Pfizer, said to “Get out the damn vaccine NOW, Dr. Hahn.”“If that phone call happened, I think it was useless and unfortunate, and so are some of the tweets,” Slaoui said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expects-to-have-immunized-100-million-against-covid-19-by-march-end-official/story-aaEPpC5nuZsWUoAAQoVDvI.html
13-12-2020||World||Explainer: How much Covid-19 vaccine will be shipped in US||Covid-19 vaccines have begun shipping in the US after getting emergency authorization, setting off the nation’s biggest ever vaccination push. But supplies are expected to be limited for some time.The first wave of shipments is going to health care workers and nursing home residents. Officials say vaccines should be available to everyone by the middle of next year.Trucks with Pfizer’s vaccine rolled out Sunday. They will deliver to 145 distribution centers around the country by Monday, said Army Gen. Gustave Perna of Operation Warp Speed, the government effort to develop and distribute Covid-19 vaccines. An additional 425 sites will get shipments Tuesday, and the remaining 66 on Wednesday.For now, only Pfizer’s vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration greenlit Friday, is being shipped. Another vaccine by Moderna will be reviewed by an expert panel this week and could get the go-ahead soon afterward.Other vaccines also could follow.HOW MANY SHOTS WILL BE SHIPPED OUT INITIALLY?Around 3 million.When states were told their first-round allocations earlier this month, the figures were based on the 6.4 million Pfizer doses that were ready for distribution at the time, Perna said. Since the Pfizer vaccine requires two doses, the government is holding back the second shots to ensure people can get them.An additional 500,000 doses are being held in reserve for any emergencies, Perna said.HOW MUCH VACCINE IS EACH STATE GETTING?US officials say it’s based on a state’s population of people 18 and older. Federal officials haven’t released a breakdown, but some states have shared their initial allocations.Colorado, for example, says it’s supposed to get 46,800 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in the first round, with more expected in the weeks that follow. If the Moderna vaccine gets the green light, the initial shipment for that shot would be 95,600 doses, said Kevin Klein, director of the state’s Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.HOW MUCH MORE IS ON THE WAY?By the end of December, US officials say they expect to have enough vaccine to give 20 million people their first doses — meaning they’d have around 40 million shots available. That’s factoring in Moderna’s vaccine, which also requires two doses and still has to clear regulatory hurdles.Officials say they expect to be able to vaccinate an additional 30 million people in January and 50 million more in February.WHY NOT DISTRIBUTE ALL THE DOSES RIGHT AWAY?Even though Pfizer study data indicates people get some level of protection after the first shot, officials say full protection means two doses. And they need to be sure they’ll have that second dose for people at the right time — three weeks after the first shot.For Moderna’s vaccine, the second shot comes four weeks after the first.Yet officials say exactly how many additional shots will become available from week to week might vary based on how much can be produced, especially in the beginning, so they don’t want to risk anyone not being able to get their second shot.COULD THE STRATEGY CHANGE?Officials say they might adjust once they become more confident about the flow of future supplies.“As we get more experience on quality control on the production, we’ll get greater confidence, of course, at the level of supply reserve we hold back for the second dose administration,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a briefing with reporters. “But we will not distribute the vaccine knowing that a booster will not be available, either from reserve supplied by us, or from ongoing, expected, predicted production.”HOW ARE DOSES ALREADY AVAILABLE?Even though the Pfizer shots just got the green light from regulators, shipments can start right away because manufacturing and stockpiling of the doses was underway. It was a chance officials took to speed up delivery if the vaccines were shown to be safe and effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-how-much-covid-19-vaccine-will-be-shipped-in-us/story-BvPlKIBkIDwX4133AR6d9H.html
13-12-2020||World||Status report of Joe Biden’s all-inclusive cabinet||US president-elect Joe Biden is facing some severe challenges and criticism on his mission to create an all-inclusive cabinet that ‘looks like America’. The Democrat leader had pledged to nominate an unprecedented diverse cabinet and bring in representation from all the sections of the society. He is trying hard to fulfil the promise and return rewards to his loyalists who stuck by him through the long race leading him to the White House as the leader of the country.Till now Biden has nominated General Lloyd J Austin making him the first Black secretary of defence, he chose Cuban immigrant Alejandro Mayorkas to lead the department of homeland security, Janet Yellen as the first female treasury secretary, and Xavier Becerra, the son of Mexican immigrants, as the secretary of health and human services. His nomination of Taiwanese Katherine Tai for US trade representative was particularly lauded by progressive groups. Besides them, there is his star woman of colour vice president-elect Kamala Harris, who recorded many firsts in the history of American politics.However, there have been undertones of disappointments as many communities still feel left behind in the run for cabinet roles. LGBTQ advocates are upset as there has been no representation from the community until now in the cabinet and until Tai’s nomination, Asian groups too were looking for themselves in the senior-level jobs.Also Read | US President-elect Joe Biden vows to rejoin Paris Climate Accord on day one of presidencyRecently, Biden nominated Marcia Fudge, a renowned Black congresswoman for housing and urban development, for which he received a lot of flak. Biden also received criticism as he nominated Obama’s administration alum Tom Vilsack for the agriculture department instead of Fudge who has been a long-time member of the House Agriculture Committee advocating to protect the food-stamp program. Fudge was lobbied by many for not only her experience but also to fight food insecurity and racial inequality.Audio of a private meeting leaked to The Intercept had NAACP president Derrick Johnson telling Biden, “Vilsack could have a disastrous effect on voters in the state of Georgia,” reported AP.The challenge to decide on an attorney general with Black leaders wanting someone from a background in civil rights has also heated the atmosphere. Activists also feel that there are likely fewer chances of leaders like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders landing the major roles as the transition team fears poaching from Democrats’ ranks in the Senate.AP reported Norman Solomon, national director of the progressive activist group RootsAction saying, “I think there are some red flags or, in this case, some discouraging blue flags.” He also said that there could be attempts to block the nomination of Indian American Neera Tanden for the office of management and budget due to her past antagonism towards Sanders, as reported by AP.His earliest choices of four white men for the critical roles of chief of staff, secretary of state, national security adviser and his top political adviser also raised some questions as it gave an impression that the president-elect still wants to go for same old aides and not bring in some fresh perspective.His nominees need to win confirmation in the divided Senate that could be driven by Republicans depending on who wins in the runoff races in Georgia next month.Moreover, experts say Biden also needs a team not only diverse but also highly efficient as they have to bring the country up from economic turmoil, fight a pandemic, stop racial injustices and create many jobs in a country that saw a historic level of unemployment this year while being energy efficient as the country intends to go back to the Paris climate treaty.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/status-report-of-joe-biden-s-all-inclusive-cabinet/story-oJc3U43C7QPwbONAQPQLVP.html
13-12-2020||World||‘Business as usual with Iran’ will be mistake, says Netanyahu||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said it would be a mistake “to go back to business as usual with Iran,” signaling Israeli resistance to an expected push by President-elect Joe Biden to revive the international nuclear deal with Iran.Netanyahu spoke at a press conference with Robert O’Brien, President Donald Trump’s national security adviser.But his comments appeared to be aimed at Biden, who has said the US will rejoin the nuclear deal if Iran agrees to strict adherence. The deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, has unraveled since Trump withdrew from it in 2018.Netanyahu led an unsuccessful fight against the deal when it was negotiated by then-President Barack Obama in 2015 and welcomed Trump’s withdrawal three years later. Netanyahu says the deal will not prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and fails to address other belligerent Iranian behavior, such as its support for proxies across the region and its development of a long-range missile program.“As long as Iran continues to subjugate and threaten its neighbors, as long as Iran continues calling for Israel’s destruction, as long as Iran continues to bankroll, equip and train terrorist organizations throughout the region and the world, and as long as Iran persists in its dangerous quest for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them, we shouldn’t go back to business as usual with Iran,” Netanyahu said Sunday. “We should all unite to prevent this major threat to world peace.”O’Brien arrived days after the U.S. announced that Israel and Morocco were establishing full diplomatic relations — making it the fourth such deal between Israel and an Arab state brokered by the outgoing Trump administration.O’Brien said the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against Iran has been successful and said the string of agreements between Israel and Arab countries would cement what he called “the legacies of peacemakers” Trump and Netanyahu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/business-as-usual-with-iran-will-be-mistake-says-netanyahu/story-XGVrvn5J4zCiHCU3QZ36BN.html
13-12-2020||World||Spain could develop coronavirus herd immunity by end of summer 2021, minister says||Spain should achieve herd immunity from Covid-19 by the end of summer 2021 if enough people are vaccinated by then, the health minister said in an interview published on Sunday. Salvador Illa said a vaccination programme will start in January and by the end of the summer more than two thirds of the population of 47 million should be vaccinated.“In Europe, even if it is not the final end, we will be in a very different stage. That is why I think we are at the beginning of the end with this time horizon that I say, from five to six months,” he told Publico newspaper.Asked if this meant that Spain would achieve herd immunity, Illa replied: “Yes. It is what the technicians call that, that people have immunity either because they are vaccinated or because they have had the disease.”However, Illa cautioned Spaniards against dropping their guard during the Christmas period. Spain has been one of the worst hit countries in Europe by coronavirus.New cases rose by 10,519 to 1,730,575 on Friday, according to health ministry data, while the number of deaths increased by 280, bringing the total to 47,624.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-could-develop-coronavirus-herd-immunity-by-end-of-summer-2021-minister-says/story-tDevtVfvVre6xN2gca5PgL.html
13-12-2020||World||Trucks with first Covid-19 vaccine in US roll out||The first trucks carrying a Covid-19 vaccine for widespread use in the United States pulled out of a Michigan manufacturing facility Sunday, with the shots that are critical to stopping the nation’s coronavirus outbreak destined to reach states a day later.Shipments of the Pfizer vaccine will set in motion the biggest vaccination effort in American history at a critical juncture of the pandemic that has killed 1.6 million and sickened 71 million worldwide.Initially, about 3 million doses were expected to be sent out, and the priority is health care workers and nursing home residents as infections, hospitalizations and deaths soar in the US With numbers likely to get worse over the holidays, the vaccine is offering a bright spot in the fight against the pandemic that’s killed nearly 300,000 Americans.Federal officials say the first shipments of Pfizer’s vaccine will be staggered, arriving in 145 distribution centers Monday, with an additional 425 sites getting shipments Tuesday, and the remaining 66 on Wednesday. The vaccine, co-developed by German partner BioNTech, is being doled out based on each state’s adult population.Pennsylvania health care giant UPMC has chosen staff who are critical to operating its facilities as among those getting the first round of vaccinations, said Dr. Graham Snyder, who led the center’s vaccine task force.“It’s very exciting. I will be thrilled, that moment when we administer our first dose,” Snyder said Saturday. “That will clearly be a watershed moment for us.”Snyder said the UPMC system estimates that half its employees are willing to get the vaccine as soon as it’s offered to them.The vaccine is heading to hospitals and other sites that can store it at extremely low temperatures — about 94 degrees below zero. Pfizer is using containers with dry ice and GPS-enabled sensors to ensure each shipment stays colder than the weather in Antarctica.Doses should be delivered to all vaccination sites identified by states, such as local pharmacies, within three weeks, federal officials said.The 40-hospital Oschner Health System in Louisiana and Mississippi expects to receive more than 9,000 doses in the coming days, said Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, medical director of hospital quality.Employees approved for the first round are getting texts and emails directing them to schedule their initial injection, she said.“I would say there’s enthusiasm,” Kemmerly said Saturday. “There’s that thought that maybe they don’t have to be so afraid to come to work if they can be vaccinated and be immune.”The rollout will ensure there is enough vaccine to give people the two doses needed for full protection against Covid-19. That means the government is holding back 3 million doses to give those vaccinated in the first round a second shot a few weeks later.The Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of the vaccine Friday, saying it is highly protective and presents no major safety issues. While US regulators worked for months to emphasize the rigor and independence of their review, they faced political pressure until the final stages.Concerns that a shot was rushed out could undermine vaccination efforts in a country with deeply ingrained skepticism about vaccines. The head of the FDA said the agency’s decision was based on science, not politics, despite a White House threat to fire him if the vaccine wasn’t approved before Saturday.While the vaccine was determined to be safe, regulators in the U.K. are investigating several severe allergic reactions. The FDA’s instructions tell providers not give it to those with a known history of severe allergic reactions to any of its ingredients.Another vaccine by Moderna will be reviewed by an expert panel next week and soon afterward could be allowed for public use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trucks-with-first-covid-19-vaccine-in-us-roll-out/story-64izKUpEaiRjeuiZNljLyH.html

Turkish Airlines, in which Turkey’s government holds a 49% stake, plans to resume service on the route within days, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified due to its sensitivity.Turkish Airlines and Emirates withheld flights between their two hubs even as both carriers revived their pandemic-depleted schedules. While neither airline said why the services remain suspended, the prolonged halt coincided with a worsening of relations between the two nations.The UAE’s aviation regulator didn’t respond to requests for comment.Mending FencesThe UAE and Turkey are on opposing sides of a proxy war in Libya and disagree on issues ranging from Syria and Iraq to the eastern Mediterranean. Like its close ally Saudi Arabia, the UAE views Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s version of political Islam as a destabilizing influence in the region.The planned restoration of flights suggests that tensions between Turkey and the UAE are receding. Saudi and Turkish leaders agreed last month to keep their channels of dialogue open.The Dubai-Istanbul journey, which takes between 4 and 5 hours, ranked among Emirates’ busier routes. For Turkish Airlines, the corridor provided a welcome way to attract budget-minded passengers headed for western Europe or North America through the country’s new Istanbul airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-turkey-to-resume-flights-for-first-time-since-coronavirus/story-SgvW5JfCk2YG31QLq9QKlL.html
13-12-2020||World||Trump appoints flurry of allies as presidency nears end||His time in the White House rapidly ending, President Donald Trump is rewarding some supporters and like-minded allies with the perks and prestige that come with serving on federal advisory boards and commissions.On Thursday, Trump announced his intention to nominate two authors who wrote books that flattered him to a board that makes recommendations on education research. Another author who helped write a favorable book about the president was chosen for the same board a few days earlier.On Wednesday, the Department of Defense announced that China hawk Michael Pillsbury would become the chair of a board that gives Pentagon leadership advice on how to enhance national security. Pillsbury has served as an outside adviser to the president on China.And on Tuesday, Trump said he would appoint his former counselor and 2016 campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, to serve on the board of visitors to the US Air Force Academy. Going to the same board will be Heidi Stirrup, an ally of top Trump adviser Stephen Miller. She served as a White House liaison at the Justice Department and was told to vacate the building when top department officials learned of her efforts to collect inside information about ongoing cases and the department’s work on election fraud.Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was among the appointees to the board of trustees at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. She’s also married to Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and a perpetuator of Trump’s false claims of election fraud, will become a member of the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board.It’s not unusual for outgoing presidents to make a flurry of appointments to boards and commissions before leaving office. With three days to go in his tenure, President Barack Obama named senior advisor Valerie Jarrett and national security advisor Susan Rice to the Kennedy Center board.Paul Light, an expert on the federal bureaucracy and a professor at New York University, describes the practice as “unseemly” and said that every administration does it.“But nobody does these things with more politicization than Trump,” Light said.The positions that Trump has filled in recent weeks are generally on advisory boards in which members go without a salary, though they get reimbursed for travel expenses. The positions have what Light describes as “gorgeous resume value.”The number of advisory board positions has ballooned over the years. Light said that he believes past administrations have put in sincere work to match up people with the kind of credentials and experience Congress envisioned when it created those boards. He doesn’t see that same effort now.“This is all favors repaid and favors earned,” Light said of Trump’s picks.The White House did not respond to a request for comment about what the president is seeking to accomplish with the appointments and how he thinks they would enhance the work of the federal government.Among the most consequential of the wave of appointments has been with advisory boards at the Pentagon.There was Pillsbury’s appointment to the Defense Policy Board. In addition, the Pentagon announced the previous week that Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie would serve on a separate entity, the Defense Business Board. That board provides the Pentagon’s leadership with outside private sector perspectives. Lewandowski was the first of Trump’s three campaign managers in 2016. Bossie was tasked with helping the campaign’s legal challenges contesting this year’s presidential election.They serve at the pleasure of the administration, so President-elect Joe Biden could move to replace them quickly.In another recent move, Trump picked global warming skeptic David Legates to serve on the President’s Committee on the National Medal of Science. Legates co-wrote an article in April that stated: “Actual hurricane, tornado, sea level, flood, drought, and other historic records show no unprecedented trends or changes, no looming crisis, no evidence that humans have replaced the powerful natural forces that have always driven climate and weather in the real world outside the modelers’ labs.”He’ll be among 12 scientists and engineers appointed to award the medal given to those who make outstanding contributions in the physical, biological, mathematical, or engineering sciences.In September, Trump told California leaders struggling with the worsening wildfires associated with global warming that the climate would “start getting cooler” again. “You just watch,” he added.Light said some of the picks struck him as Trump declaring: “I’m on my way out and I’m going to slap you one more time. ... You laughed at me on the way out, but I got the last decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-appoints-flurry-of-allies-as-presidency-nears-end/story-1VBJhKIri6qKKoPyuHjljP.html
13-12-2020||World||South Korea’s President Moon warns of toughest Covid-19 curbs after two days of record cases||South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in warned on Sunday that Covid-19 restrictions may be raised to the highest level after a second day of record increases in cases as the country battles a harsh third wave of infection. Presiding over an emergency meeting at the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters for the first time since February, Moon urged vigilance and called for an all-out efforts to contain the virus. “Unless the outbreak can be contained now, it has come to the critical point of considering escalating social-distancing measures to the third level,” he said, referring to the tightest curbs under the country’s five-tier system.Greater Seoul, home to about half of South Korea’s 52 million people, is under level 2.5 restrictions. Gatherings of more than 50 people are banned and restaurants are prohibited from serving customers after 9 p.m.A country that had initial success controlling Covid-19, South Korea reported 1,030 new coronavirus infections on Sunday after 950 the previous day, bringing total infections to 42,766 with 580 deaths.Of the new cases, 1,002 were locally transmitted, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said. “Our back is against the wall,” Moon said. “This is a crucial moment to devote all our virus control capabilities and administrative power to stopping the coronavirus spread.”Level 3 curbs would essentially mean a lockdown for the first time in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. Schools would switch to remote learning, companies could allow only essential workers in offices and gatherings of more than 10 people would be banned.The government will add about 10,000 hospital beds within the next few weeks and temporarily pay some nurses involved in the care of Covid-19 patients an extra 3 million won ($2,748) a month to help overstressed hospitals across the country. “Assuming about 1,000 of new daily infections for the next 20 days, we will secure over 10,000 beds in the next three weeks,” Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said in a televised briefing after the emergency meeting. South Korea was praised for its early success in containing the coronavirus without a lockdown by relying heavily on contact-tracing and testing after the country’s first case was confirmed in January.On Saturday, Moon ordered the mobilisation of police, military personnel and public medical doctors to block the spread, which he called an “emergency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-president-moon-warns-of-toughest-covid-19-curbs-after-two-days-of-record-cases/story-GcbUuRh1QHmJME6PlA3EOM.html
13-12-2020||World||Brexit: Food, medicine shortages and other concerns amid trade talks deadlock||Britain and the European Union have held several rounds of negotiations to arrive at a post-Brexit trade agreement but the two sides on Saturday indicated that the UK’s ‘no deal’ exit from the bloc seems more likely than not. The United Kingdom exited the EU on January 31 but it has been following the bloc’s rules during the ongoing transition period of 11 months.On January 1, the United Kingdom will leave the EU Single Market and Customs Union, and the application of EU law to and in the UK will cease. The two sides haven’t been able to resolve the differences over a few sticking points, but they have agreed to continue the talks on a free trade agreement, extending the self-imposed deadline that was set to end on Sunday. However, the UK and the 27-member bloc have been preparing for a ‘no deal’ exit since both sides have to adjust quickly to the changed rules.Here are the major concerns and the ways the two sides preparing:Concerns over possible food shortagesThe European Commission had warned that there are not enough European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) permits available, which are required by UK lorry drivers to enter EU countries. In such a situation, the UK lorries won’t able to transport enough goods from EU countries, leading to a serious disruption in the supply chain. The EU has proposed allowing road freight, and road passenger transport for six months as long as EU drivers are also allowed into the UK.Basic air connectivityThe UK is currently a member of European Common Aviation Area which allows British airlines to fly to and from destinations in the EU countries. In case of a ‘no deal’ exit, the UK’s membership to the ECCA will cease. The European Commission has proposed a six-month regulation to allow certain air services between the UK and the EU, provided the UK ensures the same.Also Read | Deadline comes knocking: Is there hope left for Brexit deal?Medicine shortagesThe UK pharmaceutical companies had reportedly warned the government against a possible shortage of some medicines in the middle of the pandemic. According to a BBC report, the head of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry warned that no trade deal before the end of the transition period would cause “increased complexity, duplication and cost.” The UK government has insisted that there are contingency plans to ensure the shipping of Pfizer’s vaccines from Belgium if border problems arise.FishingThe 27-member bloc has been demanding access to UK fishing waters but the British government has called it incompatible with the UK’s future status as an independent coastal state. The European Commission has proposed regulation to create an appropriate legal framework for continued access by EU and UK vessels to each other’s waters after December 31, 2020. According to the proposal, the legal framework will exist until December 31, 2021, or until a fisheries agreement has been concluded, whichever date is earlier.“In order to guarantee the sustainability of fisheries and in light of the importance of fisheries for the economic livelihood of many communities, it is necessary to facilitate the procedures of authorisation of fishing vessels,” the commission said in a statement earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-food-medicine-shortages-and-other-concerns-amid-trade-talks-deadlock/story-L6a75R77kOA327aCgidQTJ.html
13-12-2020||World||UK, EU say talks will continue on post-Brexit trade deal||Britain and the European Union say talks will continue on a free trade agreement — a deal that if sealed would avert New Year’s chaos for cross-border traders and bring a measure of certainty for businesses after years of Brexit turmoil.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had set Sunday as the deadline for a breakthrough or breakdown in negotiations.But they stepped back from the brink, saying it was “responsible at this point in time to go the extra mile” and had told their negotiators to continue talking.With less than three weeks until the UK’s final split from the EU, key aspects of the future relationship between the 27-nation bloc and its former member remain unresolved.Progress came after months of tense and often testy negotiations that gradually whittled differences down to three key issues: fair-competition rules, mechanisms for resolving future disputes and fishing rights.It has been four and a half years since Britons voted by 52%-48% to leave the EU and — in the words of the Brexiteers’ slogan — “take back control” of the UK’s borders and laws.It took more than three years of wrangling before Britain left the bloc’s political structures on Jan. 31. Disentangling economies that have become closely entwined as part of the EU’s single market for goods and services took even longer.The UK has remained part of the single market and customs union during an 11-month post-Brexit transition period. That means so far, many people will have noticed little impact from Brexit.On Jan. 1, it will feel real. New Year’s Day will bring huge changes, even with a deal. No longer will goods and people be able to move between the UK and its continental neighbors.Exporters and importers face customs declarations, goods checks and other obstacles. EU nationals will no longer be able to live and work in Britain without a visa — though that doesn’t apply to the more than 3 million already there -- and Britons can no longer automatically work or retire in the EU.There are still unanswered questions about huge areas, including security cooperation between the UK and the bloc and access to the EU market for Britain’s huge financial services sector.Without a deal U.K. will trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization terms, with all the tariffs and barriers that would bring.The UK government has acknowledged a chaotic exit is likely to bring gridlock at Britain’s ports, temporary shortages of some goods and price increases for staple foodstuff. Tariffs will be applied to many UK goods, including 10% on cars and more than 40% on lamb.Still, Johnson says the UK will “prosper mightily” on those terms.To jumpstart the flagging talks, negotiators have imposed several deadlines, but none have brought the sides closer together on the issues of fair trading standards, legal oversight of any deal and the rights of EU fishermen to go into U.K. waters.While both sides want a deal on the terms of a new relationship, they have fundamentally different views of what it entails. The EU fears Britain will slash social and environmental standards and pump state money into U.K. industries, becoming a low-regulation economic rival on the bloc’s doorstep, so is demanding strict “level playing field” guarantees in exchange for access to its markets.The UK government claims the EU is trying to bind Britain to the bloc’s rules and regulations indefinitely, rather than treating it as an independent nation.Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said a no-deal Brexit would be a “double whammy” for economies already battered by the coronavirus pandemic.“It is clear when you do a trade deal that you are a sovereign nation; they are made to manage interdependence,” she told Sky News. “The UK and the European Union are interdependent so let’s do a deal which reflects the need to manage this interdependence.”Britain’s belligerent tabloid press urged Johnson to stand firm, and floated the prospect of Royal Navy vessels patrolling UK waters against intruding European vessels.But others, in Britain and across the EU, urged the two sides to keep talking.Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, whose economy is more entwined with Britain’s than any other EU state, said he “fervently” hoped the talks wouldn’t end Sunday.“It is absolutely imperative that both sides continue to engage and both sides continue to negotiate to avoid a no-deal,” Martin told the BBC. “A no-deal would be very bad for all of us.“Even at the 11th hour, the capacity in my view exists for the United Kingdom and the European Union to conclude a deal that is in all our interests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-say-talks-will-continue-on-post-brexit-trade-deal/story-LkztVJ0Wo80jd1QFvxKQOP.html
13-12-2020||World||Hundreds of Nigerian students missing after attack on school||Hundreds of Nigerian students are missing after gunmen attacked a secondary school in the country’s northwestern Katsina state, police have confirmed.The Government Science Secondary School in Kankara was attacked Friday night by a large group of bandits who shot “with AK 47 rifles,” Katsina State police spokesman Gambo Isah said in a statement.Police engaged the attackers “in a gun duel which gave (some of) the students the opportunity to scale the fence of the school and run for safety,” Isah said.About 400 students are missing, while 200 are accounted for, Isah said. The school is believed to have more than 600 students.“The police, Nigerian Army, and Nigerian Air Force are working closely with the school authorities to ascertain the actual number of the missing and/or kidnapped students,” said Isah.“Search parties are working with a view to find or rescue the missing students,” he said.A resident of the town, Mansur Bello, told The Associated Press that the attackers took some of the students away.It is the latest attack on a school by gunmen in Nigeria.The most serious incident occurred in April 2014, when members of the Jihadist group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from their school dormitory in Chibok, in northeastern Borno State. About 100 of the girls are still missing.The latest attack is believed to have been carried out by one of several groups of bandits active in northwestern Nigeria. The groups are notorious for kidnapping people for ransom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-of-nigerian-students-missing-after-attack-on-school/story-ZR4oEgNmCmfoGnMijKUt8I.html
13-12-2020||World||How Covid-19 hijacks and damages lung cells? Scientists decode||Scientists in the US have decoded the chain of molecular responses of human lung cells to the coronavirus infection, a feet which may help in identifying the clinically approved medications that can be re-purposed for the treatment of Covid-19, according to a report.Published in the journal Molecular Cell, the study, conducted by the scientists from Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM), evaluated engineered cells of the human lungs’ air sacks using exact mass spectrometry technology that can identify the molecules present in samples. Based on the analysis of the study, the researchers identified proteins and pathways of molecules in lung cells whose levels change upon infection by the coronavirus. The scientists believe the findings of the study provides an insight into disease pathology and new therapeutic targets to block Covid-19.The researchers found a crucial type of protein modification called “phosphorylation” becomes aberrant in these infected lung cells. According to the study, phosphorylation of proteins plays a major role in regulating protein function inside the cells of an organism. It noted that both protein abundance and protein phosphorylation are typically highly controlled processes in the case of healthy cells. However, the scientists discovered that SARS-CoV-2 throws the lung cells into disarray, causing abnormal changes in protein amounts and frequency of protein phosphorylation inside these cells. These abnormal changes, the scientists said, help the virus to multiply -- eventually destroying the cells and resulting in widespread lung injury. Upon infection, the researchers said the coronavirus rapidly begins to exploit the cell’s core resources, which are otherwise required for the cell’s normal growth and function. “The virus uses these resources to proliferate while evading attack by the body’s immune system. In this way new viruses form which subsequently exit the exhausted and brutally damaged lung cell, leaving them to self-destruct,” said Andrew Emili, study co-author from BUSM. “These new viruses then infect other cells, where the same cycle is repeated,” Emili explained. In the study, the scientists examined lung alveolar cells from one to 24 hours after infection with SARS-CoV-2 to understand what changes occur in these cells immediately -- at one, three and six hours after infection by SARS-CoV-2 -- and what changes occur later -- at 24 hours after infection. “Our results showed that in comparison to normal/uninfected lung cells, SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells showed dramatic changes in the abundance of thousands of proteins and phosphorylation events,” said Darrell Kotton, study co-author and professor of pathology & laboratory medicine at BUSM. “Moreover, our data also showed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus induces a significant number of these changes as early as one hour post infection and lays the foundation for a complete hijack of the host lung cells,” added Elke Muhlberger, another co-author of the study. The researchers also identified at least 18 pre-existing clinically approved drugs which were developed originally for other medical conditions that could be re-purposed for use towards Covid-19 therapy. They believe further studies can shed light on the potential of these drugs to block the proliferation of the novel coronavirus in human lung cells.

France also strongly criticised the execution on Saturday of dissident journalist Ruhollah Zam, who had been based in Paris before he was captured and taken to Iran.Zam was convicted of fomenting violence during anti-government protests in 2017. His Amadnews feed had more than 1 million followers.The EU said in a statement after his execution: “The European Union condemns this act in the strongest terms and recalls once again its irrevocable opposition to the use of capital punishment under any circumstances.”The French Foreign Ministry called the execution a “barbaric and unacceptable act”, saying in a statement: “France condemns in the strongest possible terms this serious breach of free expression and press freedom in Iran.”Amnesty International and press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also condemned the execution.Iranian officials have accused the United States, as well as Tehran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia and government opponents living in exile, of stoking the unrest that began in late 2017 as regional protests over economic hardship spread nationwide.Officials said 21 people were killed during the unrest and thousands were arrested. The unrest was among the worst Iran has seen in decades, and was followed by even deadlier protests last year against fuel price rises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-summons-german-ambassador-over-eu-criticism-of-journalist-s-execution-report/story-Z9OupDautlCPxVlWy1mzwJ.html
13-12-2020||World||Emmanuel Macron thrusts Muslims onto the front line of French politics||Nagib Azergui used to be hopeful that the racism he experienced growing up in a Paris suburb was on its way out. In Emmanuel Macron, the country was getting a president who would heal divisions, an “anti-Trump leader.”The head of France’s only Muslim political party now he says he was wrong. Macron has called Islam a religion in crisis and has moved to shut down mosques accused of spreading hatred. Last week, his government introduced a draft law to fight “separatism,” a term he’s coined for groups that don’t integrate and are susceptible to extremism.“Muslims are tired of being used by politicians as scapegoats to deflect attention away from real problems,” said Azergui, 41, an engineer of Moroccan descent from Nanterre.Azergui can’t claim to represent the country’s Muslims—his group still only has about 1,000 members and in last year’s European elections it gained just 0.13% of the vote. But Macron’s policies have reinvigorated his goal of fighting Islamophobia and encouraging citizens of his religion to stop being “invisible.”France’s president has cultivated an image abroad as a defender of liberalism since coming to power in 2017 in contrast to leaderships in the US, Britain, and eastern Europe. Yet at home he’s been courting conservatives after a series of horrific attacks by Islamic radicals and that risks alienating a Muslim population that may be heterogeneous but also represents France’s second biggest religious group after Catholicism.As campaigning for the 2022 presidential election unofficially gets underway, there’s a growing sense of betrayal within France’s 5.6 million-strong Muslim community, the overwhelming majority of whom are integrated and reject terrorism.Macron hasn’t said whether he’ll run again, but he’s clearly positioning himself as the law-and-order candidate in an election that’s likely to pit him against far-right leader Marine le Pen.Attacks by extremists have left about 250 people dead since 2015, including a teacher beheaded in October for opening a classroom debate on freedom of speech and cartoons of Prophet Muhammed.Part of the French president’s plan entails creating an “Islam of Enlightenment” and while he has repeatedly insisted that Muslims shouldn’t be stigmatized, his assertion that the religion is in crisis upset many Muslims in France.As did his appointment of Gerald Darmanin, a hardliner, as interior minister in a recent cabinet shuffle. His prime minister, Jean Castex, meanwhile has dismissed the idea of making amends for France’s colonization of regions including in North Africa and the Sahel, from where many of its Muslims can trace their roots.France’s Muslim community is broad and opinions are hard to pin down because of restrictions on collecting ethnic and religious statistics.The country’s aspiration for universalism and integration makes it harder for those who identify with any religion from entering public life, said Hakim El Karoui, a fellow at Paris-based think tank Institut Montaigne. Polls commissioned by Journal du Dimanche, a French weekly newspaper, and Charlie Hebdo,  the satirical magazine targeted in a 2015 terrorist attack, last year showed that 60% of French deem Islam incompatible with the values of the Republic, with almost half of French Muslims under 25 sharing that view.“Society puts Muslims in a double bind,” said El Karoui. “Speak up, but also, don’t show your religion in public.”El Karoui is himself a poster child of success in France, and said Islam represents a link to his family’s roots. His mother is Protestant, his father a Muslim of Tunisian origin. He’s an ex-banker whose time at Rothschild coincided with Macron’s. Two of his uncles were ministers in Tunisia before the uprising that sparked the Arab Spring. El Karoui served as an adviser to former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin.In his elegant office in Paris’s business district, El Karoui thinks France’s integration system ultimately works well, citing as an example a high rate of mixed marriages. He advocates the creation of a body that would raise funds to encourage Muslims to fund research and train imams. “After every terrorist attack, discrimination against Muslims jumps,” he said. “What I’m telling them is: It’s not your fault, but now it’s in your interest to get organized.” The trouble is that when they try to do that, they can run into problems. Fatima Bent is the president of the feminist, anti-racist group Lallab. It describes itself as “pro-choice” on issues from abortion to the veil, but has been accused of being close to the Muslim Brotherhood. When it was set up in 2016, a bank even rejected its application to open an account.Bent said she worries most about police violence, which quietly affected Muslims in the suburbs, or “banlieues,” for a long time before entering the public eye more recently. She’s critical of a law provision once pushed by Macron that would have made it harder to share videos of police abuse.Muslim voters are disappointed by the parties on the political left, which they have tended to support, Bent said. That’s when they don’t abstain.While Azergui tries to get people behind his Union of French Muslim Democrats, which he founded eight years ago after former President Nicolas Sarkozy began a debate on national identity and immigration, Bent is betting on local initiatives. She’s organizing to help Muslim women share their stories.“I can’t believe we’re still asked whether Islam is compatible with secularism when we have millions of French Muslims at peace with these two identities, and living peacefully,” Bent said. “The government’s rhetoric is dangerous, it’s widening the rift of ‘them’ against us.”According to the draft law on “separatism” published on December 9, there will be stricter punishments for those who promote hatred online and threaten civil servants, including teachers. It neither explicitly mentioned Islam nor Muslims.Doctors who provide “virginity certificates” will also be targeted and scrutiny of the funding of religious associations increased. Home-schooling for kids older than three, meanwhile, will be restricted in a bid to prevent clandestine religious schools. Macron also wants to end the ghettoization of city suburbs and support their residents, though he has yet to unveil firm proposals to do so.Azergui is concerned the crackdown will backfire and drive more youngsters to extremism. He defends an interpretation of France’s secularism, known as “laicite,” whereby all faiths are respected but kept private, though he’d like women to be allowed to wear veils wherever they want.Since 2004, the wearing of religious signs has been prohibited in French schools, a ban backed by 44% of Muslims, according to a recent Ifop poll. While the veil may be worn elsewhere, women who do so and take on public responsibilities are often criticized as promoting a sexist symbol, including by government members.“When Macron speaks about separatism, he deliberately focuses on Islamism rather than on Corsican separatists, or wealthy people building a life on the margins,” said Azergui. “We’re an easy target.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emmanuel-macron-thrusts-muslims-onto-the-front-line-of-french-politics/story-dNZg13rvfF2hshsC6pL7vI.html

The year’s best meteor shower - the Geminid meteor shower - will settle on Monday morning after which the earth will soon be at a position that will give the skywatchers glimpse of the last solar eclipse of the year.However, the last solar eclipse of 2020 will not be visible in India due to its time and the earth’s rotations and revolutions around its axis and orbit respectively. It will be a total solar eclipse as the moon will completely cover the sun, blocking the light coming from the star of our solar system thereby casting a dark shadow or umbra on the planet.As per timeanddate.com, the eclipse is estimated to last for five hours beginning at 7:03pm IST with its peak at 9:43pm and ending at 12:23am on December 15. The total eclipse can be tracked in parts of Southern America. Chile and Argentina are expected to see up to two minutes and ten seconds of darkness due to the eclipse. Partial phases of the eclipse can be seen at some places in southern South America, south-west Africa and Antarctica.The US space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), will also provide the live link for the space nerds across the globe to witness the last total solar eclipse of the year. ☀️🌗🌎 On Mon., Dec. 14, a solar eclipse will pass over South America with parts of Chile & Argentina in the path of totality. Enjoy real-time views on NASA TV starting at 9:40am ET & an all Spanish-language program with @NASASun scientists at 10:30am: https://t.co/zRP7YE1ZjV pic.twitter.com/4iWcVcTrBEA solar eclipse is the result of the moon’s placement between the sun and the earth. The moon in between restricts the path of sun rays reaching the earth and casts its shadow on the planet instead. Parts of the earth that darken due to the moon’s shadow are able to see the eclipse.India is projected to see the next solar eclipse on June 10 in 2021, which will be an annular solar eclipse. An annular eclipse happens when the moon fails to completely block the sun and its outer edges are still visible giving an image of a fire ring in the sky. The country will have to wait 4,844 days to see a total solar eclipse. Solareclipse.info, a site that has all the information relating to the cycle of solar eclipses, has projected the next total solar eclipse for India on March 20 in 2034.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solar-eclipse-2020-after-a-dazzling-meteor-shower-skygazers-to-see-another-astronomical-event/story-WQG2t1u4KAqGoSM758YcZL.html
13-12-2020||World||China looks forward on anniversary of 1937 Nanjing massacre||A confident-sounding Communist Party of China spoke of a brighter future as it remembered the victims at a ceremony Sunday on the 83rd anniversary of the Nanjing massacre.Over six weeks, Japanese troops raped and killed tens of thousands — and by some estimates hundreds of thousands — of people after conquering Nanjing, then the capital of China, on Dec. 13, 1937.Chen Xi, a senior party official called the massacre “an inhuman act in human history.” Addressing a large and precisely lined-up crowd in the eastern city, he said they had gathered “to remember the day of atrocity, honor peace and open a new chapter of our future.”His forward-looking remarks reflected how much the world has changed since the days when then-imperial Japan occupied the eastern half of the country, ending only with Japan’s defeat at the end of World War II.Chen said that China, which has displaced Japan as the world’s second largest economy, is closer than ever to achieving the dream of national rejuvenation, a Communist Party catchphrase.He used the anniversary to counter those who see China’s rise as a threat, saying that the party is committed to international cooperation and peaceful development.Chen also noted that China is the first country to bring Covid-19 under control and restore economic growth, which he said demonstrates the strength of Communist Party leadership. China is a one-party, authoritarian state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-looks-forward-on-anniversary-of-1937-nanjing-massacre/story-ph2PHtow4df8g5qe1Xdi8I.html
13-12-2020||World||Pakistan increases funds for Covid-19 vaccine to USD 250 million||Pakistan has increased the funds allocated for purchasing Covid-19 vaccine to USD 250 million from the earlier approved amount of USD 150 million.It has also signed non-disclosure agreements with various multinational companies under which the recipient country will not make details of the vaccine public, the Dawn News reported.Parliamentary Secretary on National Health Services (NHS) Nausheen Hamid told the daily that the allocation for vaccine purchase had been enhanced to USD 250 million. “We will sign a purchase agreement with more than one company to ensure that we get a vaccine. Russia had also offered us its vaccine recently. However, we are looking into its safety and efficacy as public health is our top priority,” she was quoted as saying. When asked when the vaccine will be available, Hamid said it was hoped that the delivery of the vaccine would start by the end of the first quarter of next year. She said that in the initial phase of vaccinations, frontline health workers attending to Covid-19 patients and people over 65 years will be vaccinated. In the second phase, the remaining healthcare workers and people over 60 years of age will get preference, she said, adding that the vaccine alliance GAVI has also pledged to provide vaccines for the 20 per cent population. By the end of 2021, it would be available to the masses, Hamid added. Replying to another question, the parliamentary secretary said Pfizer had offered special containers to maintain the cold chain, adding that the vaccine could be kept in normal freezers for five days. A senior official of the ministry of National Health Services (NHS) told the paper that there were six potential companies and the ministry was not only engaged with them but had signed non-disclosure agreements with some of them due to which they were sharing data and progress of vaccine trials. “The Chinese vaccine is also under trial in Pakistan so we will get the vaccine on a priority basis. As per assurances given by the companies we may get between 100,000 and 500,000 doses by the end of February or in March. The vaccine will be administered to the most vulnerable people such as healthcare professionals working with Covid-19 patients,” he was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases jumped to 438,425 on Sunday after 3,369 new cases were reported. Another 72 patients died in the last one day, taking the Covid-19 death toll to 8,796, while at least 2,471 patients were in critical condition, according to the NHS ministry, which added that 3,83,000 people have recovered so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-increases-funds-for-covid-19-vaccine-to-usd-250-million/story-kP4lt8hUa7QPD69bDBguhK.html
13-12-2020||World||Deadline comes knocking: Is there hope left for Brexit deal?||Facing yet another self-imposed Brexit deadline on Sunday, the chief negotiators from the European Union and United Kingdom were making last-ditch efforts to bridge differences on a trade deal that have proved insurmountable for the best part of the year.The EU’s Michel Barnier and Britain’s David Frost were already meeting just after dawn Sunday to try to reach a middle ground. But so far, the U.K. hasn’t backed down from its insistence on trading with the 27-nation bloc with as few restraints as possible, and the EU isn’t yielding on its demand to accept trade only if Britain respects the rules of the bloc.“There is still I think a long way to go,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said early Sunday.Britain left the EU on Jan. 31, but remains in its economic structures until a transition period ends on Dec. 31.Expectations are that the deadline day will be capped with a contact between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen late Sunday.Whether it’s a negotiating ploy or not, Johnson has publicly said the U.K. would still thrive mightily if there is no deal and it was “very, very likely” that negotiations on a new relationship that will take effect on Jan. 1 will fail.If the talks break down Sunday, both sides will have less than three weeks to prepare for the chaotic and costly no-deal exit at the end of the year.Without a deal U.K. will trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization terms — with all the tariffs and barriers that would bring.To jumpstart the flagging talks, negotiators have imposed several deadlines, but none have brought the sides closer together on the issues of fair trading standards, legal oversight of any deal and the rights of EU fishermen to go into U.K. waters.While both sides want a deal on the terms of a new relationship, they have fundamentally different views of what it entails.

13-12-2020||World||‘Truly exhausted’: Texas doctor has been working for over 260 days without a single off day||Through multiple masks, a face shield and a protective suit he likens to those worn by astronauts, Dr Joseph Varon bends over his Covid-19 patient and waves into the phone she is holding up.At the other end of the video call, several loved ones express their delight at seeing the man who helped save Gloria Garcia from the disease that has killed more than 278,000 people in the US and counting.Varon, the chief of staff at United Memorial, a small hospital that primarily treats minority patients in a low-income north Houston neighborhood, made headlines when a photo of him hugging an elderly Covid patient on Thanksgiving went viral. The hug was a candid moment of empathy. And Varon’s wave to Garcia’s family is enthusiastic.But make no mistake: the doctor is exhausted.When AFP accompanied Varon on his rounds on Friday, it was his 260th straight day of work. Even the few hours he steals at home each day are interrupted by endless phone calls. He sleeps, he says, no more than one or two hours a night. “Don’t ask me how I can do this,” he adds. Donuts play a role. He displays a box, adding: “Whatever they bring is what I will eat because you don’t know when you’re going to eat again.” He says he has gained 35 pounds (15 kilograms).Outspoken and frustrated, Varon complained to the media as far back as July that he and his staff were running “on fumes.”“My staff is very tired. My nurses, they will start crying in the middle of the day. They will break down because they are so overwhelmed with the number of cases we’re getting that they are truly exhausted,” he tells AFP.- Reinforcements -Inside the critical care Covid ward, the beds are full. Staff take vitals and check on patients. Varon does his daily rounds.Garcia, ahead of her video call, sits up in bed and carefully arranges her hair and makeup. Other patients lie back on their pillows, with get well cards taped to walls.The health workers’ faces can barely be seen through the layers of protective gear. Some, including Varon, wear large photographs of themselves around their necks. It was the loneliness and lack of human contact on the ward that drove his pity for the man he hugged in the viral photo, he said.During the summer, as cases across Texas surged, they were backed up by a specialist army team providing medical support. But the military soon moved on. Varon and his staff kept working. They have some reinforcements still: since the pandemic began, travelling nurses across America have rushed towards the danger even as others have hunkered down.Demetra Ransom is one of them. She left her home in Florida to head first to New York, epicenter of the US outbreak in the spring, and then to other hotspots before landing in Houston. At United Memorial she is tactile with the patients, touching their arms and shoulders to comfort them. She talks even to those who are non-responsive, she says, updating them on their condition in case they can hear. - ‘Covid hunters’ -It did not have to be this way, Varon believes.He has expressed his frustration with the American failure to control the pandemic many times.Texas Governor George Abbott, a Republican and ally of President Donald Trump, ordered a one-month lockdown in the state in April -- but did not renew it.The wearing of masks did not become compulsory in Texas until July, as cases surged and the state become one of the new US epicenters. Abbot says there will be no more lockdowns.“People are out there in bars, restaurants, malls,” Varon told CNN when he was interviewed about the viral photo. “It is crazy. People don’t listen and then they end up in my ICU.”If Americans would follow basic health and social distancing guidelines, “health care workers like me could hopefully rest,” he said. He does not appear to dwell on sleep, however. He knows there are miles to go.The next six to 12 weeks, over the Christmas period and into the new year, will likely be the “darkest weeks in modern American medical history,” he said in a recent interview with ABC. Already cases in Texas are so high that Abbott has requested a military medical center be converted for intake of non-Covid patients to free up space in hospitals. County officials, meanwhile, have requested additional mobile morgues.United Memorial recently added another Covid wing in anticipation. For now, in the main staging area which is separated from the ward’s rooms by barriers, United Memorial staffers shed some of their protective gear beneath a sign reading “COVID HUNTERS.”Their gazes fixed, they pause and catch their breath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truly-exhausted-texas-doctor-has-been-working-for-over-260-days-without-a-single-off-day/story-mixVx6zMPuJ1sHi9ghWkoN.html

She has favoured stricter pan-German measures but was previously unable to get agreement from the nation’s 16 states. However, some states have since clamped down on their own, and momentum supporting stricter harmonized measures has been building.The draft proposal would allow only essential shops such as supermarkets and pharmacies, as well as banks, to remain open.Schools will also be basically closed during the period, and employers will be asked to close operations or have employees work from home, according to the draft. The sale of fireworks will be banned.Germany has been in partial lockdown for six weeks, with bars and restaurants closed, while stores and schools have remained open. Some regions have already imposed tougher measures as infections grew.More social contact in the run-up to the Christmas holiday means “the number of cases is now again increasing”. “Therefore, it is necessary to take further measures to restrict contacts,” said the draft.New daily infections and deaths have reached records in recent days, and more politicians have been sounding the alarm. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 20,200 to 1,320,716, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 321 to 21,787, the tally showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-close-most-shops-from-dec-16-to-jan-10-as-per-draft-government-proposal/story-2amQq5adiNJ3X4GbSlQ6UP.html
13-12-2020||World||Health professionals raise serious concern over rising Covid re-infections in Pak||Health professionals in Pakistan have raised serious concerns over the growing incidents of Covid-19 re-infections at various health facilities in the country, where several patients have been reported having coronavirus for a second time with severe illness.Earlier perceived as a rare phenomenon, a rising number of coronavirus re-infection cases have started ringing alarm bells among health professionals in major cities of the country, reported The News on Sunday.However, policymakers and planners are not worried about the situation, claiming that the Covid-19 re-infection was still something that was not fully established and cannot be considered as a threat as of now.Officials at renowned hospitals including the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) and the Indus Hospital Karachi are fully convinced that people are getting re-infected with coronavirus and reporting to the hospitals with the severity of the disease for the second time.“This is true [re-infection with SARS-CoV-2]. We are seeing a number of re-infections. Putting it together in a paper, trying to finish it but keep finding new cases,” Dr Faisal Mahmood, senior infectious diseases expert and physician at the AKUH, told The News on Saturday.Meanwhile, another senior physician Professor Sohail Akhtar said that several cases of re-infection had come to his knowledge in Karachi.“One of our senior cardiologist friends is having re-infection and he is undergoing treatment due to severe symptoms. It is still not a widespread phenomenon but the cause of concern is that it is happening and people should keep it in mind that they can get re-infected if they stop taking precautionary measures,” said Akhtar.When asked about prevention and treatment of Covid-19, DUHS senior physician Dr Tahir Hussain regretted that the centres treating the virus in Karachi and other cities of Pakistan were not giving due importance to vitamin D and its preventive and therapeutic role in dealing with the coronavirus.“Studies all around the world have proven that if your vitamin D level is less than 20, you are four times more likely to have a very serious disease and die from Covid-19,” he said.According to the latest update by Johns Hopkins University, Pakistan currently has a total of 438,425 infections, along with 8,796 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-professionals-raise-serious-concern-over-rising-covid-re-infections-in-pak/story-qCnv9W7tnxOoCA7vMawtcM.html

Bahrain had previously authorized the emergency use of the vaccine, which was provided to frontline workers in contact with coronavirus patients.The UAE registered the Sinopharm vaccine after finding it had a 86% efficacy rate, paving the way for a full public use and allowing for a re-opening of the Gulf nation’s economy.Egypt plans to start the process of inoculation against the coronavirus after receiving the first shipments of Sinopharm vaccine. Peru has temporarily suspended trials of the vaccine after an unspecified “adverse event” was reported during a clinical trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bahrain-approves-china-s-sinopharm-coronavirus-vaccine/story-CWIxSituW34RUB7YYcaH0I.html
13-12-2020||World||First Covid-19 vaccines’ triumph raises hope for cancer fight||The first vaccines against Covid-19 aren’t just a landmark in the fight against the pandemic. They’re also the stepping stone for an unconventional technology that could one day defeat other ailments that have eluded doctors, from cancer to heart disease.The shots from Moderna Inc. and a partnership of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE use genetic material called messenger RNA to effectively transform the body’s own cells into vaccine factories. The approach had never been used outside of clinical experiments, and just how well it worked against the coronavirus stunned even some of its most enthusiastic backers.Now, with one vaccine vaccine having gained US clearance and the other close behind, the pandemic validation could wrench open a whole new field of medicine.“We are now entering the age of mRNA therapeutics,” said Derrick Rossi, a former Harvard University stem-cell biologist who helped found Moderna in 2010. “The whole world has seen this. There is going to be increased investment and increased resources.”In some ways, the global pandemic was the perfect proving ground for the new technology as deep-pocketed backers -- including Pfizer -- became more willing to take a risk. But the effort was only possible because BioNTech and Moderna Inc. had worked on messenger RNA for years.The technology instructs cells to make any type of protein, transforming them into tiny production lines for drugs or vaccines. One major drawback is that messenger RNA is fragile, and must reach cells before the body breaks it down. In the coronavirus vaccine, that’s done by using a modified form of mRNA and coating it with fatty nanoparticles.BioNTech’s chief executive officer, Ugur Sahin, began studying the technology in cancer some two decades ago with his wife, Ozlem Tureci, an immunologist who co-founded the company. Sahin says what his teams were able to move quickly on the Covid project by harnessing what they had learned from cancer-vaccine development.The resulting ability to assess multiple candidates in parallel was “really beautiful,” Sahin said in an interview.The cancer field might see its first messenger RNA drug approvals in two or three years, according to Sahin. Rossi meanwhile predicts that virtually all infectious-disease vaccines will use the technology in a decade or two, in part because it’s much faster and cheaper. The scientist still owns Moderna shares, but he is no longer affiliated with the company.All or NothingThere’s no guarantee they’re right. The risk of failure hangs over every scientific pursuit.But besides cancer, mRNA companies like Moderna, BioNTech, Translate Bio Inc. and others are working to harness the technology for flu vaccines, a heart failure treatment, cystic fibrosis, a common pathogen called cytomegalovirus, and perhaps the biggest challenge of all: HIV, which has eluded vaccine researchers for four decades.Stephane Bancel, Moderna’s chief executive officer, recalls warning his wife when he left an established diagnostics company almost a decade ago that his new employer had less than a 5% chance of success. But if they did, he told her, the upside would be massive.“It is not going to be a one-drug company,” he recalled saying in a telephone interview. “Either we fail and it is zero, or we succeed and it is an industry.”One relatively quick win for messenger RNA could be better vaccines for seasonal flu. Influenza kills as many as 650,000 people each year, and existing vaccines are often only partly effective because production needs to start about six months early, based on health officials’ educated guesses about which strains are most likely to circulate at that point.The production could start later and involve less guesswork with mRNA. “If you got close to what the coronavirus vaccine is showing, that would be a major improvement,” said Matthias Kromayer, a partner at MIG AG, an early venture capital backer of BioNTech.And if people need periodic booster shots against Covid, the flu vaccines could be combined with a coronavirus booster to wipe out all winter respiratory viral worries in one shot, according to Moderna’s Bancel.More importantly, messenger RNA may help produce vaccines against viruses that have evaded conventional approaches. After Covid, Moderna’s most advanced program is a vaccine against cytomegalovirus, which can cause birth defects when passed from pregnant mother to unborn child. Scientists have been trying to develop a shot against this virus for 50 years, but Moderna believes mRNA technology gives it an edge. Early results from mid-stage trials are promising, and final-stage trials could begin next year.Big Pharma’s InterestThe company is also working on cancer vaccines with drugmaker Merck & Co. In a study with presented in November, a Moderna vaccine combined with Merck’s blockbuster immune drug Keytruda helped shrink tumors in 5 of 10 patients with of advanced head and neck cancer.Besides Merck, other big drugmakers from AstraZeneca Plc to Roche Holding AG are getting involved. There is no doubt that mRNA will be an important method going forward, according to Severin Schwan, Roche’s chief executive. Roche, one of the world’s biggest maker of oncology drugs, is working with BioNTech on developing personalized cancer vaccines.“The door is opened up here,” Schwan said in an interview. “It’s reconfirmed now via Covid-19, because this is real clinical data. That’s a good reason to further invest.”Besides Covid-19, though, almost all of the mRNA drugs and vaccines remain at early stages of human testing. And while the recent success may bode well for other infectious-disease vaccines, the implications in oncology are less clear because cancer has developed numerous defenses to evade the immune system.“We can’t just simply say that because we have seen the validation in the mRNA vaccine field, any other mRNA vaccine will also work,” says BioNTech’s Sahin. “Every approach has to address different biological and medical challenges.”Treating CancerMost of BioNTech’s research outside of Covid is focused on cancer. There, the idea is not to prevent disease but to treat it. The company is trying several different approaches, with a view to finding telltale sequences on a person’s tumor and coding mRNA to tell immune cells how to attack those tumor cells.The cash flow from the coronavirus vaccine success will enable the German biotech to push forward its patient trials in cancer as well. One of BioNTech’s cancer vaccines spurred strong responses and in some cases shrank tumors in patients with advanced melanoma in an 89-person trial published this summer. The first efficacy data from patient studies in cancer could come as soon as the end of next year or early in 2022, according to the CEO.BioNTech is also working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on an mRNA approach against HIV, which has eluded vaccine researchers so far because the virus is able to hide within cells. Human tests haven’t started yet on the project.Science FictionSome potential future uses sound a little like science fiction for now. BioNTech is doing early research into whether mRNA can be used to reprogram cells for regenerative medicine. In the future, scientists may also be able to designed targeted nanoparticles that accumulate in particular types of tissue such as bone marrow, said Drew Weissman, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania who helped develop mRNA technology used in both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. That could allow doctors to treat genetic diseases such as sickle cell anemia with a simple intravenous injection of targeted mRNA therapy.“It has enormous potential,” Weissman said. “I can’t even make a list of how many different things it could potentially be used for.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-19-vaccines-triumph-raises-hope-for-cancer-fight/story-DKMRwqczGQmZT4aVQGwkpO.html
13-12-2020||World||Los Angeles mayor sounds alarm on rising Covid-19 deaths||In a metropolitan area where one in 20 people have been infected with Covid-19, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti presented another warning: they’re dying too.“This week, every 20 minutes someone in LA County is dying from Covid-19,” he said in a tweet, adding in a separate post that “our hospitals are running dangerously low on intensive care unit beds. It’s time for urgent action.”Los Angeles County, the most populous in the US with 10 million people, said Friday the number of infections surpassed 500,000. They increased by 11,476 to 512,872 on Saturday after rising by a record the day before.The county, also home to the highest number of infections and fatalities in the US, reported 70 new deaths, bringing the total to 8,269. Garcetti said a week ago that the total number of deaths could exceed 11,000 by the end of the year.The jump in cases came two weeks after millions traveled across the country for the Thanksgiving break, prompting county health officials to call the latest wave a “Thanksgiving surge.” The health department said it’s a “dangerous time” for its residents and warned that deaths are reaching an all-time high.Still, deaths as a percentage of cases at 1.6% is lower than the 1.9% national average, or 2.2% globally.Los Angeles is in week two of its second lockdown and is part of a region in California that has imposed more restrictions through the holiday season. Hospitalizations in the Golden State are at their highest since the start of outbreak, reducing the availability of intensive-care unit beds to a new low.While the city and county were among the first in the US to shut down non-essential businesses during the initial outbreak in March, along with other restrictions, enforcement remains a key obstacle in containing the spread.“Some people aren’t doing what we’re asking them to do, and I think the biggest problem we have right now is there’s so much transmission that when even just a small percentage of people are not taking sensible steps to protect themselves and protect others, it has a tremendous cascading impact” Barbara Ferrer, the county’s of public health, said on a call with reporters on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/los-angeles-mayor-sounds-alarm-on-rising-covid-19-deaths/story-kFuF702r84Ycru4w9s23cJ.html
13-12-2020||World||Sri Lanka records highest elephant deaths in world||Sri Lanka has recorded the highest number of elephant deaths in the world due to the human-elephant conflict, according to a media report. The island-nation’s Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) had ordered a special audit into the human-elephant conflict by renowned elephant expert Dr Prithviraj Fernando, the head of the Centre for Conservation and Research. In a meeting of the COPA held recently, it was also disclosed that Sri Lanka ranked number two globally after India where highest number of human deaths were reported due to the human-elephant conflict, according to Daily News. COPE Committee Chairman Tissa Vitarana said that in the past 12 months, the number of elephants killed in conflict with humans in Sri Lanka was 407 as against the previous annual average of 272. The number of people killed also increased from an average of 85 humans to 122 per year in the country. COPE Committee Chairman Vitarana and other members emphasised the need for the Wildlife Department and other relevant agencies to work together on a more efficient programme to resolve the human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka, which has become a serious problem. He also said that despite 60 years of efforts to resolve the human-elephant conflict, no significant progress had been made and that a new approach was needed to find a solution. The COPA directed the Department of Wildlife Conservation to set up a National Coordinating Committee with all relevant institutions as soon as possible to reduce the human-elephant conflict. The Committee pointed out that although 4,211 km of elephant fences had been constructed by 2016 to control the human-elephant conflict, they had become inactive in a short period of time due to improper maintenance. Although Rs 86 million rupees is spent annually for the maintenance of the electric fences, the committee pointed out the need for the Wildlife Conservation Department to monitor whether this maintenance is being carried out on a daily basis, the daily said. The committee also pointed out that this maintenance should be done with the support of the people. The Committee also discussed that many constructions had to be halted due to protests by the people in some areas who thought that the construction of the fence was a boundary of their land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-records-highest-elephant-deaths-in-world/story-60fMgPggIBFNl5lKVVsVdL.html
13-12-2020||World||First trucks with Covid-19 vaccine in US get ready to roll out||The first trucks carrying a Covid-19 vaccine for widespread use in the United States were set to pull out of a Michigan manufacturing plant Sunday, with the shots that are critical to stopping the nation’s coronavirus outbreak destined to reach states a day later.Shipments of the Pfizer vaccine will set in motion the biggest vaccination effort in American history at a critical juncture of the pandemic that has killed 1.6 million and sickened 71 million worldwide.Initially, about 3 million doses were expected to be sent out, and the priority is health care workers and nursing home residents as infections, hospitalizations and deaths soar in the US. With numbers likely to get worse over the holidays, the vaccine is offering a bright spot in the fight against the pandemic that’s killed nearly 300,000 Americans.Federal officials say the first shipments of Pfizer’s vaccine will be staggered, arriving in 145 distribution centers Monday, with an additional 425 sites getting shipments Tuesday, and the remaining 66 on Wednesday. The vaccine, co-developed by German partner BioNTech, is being doled out based on each state’s adult population.Pennsylvania health care giant UPMC has chosen staff who are critical to operating its facilities as among those getting the first round of vaccinations, said Dr. Graham Snyder, who led the center’s vaccine task force.“It’s very exciting. I will be thrilled, that moment when we administer our first dose,” Snyder said Saturday. “That will clearly be a watershed moment for us.”Snyder said the UPMC system estimates that half its employees are willing to get the vaccine as soon as it’s offered to them.The vaccine is heading to hospitals and other sites that can store it at extremely low temperatures — about 94 degrees below zero. Pfizer is using containers with dry ice and GPS-enabled sensors to ensure each shipment stays colder than the weather in Antarctica.Doses should be delivered to all vaccination sites identified by states, such as local pharmacies, within three weeks, federal officials said.The 40-hospital Oschner Health System in Louisiana and Mississippi expects to receive more than 9,000 doses in the coming days, said Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, medical director of hospital quality.Employees approved for the first round are getting texts and emails directing them to schedule their initial injection, she said.“I would say there’s enthusiasm,” Kemmerly said Saturday. “There’s that thought that maybe they don’t have to be so afraid to come to work if they can be vaccinated and be immune.”The rollout will ensure there is enough vaccine to give people the two doses needed for full protection against Covid-19. That means the government is holding back 3 million doses to give those vaccinated in the first round a second shot a few weeks later.The Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of the vaccine Friday, saying it is highly protective and presents no major safety issues. While US regulators worked for months to emphasize the rigor and independence of their review, they faced political pressure until the final stages.Concerns that a shot was rushed out could undermine vaccination efforts in a country with deeply ingrained skepticism about vaccines. The head of the FDA said the agency’s decision was based on science, not politics, despite a White House threat to fire him if the vaccine wasn’t approved before Saturday.While the vaccine was determined to be safe, regulators in the UK are investigating several severe allergic reactions. The FDA’s instructions tell providers not give it to those with a known history of severe allergic reactions to any of its ingredients.Another vaccine by Moderna will be reviewed by an expert panel this week and soon afterward could be allowed for public use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-trucks-with-covid-19-vaccine-in-us-get-ready-to-roll-out/story-jOi3mLiXNnbz0EhdLC9I9K.html

No further details were immediately available.Faramarz also said that an Afghan government prosecutor was shot dead in eastern Kabul. The prosecutor was on his way to his office when he was attacked in Kart-e Now neighborhood, the police spokesman said.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks in Kabul. The Islamic Sate group has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks on the capital in recent months, including horrific attacks on educational institutions that killed as many as 50 people, most of them students.The Sunday attacks happened as a day earlier the IS militants hit the capital with a barrage of mortar shells, killing at least one civilian and wounding a second, amid a countrywide spike in violence.The extremist group claimed responsibility on its affiliated Amaq News site, saying it fired 10 Katyusha rockets toward the capital’s Hamid Karzai International Airport.Three shells hit the airport, while the other rounds landed in residential areas of the city, according to the Afghan Interior Ministry.Violence in Afghanistan has spiked in recent months even as the Taliban and Afghan government negotiators meet in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar to hammer out a peace deal that could put an end to decades of war.The Taliban have waged bitter battles against IS fighters, particularly in IS strongholds in eastern Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-2-killed-in-magnetic-ied-blast-in-kabul/story-QxwIKoI2pEcwVBk6jvfYDN.html
13-12-2020||World||Pakistan opposition gears up for its sixth anti-government power show in Lahore||Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), the country’s 11-party opposition alliance, is all geared up for holding its much-hyped power show at Minar-e-Pakistan, Lahore on Sunday, the last demonstration in the first phase of its anti-government rallies.The PDM is expected to announce the ‘decisive phase’ of its struggle against Prime Minister Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government in the public gathering, reported Dawn.Ahead of the alliance’s Lahore rally, Pakistan’s federal government had adopted desperate measures to block the rally proceedings.Last week, PM Imran Khan ruled out the possibility of the government granting permission to the PDM for holding the anti-government rallies, warning that legal cases will be lodged against organisers.“We will file FIRs against everyone -- from the kursi wala to the sound system handlers but won’t stop them [Opposition leaders] from going there,” he said in an interview, Geo News reported.The Prime Minister also blamed the opposition of spreading Covid-19 in the country.Several political workers were booked and arrested ahead of the rally, while the PTI government flooded the Minar-e-Pakistan lawns in a ‘failed effort’ to stop the upcoming rally.The arrests were condemned by Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President Latif Afridi and former president Syed Qalbe Hassan on Saturday and called for the immediate release of all PDM workers.Speaking on the release of water at the venue, Dawn quoted Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Vice-President Maryam Nawaz as saying in a tweet: “This action reflects the fear of Taabedar Khan (obedient Khan) that his government is being sent packing. The Lahore rally will be held and the government be sent home too.”This is the first time in the recent history of the country that the PML-N is going to hold a public meeting at Minar-e-Pakistan, the first rally at this venue for the de-facto president of PML-N, Maryam Nawaz, Dawn reported.It will also be the first appearance of PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari at a political gathering in Lahore, who claimed that his party was fighting for democracy in Pakistan.“We will restore real democracy in Pakistan. We want the people to decide about the economic policy and other policies of the country. We want people to decide their future themselves. We will install a people’s government after dislodging this puppet and selected government. We will form a government which will fulfill the promises of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,” Dawn quoted the PPP chairman.“No matter what the imposed regime of selected PM Khan does, Sunday’s public meeting will take place come what may,” said PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb.On Saturday, PML-N workers had reached Minar-e-Pakistan, broke the locks of its main gate and placed chairs and installed lights at its ground. Some PML-N leaders also visited the venue and oversaw the preparations.Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar asked the PDM to delay the Lahore rally in light of “terror threat alerts” and the persisting Covid-19 situation.The alliance has also reportedly planned a long march in February if the PTI government does not pay heed to the pressure exerted by the Opposition. However, there seems to be no consensus regarding the resignations from national and provincial assemblies, as Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) is reluctant to leave the Sindh government, according to Dawn.A senior Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader said that the next phase of PDM’s struggle would begin in January where the PDM has planned 16 more rallies.The PDM has held five rallies in Multan, Peshawar, Gujranwala, Karachi and Quetta since October 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-gears-up-for-its-sixth-anti-government-power-show-in-lahore/story-i68UdagK40KWjScRjv24dJ.html
13-12-2020||World||Chinese President Xi Jinping announces more commitments to back global climate actions||Chinese President Xi Jinping has announced further commitments by China for 2030 to contribute more to tackle the global climate challenge and called to pursue a new approach by the international community to climate governance highlighting green recovery, as the world marked the 5th anniversary of the historic Paris climate agreement aimed at curbing global warming. Addressing the Climate Ambition Summit via a video link on Saturday, Xi said that China has made important contributions to adopting the landmark Paris agreement and active efforts in its implementation. The summit was co-hosted by the United Nations, the United Kingdom and France in partnership with Chile and Italy, and brought together global climate leaders -- across governments, business and civil society -- to ramp up climate ambition and help deliver on the Paris Agreement. Referring to his announcement in September that China would scale up its nationally determined contributions and adopt more vigorous policies and measures, Xi announced China’s further commitments for 2030 to tackle the global climate challenge. According to the 2030 Climate Target Plan, the European Commission has proposed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030, increasing the European Union’s ambition on reducing greenhouse gases and setting Europe on a responsible path to becoming climate neutral by 2050. Xi, in his address, said that China will lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65 per cent from the 2005 level, increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25 per cent, increase the forest stock volume by 6 billion cubic meters from the 2005 level, and bring its total installed capacity of wind and solar power to over 1.2 billion kilowatts, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The US and China are the top two polluters of the world. Chances for the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change has brightened after US President-elect Joe Biden promised to implementing the Paris deal on the first day of his presidency, reversing President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of it. The US on November 4 this year formally withdrew from the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, a decision originally announced by Donald Trump in 2017. Xi said: “We will take solid steps to implement the targets just announced, and contribute even more to tackling the global climate challenge. China always honours its commitments”. The Chinese President also called on all the parties to close ranks and make new advances in climate governance that features win-win cooperation. “Only by upholding multilateralism, unity and cooperation can we deliver shared benefits and win-win results for all nations. China welcomes all countries’ support for the Paris Agreement and their greater contribution to tackling climate change,” he said. He said that following the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, all countries need to maximise actions in light of their respective national circumstances and capabilities. Xi also stressed that developed countries need to scale up support for developing countries in financing, technology and capacity building adding that all parties to boost confidence and pursue a new approach to climate governance that highlights green recovery. He urged the international community to pursue a new approach to climate governance that highlights green recovery. Hailing the extensive international support to and participation in the implementation of the Paris Agreement since its adoption five years ago, Xi said the international landscape is evolving more rapidly, and Covid-19 is triggering deep reflections on the relationship between man and nature. The historic accord seeks to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, the value that climate scientists have determined will have disastrous consequences if exceeded. The decision by the US -- which is the second leading producer of all carbon dioxide emissions globally after China -- to quit the agreement has led to condemnation from environmentalists and expressions of regret from world leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-president-xi-jinping-announces-more-commitments-to-back-global-climate-actions/story-w3VViq0yAoWQf7mh3NX7gK.html

13-12-2020||World||Lofty climate goals get reality check at global summit||Five years after the world signed the landmark Paris Agreement to avoid dangerous global warming, political momentum is building. But the lack of near-term detail means the planet is still on track for climate catastrophe.The six-hour Climate Ambition Summit on Saturday threw the problem into sharp relief: activists were eager for China to put some meat on the bones of its bold 2060 carbon neutrality pledge. They were disappointed. One country after another failed to raise the bar, as leaders offered only incremental steps.“As encouraging as all this ambition is, it is not enough,” said Alok Sharma, UK Business Secretary who is also president of the next round of global climate talks in Glasgow next year, known as COP26.The underwhelming summit puts more pressure on President-elect Joe Biden, who is expected to assert US leadership on climate change when he takes office -- starting with rejoining the Paris deal. As political and corporate leaders jostle to prove how progressive they are on the issue, the challenge is getting them to make specific, short-term commitments that back up their impressive sounding long-term goals.Countries’ level of ambition should increase between three- and five-fold to deliver on the Paris pledge to try and limit warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, according to the United Nations Emissions Gap Report.“We know we’re in a race -- be that a sprint or a marathon -- and what’s critical is momentum,” said Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, and a former UN climate envoy. “We are not moving fast enough, but we are moving.”While greenhouse gas emissions will fall a record 7% this year as the pandemic hit economic activity, the dip will only result in a 0.01 degree Celsius reduction of global warming by 2050, the UN said.Biden wants to convene a summit within his first 100 days in office to convince some of the world’s biggest emitters to step up, and set a net-zero target for the U.S. for 2050. His plans mean that 70% of the world economy will have made commitments to be carbon neutral by 2050 or 2060. In the private sector, companies from asset managers to oil majors have set long-term targets to eliminate carbon emissions.The European Union and UK went into the summit with new emissions pledges in hand -- in the EU’s case after a diplomatic tussle. Some of the more ambitious pledges by 75 the nations and companies on Saturday included:The biggest challenge for Biden and the COP26 hosts ahead of the Glasgow summit will be convincing world leaders who champion fossil fuels to make a u-turn. The leaders of Brazil, Russia, and Australia were not invited to speak on Saturday after the UK and their co-hosts France decided they hadn’t come forward with bold enough pledges.Until Friday, Brazil’s government had been preparing for President Jair Bolsonaro to speak and did not expect his name to be left off the agenda, two people familiar with the matter said. Their surprise underscores how wide an expectation gap still remains between climate-aligned countries and laggards who have so far been able to avoid too much scrutiny on the international stage.Brazil’s environment ministry said this week it set a new goal to zero out carbon dioxide emissions by 2060 or sooner -- if it can raise $10 billion a year from other countries.Even after new pledges, rich countries risk failing to meet a target set five years ago to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 to help poor nations deal with the worst impacts of climate change. And at home, funds aren’t being deployed as well as they could be, according to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.“So far, the members of the G-20 are spending 50% in their stimulus and rescue packages on sectors linked to fossil fuel production and consumption, than on low-carbon energy,” he said. “This is unacceptable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lofty-climate-goals-get-reality-check-at-global-summit/story-g5DaRVOIcd0NDaro0txgzH.html
13-12-2020||World||UPS, FedEx collaborate to ship Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines in US||Rival US companies UPS and FedEx are working side-by-side to ship the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, after it was approved for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday.The two shipping companies said that they had put plans, which they had been working for months, into action after the coronavirus vaccine received emergency use authorisation, reported The New York Times.During a news conference on Saturday, General Gustave F Perna, the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to bring a market, said that the boxes were being packed at Pfizer’s plant in Michigan, and would be shipped to UPS and FedEx distribution hubs, where they would be dispersed to 636 locations around the country.Perna specified that 145 sites would receive the vaccine on Monday, 425 on Tuesday and 66 on Wednesday.UPS said that the company expects to start transporting the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Sunday morning when employees stationed at Pfizer’s facility in Michigan will affix special Bluetooth- and radio-enabled tracking tags to each shipment, reported The New York Times.“This is the moment we’ve been waiting for... We’ve been planning for months with daily calls, drilling down to really quite minute details,” said Wes Wheeler, president of the company’s health care division, in an interview on Saturday.“You have two fierce rivals here, and competitors, in FedEx and UPS, who literally are teaming up to get this delivered,” said Richard Smith, a FedEx executive, to the Senate’s Subcommittee on Transportation and Safety on Thursday.Both companies said the shipments would be closely tracked and monitored, and would be given priority over other packages. To ship its vaccine, Pfizer designed specialized containers packed with enough dry ice to keep a minimum of 975 doses cool for up to 10 days. Each comes with a tracking device, according to The New York Times.This comes after the FDA authorized Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on Friday for the prevention of coronavirus disease in individuals 16 years of age and older.“The FDA’s authorization for emergency use of the first Covid-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, MD.The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine was first approved in the United Kingdom, then in countries Canada, United States, and Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ups-fedex-collaborate-to-ship-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines-in-us/story-dPkJr3w9UhOYqbuMF764SK.html
13-12-2020||World||Tempers flare as Trump supporters rally in Washington||Thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump returned to Washington for weekend rallies to back his desperate efforts to subvert the election that he lost to Joe Biden.Sporadic fights broke out between pro-Trump and anti-Trump demonstrators after sundown Saturday. WRC-TV reported that four people were taken to a hospital with stab wounds, and the Metropolitan Police Department told the station that 23 people were arrested.The gatherings of mostly unmasked Trump loyalists were intended as a show of force just two days before the Electoral College meets to formally elect Biden as the 46th president. Trump, whose term will end January 20, refuses to concede, while clinging to baseless claims of fraud that have been rejected by state and federal courts, and Friday by the Supreme Court.Trump tweeted his apparent surprise Saturday morning at the rallies, publicly known for weeks: “Wow! Thousands of people forming in Washington (D.C.) for Stop the Steal. Didn’t know about this, but I’ll be seeing them! #MAGA”Trump left the White House around midday for the trip to the Army-Navy football game at the US Military Academy in West Point, New York. As the Marine One helicopter passed over a rally on the National Mall, cheers went up.Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser recently pardoned by Trump, was speaking from the stage at the time.“That’s pretty cool. Imagine just being able to jump in a helicopter and just go for a joy ride around Washington,” said Flynn, whose pardon wiped away his conviction for lying to the FBI during the Russia investigation.At a pro-Trump demonstration in Washington a month ago, Trump thrilled supporters when he passed by in his motorcade en route to his Virginia golf club.That demonstration, which drew 10,000 to 15,000 people to the capital, ended late in the evening with scattered clashes between Trump’s loyalists and local activists near Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House.On Saturday, police took more steps to keep the two sides apart, closing a wide swath of downtown to traffic and sealing off Black Lives Matter Plaza.But while Saturday’s rallies, including one on Freedom Plaza downtown, were smaller than on Nov. 14, they drew a larger contingent of the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist group known to incite street violence. Some wore bulletproof vests as they marched through town.The group saw its profile raised after Trump in September famously told them to “stand back and stand by.”After the rallies ended, downtown Washington quickly devolved into crowds of hundreds of Proud Boys and combined forces of Antifa and local Black activists — both sides seeking a confrontation in an area flooded with police officers. As dusk fell, they faced off on opposite sides of a street, with multiple lines of city police and federal Park Police, some in riot gear, keeping them separated.One Proud Boy yelled out, “You cops can’t be everywhere!” The Proud Boys later dispersed.Antifa activists also were more organized this time, with their own bicycle corps to form bike walls to match those of the police.Earlier in the day, a group of about 50 men in the Proud Boys’ black and yellow circled the perimeter of Black Lives Matter Plaza, where about 200 anti-Trump demonstrators were rallying.They chanted vulgar slogans and at one point started singing “Jingle Bells.” They were apparently under orders not to engage with hecklers. One man who was talking back to people was yelled at and told “Don’t interact!”The assembly on the National Mall, called the “Jericho March,” was described on its website as a “prayer rally” with speakers “praying for the walls of corruption and election fraud to fall down.”The rally on Freedom Plaza also featured a series of speakers pushing debunked claims of election fraud to a receptive audience.Sylvia Huff, a demonstrator who came from Gloucester, Virginia, to show her support for Trump, said the legal defeats hadn’t shaken her belief that he won the election.“I believe the courts were on the take, too,” she said. The Supreme Court, where three of the nine justices were appointed by Trump, “was just afraid of a political backlash,” she said.Among the speakers was Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump adviser, who urged demonstrators not to give up even after Friday’s Supreme Court decision. He said he wanted to send Trump a video and held up his phone, cueing the flag-waving crowd to chant “Stop the Steal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tempers-flare-as-trump-supporters-rally-in-washington/story-47kdnwiE2xxlomkqKBgaqI.html

A message seeking comment was left at a number listed for Casillo. Online records did not list a lawyer who could speak on her behalf.Bystander video showed a black BMW sedan suddenly accelerating as protesters gathered around the vehicle around 4 p.m. Friday near 39th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan. One person appeared to be leaning over the front of the car.Tom Ella, who shot the video, said he heard the engine roar and saw the car accelerating.“Just watching them actually hit people, it’s traumatizing, it’s horrifying,” Ella said.Protester Sofia Vickerman, of Denver, Colorado, said people and a bicycle were tossed in the air.Six people were taken by ambulance to hospitals with injuries that officials said did not appear to be life-threatening.Casillo, of Rockaway Park, Queens, remained at the scene. She was taken into custody and questioned, police said.Another woman, whom police described as a protester, was arrested for interfering with ambulance workers at the scene, police said.Nicolle Besuden, 32, of Manhattan, was charged with disorderly conduct and obstruction of governmental administration.Besuden was also released with a notice to appear in court at a later date.She called the allegations “false and incredibly damaging” and referred to an account of the incident from the injured protester she was helping, who said Besuden was providing care and comfort before EMTs arrived and that her arrest was uncalled for.The protest march started in Times Square and was aimed at drawing attention to an ongoing hunger strike by immigration detainees at a jail in New Jersey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-plows-into-manhattan-protesters-driver-arrested/story-VBbRgFRdJDJN7Eb3ChaXBJ.html
13-12-2020||World||Huawei’s role in developing surveillance products including ‘Uyghur alarm’, sparks international outcry||The revelation this week of Huawei’s role in testing artificial intelligence surveillance technology, which includes a face-scanning camera system that can send an “Uyghur alarm” to police after detecting a member of the group, has sparked an international outcry against one of China’s most valuable tech companies.Washington Post reported that despite the company’s claims that it is committed to human rights at the highest level, Huawei has worked with dozens of security contractors to develop surveillance products, some of which are said to be able to identify a person’s ethnicity and help suppress potential protests, according to company marketing documents.The international backlash included a French soccer star, Antoine Griezmann, who publicly ended his work as a Huawei brand ambassador and urged the company to ‘condemn this mass repression’.Meanwhile, Huawei representatives refuted the allegations, saying that the document outlining the “Uyghur alarm”, used language that is “completely unacceptable”.“It is not compatible with the values of Huawei... Our technologies are not designed to identify ethnic groups,” said a representative.However, products made by Huawei with four other partner companies were also advertised to have ethnicity-tracking capabilities, according to Chinese language marketing materials posted on a public Huawei website where the material could be downloaded by anyone who registered an account. After Washington Post approached Huawei for comment, the site briefly became inaccessible, and the number of product collaborations detailed on the site had dropped from over 2,000 to 38, after returning.“We take the allegations in the Washington Post’s article very seriously and are investigating the issues raised within,” a Huawei spokesperson said in a statement to The Post.Huawei and its partners have provided some of the surveillance products to authorities in China’s Xinjiang region, where the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have detained thousands of Uyghur Muslims, in an attempt to control and assimilate the ethnic minority group through a mass ‘re-education’ campaign.Among the surveillance products was a facial recognition system used by police in the Xinjiang capital, Urumqi, and a highway surveillance camera system for the region, according to documents from Huawei’s website.The company’s partnerships reflect the ongoing expansion of surveillance in China, where top officials have called for police to use big data to fight crime, under the slogan, “One Person, One File,” a phrase signifying the use of disparate information streams, from surveillance footage to Internet chat history, to better track individuals, reported Washington Post.Jerome Cohen, a veteran China human rights legal expert, said racial profiling and discrimination are prevalent in China. The country’s government is “engaging in racial profiling on a massive scale,” he said.Marketing materials for products co-developed by Huawei with DeepGlint, Bresee and Maiyuesoft also mention ethnicity identification or search features. The three companies did not respond to requests for comment.Classified documents known as the China Cables, accessed last year by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, threw light on how the Chinese government uses technology to control Uyghur Muslims worldwide.However, China regularly denies such mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training, while people in the internment camps have described being subjected to forced political indoctrination, torture, beatings, and denial of food and medicine, and say they have been prohibited from practising their religion or speaking their language.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-s-role-in-developing-surveillance-products-including-uyghur-alarm-sparks-international-outcry/story-ED2947LjmwUXsZgkmzXKPL.html
13-12-2020||World||Donald Trump loses Wisconsin case while arguing another one||President Donald Trump lost a federal lawsuit Saturday while his attorney was arguing his case before a skeptical Wisconsin Supreme Court in another lawsuit that liberal justices said “smacks of racism” and would disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters only in the state’s most diverse counties.US District Judge Brett Ludwig dismissed Trump’s federal lawsuit asking the court to order the Republican-controlled Legislature to name Trump the winner over Democrat Joe Biden.The judge said Trump’s arguments “fail as a matter of law and fact.”The ruling came as Trump’s attorney in a state case faced a barrage of questions about his claims from both liberal and conservative justices on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.Trump is trying to overturn his loss to Biden in the state by disqualifying more than 221,000 votes in Wisconsin’s two most heavily Democratic counties. Trump is not challenging any votes in counties he won.“This lawsuit, Mr. Troupis, smacks of racism,” Justice Jill Karofsky said to Trump’s attorney Jim Troupis early in his arguments. “I do not know how you can come before this court and possibly ask for a remedy that is unheard of in U.S. history. ... It is not normal.”Justice Rebecca Dallet, like Karofsky another liberal justice, questioned why Trump didn’t raise his same concerns about the absentee ballot process in the 2016 election that he won in Wisconsin. Troupis said Trump was not an aggrieved party that year.Conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley questioned how the court could reject more than 28,000 ballots of people who said they were indefinitely confined given that it would include people who properly claimed that status.Wisconsin’s highest court agreed to take the case at Trump’s urgent request Friday, soon after a state judge ruled against him and with Monday’s Electoral College vote bearing down and the state’s 10 electoral votes about to go to Biden.The court is controlled 4-3 by conservatives, but its willingness to take the case isn’t necessarily an indicator of how it will rule. The court previously refused to hear the case before it went through lower courts, and a majority of justices have openly questioned whether the remedy Trump seeks is appropriate.Trump sought to have more than 221,000 ballots disqualified in Dane and Milwaukee counties. He wanted to disqualify absentee ballots cast early and in-person, saying there wasn’t a proper written request made for the ballots; absentee ballots cast by people who claimed “indefinitely confined” status; absentee ballots collected by poll workers at Madison parks; and absentee ballots where clerks filled in missing information on ballot envelopes.The circuit judge on Friday ruled that none of Trump’s arguments had merit and that state law was followed during the election and subsequent recount.Biden won Wisconsin by about 20,600 votes, a margin of 0.6% that withstood a Trump-requested recount in Milwaukee and Dane counties.Trump and his allies have suffered dozens of defeats in Wisconsin and across the country in lawsuits that rely on unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud and election abuse. On Friday evening, the US Supreme Court rejected a Texas lawsuit that sought to invalidate Biden’s win by throwing out millions of votes in four battleground states, including Wisconsin.Also Saturday, former Trump campaign attorney Sidney Powell asked the US Supreme Court to hear a federal case she lost in Wisconsin seeking to order the GOP-controlled Legislature to declare Trump the winner. Powell has also lost similar cases in Georgia and Arizona.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-loses-wisconsin-case-while-arguing-another-one/story-Ntv1nz1WK6Q4ozeh6Z34UK.html
13-12-2020||World||Khalistanis target Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in Washington||Khalistani separatists draped their flag around the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in front of the Indian Embassy in Washington on Saturday to show their support for the farmers protesting against the farm laws in India.“Farmers and Khalistan supporters have the same agenda and that is independence of Punjab from Indian occupation,” said Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, general counsel to Sikhs For Justice. Pannun was designated a terrorist by India in July.There have been reports that Khalistanis have tried to inject their separatist agenda into the farmers’ protests to further their own cause, and not to help the protesters. Earlier this month, Congress MP from Ludhiana Ravneet Singh Bittu raised alarm over “Khalistani elements (who) have penetrated the ongoing protests”.Farmers are protesting new laws that seek to reform the farm sector and allow large corporation to bypass government-regulated procurement markets. They fear these reforms could take away the minimum support price (MSP) guaranteed to them by the government on their yields.The Indian embassy issued a statement in this regard. “Strongly condemns this mischievous act by hooligans masquerading as protesters against the universally respected icon of peace and justice,” the statement read.The statement added that the embassy had also lodged a “strong protest” with US law enforcement agencies and taken it up with the State Department and has sought an “early investigation and action against the culprits under the applicable law”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/khalistanis-target-gandhi-statue-in-washington-dc/story-zmuDrN3HQfZqNvCveHZ7kL.html
13-12-2020||World||Brazil govt releases Covid-19 pandemic vaccination plan with holes||Brazil’s government has presented a Supreme Court justice with a coronavirus immunization plan that provides initially for only enough shots for about a quarter of the population and does not indicate a start date.The document, which was made public Saturday, was submitted by President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration the previous night to judge Ricardo Lewandoswki, who had ordered the report after an opposition political party filed a lawsuit seeking information on the government’s immunization plans for the pandemic.The plan calls for the government to provide immunization shots for priority groups that amount to about 51 million people, just under 25% of Brazil’s 212 million people. The first of four phases for vaccinating those groups include health workers, people older than 80 and Indigenous peoples.Signed by the health minister Eduardo Pazuello, the document says, however, that “the interruption of the circulation of Covid-19 in the national territory depends on a highly effective vaccine” being administered to more than 70% of the population.No date is given for starting to give out immunization shots. Brazil’s health regulator, Anvisa, has not yet approved the use of any coronavirus vaccine in the country.In addition, the plan says that to avoid the collapse of Brazil’s health services, it may be necessary to “maintain social distancing measures for 1 to 2 years” — the type of pandemic restriction that often criticized by Bolsonaro, who argues that economic damage from lockdowns and other pandemic strictures will cause more harm to the country than the illnesses and deaths from the virus.Bolsonaro, who recovered from Covid-19 earlier this year and has said he will not make immunization mandatory, has been the target of criticism from several Brazilian state governors and health experts over what they consider delay by the federal government in organizing an immunization plan.Brazil has registered more than 180,000 deaths from Covid-19, the second highest number in the world. In recent weeks it has seen an acceleration in the rate of coronavirus infections and several states report occupancy of hospitals’ intensive care beds above 80%.Bolsonaro, meanwhile, said Thursday at an official ceremony that Brazil is experiencing “the end of the pandemic.”Accusing the government of foot-dragging, Sao Paulo Gov. Joao Doria already unveiled an immunization plan of his own for his state that has a goal of beginning vaccinations on Jan. 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-govt-releases-covid-19-pandemic-vaccination-plan-with-holes/story-76USrxxrpvMLDB6YppNqDP.html
13-12-2020||World||Israelis maintain anti-Netanyahu protests in wintry weather||A few thousand Israelis protested against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, demanding that he resign in the face of corruption charges and the pandemic. Some 2,000 people demonstrated outside Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem. The size of the crowds has shrunk in recent weeks with the arrival of wintry weather. Protesters held signs reading “Go” and “Everyone is equal under the law.” They also carried an inflatable submarine, alluding to a USD 2 billion purchase of German submarines that critics allege Netanyahu was implicated in. The protesters say Netanyahu must resign because of the corruption charges against him, saying he has lost the public’s trust and can’t properly manage the country under charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing on all charges, which revolve around a series of scandals involving media moguls and billionaire associates. His trial is set to begin evidentiary hearings early next year. The protests have been a nuisance for Netanyahu, who has seen his popularity plummet during the coronavirus outbreak, with Israel on the verge of what may be a third national lockdown with cases again trending upward. With Israel appearing to be headed toward its fourth national election in two years, the long-serving Netanyahu may be banking on recently arrived vaccines to give him a boost in the polls. Opinion polls show that if the election were held today his Likud Party would emerge as the largest in parliament. But it would be weaker than today and challenged by a new party set to enter the fray that is led by a former Likud lawmaker calling for Netanyahu’s rule to end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelis-maintain-anti-netanyahu-protests-in-wintry-weather/story-XsGutPq18M787HE6d6MyzL.html

But following the latest development, they would set aside the application and reformulate it for another occasion by the end of the year.The 17-page filing, obtained by the Post, was submitted to West Kowloon Court where Lai was charged with one count of colluding with foreign powers, an offence under the national security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in June.According to prosecutors, Lai called for overseas countries to “voice out and take action” over Beijing’s suppression in a tweet tagging United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, even after the national security law came into force. In another tweet, he urged the US to “be lenient” towards young Hongkongers seeking asylum in the country.US Defence Secretary Michael Pompeo slammed China for charging Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai under the draconian National Security Law and demanded that charges must be dropped.Pompeo further went on to accuse the Chinese Communist Party of its authoritarian rule and making a mockery of the justice in the region.“Hong Kong’s National Security Law makes a mockery of justice. @JimmyLaiApple’s only “crime” is speaking the truth about the Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarianism and fear of freedom. Charges should be dropped and he should be released immediately,’ Pompeo tweeted.In August 2020, the tycoon was arrested under the new National Security Law.The charge stems from comments Lai purportedly made on Twitter and in interviews asking foreign countries to sanction the city.This comes after a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers were arrested in the month of October over protests after the draconian National Security Law was imposed on the city by Beijing.The law criminalizes secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces and carries with it strict prison terms. It came into effect from July 1.Several of those disqualified were sitting lawmakers, who were subsequently ejected from the parliament by Beijing overruling constitutional precedent and bypassing Hong Kong’s courts on November 11, sparking the mass resignation of the entire pro-democratic camp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-denied-bail-after-being-charged-with-national-security-law/story-ZDnFTJWREmGYeR6SJzxadI.html

Post the desecration, an expert was called in to refurbish the Gandhi statue.The statue was vandalised with graffiti and spray painting, prompting the Indian mission to register a complaint with the local law enforcement agencies. The desecrated statue of Gandhi, the design of which was created by Gautam Pal, was later covered and the site has been cleaned up.The Indian Embassy in the US had then registered cases with the Metropolitan Police and the National Park police. The matter was reported immediately to the State Department and Deputy Secretary of State had called the Indian ambassador to address the issue. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun had apologised for the incident.

German Malaga, chief researcher at the local Cayetano Heredia University, which is involved with the study, said one volunteer had experienced decreased strength in his legs among other symptoms.Meanwhile, China has put one northern city in lockdown and launched citywide coronavirus testing in another, after two local infections involving workers at a port and trade zone respectively, authorities have said. There was one new case each in Dongning and Suifenhe, which both sit on the country’s border with Russia. Officials there said on Saturday it would enter “wartime mode” - temporarily suspending public bus services and road transport, while requiring anyone leaving the city to produce a negative Covid-19 test from the preceding 24 hours.Japan saw more than 3,000 new infections of the novel coronavirus for the first time in one day on Saturday, public broadcaster NHK reported, while South Korea has reported another 950 cases, its largest daily increase since the emergence of the pandemic, as fears grow about overwhelmed hospitals in the greater capital area.President Moon Jae-in in a Facebook message apologised for his government’s failure to contain the outbreak despite months of measures that hurt the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-vaccine-test-halted-due-to-serious-event/story-ElHVYdlZtywuEfzOYoOxkK.html
13-12-2020||World||More than 100 arrested at Paris protest over security bill||Paris police took more than 100 people into custody at what quickly became a tense and sometimes ill-tempered protest Saturday against proposed security laws, with officers wading into the crowds of several thousand to haul away suspected trouble-makers.Police targeted protesters they suspected might coalesce together into violent groups like those who vandalized stores and vehicles and attacked officers at previous demonstrations.Paris police reported at least 107 arrests. Long lines of riot officers and police vehicles with blue lights flashing escorted Saturday’s march through rain-slickened streets in Paris. They hemmed in protesters, seeking to prevent the flare-up of violence that marked many previous demonstrations.A police water cannon doused demonstrators at the end of the march, as night fell.Marchers were protesting against a proposed security law that has sparked successive weekends of demonstrations and against a draft law aimed at combating Islamist radicalism.The security bill’s most contested measure could make it more difficult to film police officers. It aims to outlaw the publication of images with intent to cause harm to police. Critics fear it could erode media freedom and make it more difficult to expose police brutality. The provision caused such an uproar that the government has decided to rewrite it.Slogans on placards carried by marchers in Paris said “I will never stop filming” and “Camera equals mutilation?”There were also protests in other cities. In Lyon, in the southeast, authorities reported five arrests among people they said attacked police and sought to loot shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-100-arrested-at-paris-protest-over-security-bill/story-OaXXbzbeJa0JCnPdJStKSM.html
13-12-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine D-Day arrives with 2.9 million doses set for delivery in US||The first Covid-19 vaccine arrived in record time, an essential initial step toward ending the pandemic. Now comes the hard part: producing enough shots to immunize the majority of the US population and then getting them into everyone’s arms by next summer.If successful, the plan could help end a pandemic that’s killed almost 300,000 Americans in the 47 weeks since the first case was recorded. On Saturday, Gustave Perna, the army general who serves as chief operating officer for Operation Warp Speed, said the first doses of the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine will be delivered on Monday, and that all of the initial delivery is expected to be completed in all 50 states by Wednesday.It’s an enormous undertaking that’s already been marked by confusion and uncertainty. As late as Friday, some states were saying they weren’t sure how many doses they’ll get. There have also been questions about whether the U.S. has ordered enough shots to meet its ambitious distribution schedule moving into 2021.“We are not taking a victory lap,” Perna said in a news briefing Saturday. “We know that the road ahead of us will be tough. We know that situations will occur, but we will figure it out together, collectively, a whole-of-America approach to solve the problems.”Perna, dressed in battle fatigues and speaking alone without any preamble from political appointees, compared the moment to D-Day, the Allied invasion of France that marked the turning point in Europe in World War II. “D-Day was the beginning of the end,” he said. “And that’s where we are today.”The Pfizer shot -- and a similar vaccine from Moderna Inc. that’s just a week away from a decision on emergency authorization -- will be in short supply initially.Only 2.9 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine will be delivered in the first shipment, a fraction of what’s needed to vaccinate health-care workers and nursing home residents, who are atop the priority list. Another 2.9 million are being held back to ensure that the second dose will be available for people who get the first round. Additionally, half a million are being held as an emergency reserve.The government is holding up the second dose “just until we have ultimate confidence, and we’ve built up stocks to ensure that we can get the American people a second dose,” Perna said, adding that he expects that both doses could start to be sent out together in mid-January or February.“Make no mistake,” Perna added, “distribution has begun,” with 40 million doses available by the end of the month if Moderna’s vaccine is authorized alongside Pfizer’s. “Right now, boxes are being packed and loaded with vaccine,” he said, with the shots set to start rolling out from manufacturing to distribution hubs on Sunday.Pfizer’s vaccines will be delivered directly to individual facilities identified by the states, Perna said, with 145 sites set to receive the Pfizer vaccine on Monday, 425 on Tuesday and the final 66 sites on Wednesday. He said all states now know how much vaccine they will get.The vaccines weren’t prepositioned, he added, because the operation did not want to begin moving the shots before the US Food and Drug Administration approved emergency authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech shot late Friday.‘Only Goal’Each week that follows, “we will have more doses ready for allocation and distribution,” Perna said. “We know that we are not done. We are not done until every American has access to the vaccine, until every American that wants it receives it. This is our only goal.”Many states plan to simultaneously deliver shots to front-line health-care workers and long-term health care facilities, he added.In Virginia, Cindy Williams, vice president and chief pharmacy officer at Riverside Health System, woke around 3 a.m. Saturday to check whether the FDA had issued Pfizer’s emergency use authorization. She went to sleep before Friday night’s announcement and started working once she saw the news.Williams read the order and the informational materials that accompanied it so she could finalize the documents Riverside plans to print Monday ahead of its test run. “It’s almost that final, final preparation,” she said.Shots on WednesdayRiverside plans to use Monday’s test to ensure it’s ready. As of now, Riverside expects to start vaccinating workers on Wednesday.The health system ordered one container filled with three trays each holding 975 doses, meaning the system of about 10,000 employees should be able to give 2,925 workers the first shot of the two-dose regimen in the coming week. The shipment will arrive at one hospital and two trays will stay there. The third will be split up into smaller quantities and shared among Riverside’s other facilities.Kits filled with supplies needed to administer the vaccine, including needles and syringes, arrived from McKesson Corp. on Thursday, Williams said.Operation Warp Speed aims to have enough doses to inoculate 20 million Americans by the end of December, 50 million by the end of January, and 100 million total by the end of March. Alex Azar, the US Health and Human Services Department chief, has said there will be enough supply for any American who wants a vaccine by the end of the third quarter of 2021.As other vaccines encountered problems, however, it has placed more pressure on the US to vaccinate larger swaths of their population with the two messenger RNA vaccines that have shown the best results -- the Pfizer vaccine and a similar one from Moderna Inc. that is likely to be cleared next week.Because mRNA has never been used in an approved product, mass scale production is just gearing up now, and it is uncertain how quickly mRNA vaccine makers can meet the demands of the world.Ongoing TrialsLarge scale US trials of two other vaccines, from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc are ongoing. But those vaccines aren’t likely to hit the US market until around February. Meanwhile, late stage trials of vaccines using more standard technology -- from both Novavax Inc. and another from Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline PLC -- have been delayed.The US already has ordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, enough for 50 million people, but the two sides have been wrangling over how quickly when the US can get more. Pfizer has indicated that it will honor commitments to many other countries.On Friday, the US government exercised an option to order 100 million additional doses of the Moderna vaccine, in addition to the 100 million doses it had previously contracted for. The additional doses will start arriving in April.Adult PopulationOperation Warp Speed has said the doses will be allocated to states according to their share of the adult population. Officials haven’t publicly detailed how many doses each state will get. Many states have published estimates of how many they expect. In most that have, the number expected in initial shipments amounts to about 1% of their adult populations.Pennsylvania’s allotment “is still fluid,” Rachel Kostelac, a spokeswoman for the state health department, said in an email late Friday afternoon. The Oregon Health Authority described a “rapidly changing situation” with several different estimates of vaccine allocations provided by the federal government in the last week.“We know we will continue to adjust our numbers as new information about shipments becomes available,” spokesman Jonathan Modie said in an email Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-d-day-arrives-with-2-9-million-doses-set-for-delivery-in-us/story-YDRBehxui0pe9jSr1ZqmoM.html
