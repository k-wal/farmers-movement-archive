But we have got a good deal to show for it. It is fair, it is a balanced deal, and it is the right and responsible thing to do for both sides,” Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference.“The negotiations were very difficult. A lot was at stake for so many people, so this was an agreement that we absolutely had to fight for,” she added.“I believe, also, that this agreement is in the United Kingdom’s interest. It will set solid foundations for a new start with a long-term friend. And it means that we can finally put Brexit behind us, and Europe is continuing to move forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-s-ursula-von-der-leyen-says-brexit-deal-fair-balanced-and-right/story-wsKKyC2zUlfdzPdn8QBIGP.html
24-12-2020||World||US lawmakers block Trump’s requested changes on Covid-19 relief bill||Republicans and Democrats in the US House of Representatives on Thursday blocked attempts to alter a $2.3 trillion coronavirus aid and government spending package, leaving its status in doubt after President Donald Trump demanded extensive changes to the legislation.Democrats sought to increase direct payments to Americans included in the bill from $600 to $2,000 per person as part of a coronavirus economic relief initiative, acting on one of Trump’s requests. Trump’s fellow Republicans, who oppose the higher amount, blocked that effort.Republicans then moved to change the amount of foreign aid included in the package, seeking to address another one of Trump’s complaints. Democrats blocked that request. The House then adjourned for the day.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the chamber will hold a recorded vote on the stimulus-check increase on Monday.The flurry of activity on the House floor did nothing to break a standoff that threatens desperately needed assistance for millions of Americans and raises the prospect of a partial government shutdown at a time when officials are trying to distribute two coronavirus vaccines.Congress could keep operations running by passing a fourth stopgap funding bill before midnight on Monday. To successfully do that, lawmakers would need Trump’s cooperation at a time when he is still consumed by his November loss to Democrat Joe Biden, who is set to take office on Jan. 20.Trump was in Florida, where he was due to play golf on Thursday. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The stopgap bill would not include coronavirus aid, however.Embittered by his defeat to Biden, Trump is pressing Congress to dramatically alter the package, which passed by wide, bipartisan margins on Monday.The 5,500-page bill took months to negotiate and was supported by Trump’s administration.With the status quo unchanged, it was unclear whether Trump would sign the package into law or hold out for further action.Without his signature, unemployment benefits for those thrown out of work by the pandemic are due to expire as soon as Saturday, and the U.S. government would be forced into a partial shutdown starting on Tuesday.The House is due to return on Monday to attempt to override Trump’s veto of an unrelated defense-policy bill which, like the coronavirus package, passed Congress by wide, bipartisan margins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-block-trump-s-requested-changes-on-covid-19-relief-bill/story-HryadkfMHVA29lZon1KvgN.html
24-12-2020||World||UK, EU reach post-Brexit trade deal to avert chaotic New Year’s split||Britain and the European Union have struck a provisional free-trade agreement that should avert New Year’s chaos for cross-border commerce and bring a measure of certainty to businesses after years of Brexit turmoil. The breakthrough came Thursday with just over a week to go until the UK’s split is completed. Now comes the race to approve and ratify the deal before the UK leaves the EU’s economic structures at the end of the year. The British and European parliaments both must hold votes on the agreement.Months of tense and often testy negotiations gradually whittled differences between the two sides down to three key issues: fair-competition rules, mechanisms for resolving future disputes and fishing rights. The rights of EU boats to trawl in British waters remained the last obstacle before it was resolved. However, key aspects of the future relationship between the 27-nation bloc and its former member remain unresolved.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had insisted the UK would “prosper mightily” even if no deal were reached and the UK had to trade with the EU on World Trade Organization terms. But his government has acknowledged that a chaotic exit was likely to bring gridlock at Britain’s ports, temporary shortages of some goods and price increases for staple foods.Britain withdrew from the EU’s political institutions on January 31, and an economic transition period expires on December 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-reach-post-brexit-trade-deal-to-avert-a-chaotic-new-year-s-split/story-lOy9XzwICRfiQTMqhWkLNI.html

The 70-year-old radical cleric has already been convicted for 21 years imprisonment in four terror financing cases of late.“On Thursday an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) of Lahore sentenced five leaders of Jamat-ud-Dawa, including its chief Hafiz Saeed, in another terror financing case...for 15 and a half years,” a court official told PTI.Now, Saeed will have to undergo collective imprisonment of over 36 years in five terror financing cases at the Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore. His punishment will run concurrently in these cases. There are reports that he is given “VIP protocol” in jail.Saeed, a UN-designated terrorist on whom the US has placed a USD 10 million bounty, was arrested on July 17 last year in the terror financing cases. He was sentenced to 11 years in jail by an anti-terrorism court in February this year in two terror financing cases.In November, Saeed was sentenced to another 10 years in jail by an anti-terrorism court in two more terror financing cases.The other four JuD leaders convicted by the court on Thursday are Hafiz Abdus Salam, Zafar Iqbal, JuD spokesperson Yahya Mujahid and Muhammad Ashraf.Each convicted person has also been fined a PKR 200,000.The ATC also handed down six-month imprisonment to Saeed’s brother-in-law Abdul Rehman Makki in this case and imposed a fine of PKR 200,000 on him, the official said.“Judge Ijaz Ahmed of ATC Court No 3 heard the case no 32/19 filed by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in which the verdict has been announced after the statements of witnesses were cross-examined by Saeed and others’ counsels -- Naseeruddin Nayyar and Mohammad Imran Fazal Gul Advocate,” the official said.He said that the JuD leaders including Saeed were brought to the court amid high security and the media was not allowed to cover the proceedings.A total of 41 cases have been registered by the CTD against the JuD leaders, out of which 28 have been decided while the rest are pending in the ATC courts. Five cases have been decided against Saeed so far.Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. He was listed under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in December 2008.The global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is instrumental in pushing Pakistan to take measures against terrorists roaming freely in Pakistan and using its territory to carry out attacks in India.The FATF had placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to COVID-19 pandemic.With Pakistan’s continuation in the ‘grey list’, the country may find it difficult to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the cash-strapped nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-sentences-jud-chief-hafiz-saeed-to-over-15-years-in-jail-in-one-more-terror-financing-case/story-FEJ3tQHzOIAS0s352ELbXP.html
24-12-2020||World||UK’s new coronavirus strain more contagious, likely to cause more deaths: Study||The mutated coronavirus strain that’s been spreading in the U.K. appears to be more contagious and will likely lead to higher levels of hospitalizations and deaths next year, a new study showed.The variant is 56% more transmissible than other strains, according to the study by the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. There’s no clear evidence that it results in more or less severe disease.The U.K. government had previously said the mutated variant appears to be as much as 70% more transmissible than other circulating strains. Additionally, it has almost two dozen mutations that may affect proteins made by the coronavirus, Patrick Vallance, the U.K.’s chief scientific adviser, said on Dec. 19.That has raised concern that tests, treatments and vaccines that just started rolling out might be less effective, though Europe’s health regulator said the variant probably isn’t different enough from earlier ones to elude Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s shot. Countries including Australia, Denmark and Singapore have also discovered the strain.Measures like England’s national lockdown in November are unlikely to reduce the reproduction number -- the new infections estimated to stem from a single case -- to less than 1 unless schools and universities are also closed, the report said. It also said vaccine rollouts may need to be accelerated to contain its spread, to a rate of 2 million people a week from the current pace of 200,000.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-new-coronavirus-strain-more-contagious-likely-to-cause-more-deaths-study/story-c2yrZVytDUXNIFfAYqM46H.html
24-12-2020||World||Covid-19: Timeline of a pandemic that disrupted lives across the world||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which is believed to have originated from a wildlife market in China’s Wuhan, turned into a pandemic within weeks as rapid virus transmission occurred across the world. The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged as a new strain in the large family of coronaviruses (CoV) which was previously not identified in humans. The epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak shifted from China to Italy as the European nation started witnessing a relatively higher mortality rate.The virus soon spiralled out in all the major European nations, including France and Germany, prompting countries around the world to announce strict lockdowns. The United States has remained the worst-hit nation in terms of the number of Covid-19 cases and related deaths. India is a distant second with over 10 million cases, followed by Brazil, Russia, and France. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, nearly 79 million Covid-19 cases and more than 1.7 million related deaths have been recorded across the globe so far. Several biotech firms have now developed their vaccine candidates to provide immunity against Covid-19, and some countries, including the US and Britain, have started their immunisation drive. Vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca have shown impressive efficacy rate. However, new variants of Covid-19, with higher transmission rate, have caused concerns for governments around the world.Also Read | New Covid-19 mutant found in South Africa: What we know so farHere’s the timeline of the coronavirus pandemic:2019 December 31 - The World Health Organisation (WHO) picked up a media report about a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause.2020January 7 - The virus outbreak was identified as a new coronavirus.January 11 - China reported its first death due to the new virus and shared its genetic sequence with the WHO.January 23 - China ordered a lockdown in Wuhan to contain the spread of the virus.January 30 - India reported its first three cases of coronavirus but didn’t cause an outbreak.February 11 - The coronavirus disease is named Covid-19 as the UN health agency avoids naming it after group, people, or geographical location.February 24 - Italy and Iran emerge as the new epicentre of the outbreak.March 3 - Official start of the Indian outbreak with one case each in Delhi and Hyderabad.March 11 - WHO declared Covid-19 as a pandemic, urging countries to take immediate and aggressive action.March 18 - The UN agency launched international randomised trials for Covid-19 treatments, termed it Solidarity Trial.March 25 - India imposed a nationwide lockdown.April 2 - Over a million cases reported worldwide with more than 51,000 related deaths.May 2 - Pfizer-BioNTech started Phase 1/2 trial to test immune response and safety.May 17 - India extended nationwide lockdown to May 31.May 19 - India overtook China in total Covid-19 cases as it crossed the sombre milestone of 100,000 cases.June 1 - Several countries eased coronavirus restrictions.June 11 - India surpassed Britain as the fourth worst affected country in terms of total Covid-19 cases.July 3 - The WHO announced that Covid-19 is airborne, advised everyone to wear a facemask.July 16 - India crossed one million cases.July 21 - The interim results of AstraZeneca’s Phase 1/2 trials of its vaccine candidate showed promise.July 27 - Moderna started Phase 3 trials.August 15 - India reported a total of over 50,000 Covid-19 related deaths.September 7 - India surpassed Brazil to become the second worst-hit nation in terms of total Covid-19 cases.September 29 - A total of over a million Covid-19 related deaths recorded.October 2 - India recorded 100,000 deaths, US President Donald Trump tested positive for Covid-19.November 16 - Moderna announced its Covid-19 vaccine candidate has 94.5% efficacy rate.November 18 - Pfizer announced 95% efficacy in the final trial results.November 23 - AstraZeneca announced its vaccine candidate can be around 90% effective.December 2 - The UK became the first country to formally approve Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.December 8 - Margaret Keenan, 90, became the first person in the world to receive a clinically approved vaccine.December 14 - The vaccine rollout started across the US after approval from the Food and Drug Administration.December 18 - India crossed 10 million Covid-19 cases.December 19 - London entered lockdown due to a new variant of Covid-19.December 22 - India joined dozens of countries to ban travel from the UK amid concerns over the new virus strain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-timeline-of-a-pandemic-which-disrupted-lives-across-the-world/story-R6bWcTh4YVS3O596p9uLaM.html

Schools and key public offices have been closed, public gatherings banned and restrictions imposed on public transport.The two clusters that emerged in October — one centered on a garment factory and other on a fish market — account for most of Sri Lanka’s outbreak. The confirmed cases from the two clusters have grown to 34,959 on Thursday.

His potential appointment raised hackles in sections of the Indian community in the UK and New Delhi.The group said in a statement, “Our understanding is (Labour leader) Keir Starmer recommended Dabinderjit to fill one of the nominations given to the Labour Party by the prime minister.“The House of Lords appointments commission carried out all the necessary checks and concluded weeks ago Dabinderjit was of good standing in the community and had no concerns on his past conduct that would call into question his appointment to the House of Lords as a Labour peer.”“Dabinderjit’s name then went to the prime minister and Buckingham Palace for formal sign-off. Formal sign-off had been obtained and the only matter outstanding was a public announcement,” it added.The statement noted that minutes before the list was released on Monday, Labour decided to delay Singh Sidhu’s announcement.“Much has been made in the Indian media of Dabinderjit’s support for the re-establishment of an independent Sikh state. This should not be a matter of concern for Labour as there are many MPs and Lords who have strong personal views in relation to Kashmir, Palestine and the establishment of other independent states,” the statement added.According to the group, Singh Sidhu was never a member of the International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), which is banned in India. The UK had banned it in 2001, but the ban was lifted in 2016. The statement added that he has not held any official position in the Sikh Federation UK that was set up in September 2003, but has been one of its volunteer advisers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/khalistan-supporter-s-nomination-to-uk-house-of-lords-delayed-says-sikh-group/story-QMKERoucjFrumV9CfGMb4H.html

Germany’s ambassador and the country’s transport minister have invited him for meetings.A lover of math and science, the student has flown as a trainee three times on a Cessna 172.He says he wants to be a pilot and an astronaut, and someday travel to Mars. “My role model is Elon Musk,” said the boy, a pilot’s white shirt and black slacks hugging his small frame.“I like Elon Musk because I want to learn with him about space, to go with him in space and also to get a handshake.”Musk founded SpaceX and the private rocket company recently launched two Americans into orbit and hopes to one day send humans to Mars.One recent morning at Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport, his instructor asked him to explain how the engines worked on a Bombardier CRJ9000 plane parked on the tarmac. His voice struggling to rise above the roar of a plane’s running engines, Shema rattled off the answer: “The inlet tubes suck in the air and inject it into the compressor, the compressor squeezes it with the fans, after squeezing it with the fans, it becomes hot,” Shema said, playfully gesturing and proceeding to detail how an engine creates thrust.Shema’s curiosity for flight was piqued by a freak incident.When he was 3 years old, a police helicopter flew so low to the ground that it blew off the roof of his grandmother’s house on the outskirts of the Ugandan capital Kampala while he was playing outside.“It triggered something in his mind,” said his mother, travel agent Shamim Mwanaisha, 29. Her son began peppering her with endless questions about how planes work, she said.Last year, she contacted a local aviation academy and Shema began lessons at home on aircraft parts and aviation vocabulary. After five months of coursework, Mwanaisha paid for practical flying lessons for her son.“I felt like a bird flying up,” Shema said of his first flight. He had never flown on a plane before.He flew three times as co-pilot between January and March before the pandemic stopped his practice.He has since been focusing on aviation theory, and immersing himself in videos about aviation and space exploration on his virtual reality viewer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-year-old-boy-who-adores-elon-musk-is-sensation-on-ugandan-aviation-scene/story-d2Uty4J6ET9vicTrZQgQlN.html
24-12-2020||World||Another new virus variant appears to emerge in Nigeria: Africa CDC||Another new variant of the coronavirus appears to have emerged in Nigeria, Africa’s top public health official said Thursday, but further investigation is needed.“It’s a separate lineage from the UK and South Africa,” the head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, told reporters. He said the Nigeria CDC and the African Center of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases in that country — Africa’s most populous — will be analyzing more samples.“Give us some time ... It’s still very early,” he said.The alert about the apparent new variant was based on two or three genetic sequences, he said, but that and South Africa’s alert late last week were enough to prompt an emergency meeting of the Africa CDC this week.The news comes as infections surge again in parts of the African continent.The new variant in South Africa is now the predominant one there, Nkengasong said, as confirmed infections in the country approach 1 million. While the variant transmits quickly and viral loads are higher, it is not yet clear whether it leads to a more severe disease, he said.“We believe this mutation will not have an effect” on the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines to the continent, he said of the South Africa variant.South Africa’s health minister late Wednesday announced an “alarming rate of spread” in that country, with more than 14,000 new cases confirmed in the past day, including more than 400 deaths. The country has more than 950,000 infections and COVID-19 is “unrelenting,” Zwelini Mkhize said in a statement.The African continent now has more than 2.5 million confirmed cases, or 3.3% of global cases. Infections across the continent have risen 10.9% over the past four weeks, Nkengasong said, including a 52% increase in Nigeria and 40% increase in South Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-new-virus-variant-appears-to-emerge-in-nigeria-africa-cdc/story-Bo8T3uDwnn1gTw9S7FhlwJ.html

According to a CNN report, US President Donald Trump’s Covid-19 vaccine czar said that the frequency of allergic reactions to Pfizer’s vaccine is greater than expected.“That frequency, as it stood yesterday (December 22), is superior to what one would expect with other vaccines,” Dr Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, was quoted as saying by the US media network.The UK regulators have already issued an advisory regarding the issue, urging people who have a history of “significant” allergic reactions to not get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued precautionary advice to the National Health Service (NHS) after two health care staff members experienced allergic reactions. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, had testified to a parliamentary committee where she acknowledged that the cases of allergic reactions didn’t feature in the extensive clinical trials.ALSO WATCH | ‘Nothing to worry about’: Joe Biden gets his first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine “We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn’t a feature. But if we need to strengthen our advice, now that we’ve had this experience in the vulnerable populations – the groups have been selected as a priority – we get that advice to the field immediately,” said Dr Raine.The United States has started the immunisation drive against the coronavirus disease after the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorisation to Pfizer-BioNTech, followed by Moderna. Under the new agreement for additional doses of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine, the US drugmaker and its German partner BioNTech will deliver at least 70 million doses by June 30, with the remaining doses to be delivered no later than July 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frequency-of-allergic-reactions-to-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-greater-than-expected-us-official/story-JehL6v5WeUyrVYPwf1sqgM.html

The footage was recorded when Baradar met wounded Taliban fighters being treated in Karachi during his visit to Pakistan last week as the head of a “political commission” for talks with the leadership in Islamabad. Video footage has also emerged of Taliban leader Mullah Fazal Akhund, a member of the group’s team for negotiations being held in Doha, meeting Taliban fighters being trained in a camp in Pakistani territory. These videos were widely shared on social media this week, including by pro-Taliban accounts. Also Read: Daniel Pearl case: Pakistan court orders immediate release of terrorist Omar Saeed SheikhDuring a meeting with Taliban fighters in Karachi, including those being treated for their injuries, Baradar, the head of the Taliban’s political office in Doha, can be heard saying that the wounded men have been sent to Pakistan because they cannot be treated in Afghanistan. Baradar also makes it clear that all of the Taliban’s decisions on the Afghan peace process are made only after consulting the group’s “shura” or leadership and the “ulema” or clerics based in Pakistan. “Though everything has passed us by, we are compelled to come (to Pakistan) because there are not a few people here, our entire leadership is present here in this place,” he is heard saying in the video, addressing a large group of men. “When we conduct partial or general negotiations (in Doha), we share the whole process with the ulema council and the shura here. We then receive their guidance and act upon it,” he added. Another video shows Baradar meeting with a senior Taliban leader from Daikundi in Afghanistan. A third video shows Mullah Fazal Akhund meeting masked men clad in fatigues at a Taliban training camp at an undisclosed location in Pakistan. The men can be seen embracing him and kissing his hand. The meetings depicted in the videos were reportedly held after the Taliban delegation led by Baradar met Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Prime Minister Imran Khan in Islamabad during a three-day visit that began on December 16. The Twitter handle of the Pakistani prime minister’s office had said that Khan, during his meeting with the Taliban delegation on December 18, had expressed concern over the “high level of violence” in Afghanistan and called on all sides for “reduction in violence leading to ceasefire”. Pakistan has for long sought to deny reports about the Taliban’s top leadership being based in Quetta and Karachi and said that it has little influence over the group. However, Indian and US officials believe Pakistan’s military establishment has close ties to the Taliban leadership and is backing the group to reduce India’s influence in Afghanistan||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-decisions-in-afghan-peace-process-made-after-consulting-taliban-leaders-in-pakistan-mullah-baradar/story-0TFeWrq9DEFkw8i2mXD4RK.html

All you need to know||Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, the mistress of Thailand King Maha Vajiralongkorn, is again in news as part of an alleged scandal where her over 1,000 sexually explicit photographs, mostly nude, were anonymously leaked to anti-monarchy activists outside the country.Though it has created a ripple now, the leak took place in August, as claimed by British journalist Andrew MacGregor Marshall who received the photos. Apart from him, the photos were sent to academic Pavin Chachavalpongpun who is living in Japan and faces criminal prosecution in Thailand for critiquing the monarchy.Marshall in November took to Facebook and said, “Thailand’s royal family is facing another embarrassing scandal following the leak of hundreds of intimate photographs of King Vajiralongkorn’s official consort Sineenat ‘Koi’ Wongvajirapakdi amid savage infighting among competing palace factions. Three months ago, in August, a letter was sent to an address where I used to live and was forwarded to me. Inside was an SD card with 1,443 photographs that had apparently been extracted from three iPhones that Koi used to own.”In the post, he added that the photos were sent to him shortly before Koi was released from Lat Yao women’s prison in Bangkok and returned to Munich to be with Vajiralongkorn on August 29, with all her royal titles and privileges back.Also Read | Thailand considers more lockdowns as seafood workers hit by virusHer return was opposed by supporters of Queen Suthida and Princess Bajrakitiyabha, he said, speculating that it is highly probable that the leak is an act of vengeance to sabotage her return to the King as her consort.Such leaks have happened multiple times in the past as per the journalist, who in his post gave examples of similar incidents. “In 2007, a video was leaked showing Vajiralongkorn’s third wife Srirasmi semi-naked at her birthday party in 2001, and many naked photographs of Srirasmi have been leaked over the years,” he wrote.“They show there is an ugly power struggle in the palace due to Vajiralongkorn’s chronically complicated sex life, and the royal civil war is likely to get progressively worse as Suthida and Koi compete for status and attention,” he said.Suthida is the Queen consort of Thailand as the fourth wife of King Vajiralongkorn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-thai-king-s-mistress-sineenat-wongvajirapakdi-is-in-news-all-you-need-to-know/story-Wbi7YEDvJKiIyYmUwNTpKO.html
24-12-2020||World||South African health minister urges review of Covid-19 restrictions||South Africa’s health minister urged a review of current restrictions and called for further measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 after a record surge in the number of infections.The virus continues to spread “exponentially,” Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said in a statement late Wednesday. “The rate of spread is much faster than the first wave and we will surpass the peak of the first wave in the coming days.”The country recorded 14,046 new cases in one day, bringing the cumulative number of cases 954,258. That’s the highest one-day jump on record, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.A further 411 coronavirus-related deaths were reported, taking the total to 25,657 since the start of the pandemic in the country, according to the statement.The government will evaluate the situation in the provinces, identify hotspots in these areas and make recommendations based on the findings of what has to be implemented, Mkhize said.Private hospital operators have warned that they are facing severe capacity constraints due to the resurgence in coronavirus cases.Virus Surge Puts South African Hospitals Under Severe StrainThe government on Dec. 18 said that the spread of a new variant of the virus, called SARS-CoV2, a lineage with multiple spike mutations, which may be driving new infections. It has spread faster than other variants, with smaller amounts of this strain needed to infect people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-african-health-minister-urges-review-of-covid-19-restrictions/story-GfQxNI2AtmPwuLAMaKS1FM.html
24-12-2020||World||Months after Beirut blast, victims await answers||Tracy and Paul Najjar believe their daughter Alexandra could have survived the August 4 explosion at Beirut port if the authorities had raised the alarm on that fateful day.As they mourn the loss of their three-year-old, one question continues to haunt them: why did no one warn residents or evacuate them as fire raged for more than half an hour close to a huge store of ammonium nitrate?“They had 40 minutes to tell us ‘Leave Beirut! Go hide! Get away from the windows!’. They didn’t do it,” said Tracy Najjar, 34, who was at home with her family in the Gemmayzeh district when the blast at the nearby port tore through Beirut.“They had 40 minutes to prepare for the post-blast. To prepare hospitals, to open the roads, to send doctors, to send the army, and they didn’t do it.”Security officials reached by Reuters declined to comment on the families’ grievances and questions over why they were not prepared and did not raise the alarm.The August 4 tragedy was one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions ever recorded. It killed some 200 people, wounded thousands and devastated swathes of the Lebanese capital.More than four months later, victims are still awaiting the result of the investigation into why 2,750 tonnes of potentially explosive material were stored unsafely at the port, which is surrounded by residential areas, for more than six years.Lebanese leaders had promised it would come within days.“Instead of grieving and trying to continue with life, we are fighting today for something that is actually our right. To find the truth. To get justice,” Najjar said.“We didn’t give up and we will not give up.”Their only child, Alexandra, died from her wounds five days after the blast. It took an hour to get her to hospital because of traffic.“If they had opened the roads, then many people would have survived, maybe Alexandra would have survived,” Najjar said.She recalled how she could not find members of the security services to assist in the immediate aftermath and how ordinary people helped each other. Her husband, Paul, eventually made it to hospital with Alexandra on the back of a stranger’s scooter.Weeks passed before the Najjars heard from a state official.The first to get in touch was an army officer who asked them to take part in a commemoration to be attended by the army commander. They declined.“For us, the president, the government, the army are all part of it and it’s a way of washing their hands,” said Paul Najjar, 36, his face scarred from the blast. Many casualties could have been avoided if the alarm had been raised, he said.For some, the explosion and the state’s handling of its aftermath are an indictment of politicians who have led Lebanon as it lurches from crisis to crisis.Several senior officials have been detained, including the port’s general manager and head of customs. The judge investigating has also charged Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab and three former ministers with negligence.Diab, whose cabinet resigned over the August blast after taking office in early 2020, said his conscience was clear and accused the judge of breaching the constitution.Security officials warned the prime minister and president in July that the ammonium nitrate stored at the port posed a security risk and could destroy the capital if it exploded, according to documents seen by Reuters and senior security sources.A high-ranking security official told Reuters in August that the fire spread due to sparks from welding.The US Federal Bureau of Investigation, which sent investigators to Beirut to help, said in October it had reached no firm conclusion about what caused the explosion.Other US and European government agencies closely following the investigations strongly believe that the blast was accidental.Families of some of the victims marked the four-month anniversary with a protest at the entrance to the port. “We want the results of the investigation and transparency before our patience runs out,” declared a banner.Since the blast, and the resignation of the government shortly afterwards, powerful politicians have failed to form a new one as they haggle over who gets what position.The familiar bickering has hampered Lebanon’s efforts to rebuild after the blast, and with longer term problems like the deepening economic crisis that has plunged millions of people into poverty.“We have no leaders, there are a mafia,” said Rita Hitti, whose firefighter son Najib was killed along with two other family members as they battled the flames that ignited the explosives at the port.“Those at the top should have resigned and gone home. They are still dividing up the pie, they still haven’t had enough.” The firefighting trio - Najib Hitti, 27, his brother-in-law Charbel Karam, 37, and cousin Charbel Hitti, 21 - always did their shifts together. In his last call home, Karam told his wife Karlin they were going to the port to put out a fire.After the explosion, the families went from hospital to hospital searching for the men, said Karlin, who must now raise their two daughters, Angelina and Catherina, alone.Karlin said: “When asked what gift does she want Santa to bring her for Christmas, Angelina replied: ‘I want Santa to bring my dad’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/months-after-beirut-blast-victims-await-answers/story-LjzhhPUQleoZHXsxaPrK5H.html
24-12-2020||World||Covid-19 UK variant: How scientists discovered the new strain||British epidemiologists found the new mutation in coronavirus when they were investigating the reason for the surge of cases in the southeast part of England despite the imposed restrictions that controlled the spread in other parts of the country. Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The public health officials who were out searching the reason for the surge initially presumed that a superspreader event or negligent behavioral patterns like disregarding social distancing norms, illegal house parties etc, had caused the rapid rise of cases in the area, as per the Wall Street Journal.It was on December 8 when the group of scientists, Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium(COG-UK) that collects, monitors and researches on the virus discovered the new variant with 23 mutations, in a test of a patient from Kent, near the centre of outbreak in late September, that consequently led to the world isolating the UK. The same variant was also found in a sample tested in London a day after, WSJ reported. These new mutations were found to have increased the communicability of the virus. While researchers have said that the virus has mutated numerous times since the inception of the spread in 2019, WSJ said the variant has caused global worries specifically because of the greater number of mutations that affected the code of the amino acid responsible for producing proteins constituting the virus.The new variant can help the virus in infecting the people more efficiently as two of the mutations affect the spike protein of the virus that makes it easy to stick to the human cell wall and enter the body.The mutation had caused global worries at a time when the vaccines are being rolled out for emergency use in many parts of the world as scientists say that the nature and number of mutations are unprecedented.The British officials in recent weeks have been clandestinely looking for patient zero. They have been through the contacts of two people identified early carrying the variant, neither of whom was sick including others infected earlier. The hypothesis around patient zero is that the variant must have born out of its weak immune system. Compromised and deficient immune system is mostly the best place for the virus to evolve with high mutations as it is able to survive in that environment for a longer period of time, WSJ reported.Also Read | New Covid-19 mutant found in South Africa: What we know so far“In an ideal situation you would know who the index case was,” Sharon Peacock, microbiologist leading the genomics team at the University of Cambridge was quoted by WSJ “We don’t know at all, if this has arisen in a patient in the UK or if it has been introduced, we categorically can’t tell at the moment.”The concerns about the new-found virus were made public on December 14 when the Health Secretary Matt Hancock informed the lawmakers that the new variant was accountable for 1000 cases in London and southeast England. Hancock had said, “Initial analysis suggests this variant is growing faster than the existing variants,” reported Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-variant-how-scientists-discovered-the-new-strain/story-wKzzMWF9vQ3IDzQZ2bHz1I.html

This does not include British and Irish Nationals, visa holders and permanent residents, who will be able to enter but are required to self-isolate for 10 days along with their household,” the statement added.According to the UK Department of Health and Social Care, the new strain of Covid-19 was first discovered at Nelson Mandela Bay in South Africa in early October, however, specialists believe that the new mutation could have started spreading as early as late August.Sputnik reported that the news comes after the UK identified over the weekend a mutated coronavirus strain that is 70 percent more transmissible than other SARS-CoV-2 virus strains.Many countries, including France, Russia and the Netherlands, have since suspended passenger travel to and from the UK in a bid to prevent the import of the new virus strain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-bans-entries-from-south-africa-after-new-covid-19-strain-different-to-uk-variant-found/story-ki65tyyaj4PfcObeqoK7hJ.html
24-12-2020||World||Facebook bans Australian celebrity chef over coronavirus misinformation||Facebook has banned Australian celebrity chef and conspiracy theorist Pete Evans for repeatedly spreading misinformation about the coronavirus. With more than a million social media followers, Evans had been an influential promoter of conspiracy theories about the pandemic and vaccines.Facebook said Thursday it would not “allow anyone to share misinformation about Covid-19 that could lead to imminent physical harm” or falsehoods about Covid-19 vaccines. “We have clear policies against this type of content and we’ve removed Chef Pete Evans’ Facebook Page for repeated violations of these policies,” the company said in a statement. The former chef’s page on Instagram -- a Facebook-owned platform -- with 278,000 followers is still active, however, and includes posts that encourage Sydney residents to defy public health officials and refuse to get tested for the virus. Australia’s largest city is currently battling to contain a cluster of more 100 cases that ended months of low community transmission. Evans said on Instagram Thursday that he was glad to be “one of the catalysts for a conversation” about freedom of speech and described the science around the pandemic as “BS”.Facebook has previously banned some high profile accounts that peddled misinformation and hate speech, most notably those of conspiracist Alex Jones and far-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos.Under fierce scrutiny and criticism that the platform is debasing public debate, Facebook has also announced a ban on accounts linked to the QAnon conspiracy group. Evans was previously known for promoting pseudoscientific dieting ideas -- often linked to his own commercial enterprises -- such as the palaeolithic diet, earning him the nickname “Paleo” Pete.Several companies recently ditched Evans and his books were pulled from the shelves after he posted a “black sun” Nazi symbol on social media.Evans denies trafficking in lies, and denounces what he calls “fear-based propaganda.”“The pandemic is a hoax. It is as simple as that” he told AFP earlier this year, without offering any credible evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-bans-australian-celebrity-chef-over-coronavirus-misinformation/story-I88iui6iDQ5LtGigdvUgtL.html

24-12-2020||World||Sinovac Covid-19 shot more than 50% effective, but data withheld||A Covid-19 vaccine developed by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech Ltd. was found to be more than 50% effective in a Brazilian clinical trial, though researchers delayed releasing more information at the request of the company.A 50% efficacy rate is a minimum standard set by US regulators for emergency authorization of Covid vaccines. Messenger RNA vaccines from Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. have produced far better results, reducing symptomatic Covid cases by well over 90% in giant trials.Chinese vaccine developers have been slow compared with their western peers in releasing efficacy data on their shots. As millions of healthy people count on transparency in trials before taking a shot, the lack of more specific results from Sinovac’s trial risks eroding confidence in Chinese vaccines. Hong Kong on Wednesday said residents will be allowed to choose which shot they want to take among several candidates that will likely include Sinovac’s.The lack of transparency in reporting the Brazil trial results “is totally unacceptable,” and wouldn’t pass muster in the US, Eric Topol, a clinical trials expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said in a phone interview. “This doesn’t have a good look to it at all.”Sinovac didn’t respond to repeated calls seeking a comment. State-backed newspaper Global Times said in response to what it called western media “hyping up questions about transparency” that the delay had nothing to do with “fake data.” It said the company will gather and analyze data from trials in other countries like Turkey and Indonesia before finalizing a complete picture.‘Cause for Celebration’The late-stage trial of Sinovac’s vaccine in Brazil, involving about 13,000 participants, suggested the shot is “safe and effective,” authorities at the Butantan Institute and from the state of Sao Paulo said. They were asked to not disseminate the information until it was thoroughly reviewed in China as part of a contractual agreement, they said.“Our goal was for the shot to be more than 50% effective,” state Health Secretary Jean Gorinchteyn said at a press conference. “A vaccine that reaches at least that is already cause for celebration.”The group that received the vaccine in Brazil’s trial had no severe cases of Covid-19, and the main side effect reported was mild pain at the injection site, said Dimas Covas, head of Butantan. Efficacy is above the threshold needed for a vaccine to be registered by Brazil health regulator known as Anvisa, which still has to approve the shot, he said.The trial produced efficacy data that differed from tests carried out in other countries, Gorinchteyn said, without elaborating. He added that Sinovac’s review of the data is slated to take 15 days but could take less than that, and shouldn’t delay the planned Jan. 25 start of inoculations with the Sinovac shot.Data Consistency“Sinovac has several ongoing trials, and it’s important it gives the data consistency,” Covas said. “The company can’t analyze data from the same vaccine using different criteria, and can’t have three different efficacy rates for the same vaccine.”It is routine for trials of a drug or vaccine conducted in different groups of patients or locations to produce slightly different results, and research groups typically report results of independent trials separately.Yet while Butantan and state authorities reiterated their optimism for the shot, Topol said the fact that Brazilian authorities would only say that the vaccine is more than 50% effective, but not provide any more detail, suggests that Sinovac efficacy results may not be as good as those achieved by Pfizer and Moderna.Saving LivesSinovac is betting on a successful vaccine to inoculate more people around the world and save lives, especially in developing countries like Brazil that will have limited access to the Pfizer and Moderna shots. Vaccines from Sinovac and other Chinese companies could also help their home country win geopolitical influence and restore an image tarnished by the criticism of its initial response to the virus.Sinovac’s shot is potentially more suited to developing countries because it can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. By contrast, the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require deep-freeze conditions for storage and transportation, making distribution more complicated.China has allowed emergency use of its frontrunner vaccines since mid-year and plans to inoculate 50 million people in frontline industries by early February, Bloomberg News has reported. A shot developed by state-owned China National Biotec Group Co., a unit of Sinopharm, protected 86% of people against Covid-19, according to a statement from the health ministry in the United Arab Emirates. Neither CNBG nor Sinopharm has commented on the UAE announcement, nor released interim efficacy data directly.China’s drug regulator will review an application by a Sinopharm unit that developed one of the company’s two inactivated vaccines, according to local Chinese news website Jiemian, citing a screen shot of the regulator’s Center for Drug Evaluation website. In Hong Kong, the government has agreed to receive 7.5 million doses of Sinovac’s vaccine.The data delay on the Sinovac shot is a blow to Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria’s plan to obtain swift approval and begin vaccinating the state of some 45 million people in January. He’s attempting to move quickly while the central government drags its feet on supply agreements and concrete vaccination dates. Millions of doses of Sinovac’s vaccine, called CoronaVac, have already been shipped to Sao Paulo.The Sinovac vaccine has been at the center of a political dispute between Doria and President Jair Bolsonaro, who says a vaccine from China can’t be trusted.In addition to Brazil’s central government, Butantan is in talks to sell the vaccine to Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador and Honduras. Chile is in talks directly with the Chinese company, according to Covas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinovac-covid-19-shot-more-than-50-effective-but-data-withheld/story-4gqgbUjuFc4JNpDYg2I7RO.html

The Sindh high court said the detention orders for Sheikh and three other accused in the case were null and void. While ordering their release, the court said their names should be put on a no-fly list so that they couldn’t leave Pakistan. “These men have been rotting in jail for 18 years without committing any crime,” the presiding judge observed. Also Read: Maryam Nawaz lashes at Pak PM, asks why he assumed office when wasn’t preparedIn April, the high court had heard the appeals of Sheikh, Fahad Naseem, Sheikh Adil and Salman Saqib 18 years after they were sentenced and acquitted Sheikh, Saqib and Naseem. It commuted Sheikh’s death sentence to seven years in prison and fined him Rs2 million. Sheikh has spent 18 years on death row and his seven-year sentence for kidnapping was counted in the time already served. However, the federal government issued a preventive detention order for a period of 90 days under which the four men continued to remain in custody. The first notification was issued the day the men were acquitted and a second three months after they completed their initial detention period. It is not clear what line of action the federal government will take now, but it has opposed the release of Sheikh and the other accused in the past. Daniel Pearl, 38, was South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal when he was abducted in Karachi in January 2002 while researching links between militants in Pakistan and Richard C Reid, known as the “shoe bomber” for trying to detonate a bomb while on a flight from Paris to Miami in 2001. Pearl was later killed by his captors in Karachi. Sheikh, a British citizen of Pakistani origin, was freed by India along with Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Masood Azhar and terrorist Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar in exchange for passengers of Indian Airlines flight IC-814, which was hijacked by a group of Pakistani terrorists from Kathmandu to Kandahar in December 1999.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-court-orders-immediate-release-of-terrorist-omar-saeed-sheikh/story-s1eD7dwtIPmGMTKvzPiFhJ.html
24-12-2020||World||UK, EU on cusp of striking Brexit trade deal at last||European Union and British negotiators worked through the night and right into Christmas Eve to put the finishing touches on a trade deal that should avert a chaotic economic break between the two sides on New Year’s Day.After resolving the remaining fair-competition and fisheries issues on Wednesday, negotiators combed through hundreds of pages of legal text that should become the provisional deal for a post-Brexit relationship after nine months of talks.Sources on both sides said the long and difficult negotiations were on the cusp of being wrapped up as negotiators, holed up at EU headquarters in Brussels with a stack of pizzas, worked to deliver the text to their leaders at dawn on Thursday.Everyone awaited early morning appearances by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to announce the deal. The agreement then goes to the 27 EU capitals seeking unanimous approval, as well as the blessing of the EU and British parliaments.Despite the breakthrough, key aspects of the future relationship between the 27-nation bloc and its former member remain uncertain. But it leaves the mutually dependent but often fractious UK-EU relationship on a much more solid footing than a disruptive no-deal split.Johnson will now claim to have delivered on the promise that won him a resounding election victory a year ago: Get Brexit Done.Even with a deal, trade between Britain and the EU will face customs checks and some other barriers on January 1, when the UK leaves the bloc’s single market and customs union. A trade deal would avert the imposition of tariffs and duties that could cost both sides billions in trade and hundreds of thousands of jobs. Britain withdrew from the EU on January 31, and an economic transition period expires on December 31.Johnson has always insisted the UK will “prosper mightily” even if no deal is reached and the UK has to trade with the EU on World Trade Organization terms from January 1.But his government has acknowledged that a chaotic exit is likely to bring gridlock at Britain’s ports, temporary shortages of some goods and price increases for staple foods. Tariffs will be applied to many UK exports, including 10% on cars and more than 40% on lamb, battering the UK economy as it struggles to rebound from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Over the past few days, Johnson and von der Leyen have been drawn more and more into the talks, speaking by phone in a bid to unblock negotiations that have dragged on for months, hampered by the coronavirus pandemic and by the two sides’ opposing views of what Brexit entails.Rumors of a pre-Christmas trade deal surfaced in recent days based on progress on the main outstanding issues: fair competition, resolution of future disputes and fishing.The EU has long feared that Britain would undercut the bloc’s social, environmental and state aid rules to be able to gain an unfair edge with its exports to the EU. Britain has said that having to meet EU rules would undercut its sovereignty.Compromise was finally reached on those “level playing field” issues, leaving the economically minor but hugely symbolic issue of fish came to be the final sticking point, Maritime EU nations are seeking to retain access to UK waters where they have long fished, and Britain insisting it must exercise control as an “independent coastal state,”A huge gap between the two sides on fishing was gradually narrowed until it appeared, at last, bridgeable.Johnson’s large majority in Parliament should ensure the agreement passes, but any compromises will be criticized by hard-line Brexit supporters in his Conservative Party. The party’s euroskeptic European Research Group said it would carefully scrutinize any deal “to ensure that its provisions genuinely protect the sovereignty of the United Kingdom after we exit the transition period at the end of this year.”The European Parliament has warned it’s now too late for it to approve the deal before January 1, but an agreement could provisionally be put in place and approved by EU legislators in January.Businesses on both sides are clamouring for a deal that would save tens of billions in costs.While both sides would suffer economically from a failure to secure a trade deal, most economists think Britain would take a greater hit, because it is smaller and more reliant on trade with the EU than the other way around.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-on-cusp-of-striking-brexit-trade-deal-at-last/story-3NvaR5tiCbrcO5Gth52BkN.html
24-12-2020||World||Anti-Myanmar hate speech flares in Thailand after virus spread||“Wherever you see Myanmar people, shoot them down,” read one Thai comment on YouTube after a surge of coronavirus cases among workers from Myanmar.The outbreak, first detected at a seafood market near Bangkok, has prompted a flare-up in such online hate speech as well as questions over the treatment of millions of migrant workers in traditionally tolerant Thailand.“Myanmar people are being labelled for transmitting Covid-19, but the virus doesn’t discriminate,” said Sompong Srakaew of the Labor Protection Network, a Thai group helping migrant workers.Shifting sentiment had real consequences, he said, with workers from Myanmar, previously known as Burma, being blocked from buses, motorcycle taxis and offices.One of the many incendiary comments on social media seen by Reuters called for infected migrant workers to remain untreated and punishment for people that brought them into Thailand.The rhetoric reflects a global pattern since the start of the pandemic of foreigners being blamed for spreading the virus.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha this week said illegal immigration was behind the outbreak in a country that had brought Covid-19 under control, although Thailand’s virus task force appealed for sympathy for immigrants.The independent Social Media Monitoring for Peace group told Reuters it found hundreds of comments classified as hate speech on YouTube with others on Facebook and Twitter.“The comments included racist language aimed at triggering discrimination and promoting nationalism,” said the group’s Saijai Liangpunsakul. “We’re concerned that online discrimination could translate into further discrimination and even lead to real-world violence.”After Reuters flagged some posts, Facebook said it had removed several for violating hate speech policies.“We know that hate speech targeted towards vulnerable communities can be the most harmful,” a Facebook spokesperson said, saying its technology detected 95% of hate speech.Facebook came under heavy criticism for the role it played in spreading hate speech that fuelled violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar in 2017 and has since invested in systems that can rapidly detect and remove such content.Twitter said it was looking into the issue. YouTube did not respond to requests for comment.Not all the social media traffic has been negative, with some Thais defending the Myanmar workers.Government spokespeople in Thailand and Myanmar did not respond immediately to requests for comment on hate speech.The outbreak was first detected last week at a shrimp market at Samut Sakhon, barely 35 km (20 miles) from central Bangkok. Since then nearly 1,300 infections linked to the market have been found while thousands of people have been quarantined.“We feel really sad that we Myanmar workers are being blamed,” said Nay Lin Thu, a 35-year-old worker from Myanmar who has now volunteered to help others.“We are told ‘this happened because of you Myanmar’. Mostly we do not respond but some of us couldn’t contain their anger.”Officially, Thailand has nearly 1.6 million workers from Myanmar, almost two-thirds of all migrant workers, but the real figure is higher because of illegal immigration. Most migrants are labourers or work in service industries.“Thai people won’t take the jobs they are doing,” Taweesin Wisanuyothin, of Thailand’s Covid-19 task force said as he pleaded for tolerance in a televised broadcast. “Today they are our family... Both Myanmar and Thai people are Buddhists.” Thailand has traditionally been seen as tolerant of foreigners, but a historic enmity has been revived on social media with references to the 18th century destruction by Burmese forces of Ayutthaya, capital of what was then known as Siam.Myanmar has suffered a much more severe outbreak of coronavirus, with over 2,500 dead from nearly 120,000 confirmed cases compared with 60 fatalities from over 5,800 cases in Thailand.How the new cases first appeared in Thailand is unclear.Similar outbreaks among migrant workers living close together in Malaysia and Singapore showed how the virus can spread undetected among healthy young people who show few symptoms. It was first detected in a 67-year-old woman.Although Thailand reported few local transmissions in recent months, Myanmar had detected cases in citizens returning form Thailand.“Our judgement is that silent carriers have been present in Thailand,” said Sein Htay of the Yangon-based Migrant Worker Rights Network. “Living conditions for Myanmar workers are difficult for social distancing with three or four to a room.”Despite the accusations against Myanmar workers of crossing the border illegally, Thais have done so too.A previous coronavirus scare flared recently when several Thai women returned home, some using illegal border crossings, after an outbreak at the nightlife spot where they worked in Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anti-myanmar-hate-speech-flares-in-thailand-after-virus-spread/story-NeQddU03sGD733yfuLyrRM.html

Think it over,” Trump said.The Iraqi military blamed the attack, which caused some minor damage, on an “outlaw group.”Top US national security officials agreed on Wednesday on a proposed range of options to present to Trump aimed at deterring any attack on US military or diplomatic personnel in Iraq, a senior administration official told Reuters without describing the content of the options or say whether they included military action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-minister-rubbishes-trump-s-accusation-of-us-embassy-attack-in-baghdad/story-NEfLzr4LjXGUaGzEprlHRJ.html
24-12-2020||World||Trump pardons more allies and Kushner’s father, sparking fresh outrage||US President Donald Trump issued new pardons Wednesday for allies including the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner and two confidants caught up in the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election that brought him to power. The pardons added to a long list he has granted in his waning days in office and sparked fresh outrage.Among those pardoned were Charles Kushner, who pleaded guilty to charges including tax evasion and witness tampering in 2004, as well as former campaign manager Paul Manafort and longtime adviser Roger Stone.The trio were among 26 people pardoned and three who had all or part of their sentences commuted by Trump on Wednesday.They come only a day after Trump pardoned another 15 people and commuted sentences for five, including corrupt Republican congressmen and security guards convicted of killing 14 civilians in a 2007 Baghdad massacre. Trump’s pardon of Manafort, who was at the heart of the investigation by special prosecutor Robert Mueller into allegations of Russian interference in the election four years ago, triggered fury that Trump was trying to erase the probe he has always described as a “witch hunt.”Democratic congressman Adam Schiff, who heads the House intelligence committee, said in a tweet that “during the Mueller investigation, Trump’s lawyer floated a pardon to Manafort. Manafort withdrew his cooperation with prosecutors, lied, was convicted and then Trump praised him for not ‘ratting.’ Trump’s pardon now completes the corrupt scheme.”Manafort himself took to Twitter, saying, “You truly did ‘Make America Great Again.’ God Bless you & your family. I wish you a Merry Christmas & many good wishes for the coming years.”David Axelrod, a political commentator and former aide to president Barack Obama, said of the move, “Everyone saw this raw sewage dump of pardons and commutations for @realDonaldTrump apparatchiks and loyalists coming ... Yet the spectacle is still appalling.”Republican Senator Ben Sasse, who has publicly spoken out against Trump, said simply, “This is rotten to the core.”Earlier in the day, Iraqis had expressed outrage and sadness after Trump delivered pardons for the four Blackwater security contractors who were convicted of murder and manslaughter six years ago for the Nisur Square massacre.The four, all former US servicemen, opened fire unprovoked on the crowded square in 2007, leaving at least 14 civilians dead -- though Iraqi authorities put the toll as high as 17 -- while wounding dozens more and deeply souring US-Iraqi relations. “I knew we’d never get justice,” Fares Saadi, the Iraqi police officer who led the investigations, told AFP.Retired US general Mark Hertling, who served in Iraq, called the Blackwater pardon “egregious and disgusting.”“This was a craven war crime that resulted in the death of 17 Iraqi civilians. Shame on you Mr President,” Hertling tweeted, using the higher death toll.Trump had also extended pardons to two more minor figures in the 2016 Russia election meddling investigation, and granted clemency to three former Republican lawmakers that watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington called “three of the most corrupt members of Congress in recent history.” All five have been vocal supporters of Trump.Trump also stunned prosecutors in Florida Tuesday when he commuted the prison sentence of Philip Esformes, a health care tycoon sentenced in 2019 to 20 years in prison for bilking the federal Medicare program of $44 million, the largest-ever Medicare fraud case. While Esformes had no evident links to Trump, he was backed by several influential former Republican attorneys general and prosecutors who have supported the president.Trump is believed to be weighing other pardons including members of his family, his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and potentially himself, to protect from potential litigation after he steps down on January 20.That could spark even greater uproar, though would likely be difficult to reverse.Trump is also being pressed by libertarian and civil rights groups to pardon three people involved in leaks of national security information -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, and another ex-NSA employee Reality Winner.Others known to have requested pardons include former US soldier Robert Bale, convicted of murdering 16 Afghan civilians in 2012, and Joseph Maldonado-Passage, better known as Joe Exotic, the star of the hit Netflix documentary “Tiger King”, convicted of trying to hire a man to murder a rival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-pardons-more-allies-and-kushner-s-father-sparking-fresh-outrage/story-T9QE4MQbZX9zhFFSHLtglO.html
24-12-2020||World||Democrats face a turnout test in Georgia’s Senate runoffs||In the first week of early voting for Georgia’s Senate runoff election, Casie Yoder parked at a polling location in Cobb County and loaded miniature hand sanitizer bottles, knitted hats, hand warmers and face masks into a collapsible wagon cart.Her goal: to help voters stay in line in frigid temperatures and cast their ballots in a pair of high-stakes runoff contests that will determine which political party controls the Senate next year. The runoffs will also test whether Democrats can again pull together the diverse coalition that propelled President-elect Joe Biden to victory in Georgia in November and cemented the state’s status as a political battleground.“We’ve never had an election happen like this in December,” said Yoder, the Georgia state captain for the Frontline, a nonpartisan electoral justice project of the Movement for Black Lives and other partner organizations.For Democrats to win control of the Senate, Georgia’s Black communities, as well as the state’s smaller Hispanic and Asian communities, likely need to vote in the January 5 runoff election by history-making margins. There is hope that the candidacy of the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the Black senior pastor of the church where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, might help spur Black votes for both him and fellow Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff over the Republican incumbents, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.An Associated Press VoteCast survey of Georgia voters in November found that 22% of white voters chose Warnock and 28% chose Ossoff, compared to the 90% of Black voters who chose Ossoff and 73% who chose Warnock. Democrats also have an opportunity to capture the 15% of Black voters who chose Matt Lieberman, another Democratic candidate who competed against Warnock in last month’s race.There are signs that turnout in Georgia could indeed be high in the runoffs. Through Wednesday, early voting data released by the office of Georgia’s secretary of state show nearly 1.9 million voters have already cast in-person or mail-in ballots since voting opened last week. That’s almost half of the total early votes cast in the November general election, with less than two weeks left before the Senate runoff concludes.Roughly 75,000 people in Georgia have also registered to vote ahead of the runoff, with less than half of those self-identifying as white.“The old way of just thinking that white voters will determine statewide elections in Deep South states is rapidly fading,” said Ben Jealous, president of People For the American Way, a progressive advocacy organization that encourages civic participation.Black, Hispanic and Asian American Georgians make up increasing segments of the state’s registered voters rolls. According to a new Pew Research Center analysis, Black registered voters here increased by about 130,000 between the 2016 presidential election and last month’s contest, which was the largest increase of all major racial and ethnic groups in the state. Although far fewer in number, Hispanic and Asian American residents have increased their registration every year for the last three presidential cycles, the Pew analysis shows.Dolores Huerta, the American labor movement icon and civil rights activist, said the growing size of the Hispanic voting population, particularly among younger voters, has already shifted the organizing strategy for races like the Georgia runoff.For weeks, several Black and multiracial social justice groups, many of them flush with resources, have been canvassing Georgia communities and airwaves to drive the needed turnout. They’re phone banking, sending texts, door knocking, and crisscrossing the state in tour buses and personal vehicles to reach Black and Hispanic Georgians. Many of them said they’ll continue outreach through the holidays, putting their own Christmas and New Year’s traditions on hold.Last weekend, Grammy, Oscar and Emmy award-winning hip-hop artist and activist Common was among celebrities who made several stops throughout Georgia, including at a rally for Warnock and Ossoff.Jealous’s organization last week launched a six-figure radio ad buy with the goal of reaching more than one million Black Georgia voters — and especially Black men, who haven’t voted in the same margins that Black women have, he said. Similarly, the recently formed Black Lives Matter PAC this week began airing its first TV ad targeting Georgia voters on major broadcast network affiliates and a handful of cable channels.The ad depicts a Black man out for a jog seeming to overcome the obstacles that might disenfranchise him. It evokes Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black man killed by white men in the coastal Georgia community of Brunswick last February, whose death helped spur this year’s national reckoning on systemic racism.The Rev. James Woodall, the Georgia NAACP president, said he appreciates the resources pouring in from outside of the state. However, he believes victory would come down to homegrown turnout efforts.“Georgians are organizing Georgians,” Woodall said.In a statement to the AP, Abigail Sigler, spokeswoman for the Georgia Republican Party, said the party was “working tirelessly to ensure all Georgians understand they have a clear choice” in the runoff.Republicans have focused their efforts on whiter, more rural parts of the state and smaller, more conservative cities, including Valdosta, where Trump held a rally earlier this month. Trump succeeded in the 2020 election in ramping up turnout in similar areas across the country, though it wasn’t enough to offset Biden’s advantages with minority voters and in large urban centers.The Working Families Party, a national progressive political movement that has endorsed Warnock, dispatched more than a dozen organizers and several more volunteers to Georgia. A group of them have set up shop at a home garage in a subdivision in Lawrenceville. Last Wednesday, some of them canvassed several neighborhoods that varied along the socioeconomic scale.“In less affluent neighborhoods, you can see the disparities clearly,” said Robert Campbell, a 29-year-old volunteer from the nonpartisan Chicago-based group Social Change, which is helping the Working Families Party with voter outreach.“It makes you wonder, when’s the last time a politician came out here door knocking? Every time they look out their door, they’re reminded of their conditions. No wonder they are infrequent voters,” Campbell said.Stephanie Lopez-Burgos, a field director for the Working Families Party for the Gwinnett area, led a group of canvassers in a more affluent Lawrenceville neighborhood. Nearly every home along a pristinely kept cul-de-sac was adorned with Christmas decorations.“Do you have a plan to vote in the runoff election?” another canvasser, Graco Hernandez Valenezuela, asked Tyrone Vereen, a 62-year-old Black retired police officer who answered the door.Vereen, who had already mailed in his ballot a week prior, said the events of the last year convinced him it was “time for a change.”At another home in the same neighborhood, 18-year-old Delano Jordan answered the door and told the canvassers that he would be voting for the first time at the polls on January 5.An aspiring lawyer who currently makes $11 per hour at a sporting goods store, Jordan, who is Black, said he’ll support candidates who favor raising the federal minimum wage to $15. Both Ossoff and Warnock have said they support a “livable wage.”“It’s going to be hard, but people need the change,” Jordan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-face-a-turnout-test-in-georgia-s-senate-runoffs/story-9ApxctkqdOFXl4lKduhSSM.html

24-12-2020||World||Families of Italian Covid-19 victims seek $122 million from government||About 500 relatives of people who died of Covid-19 in Italy said on Wednesday they had begun legal action against regional and national authorities, seeking 100 million euros ($122 million) in damages.The civil lawsuit, which the plaintiffs presented to a Rome court, is against Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Health Minister Roberto Speranza and the governor of the northerly Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana.The spokespeople of all three politicians did not respond to a request for comment.Italy, the first Western country hit by the coronavirus, has reported seen more than 70,000 deaths from Covid-19 since the outbreak emerged in February, the highest toll in Europe and the fifth-highest in the world. The hardest-hit region is Lombardy, where the first Covid-19 patient was detected on February 20.The lawsuit is being brought by members of a committee called “Noi Denunceremo” (we will go to court), set up in April to represent the relatives of people who died in Bergamo, one of Lombardy’s worst-affected cities.“This case is our Christmas gift to those who should have done what they were supposed to do, but didn’t,” the group’s president, Luca Fusco, said in statement.Concern about Italy’s management of the crisis was rekindled last week when prosecutors in Bergamo questioned Francesco Zambon, a World Health Organization (WHO)official who co-authored a report on Italy’s response to Covid-19.The report said the response of Italy’s hospitals had been “improvised, chaotic and creative” and “it took some time before formal guidance became available.” It was published by the WHO on May 13 but was quickly removed from its website.The WHO said it had been removed because of “factual inaccuracies”, but declined to say what these were.The Noi Denunceremo committee said when the outbreak erupted in Lombardy local authorities and the central government failed to take rapid action which could have avoided the need for a national lockdown and the economic damage it has brought.They also decried an alleged lack of preparedness, with neither Rome nor the Lombardy region having an updated plan in place to deal with a possible pandemic.“The authorities will be asked for an average compensation of 259,000 euros per person for a total outlay of around 100 million euros,” the group’s statement said.In June, “Noi Denunceremo” asked prosecutors in Bergamo to investigate possible criminal responsibility in the management of the pandemic.Conte was questioned by the prosecutors during the summer as a witness but is not under criminal investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/families-of-italian-covid-19-victims-seek-122-million-from-government/story-FKyibXcNZUSTeExnyIYfyN.html
24-12-2020||World||Donald Trump pardons a relative and more Russia probe convicts||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday pardoned two more aides convicted in the Russia meddling probe - Paul Manafort and Roger Stone - and for the first time extended the extraordinary pardon powers of his office to benefit a family member, Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.The outgoing president, who has refused to acknowledge his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden and has continued efforts to overturn the election’s outcome, had pardoned George Papadopoulos and Alex Van Der Zwaan, the first convicted in the Russia probe, on Tuesday. Earlier this month, he had pardoned Michael Flynn, his national security adviser.Trump granted 26 pardons and three commutations on Wednesday to add to 15 pardons and 5 commutations on Tuesday. Manafort had headed Trump’s 2016 election campaign before being fired just weeks before polling because of his business dealings with the former Soviet Union. He had been sentenced to seven and a half years for financial fraud in a case prosecuted by special counsel Robert Muller.Stone, meanwhile, was given 40 months’ jail time for lying to congress, essentially to protect Trump. The president had commuted his sentence earlier, saving him from serving in jail.The outgoing president’s pardon to Charles Kushner, however, received a lot of comments and criticism as a development that was taken to preview Trump’s larger plan to pardon his immediate family, especially his adult children who are already under investigation by state and local authorities, and possibly himself.Charles Kushner, a real estate magnate in New Jersey, pleaded guilty in 2016 to 16 counts of tax evasion and other charges that included using a sex worker to influence his sister’s husband to force him to not testify against him. He served two years in prison and got out in 2016.Charles Kushner, whose son Jared is married to the president’s eldest daughter Ivanka Trump, was prosecuted by Chris Christie, the then US attorney who went on to win two terms as governor of New Jersey and became a close ally of President Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pardons-a-relative-and-more-russia-probe-convicts/story-WDePIGEe2UhmZPY7W0052J.html

24-12-2020||World||US preparing new sanctions to impede Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline||The United States is urging European allies and private companies to halt work that could help build the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline and is preparing wider sanctions on the Russian project in coming weeks, senior Trump administration officials said on Wednesday.The outgoing Trump administration is readying a fresh round of congressionally mandated sanctions “in the very near future” that it believes could deal a fatal blow to the Russia-to-Germany project led by state gas company Gazprom , three officials said.“We’ve been getting body blow on body blow to this, and now we’re in the process of driving a stake through the project heart,” said one of the officials, who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity.Russia this month resumed building the $11.6 billion (9.5 billion euro) pipeline, which is 90% complete, after a one-year pause prompted by existing US sanctions. New work has been centered on a 2.6 kilometer (1.6 mile) stretch in shallow waters of Germany’s Exclusive Economic Zone but not yet in the deep-water sections off Denmark that comprise most of the unfinished 100-km stretch. Washington says the project, which will increase European reliance on Russian gas, will compromise European energy security. Russia says the sanctions amount to “unfair competition” aimed at helping U.S. liquefied natural gas producers, and insists it will finish the pipeline.The feud may not die down once President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20, foreign diplomats say. The U.S. pressure campaign on Nord Stream 2 is backed by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers who fear it will bypass Ukraine, robbing it of lucrative transit fees. Biden described the pipeline as a “bad deal” for Europe in 2016, and has criticized Moscow for its alleged role in a massive cyber attack on US government agencies that was discovered last week. Nord Stream 2 did not immediately comment on the possibility of new sanctions. Last month it told Reuters that existing sanctions and new ones in the defense policy bill would, if imposed, directly or indirectly hit more than 120 companies from more than 12 European countries.SHIP IN CANARY ISLANDSGazprom has had to retool its ships to do the delicate deepwater pipelaying and may need the help of companies from other countries to finish the project quickly.Washington has what it considers “reliable information” about modifications being carried out to the Oceanic 5000, a crane ship, in Spain’s Canary Islands, upgrades that U.S. officials say will equip the ship to lay pipe in deep water.The officials declined to identify which entities could face sanctions for the previously unreported work, but said they were not targeting specific governments or government officials. Several European entities were involved, but some were “unwitting” of the implications for the pipeline, said one official, adding they could still escape sanctions if they made “a good faith effort to unwind their involvement.”A Danish regulator on Tuesday said a Gazprom vessel called Fortuna would start work off Denmark from Jan. 15 with the assistance of other supply vessels.The project is grappling with financial pressures and the departure of key participants, including Norway’s risk management and quality assurance firm DNV last month. The State Department is due to issue an overdue report to Congress in the next weeks on companies that could be at risk for helping the project, another official said.DNV said new U.S. guidelines meant it could face sanctions. The scope of the sanctions were expanded further in a veto-proof bipartisan defense policy bill passed this month.That measure would also target individuals or companies assisting Gazprom with “pipelaying activities,” insurance, and verification of construction equipment. US sanctions have already added $1 billion in extra cost to the project, said one of the US officials.Initially slated to become operational in late 2020 or early 2021, Nord Stream 2 would double the capacity of Russia to carry gas directly to Germany.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-preparing-new-sanctions-to-impede-russia-s-nord-stream-2-pipeline/story-OvcwZFVgrIMiN6rPmiCIAL.html
24-12-2020||World||Over 100 killed in Ethiopia by gunmen in dawn attack||Gunmen killed more than 100 people in a dawn attack in the western Benishangul-Gumuz region of Ethiopia on Wednesday, the human rights commission said, as residents described fleeing the latest deadly assault in an area bedevilled by ethnic violence.The attack occurred in the village of Bekoji in Bulen county in the Metekel zone, the state-run Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said in a statement, an area where multiple ethnic groups are living. Africa’s second-most populous nation has been grappling with regular outbreaks of deadly violence since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was appointed in 2018 and accelerated democratic reforms that loosened the state’s iron grip on regional rivalries.Elections due next year have further inflamed simmering tensions over land, power and resources. In a separate part of the country, Ethiopia’s military has been fighting rebels in the northern Tigray region for over six weeks in a conflict that has displaced close to 950,000 people. The deployment of federal troops there has raised fears of a security vacuum in other restive regions.Ethiopia is also fighting an insurgency in the Oromiya region and faces long-running security threats from Somali Islamist militants along its porous eastern border. Gashu Dugaz, a senior regional security official, said authorities were aware of the Benishangul-Gumuz attack and were verifying the identities of the attackers and the victims, but did not give further information.The region is home to several ethnic groups including the Gumuz people. But in recent years farmers and businessmen from the neighbouring Amhara region have begun moving into the area, prompting some Gumuz to complain that fertile land has been taken. Some Amhara leaders are now saying that some of the land in the region - especially in the Metekel zone - rightfully belongs to them, claims that have angered Gumuz people. “In previous attacks it was people who came from ‘the forest’ who were involved but, in this case, victims said they knew the people involved in the attack,” the rights commission said in its statement.Belay Wajera, a farmer in the western town of Bulen, told Reuters he counted 82 dead bodies in a field near his home after Wednesday’s raid. He and his family awoke to the sound of gunshots and ran out of their home as men shouted “catch them”, he said. His wife and five of his children were shot dead, he was shot in the buttocks while four other children escaped and are now missing, Wajera told Reuters by phone late on Wednesday.Another resident of the town, Hassen Yimama, said armed men stormed the area around 6 a.m. (0300 GMT). He told Reuters that he counted 20 bodies in a different location. He grabbed his own weapon but assailants shot him in the stomach. A local medic said he and colleagues treated 38 injured people, most suffering from gunshot wounds. Patients told him of relatives who were killed with knives and told him that gunmen set houses on fire and shot at people trying to escape, he said.“We weren’t prepared for this and we are out of medicine,” a nurse at the same facility told Reuters, adding that a five-year-old child died while being transferred to the clinic. The attack came a day after Abiy, the military chief of staff and other senior federal officials visited the region to urge calm after several deadly incidents in recent months, such as a Nov. 14 assault in which gunmen targeted a bus and killed 34 people.“The desire by enemies to divide Ethiopia along ethnic and religious lines still exists. This desire will remain unfulfilled,” Abiy tweeted on Tuesday along with photos of his meetings that day in the town of Metekel, near where the November 14 attack occurred. He said residents’ wish for peace “outweighs any divisive agenda”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-100-killed-in-ethiopia-by-gunmen-in-dawn-attack/story-rPt12sVBPsR5AdIosklTXK.html
24-12-2020||World||Donald Trump vetoes defence bill that also slams Chinese aggression along India’s border||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday vetoed a $740 billion defence policy bill that also expresses concern over Chinese aggression on the border with India. Trump vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it failed to repeal a law — Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — that protects social media platforms from liability for content published by them; provides for renaming military installations named after confederate figures against his administration’s policy; and prevents him from moving troops from Germany and South Korea, among other things.Trump said in a note announcing his veto, “The Act fails to include critical national security measures, includes provisions that fail to respect our veterans and our military’s history, and contradicts efforts by my administration to put America first in our national security and foreign policy actions. It is a ‘gift’ to China and Russia.”Trump had threatened to veto the bill before it landed on his desk. His position sets up a confrontation with US congress that he is expected to lose. The bill had been passed with enough votes in both chambers to override Trump’s veto; it requires the support of two-thirds of the members. Both Republicans, who control the Senate, and Democrats, who dominate the House of Representatives, are determined to see the legislation go through despite Trump’s objection to it. The House is scheduled to hold its override vote on Monday and the Senate is set to follow on Tuesday.The legislation includes, with bipartisan and bicameral support, a section that seeks to convey congress’s “significant concern” with Chinese aggression along the northern border with India and calls upon Beijing to de-escalate tensions by working through existing diplomatic channels. The US president, however, has not cited this particular section among the grievances that he has aired while announcing the bill’s veto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-vetoes-defence-bill-that-also-slams-chinese-aggression-along-india-s-border/story-Sfl3s5EbATcr3ufukYDrRI.html

The girl, who had been studying in the UK , arrived in Singapore on Dec. 6 and was confirmed to have an infection Dec. 8. Her case was included in that day’s case count.“As she had been isolated upon arrival in Singapore, we were able to ringfence this case so that there was no further transmission arising from her,” the ministry said. “There is currently no evidence that the B117 strain is circulating in the community.”The presence of a more contagious Covid-19 strain could pose a challenge to Singapore, which has been lauded for its success in quelling the pace of infections in the community. The nation has imposed tougher border restrictions to stop travelers from the UK , including barring entry and transit for those who have traveled there in the past 14 days.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has imposed tougher regulations across a swath of England to rein in the more contagious strain, which is spreading quickly across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-detects-one-case-of-more-contagious-covid-19-strain/story-gF5TNCJj3Dwd57WK68ZNJI.html
24-12-2020||World||Hong Kong to let residents choose between Covid-19 vaccines||Hong Kong said residents will be allowed to choose which Covid-19 vaccine they want to take, as the city added a third candidate to its arsenal with an agreement to buy shots from AstraZeneca Plc.The city reached an agreement with AstraZeneca for 7.5 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a media briefing Wednesday. The deal joins similar agreements with Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Chinese developer Sinovac Biotech Ltd., giving the city a total of 22.5 million potential doses of vaccines. Hong Kong is seeking a further 7.5 million doses and residents will be offered a choice of which vaccine they will take, according to Lam.While the move will address concerns from residents anxious about taking a Chinese vaccine, it also raises the prospect of a run on particular shots. The three candidates are widely different and none of them have been approved for use in the city yet, which is enduring its fourth wave of the pandemic. In a bid to encourage take-up of the vaccines, Lam said on Wednesday the government will set up a fund to provide financial support for patients that experience side effects.Pfizer’s vaccine, which data indicate has a 95% protection rate against Covid-19, uses a new technology called messenger RNA that turns the body’s own cells into vaccine-producing factories to fight the coronavirus. While the shot is considered to be safe, there have been some reports of serious allergic reactions.Sinovac’s shot is made using an inactivated version of the coronavirus that is said to prime human immune systems to fight it. The vaccine was found to be more than 50% effective in a Brazilian clinical trial, though researchers delayed releasing more information at the request of the company. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has the most supply deals around the world, but initial clinical results were mixed.Lam said Wednesday the government has appointed a committee to approve the emergency use of the vaccines, signaling the city is moving closer to authorizing the candidates.Countries lacking the capacity to independently validate experimental drug therapies often rely on reviews of global leading drug authorities like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Pfizer-BioNTech’s shot has so far been approved in the U.S. and the European Union, while Singapore approved it last week.Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co., the Chinese company with the rights to market the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Hong Kong, was preparing to seek approval of the shot soon after the U.S. cleared it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-to-let-residents-choose-between-covid-19-vaccines/story-cLJdhZaLytgrCiLZrnxV6J.html
24-12-2020||World||Britain, Swiss firm Roche say Covid-19 tests can detect mutant virus||Britain and drugmaker Roche on Wednesday offered reassurances that the accuracy of diagnostic tests used to detect Covid-19 was unlikely to be affected by a fast-spreading mutant strain of the virus. Public Health England said that rapid lateral flow tests being deployed in the country’s mass-testing programme can identify the variant. Separately, Roche said neither its molecular test for Covid-19 nor a combination Covid-19/Influenza molecular test used on its high-throughput diagnostic machines was likely to be impacted by the mutations.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe reason, the Swiss company said, was that the mutations occurred on different regions of the new coronavirus than the regions that are targeted for the tests. Roche also said that five other tests it sells - Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Test, Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S Test as well as its SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test and SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test - were also unlikely to be eluded by the variant. Roche said that it would conduct further tests on the rapid antibody test that it makes in partnership with South Korea’s SD Biosensor, just to make sure.“We will share our findings, as soon as these indications have concluded,” the Basel-based company said. Also Read: Top scientist Anthony Fauci says US could see return to normal by next summerThe rapidly spreading mutation has prompted deep concerns in Britain and beyond that it will make fighting the pandemic even more difficult as infections accelerate. Nations including Switzerland have announced a series of travel bans and restrictions aimed at helping limit the spread of the strain outside Britain. Vaccine makers including Pfizer and BioNTech are also investigating whether the mutant virus that emerged in Britain could elude their shots, and say they need about two weeks to make a determination. They say they expect them to still work, but said the data needs to bear that out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-swiss-firm-roche-say-covid-19-tests-can-detect-mutant-virus/story-h27peM5KGlGWWR5gKGUsKN.html

Two cases belonging to this new category have been detected in the United Kingdom, British health secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed.2. Both of them have come in contact of those who have travelled from South Africa over the past few weeks.ALSO WATCH | Covid update: 2nd new virus variant reaches UK; India-Russia summit cancelled 3. South Africa had detected the mutation earlier. It reported last week that scientists have found a new genetic mutation which might be responsible for the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in South Africa.4. This South African variant is more transmissible than the UK variant, British health secretary has said, as this variant has mutated further than the UK variant.5. The variant has been named as 501.V2, South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize announced on Twitter. We have convened this public briefing today to announce that a variant of the SARS-COV-2 Virus- currently termed 501.V2 Variant has been identified by our genomics scientists here in South Africa.#SARSCOV2MediaBriefing6. Younger people with no co-morbidities are being infected by the new variant, South Africa has found. “Clinicians have been providing anecdotal evidence of a shift in the clinical epidemiological picture- in particular noting that they are seeing a larger proportion of younger patients with no co-morbidities presenting with critical illness,” Zweli Mkhize said.7. The new variant was discovered through routine surveillance by the laboratories in South Africa. Initially, the variant was confined to coastal regions, but has now entered inland.8. Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Turkey, Israel and Mauritius have banned flights from South Africa. URGENT UPDATE: I’ve taken the decision to temporarily stop flights and arrivals entering England from SOUTH AFRICA from 9am tomorrow following an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus. 1/39. The South African variant may allow the virus to better bind to and enter cells than previous variants, which is why transmission rate is higher, scientists told The Guardian.10. South Africa reported a sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in January. the new variant is believed to be the reason behind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coronavirus-mutant-found-in-south-africa-what-we-know-so-far/story-3PCx4lLRuGKunFXv1OHO1K.html
24-12-2020||World||Trump warns Iran over rocket strike on embassy in Iraq||US President Donald Trump warned Wednesday he would hold “Iran responsible” in the event of a fatal attack on Americans in Iraq, as the first anniversary of the killing of a top Iranian general in a US air strike approaches.“Our embassy in Baghdad got hit Sunday by several rockets,” Trump said on Twitter, referring to an attack that caused damage but no deaths. “Guess where they came from: IRAN,” he added. “Now we hear chatter of additional attacks against Americans in Iraq,” he added, before offering “some friendly health advice to Iran: if one American is killed, I will hold Iran responsible. Think it over,” he said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had already pointed the finger at Tehran, while the US military command that covers the region said that the rocket attack “was almost certainly conducted by an Iranian-backed rogue militia group.”It said in a statement that while it “caused no US injuries or casualties, the attack did damage buildings in the US embassy compound, and was clearly NOT intended to avoid casualties.” “The United States will hold Iran accountable for the deaths of any Americans that result from the work of these Iranian-backed rogue militia groups,” it added. Iran responded by calling on US authorities on Monday not to provoke “tensions”. Trump ordered the drone attack on January 3, 2020 to kill the powerful Iranian general while he was in Baghdad. The air strike came after Iranian-backed militias had fired rockets at US targets in Iraq, in a scenario echoed by the latest strikes against the US embassy.After Soleimani’s killing, the entire region held its breath in anticipation of an uncontrolled escalation which ultimately did not materialize. But tensions are rising again as the first anniversary of the strike nears and the US leader -- in his final weeks in office -- is sticking to his “maximum pressure” approach toward the Iranian regime.Washington has recently reduced its diplomatic staff in the Iraqi capital amid speculations that it could close the mission altogether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-warns-iran-over-rocket-strike-on-embassy-in-iraq/story-vHmUwFj3JFK5PJg9egAaEI.html

Christmas is the right moment for such a gesture,” Heusgen told the council session, whose official agenda topic was Iran. Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat who was working as an adviser for the International Crisis Group think tank, and businessman Spavor were detained by Beijing in 2018 shortly after Canadian police picked up Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a US warrant.China’s deputy UN ambassador, Geng Shuang, accused Heusgen of abusing the Security Council to launch “malicious” attacks on other members “in an attempt to poison the working atmosphere”.“I wish to say something out of the bottom of my heart: Good riddance, Ambassador Heusgen,” Geng said. “I am hoping that the council in your absence in the year 2021 will be in a better position to fulfil the responsibilities...for maintaining international peace and security.”Heusgen also used the Security Council meeting to advise Russia’s deputy UN ambassador, Dmitry Polyanskiy, to read certain articles about Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who said he had tricked a Russian secret agent into disclosing details of a botched plot to kill him. Russia’s FSB security service dismissed the recording as a fake.Polyanskiy replied: “It seems he’s developed a certain dependency on the council, there’s never a meeting without criticism of Russia even if that’s not suitable for the subject matter. I hope that after Jan. 1 that Christoph’s symptoms will improve.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/good-riddance-china-says-as-germany-leaves-un-security-council/story-56vfJnHQXDzv4hVi0dwCrL.html
24-12-2020||World||Top scientist Anthony Fauci says US could see return to normal by next summer||If the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines proceeds smoothly, it might be possible to achieve widespread population immunity in the United States by next summer, top scientist Anthony Fauci has said.In an interview with WebMD that was posted Wednesday, the infectious disease official suggested people could host weddings as early as June or July.Fauci said he believed priority populations, such as nursing home residents, health care workers, critical workers, the elderly, people at high risk etc. should receive their shots by March or early April.“We could start in April doing what I call ‘open season’ on vaccinations -- namely anybody in the general population who wants to get vaccinated will get vaccinated.”He continued: “By the time we get into the middle or end of the summer, I believe we will have, if we do it correctly, we could have 70 to 85 percent of the population vaccinated. “When that occurs, there will be an umbrella of protection over the entire country.”Asked whether people who had postponed their weddings until March or April of 2021 would need to postpone again, he replied: “You know, they should have done it till June, July.”Fauci’s comments come after the US authorized two vaccines for emergency use, one by Pfizer and BioNTech and the other by Moderna and the National Institutes for Health.Also Tuesday, the Trump administration announced it had purchased an additional 100 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with the shots set to be delivered by July.That brings the current US supply of Covid-19 vaccine to 400 million doses -- half from Pfizer and half from Moderna -- allowing it to immunize 200 million people under the two-shot regimens.“Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will deliver at least 70 million doses by June 30, 2021, with the balance of the 100 million doses to be delivered no later than July 31, 2021,” the defense department said in a statement.The agreement includes options for an additional 400 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. The US is hoping to immunize 20 million people this month, with long-term care residents and health workers at the front of the line.On Sunday, an expert committee said that people 75 and older should be the next vaccinated along with 30 million “frontline essential workers,” including teachers, grocery store employees and police.Governments are also hoping for more vaccine makers’ products to be approved, with Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca thought to be next along the line.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-scientist-anthony-fauci-says-us-could-see-return-to-normal-by-next-summer/story-jXvZ7nWpZWyS7WeisUT7zM.html

Where is that 200-person team now?” Dawn reported. “Ministers in his cabinet play musical chairs with each other [...] but that 200 person team is nowhere to be seen in Pakistan,” she said.“He says that he was unaware about the country’s power issues, external debt, the current account deficit, and didn’t know how to run the government and was not prepared.” However, you were prepared for the sugar, wheat and LNG scams through which you stole from the people’s pockets, she said.Maryam’s comments come a day after Prime Minister Khan said that never should a new government come to power without doing its homework and getting briefings.During today’s rally, Maryam said that coronavirus patients had died at Khyber Teaching Hospital after there was a delay in procuring oxygen cylinders. “You were not prepared to provide medical services, but you were prepared to raise the prices of medicines?”She added that the premier was prepared to throw the sisters and daughters of his opponents in jail but was prepared to give an NRO to his sister.You were not prepared to work on our foreign policy but were prepared to surrender Kashmir to India, she said. “You had zero preparation to run the government but were fully prepared to be obedient. After two-and-a-half years, you still don’t know how to govern but you know how to be obedient very well.”The PDM held a rally in Mardan against Prime Minister Khan-led government, threatening him to quit by January 31 or face intensified movements by opposition parties such as a long march to Islamabad.In the past months, Khan has stepped up his efforts to silence the voice of the PDM, along with thousands of people, who criticised the government.Despite such attempts, the PDM has held five such rallies in Multan, Peshawar, Gujranwala, Karachi, and Quetta since October 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maryam-nawaz-lashes-at-pak-pm-asks-why-he-assumed-office-when-wasn-t-prepared/story-7hoyPYfXFFQp13huz1foJI.html

The city’s fire department tweeted that at least nine of the victims were in critical condition, while another was in serious condition.The trapped workers were rescued through a window.The firefighters’ union tweeted that evidence points to an explosion on the 16th floor of the downtown building, where the offices of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company are located.The fire department said the cause of the explosion remains under investigation. Utility spokeswoman Stephanie Anne Weaver said work on the building’s “air handling and boiler system” likely caused the accident.“Window washing scaffolding was compromised because of the incident and a window washing crew was pulled to safety by the fire department,” Weaver said in a statement.Weaver said no utility employees were injured. The building was largely empty because of the holidays and the coronavirus pandemic. Its gas service was not active because of the construction work.Weaver said the building has been deemed structurally sound following an inspection and repairs are planned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baltimore-building-explosion-injures-23-traps-workers/story-98pmSpVadPBNv4rtEgge1H.html
24-12-2020||World||More than 100 killed in latest ethnic massacre in Ethiopia||The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission says more than 100 people have been killed in the latest massacre along ethnic lines in the western part of the country.The Amhara Mass Media Agency, affiliated with the country’s Amhara region, in a separate report cited witnesses as saying the attack occurred early Wednesday in the Metekel zone of the Benishangul-Gumuz region.The attack occurred a day after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited the region and spoke about the need to bring those responsible for recent attacks to justice. Ethnic tensions are a major challenge as Abiy tries to promote national unity in a country with more than 80 ethnic groups.Some people in remote villages remained encircled and under threat on Wednesday evening, with the overall death toll above 200, asserted Belete Molla, head of the National Movement of Amhara political party. He said he had spoken by phone with some residents.It was not immediately clear who the attackers were, though Belete asserted that they were Gumuz militia members. The ruling party in the region, the Benishangul-Gumuz Prosperity Party, said in a statement that “armed bandits” had committed a “horrifying crime.”Amharas are the second most populous ethnic group in Ethiopia. Amharas in the region have been targeted repeatedly in recent weeks.One rebel attack on Nov. 1 in the far western Oromia region killed at least 54 people, according to Amnesty International.An attack in the Benishangul-Gumuz region in early October killed at least 14 civilians, according to a security official. It followed similar deadly attacks in September that also displaced over 300 people, leading the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission to say it was deeply alarmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-100-killed-in-latest-ethnic-massacre-in-ethiopia/story-j0vMPad5wk49jm9kRiLSsM.html

Defense lawyers argued their clients returned fire after being ambushed by Iraqi insurgents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-office-criticizes-donald-trump-pardons-of-ex-contractors/story-tvYD5bsZTKRfZ8J9PsTrqJ.html
24-12-2020||World||Gunman kills 3 French police in domestic abuse standoff||A heavily armed gunman in southern France killed three police officers responding to a domestic violence call at his house and then fled, and he was found dead nearby Wednesday after an apparent suicide, the regional prosecutor said.The unusual killing of three on-duty officers prompted a broad search and drew national concern, notably from French leaders who are under pressure from police to do more to protect them. President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: “They are our heroes.”The bloodshed started when a woman called a friend for help Tuesday night and reported her partner had beaten her at the couple’s home in the mountainside village of Ambert southwest of Lyon, regional Prosecutor Eric Maillaud told reporters.The friend called police, and when gendarmes arrived, they found the woman on the roof, where she had taken refuge after the man apparently set the house on fire, the prosecutor said.“It was a real scene of war that we confronted overnight,” he said. “An over-armed individual. A house in flames.”In the ensuing standoff, three police officers were killed and another injured, and the gunman fled. Some 300 police were sent to the area to search for the assailant, according to a spokesman for the national gendarme service.The man was found Wednesday morning in his car, crashed on a mountainside, Maillaud said. He had an unregistered semi-automatic rifle that the prosecutor described as a “weapon of war,” as well as a Glock pistol, a hunting rifle and four knives. The woman was taken into police care and given medical treatment.Preliminary investigation suggested the assailant had undergone brief military training, held “extremist” Catholic views and was known as a survivalist who “was apparently convinced that the end of the world was approaching,” the prosecutor said. The assailant had been in a custody battle with his former partner, but police had no record of problems with the woman who was targeted Tuesday, Maillaud said.France’s Interior Ministry reported that 146 women were killed by their partners last year, which prompted a nationwide campaign against domestic violence.French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin went to the scene of the killings Wednesday and praised the actions of police.Even as law enforcement officers are seeking greater protections, activists are increasingly speaking out about brutality by some police officers, notably against minorities in low-income neighborhoods.In one recent case, four officers were charged over the violent beating of a Black music producer that was caught on camera in images that shocked the French public. Two were held in custody but were released this week pending further investigation.The producer, Michel Zecler, said Wednesday that the officers were being “coddled” instead of punished. Speaking on BFM television, he said, “I can’t understand what prompts such benevolence from the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunman-kills-3-french-police-in-domestic-abuse-standoff/story-Nn2aMSoDq6fnK2CaErQQVK.html
