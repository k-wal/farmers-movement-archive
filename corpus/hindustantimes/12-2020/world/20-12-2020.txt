But the effective work of the intelligence agencies, bound to the law and national interests, has undoubtedly always been and will always be extremely important for Russia,” Putin said at the SVR headquarters.National security, according to the Russian leader, is one of the most crucial warrants of the sovereign, democratic and diverse society, which can withstand any challenges.“Among these challenges is international terrorism. ... We remember everyone who died defending Russia from this ruthless enemy that our country faced in the most difficult period of its history,” Putin noted.The president added that Russia had recently seen the creation of a powerful nationwide mechanism for combating terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/risks-of-simmering-conflicts-near-russia-require-stepped-up-border-protection-putin/story-sXEhQJrU5MTwachfM48FtN.html
20-12-2020||World||Several EU nations halt UK flights, fearing Covid-19 variant||One by one, several European Union nations banned flights from the UK on Sunday and others were considering similar action in a bid to block a new strain of coronavirus sweeping across southern England from establishing a strong foothold on the continent.Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Italy all announced restrictions on UK travel, hours after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that Christmas shopping and gatherings in southern England must be cancelled because of rapidly spreading infections blamed on the new coronavirus variant.Johnson immediately put those regions into a strict new Tier 4 restriction level, upending Christmas plans for millions.The German government said that it’s banning flights coming from Britain in reaction to the new coronavirus strain. The transportation ministry said all UK flights with the exception of cargo flights were no longer allowed to land in Germany starting at midnight Sunday. It didn’t immediately say how long the flight ban would last.The Netherlands banned flights from the UK for at least the rest of the year while Belgium issued a flight ban for 24 hours starting at midnight and also halted train links to Britain, including the Eurostar. Austria and Italy said they would halt flights from the UK but did not say exactly when that would take place.Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, said an order signed Sunday blocks flights from Britain and prohibits entry into Italy by anyone who has been in the UK in the last 14 days. The order bans plane travel until Jan. 6.The Czech Republic imposed stricter quarantine measures from people arriving from Britain. An EU official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were still ongoing, said Sunday afternoon that the European Commission was in touch with member states on the rapidly developing situation.High-speed train operator Eurostar canceled its trains between London, Brussels and Amsterdam beginning Monday, but kept trains operating on the London-to-Paris route.Johnson said Saturday that a fast-moving new variant of the virus that is 70% more transmissible than existing strains appeared to be driving the rapid spread of new infections in London and southern England. But he stressed “there’s no evidence to suggest it is more lethal or causes more severe illness,” or that vaccines will be less effective against it.Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said Sunday said he was issuing the flight ban for 24 hours starting at midnight “out of precaution.”“There are a great many questions about this new mutation,” he said, adding he hoped to have more clarity by Tuesday.The World Health Organization tweeted late Saturday that it was “in close contact with UK officials on the new #Covid19 virus variant” and promised to update governments and the public as more is learned.The new strain was identified in southeastern England in September and has been spreading in the area ever since, a WHO official told the BBC on Sunday.“What we understand is that it does have increased transmissibility, in terms of its ability to spread,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19.Studies are under way to better understand how fast it spreads and and whether “it’s related to the variant itself, or a combination of factors with behavior,” she added.She said the strain had also been identified in Denmark, the Netherlands and Australia, where there was one case that didn’t spread further.“The longer this virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to change,” she said. “So we really need to do everything we can right now to prevent spread, and minimizing that spread will reduce the chances of it changing.”Viruses mutate regularly, and scientists have found thousands of different mutations among samples of the virus causing Covid-19. Many of these changes have no effect on how easily the virus spreads or how severe symptoms are.Susan Hopkins of Public Health England said while the variant has been circulating since September, it wasn’t until the last week that officials felt they had enough evidence to declare that it has higher transmissibility than other circulating coronaviruses.U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee for U.S. surgeon general said Sunday that the emergence of the new strain doesn’t change the public health guidance on precautions for reducing the spread of the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing and washing hands.“While it seems to be more easily transmissible, we do not have evidence yet that this is a more deadly virus to an individual who acquires it,” Vivek Murthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “There’s no reason to believe that the vaccines that have been developed will not be effective against this virus, as well.”Europe has been walloped this fall by soaring new infections and deaths due to a resurgence of the virus, and many nations have reimposed a series of restrictions to reign in their outbreaks.Britain has seen over 67,000 deaths in the pandemic, the second-highest confirmed toll in Europe after Italy. Europe as a whole has recorded nearly 499,000 virus deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts believe is an undercount, due to limited testing and missed cases.The European Medicines Agency, meanwhile, is meeting Monday to approve the first Covid-19 vaccine for the European Union’s 27 nations, bringing vaccinations closer for millions of EU citizens. The vaccine made by German pharmaceutical company BioNTech and American drugmaker Pfizer is already in use in the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries.The EMA moved up its assessment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by a week after heavy pressure from EU governments, especially Germany, which has said that after the EMA approval it could start vaccinating citizens as early as next Sunday.In an urgent address to the nation on Saturday, Johnson ordered all non-essential shops, hairdressers and gyms in London and large parts of southern England closed and told Britons to reorganize their holiday plans. No mixing of households is now allowed indoors in the region, and only essential travel is permitted. In the rest of England, people will be allowed to meet in Christmas bubbles for just one day instead of the five that were planned.After he spoke, videos emerged online that showed crowds of people rushing to London’s train stations, apparently making a dash for places in the UK with less stringent coronavirus restrictions before the new rules took effect. Health Secretary Matt Hancock called those scenes “totally irresponsible.”While Hancock insisted officials had acted “very quickly and decisively,” critics said Britain’s Conservative government should have moved against rising infections and hospitalizations much earlier.“The alarms bells have been ringing for weeks, but the prime minister chose to ignore them,” said Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party. “It is an act of gross negligence by a prime minister who, once again, has been caught behind the curve.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/several-eu-nations-halt-uk-flights-fearing-covid-19-variant/story-0ZnzgJZOwXOGcQSuCkR7aO.html
20-12-2020||World||Denmark to dig up millions of dead mink after botched cull||Denmark’s parliament has agreed to dig up about 4 million dead mink, after the animals were culled and buried in haste earlier this year in an effort to stamp out a mutation of the coronavirus.The mink will be exhumed after six months, a time period deemed long enough to ensure there’s no longer a contamination risk, the Ministry of Food and Veterinary Affairs said on Sunday. The animals will then be incinerated, it said.“Once the [dead] mink are no longer contaminated with Covid-19, they will be transported to an incineration facility, where they’ll be burned as corporate waste,” the ministry said. “That way we can avoid having to handle the mink as dangerous waste.”The agreement comes after the animals had started to resurface from their mass graves, prompting fears of contamination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-to-dig-up-millions-of-dead-mink-after-botched-cull/story-F1kK4Oa7irAl0ovr3UMY8M.html
20-12-2020||World||Unclear If US has UK Covid-19 mutation, says chief scientific adviser Slaoui||It’s not clear whether a more transmissible variant of the coronavirus that prompted tighter restrictions in the UK has made its way to the US, according to Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for the government’s vaccine acceleration program.“We don’t know,” Slaoui said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” on Sunday. “We’re looking at that.”Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir questioned the threat posed by the virus changes cited by the UK government, saying it has mutated more than 4,000 times since its discovery. There’s no imminent need to suspend flights from the UK, he said on ABC’s “This Week.”“We don’t know that it’s more dangerous, and very importantly we have not seen a single mutation yet that would make it evade the vaccine,” and while that can’t be ruled out for the future, “I don’t think there should be any reason for alarm right now,” Giroir said.The new variant may be as much as 70% more transmissible, which led UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce a lockdown for London and large parts of southeast England on Saturday. He canceled plans to ease pandemic restrictions for five days over the holidays, and banned household mixing in London and the southeast while restricting socializing to just Christmas Day across the rest of England.Vaccinate Trump?Even if the variant does become more widespread, Slaoui said the vaccines that are now rolling out will provide protection against it. That includes the Moderna Inc. vaccine that received approval from US regulators Friday, and Slaoui said the first shots are expected to be administered Monday.Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, urged President Donald Trump to get vaccinated against Covid-19 to promote acceptance of immunization among his supporters.“Again, we have every reason to believe that these two vaccines are very effective and they are safe,” he said. “So I would encourage the president to get a vaccine for his own health and safety, and also to generate more confidence among the people who follow him so closely.”Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence received the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE in a televised event at the White House on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unclear-if-us-has-uk-covid-19-mutation-says-chief-scientific-adviser-slaoui/story-6VAK42BI1wPeqcwcwyTP0J.html

Earlier this month, the FCC finalized rules that require carriers with ZTE or Huawei equipment to “rip and replace” that equipment but is awaiting funding from Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-gives-nod-to-1-9-bn-fund-to-replace-huawei-zte-telecom-equipment-report/story-SQFubZdMWWewf3SesP4p0N.html
20-12-2020||World||Nepal’s private airline flew 69 passengers to wrong destination: Report||Passengers bound for Nepal’s Janakpur were in for a surprise after they ended up in Pokhara, 255 kilometres away from the actual destination, after a rare flight mix-up by a leading private carrier, according to a media report on Sunday. The incident happened on Friday to 69 passengers travelling on Buddha Air, The Kathmandu Post reported.The weather was not quite favourable for the flights on Friday so carriers were making use of every available weather window to take the passengers on board as quickly as possible and take off, the report said. Buddha Air’s flight U4505 was cleared to take off for Janakpur airport in the plains. Passengers were taken in and the plane took off, with its estimated arrival time at Janakpur by 3:15 pm.When it took off, it had already been delayed. But when it landed, it actually landed in Pokhara instead of the destination airport. According to the preliminary report, due to weather issues, flights to Pokhara were permitted until 3 pm under the visual flight rules (VFR). The VFR is a set of regulations under which a pilot operates an aircraft in weather conditions generally clear enough to allow the pilot to see where the aircraft is going.“The weather was already causing flight delays and to make up for the flying time, Buddha Air officials decided to fly to Pokhara first,” said an official at the airline company.Accordingly, the flight number was changed and the mix-up happened. Buddha Air admitted to serious lapses on its side, the report said. Birendra Bahadur Basnet, Managing Director of the carrier, told the Post that they have formed a committee to investigate the incident.“The difference in flight schedule between Janakpur and Pokhara was 15 to 20 minutes,” said an official.“The ground staff transferred [on paper] 69 passengers of flight U4505 to flight U4607 which actually was cleared for Pokhara by the air traffic controllers,” said the official.Everything was in the right order but the ground staff and the flight attendant failed to brief the flight’s captain and co-pilot that the flight’s number had been changed, according to the official.“The flight attendant did make an announcement on the flight that it was heading to Janakpur,” said the official.“There was a miscommunication between the ground staff and the pilots,” said the official. “The flying pilots also did not look at the passengers’ manifest.” Aviation experts say such incidents may happen, but they happen quite rarely.Tri Ratna Manandhar, a former director-general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, said this is the second incident of such kind in Nepal’s aviation history in the last two and a half-decades. In 1993, a Twin Otter of the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation had landed in Simara airport which was supposed to land in Bharatpur airport.“The Buddha Air incident happened due to miscommunication. It’s not part of safety lapses but it’s a serious lapse on the part of management,” said Manandhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-private-airline-flew-69-passengers-to-wrong-destination-report/story-usAU3E9Goq7tiZ4wr0CdEL.html
20-12-2020||World||Germany brings home 3 women, 12 kids from camps in Syria||Germany has organized the return of three women and 12 children from camps in northeastern Syria for humanitarian reasons.Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Sunday did not further identify the women or children, who were flown back to Germany on Saturday.However, the German weekly Bild am Sonntag reported that all three women had left Germany in recent years to join the extremist Islamic State group Syria. The paper identified the women as Merve A., Yasmin A. and Leonora M.Also Sunday, Germany’s federal prosecutor’s office said a German citizen by the name of Leonora M. had been arrested upon her arrival at Frankfurt airport. It said she is accused of membership in the foreign terrorist group Islamic State and allegedly committed crimes against humanity.Maas said he was “very relieved” about the return of the 12 children and three of their mothers.“These are humanitarian cases, especially orphans and children with illnesses — cases in which the departure was urgently needed,” Maas said.“This good news just before Christmas makes us confident that we will be able to organize the return of further cases as well,” he said adding that the government would advocate the return of others in coming weeks and months.Maas said the return was organized in cooperation with Finland, which brought home six children and two women.Hundreds of Europeans — many of them young women — left the continent in the last couple of years to join the Islamic State and fight in Syria and Iraq. Several died, others were arrested and detained by Turkish, Kurdish or Iraqi authorities who have been eager to deport them and their children back to Europe.European governments, however, have been reluctant to take back the often radicalized Islamic State supporters and sentiment is running high across Europe against the returnees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-brings-home-3-women-12-kids-from-camps-in-syria/story-kbUZxB984yt2bGt57xjpQK.html
20-12-2020||World||Millions in stringent new UK lockdown amid coronavirus variant surge||A surge in the infection rate caused by a new variant of coronavirus has led to millions entering a stringent new stay-at-home lockdown in the UK from Sunday, with non-essential shops and businesses now closed.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the new rules at a briefing from 10 Downing Street on Saturday evening, which means a planned five-day “Christmas bubble” of relaxed rules has been cancelled in favour of a new Tier 4 level to the current three-tier lockdown system to try and control the surge in infections being caused by the new mutation of the deadly virus.“It seems that the spread is now being driven by the new variant of the virus,” Johnson said.“We have alerted the World Health Organisation and are continuing to analyse the available data to improve our understanding,” said Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer for England.“There is no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments although urgent work is underway to confirm this,” he said.The state-funded National Health Service (NHS) is set to vaccinate people against the coronavirus on Christmas Day as part of a drive to accelerate the number of inoculations nationally, according to ‘The Sunday Times’. More than 100,000 Pfizer jabs have been booked at general practitioner (GP) surgeries and hospital hubs across the country for the coming week.Under the new Tier 4, people would be banned from mixing with anyone outside of their household, including on Christmas Day, and for the other tiers, Christmas rules allowing up to three households will now be limited to Christmas Day of December 25 only, rather than five days. The changes will last for two weeks with the first review now due on December 30.The new restrictions – similar to the second national lockdown which ended in November – applies to all areas in the South East which were in tier three, covering Kent, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Surrey (excluding Waverley), Gosport, Havant, Portsmouth, Rother and Hastings. It also applies in London and the East of England – Bedford, Central Bedford, Milton Keynes, Luton, Peterborough, Hertfordshire, and Essex. In Wales, the restrictions were brought forward pre-Christmas to also begin right away.“We are sacrificing the chance to see our loved ones this Christmas so we have a better chance of protecting their lives so that we can see them at future Christmases,” he said, adding that he “bitterly regretted” have to make these changes. The UK PM said there is no evidence to suggest vaccines would be any less effective against the new variant but that it was required to act fast to try and control its acceleration.“Our advisers on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) have spent the last few days analysing this new variant – there’s no evidence that it causes more severe illness or higher mortality but it does appear to be passed on significantly more quickly,” he said.Non-essential shops, gyms, cinemas, hairdressers, and bowling alleys will be forced to close for two weeks, while people will be restricted to meeting one other person from another household in an outdoor public space.Johnson added: “I know how much emotion people invest in this time of year, and how important it is, for instance, for grandparents to see their grandchildren, for families to be together. So I know how disappointing this will be. But we have said throughout this pandemic that we must and we will be guided by the science. When the science changes, we must change our response.” “I think the Prime Minister should apologise. This is not just one mistake when he has otherwise got things right. It is the same mistake over and over again,” said Sir Keir Starmer, the Leader of the Opposition.“At the heart of the problem here is a Prime Minister who simply doesn’t want to be unpopular and therefore won’t take the tough decisions that are necessary, until he is forced into them at the 11th hour. We can’t go on like that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-in-stringent-new-uk-lockdown-amid-coronavirus-variant-surge/story-NJcovax13CXUpscmofp5dP.html
20-12-2020||World||Christmas travel chaos hits UK as Europeans suspend flights||The UK plunged into Christmas chaos with police deployed to stop people boarding packed trains, holidays abroad scrapped and Europe banning travel with the country after London went into an emergency lockdown.In a sudden turnaround, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson canceled plans to allow families to see each other over the festive period as the government warned that a new strain of the coronavirus is “out of control.” There were scenes of panic at train stations, with people defying social-distancing rules to get out of the capital before the new rules took effect on Sunday.More than 16 million Britons are now required to stay at home after new restrictions came into force Sunday in London and southeast England. The measures ban household mixing in the capital and the southeast, and restrict socializing to just Christmas Day across the rest of England.France and Germany are considering joining Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium in banning air and train links with the UK, which is in the middle of delicate and critical Brexit negotiations with its partners in the European Union (EU).The talks were expected to reach a breakthrough as soon as this weekend.For many Britons, either trying to see relatives or trying to go on a winter vacation, the situation is reminiscent of the last nationwide lockdown and will stoke fears that even with a vaccine the virus is still dangerous, if not as deadly. It is also but the latest U-turn from a government that has been reluctant to impose limits to movement, unless forced. Until Friday, Johnson was adamant that close households would be able to mix over Christmas.Crowded AirportsWhile London’s Heathrow airport was crowded Sunday morning as dozens of planes departed, an 11:45 a.m. KLM service to Amsterdam left empty, according to a spokeswoman for the hub, while two later British Airways flights to the Dutch city showed as cancelled. Most other operations were shown to be on schedule.The bans are very concerning, the spokeswoman said. Heathrow has just had one of its busiest weeks since the first UK lockdown as people caught flights in the run up to Christmas, and there are large numbers still due to travel, she added.A spokesman for Schiphol airport in Amsterdam said planes arriving from London on Sunday were essentially empty. Deutsche Lufthansa AG has cancelled crew layovers in the UK and is weighing further actions, a spokesman said.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that more British Transport Police will be dispatched to stop people taking unnecessary journeys out of London.“Please do not come to a station unless you are permitted to travel,” Shapps said in a statement. “Extra British Transport Police officers are being deployed to ensure only those who need to take essential journeys can travel safely,” he said after videos of people fleeing the capital spread on social media.London’s Metropolitan Police are also increasing patrols, prioritizing high footfall parts of the capital as well as areas where the virus is spreading rapidly, it said on a statement. “At this critical moment for the city, officers across London will pay particular attention to those groups who have wilfully ignored the rules, putting communities and lives at risk,” it said.Officers are deployed across airports “as part of routine security and policing,” a Met Police spokesperson said.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News presenter Sophy Ridge earlier this morning that it is more important than ever that people are responsible and not only stick to the rules but restrict all social contact as much as is possible because “this is deadly serious.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/christmas-travel-chaos-hits-uk-as-europeans-suspend-flights/story-TwgnoDZhY1jK2b00t4n8tM.html
20-12-2020||World||Second Covid-19 vaccine authorized in US ships out||Initial shipments of the second Covid-19 vaccine authorized in the US left a distribution center Sunday, a desperately needed boost as the nation works to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control.The trucks left the factory in the Memphis area with the vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. and the National Institutes of Health. The much-needed shots are expected to be given starting Monday, just three days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized their emergency rollout.Later Sunday, an expert committee will debate who should be next in line for early doses of the Moderna vaccine and a similar one from Pfizer Inc. and Germany’s BioNTech. Pfizer’s shots were first shipped out a week ago and started being used the next day, kicking off the nation’s biggest vaccination drive.Public health experts say the shots — and others in the pipeline — are the only way to stop a virus that has been spreading wildly. Nationwide, more than 219,000 people per day on average test positive for the virus, which has killed at least 314,000 in the US and upwards of 1.7 million worldwide.The Pfizer and Moderna shots shipped so far and going out over the next few weeks are nearly all going to health care workers and residents of long-term care homes, based on the advice of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.That panel meets Sunday to debate who should get the doses available after those early shots are given.There won’t be enough shots for the general population until spring, so doses will be rationed at least for the next several months.The panel members are leaning toward putting “essential workers” next in line, because people like bus drivers, grocery store clerks and others are the ones getting infected most often. But other experts say people 65 and older should be next, along with people with certain medical conditions, because those are the Americans who are dying at the highest rates.The expert panel’s advice is almost always endorsed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No matter what the CDC says, there will be differences from state to state, because their health departments have different ideas about who should be closer to the front of the line.Both the new Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot require two doses several weeks apart. The second dose must be from the same company as the first. Both vaccines appeared safe and strongly protective in large, still unfinished studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-in-us-ships-out/story-0shaFBluZ1u5VVZt0djtUL.html

He was 72.Sheikh Nasser, who held various government posts over the years including minister of defense and deputy prime minister, had been considered a top contender for crown prince following the death in September of his father, the 91-year-old Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah.Although he drew popular support for his ambitious mega-projects and anti-corruption efforts, he was passed over for his uncle, Sheikh Meshal Al Ahmed Al Jaber Al Sabah, a more cautious choice of heir apparent at a turbulent time for Kuwait’s politics and the wider region.The KUNA state-run news agency did not specify how Sheikh Nasser died, but he was known to be in fragile health after having a lung tumor removed two years ago.In a country that depends on oil for some 90% of its revenues, Sheikh Nasser championed bold plans to diversify Kuwait’s economy by building up a business hub with a free zone and deep sea port in the country’s north. But with many in Kuwait’s parliament committed to the status quo, his ideas repeatedly ran aground even as fears mounted that the country was falling behind its more powerful and better-developed neighbors, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Last year, Sheikh Nasser’s public allegations of government corruption vaulted him into the national political scene, as he pressed for investigations into the suspected embezzlement of hundreds of millions of dollars from a military fund.His efforts backfired when his father, the emir, ousted him from government, but he retained a substantial following and continued to make public statements about the need to fight corruption both in Kuwait’s sprawling bureaucracy and his own ruling family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-s-key-reformer-son-of-late-emir-dies-at-72/story-QZ8ZuW8MH0eb3Q22AbNZzJ.html
20-12-2020||World||Ban on UK flights: Here’s how countries have reacted to new Covid-19 variant||While some countries have decided to ban flights from the United Kingdom, some are still mulling over the action after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday confirmed that a new strain of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is rapidly spreading in certain areas. During a televised briefing, Johnson said that the new variant of the coronavirus is 70% more transmissible than existing strains. “There is still much we don’t know. While we are fairly certain the variant is transmitted more quickly, there is no evidence to suggest that it is more lethal or causes more severe illness,” said the UK PM.Johnson announced that London, parts of the South East and the East of England, which were under Tier 3 restrictions, have been moved to Tier 4. Ahead of the announcement, Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said there is no evidence to suggest the new variant of coronavirus causes a higher mortality rate or it affects vaccines and treatments, however, urgent work is underway to confirm this.“We have alerted the World Health Organisation and are continuing to analyse the available data to improve our understanding,” Whitty said in a statement.Also Read | Covid-19 is ‘out of control’ in UK, says British health secretary HancockHere’s how other countries have reacted to the threat of new virus strain:Netherlands: The European nation announced a ban on all UK passenger flights, which came into effect on Sunday and will last until January 1. The Dutch government said it will assess with other EU nations the “possibilities to contain the import of the virus” from the UK.Belgium: The government issued a flight ban for 24 hours starting at midnight and also halted train links to Britain. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo on Sunday said that he was issuing the flight ban “out of precaution.” “There are a great many questions about this new mutation and if it is not already on the mainland,” he said.Italy: Foreign minister Luigi di Maio said Italy plans to suspend flights to and from the UK over fears of the new strain of coronavirus. “As a government, we have the duty to protect Italians, for this reason, after having notified the British government, with the Ministry of Health we are about to sign the provision to suspend flights with Great Britain,” Di Maio wrote in a Facebook post.Germany: The German government is also reportedly mulling over the decision to ban flights from Britain as a high-ranking official told news agency dpa that restrictions on flights from the UK are “serious option.”Austria: The EU member has said that it would also ban flights from Britain, but no immediate details on the timing of the ban were announced, according to the Austrian news agency APA.Kuwait: The civil aviation authority of the Arab nation on Sunday added the UK to its high-risk list of countries, following instructions from the health authorities.

According to data provided by the Afghan Ministry of Defence, 82 Taliban terrorists were killed in the province earlier this week amid a sustained military operation.Afghanistan continues to be ravaged by violence and bomb blasts in spite of the ongoing peace negotiations between the government and the Taliban, which began this past September in Qatar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-troops-kill-74-taliban-terrorists-during-clashes-in-kandahar-province/story-HWsWWV5fNMLewy56RlLgkJ.html
20-12-2020||World||UK emergency Covid-19 lockdown heaps pressure on Brexit trade deal talks||Boris Johnson’s emergency virus lockdown is heaping last-minute pressure on negotiators as they race to reach a post-Brexit trade deal.Officials said the announcement has focused minds on bringing the talks to a conclusion within days. As the British prime minister was detailing the new restrictions for London and southeast England on Saturday, negotiators in Brussels were inching closer toward an agreement.People familiar with both sides’ positions said the talks are unlikely to wrap up on Sunday, but should do so before Christmas.Whether nine months of talks between the UK and European Union result in a trade accord will depend on the two sides bridging their disagreements over fishing, the last remaining major obstacle. But that is proving difficult: European countries with large fishing industries are resisting any further concessions proposed by the European Commission. Nevertheless, officials from both sides said the gap can still be bridged.“I think everybody wants a deal,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Sunday. “Unfortunately, the EU have put in some unreasonable demands” that don’t respect Britain’s 2016 referendum decision to leave the bloc, he told Sky News.Cost of failureFailure to reach a trade deal would mean the UK doing business with its largest and nearest commercial partner on terms set by the World Trade Organization -- meaning millions of businesses and consumers would face the cost and disruption of tariffs and quotas.The pandemic has heavily disrupted the post-Brexit trade talks since they started in March. Both chief negotiators were forced into isolation after displaying symptoms early in the process and for months the two sides could only talk by video link.“We do need to see that movement from the EU side and I very much hope that they make the steps that are necessary so that we can conclude a deal and then we can all look forward,” Hancock said. “We have got a huge amount to get through as a continent because there are very significant problems with this virus on the continent as well.”With most other major issues now settled, the entire deal now effectively depends on how much the EU is prepared to give up of its fishing catch in UK waters. While Britain was a member of the EU, the bloc controlled fishing rights through its Common Fisheries Policy, a system that Johnson argues penalized the UK’s domestic industry.Teams from the European Commission in Brussels held a second round of talks with national capitals on Saturday. The deliberations were tense and not straightforward, one EU diplomat said.EU’s offerAfter its discussions with member states on Friday, the Commission made an offer that would see the bloc lose around 25% of the current 650 million euros ($800 million) of fish it catches annually in British waters. The UK rejected it, and has been pushing for the EU to give up 60%, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.The EU also offered to reduced the phase-in period of the new arrangements to six years, after originally wanting 10. The UK rejected the offer of six and has proposed just three years.The British team feels it has the upper hand after making recent concessions on the other major roadblock, the level competitive playing field for businesses. But Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, made clear on Friday that access to the single market will be conditional on keeping UK fishing waters open to boats from the bloc.The talks could still break down. Despite the cautiously optimistic tone coming from negotiating room, one person familiar with the UK government’s position said a no-deal outcome remains the more likely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-emergency-covid-19-lockdown-heaps-pressure-on-brexit-trade-deal-talks/story-gfrHfJygGWCpwgutD8PoQI.html
20-12-2020||World||Airlines balk at refunds as UK tells travellers not to fly||British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. aren’t offering refunds to passengers who cancel year-end trips following new U.K. coronavirus rules, even as regulators investigate carriers’ earlier refusal to hand cash back to customers caught in lockdown.IAG SA-owned BA will grant ticket holders a voucher or let them switch to a later date, it said in an emailed statement. It said it will only refund fares if the airline cancels a flight, a policy echoed by Virgin Atlantic in a Twitter post.The refund issue ignited a firestorm when similar curbs were in place last month. The UK Competition and Markets Authority launched a probe last week into whether airlines violated consumer rights by failing to offer passengers their money back for flights they couldn’t lawfully take.“Some airlines like EasyJet have mostly been doing the right thing and offering refunds, while others like BA only offer the option of a voucher or a rebooking,” said Rory Boland, travel editor at consumer advocacy group Which?. “The CMA investigation is looking precisely into this, as the wording for Tier 4 restrictions indicates these are legal requirements, not guidance so you should be due a refund.”The latest travel rules took effect Sunday, less than a day after they were announced, catching many with holiday travel plans off-guard. London Heathrow airport was crowded after airlines largely kept to schedules and many ticket holders opted to fly.EasyJet Plc said it would offer refunds for those who stayed home. “We understand some customers may now need to change their flights.”On Twitter, passengers called out Ryanair Holdings Plc and Aer Lingus for refusing refunds.Aer Lingus will waive change fees up to two hours before departure, the IAG-owned airline said in a statement. Customers may be entitled to vouchers or refunds depending on fare type, it said.Irish discounter Ryanair didn’t respond to requests for comment.New StrainPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced the tightening on Saturday, in a bid to stamp out a fast-spreading mutation of the coronavirus that’s behind a rapid rise in cases in London. Movement in the capital and much of southeast England has been restricted, including getting on foreign flights.“People should carefully consider whether they need to travel abroad and follow the rules in their tier,” Johnson said. “Those in Tier 4 areas will not be permitted to travel abroad apart from limited exceptions, such as for work purposes.”The Dutch government on Sunday banned incoming flights carrying passengers from the U.K., saying samples showed the new virus strain had reached the Netherlands.Johnson made it clear that the policy is aimed at stemming holiday gatherings that could further spread the disease.While the flight restrictions will be similar to lockdown rules lifted earlier this month, the exceptions haven’t been clearly defined.People who live outside the area may transit through Tier 4, which includes Heathrow and Luton airports, “but you should carefully consider whether you need to do so,” according to advice on a government website.The rise of the new virus strain forced the government into an abrupt policy switch at the height of the Christmas travel season. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had assured the public last week that so-called travel corridors won’t be switched for two weeks to give people certainty about booking holidays.Some customers took to social media, with one Virgin Atlantic passenger saying he was unable to get through to make changes to a flight scheduled for Sunday.“While it is a really difficult position for the government, the fact is that a number of people have taken decisions to travel based on government advice in recent weeks,” Boland said. “People will understand why this decision had to be made, but be angry that it has been made so late in the day, leaving plans to see family in tatters and another fight for a refund on flights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airlines-balk-at-refunds-as-uk-tells-travellers-not-to-fly/story-WyH3p2kyrbHWOQ2V28R7cJ.html

20-12-2020||World||Biden’s options for Russian hacking punishment: sanctions, cyber retaliation||President-elect Joe Biden’s team will consider several options to punish Russia for its suspected role in the unprecedented hacking of US government agencies and companies once he takes office, from new financial sanctions to cyberattacks on Russian infrastructure, people familiar with the matter say.The response will need to be strong enough to impose a high economic, financial or technological cost on the perpetrators, but avoid an escalating conflict between two nuclear-armed Cold War adversaries, said one of the people familiar with Biden’s deliberations, speaking on condition of anonymity.The overarching goal of any action, which could also include stepped-up counter cyber espionage efforts, would be to create an effective deterrence and diminish the potency of future Russian cyber spying, the person said.The unfolding crisis - and the lack of visibility over the extent of the infiltration into the computer networks of federal agencies including the Treasury, Energy and Commerce Departments - will push to the front of Biden’s agenda when he takes office on Jan. 20.President Donald Trump only acknowledged the hacking on Saturday almost a week after it surfaced, downplaying its importance and questioning whether the Russians were to blame.The discussions among Biden’s advisers are theoretical at this point and will need to be refined once they are in office and have full view of US capabilities.Biden’s team will also need a better grasp of U.S. intelligence about the cyber breach before making any decisions, one of the people familiar with his deliberations said. Biden’s access to presidential intelligence briefings was delayed until about three weeks ago as Trump disputed the Nov. 3 election results.With Trump taking no action, Biden’s team are concerned that in the coming weeks the president-elect may be left with only one tool: bluster, according to one of the people familiar with his options.“They’ll be held accountable,” Biden said in an interview broadcast on CBS on Thursday when asked about how he would deal with the Russian-led hack. He vowed to impose “financial repercussions” on “individuals as well as entities.”TEST OF WORKING WITH ALLIESThe response could be an early test of the president-elect’s promise to cooperate and consult more effectively with US allies, as some proposals likely to be put before Biden could hit the financial interests or infrastructure of countries friendly to the United States, a person familiar with the matter said.“Symbolic won’t do it” for any US response, said James Andrew Lewis, a cyber security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “You want the Russians to know we’re pushing back”A spokeswoman for Biden’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment.The massive data breach, first reported by Reuters, enabled hackers believed to be from Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service to explore the networks of government agencies, private companies and think-tanks for months.Moscow has denied involvement.One potential target for US Treasury financial sanctions would be the SVR, said Edward Fishman, an Atlantic Council fellow who worked on Russia sanctions at the State Department during the Obama administration.Media reports have suggested the SVR-linked hacking group known as “Cozy Bear” or APT29 was responsible for the attacks. The United States, Britain and Canada in July accused https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-cyber/russia-trying-to-steal-covid-19-vaccine-data-say-uk-u-s-and-canada-idUSKCN24H236 “Cozy Bear” of trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine and treatment research from drug companies and academic institutions.“I would think, at the bare minimum, imposing sanctions against the SVR would be something that the U.S. government should consider,” Fishman said, noting that the move would be largely symbolic and not have a major economic impact. The US Treasury has already imposed financial sanctions on other Russian security services, the FSB and the GRU.Financial sanctions against Russian state companies and the business empires of Russian oligarchs linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin may be more effective, as they would deny access to dollar transactions, both Fishman and Lewis said.Those targets could include aluminum giant Rusal, which saw US sanctions lifted in 2018 after blacklisted Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska reduced his stake to a minority in a deal with the Treasury.Lewis said a stronger option could be to cut Russia off from the SWIFT international bank transfer and financial messaging system, a crippling move that would prevent Russian companies from processing payments to and from foreign customers.Such a move was contemplated in 2014 when Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, but it would hurt the Russian energy sector, complicating gas sales to Europe and hit European companies with Russian operations.Neither the Treasury nor State Department responded to questions about possible actions in response to the hacking.The Pentagon’s US Cyber Command likely has options for counter actions that could cripple Russian technology infrastructure, such as disrupting phone networks or denial of internet actions, Lewis said, adding that this too could hurt European allies.“They’ll need to think through the diplomacy of that,” Lewis said.The hackers likely left behind some malicious code that would let them access US systems for retaliation against any US cyber attack and it will take months to find and eliminate those “Easter eggs,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-s-options-for-russian-hacking-punishment-sanctions-cyber-retaliation/story-A73MWoX9qw38LBAEc1wjpO.html
20-12-2020||World||New variant makes Covid-19 ‘out of control’ in UK, flights banned||Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock on Sunday admitted that the coronavirus is out of control, hours after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a lockdown on London and southeast England, sparking fury by cancelling Christmas at short notice and some countries imposing flight bans.The Netherlands, Italy and Belgium have banned flights to and from the UK to prevent the new Covid-19 variant from entering the countries, as reports said other European countries were considering similar measures. The Eurostar from Belgium was also subject to restrictions.Scotland banned travellers from England, while Wales went into another lockdown as health officials tried to grapple with the new variant of the Covid-19 virus that is assessed to be up to 70% faster in transmission than the earlier strain - most evident in recent days in Kent.Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show whether the coronavirus is under control, Hancock said, “No, sadly”, adding that the situation now is “incredibly difficult”. The best gift that people could give for Christmas is to stay at home and not spread the virus, he said.Also Read: Unclear If US has UK Covid-19 mutation, says chief scientific adviser SlaouiLabour Party leader Keir Starmer said his party supported the latest restrictions, but he accused PM Johnson of “gross negligence” in failing to act earlier, adding that “alarm bells have been ringing for weeks but the prime minister chose to ignore” it.Hancock said it was on Friday that scientists showed ministers evidence of the “causality” between the new fast-transmitting variant and the spike in new cases in London and southeast England, which prompted the measures outlined by Johnson on Saturday.London and southeast England have been placed in the new Tier 4 of the alert system, which has varying curbs, from Tier 1 (lowest) to Tier 4 (toughest; equivalent to full lockdown). People are prohibited from travelling to and out of Tier 4.Also Read: Israelis returning from UK to be sent to quarantine hotelsHancock indicated in Sunday’s media interviews that London’s lockdown could last months, until vaccines are rolled out across the population. So far, 350,000 people have been received the first shots of their two-dose vaccine delivered by Pfizer-BioNTech.“There are no easy answers or easy options. I think the mistake would be to ignore new scientific evidence,” he added.London’s airports, train stations and roads were clogged on Saturday night as thousands tried to escape the new lockdown restrictions that came into effect early on Sunday. Scotland Yard said the police would enforce Tier 4 rules from Sunday.People’s fury at Christmas plans being cancelled was reflected in screaming newspaper headlines on Sunday and veteran Conservative MP Charles Walker calling on Hancock to resign, amid growing criticism in the ruling over party over handling of the virus situation.Hancock said he understood Walker’s frustrations, which he admitted are shared by millions of others, but he said he is focused on the job and “of course” will be staying in his position, adding, “I am dealing with a global pandemic in the best way I can...and we must take action, however uncomfortable we find it.”He said he is “very worried” about the health service’s capacity to deal with the current crisis, saying there are currently 18,000 Covid-19 patients in hospitals, just below the peak seen during the first wave in March and April.Also Read: Second Covid-19 vaccine authorized in US ships outScotland Yard commander Alex Murray said on Sunday, “I know Londoners will be deeply saddened by the news that the planned relaxation of the rules over the Christmas period has been scrapped. The news on the virus spread is stark and deeply concerning, and we must all now take immediate action to prevent the spread by staying at home and keeping ourselves safe.“Across the city, officers will be deployed to take action against those people whose selfish action risks jeopardising the health of Londoners. Likewise, we will continue our joint enforcement with London’s 32 local authorities – clamping down on those businesses that also flout the rules and put health at risk.”Murray warned, “Our fight against the virus is not over. The rules are very clear and our collective actions in the next two weeks will have a direct impact on how quickly our city will recover. If people ignore these new rules, make reckless decisions that risk lives, I make no apology for the subsequent enforcement action that will follow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-is-out-of-control-in-uk-says-british-health-secretary-hancock/story-2JJD1kFTKVJSAKstAw7cEL.html
20-12-2020||World||What you can and cannot do in Tier 4 areas after new Covid-19 variant threat in UK||The United Kingdom on Saturday introduced a new tier - Tier 4 - for certain areas, including London, after rapid transmission of a new variant of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). During a televised briefing, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that there is no evidence to suggest that the new strain is more lethal or causes more severe illness. The government has alerted the World Health Organisation (WHO) regarding the issue and, meanwhile, it has introduced new restrictions in the most affected areas.London, parts of the South East and the East of England, which were under Tier 3 restrictions, have been moved to Tier 4. The new restrictions took effect from Sunday morning. Tier 4 is basically ‘stay at home’ order for areas under it. The government said that these rules will not be relaxed for Christmas. According to the new guidance, the police can take action against the violators, which includes breaking up illegal gatherings and issuing fines. The police can issue a fixed penalty notice of £200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of £6,400.What you can and cannot do in areas under Tier 4?People living in Tier 4 zone cannot meet other people indoors unless they live together or they are part of any existing support bubble.The government has ordered people living in those areas to must not leave or be outside of their home except for where they have a specific purpose or a ‘reasonable excuse’. You cannot leave home for holidays or stays overnight away from your main home unless permitted by law. You can leave home for essential activities, work and volunteering, fulfilling legal obligations, education and childcare, medical reasons, exercise and recreation.You can travel outside the Tier 4 area for work, education, caring responsibilities, visiting a hospital.

Without revealing his name, Obama said the family got to spend some time with him as he got stuck because of the Covid-19 situation and eventually he spent the early quarantine period with the Obama family. According to The Independent, Obama shared these details during an appearance on The Bill Simmons Podcast.Explaining how enjoyable it was to spend quarantine time with the family, he said now Malia and Sasha are at that stage where they want to spend time with their parents. “It’s a blessing because all the teenage stuff is kinda gone now and they’re just back and they love you again and they want to spend time with you and they’re funny,” he said, according to The Independent.The former president also revealed how he spent time teaching the kids and Malia’s boyfriend some spades games.“He’s British, wonderful young man, and he was sort of stuck because there was a whole visa thing and he had a job set up. So we took him in and I didn’t want to like him, but he’s a good kid,” Obama said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/didn-t-want-to-like-him-says-obama-on-daughter-malia-s-british-boyfriend/story-FFwIwJP9XzM1qjcfDtuaQM.html
20-12-2020||World||The coronavirus pandemic exposes the vulnerability of Italy’s ‘new poor’||The coronavirus pandemic did not produce Elena Simone’s first budgetary rough patch. The 49-year-old single mother found herself out of the job market when the 2008 global financial crisis hit Italy and never fully got back in, but she created a patchwork of small jobs that provided for herself and the youngest of her three children.That all changed with Italy’s first Covid-19 lockdown in the spring.With schools closed, so went Simone’s cafeteria job. Her house cleaning gigs dried up, too. While others returned to work when the lockdown ended, Simone stayed frozen out.“There was a period when I was only eating carrots,’’ she recalled from her kitchen decorated with colourful plush characters shaped like vegetables.For the first time in her life, Simone needed help putting food on the table. At a friend’s urging, she enrolled for access to the food stores operated by Roman Catholic charity Caritas. Her eligibility covers her through January, and she hopes to be off the charity rolls by then “to make room for people who need it even more.”The charity serving more than 5 million people in the Milan archdiocese, Caritas Ambrosiana, says the pandemic is revealing for the first time the depths of economic insecurity in Italy’s northern Lombardy region, which generates 20% of the country’s gross domestic product.Simone, who has two adult children and a 10-year-old son at home, is typical of Italy’s new poor. These are people who managed to get by after the 2008 financial crisis, staying off the radar of Italy’s welfare system by relying on informal, gray-market jobs and the help of friends and family.But between Italy’s near-total spring lockdown, the introduction of a partial lockdown when the virus surged again in the fall and the continued toll the pandemic is taking on Italy’s economy, the slim threads that allowed people to weave together employment have snapped.Nowhere in Italy is this more evident than in Lombardy, where Covid-19 first exploded in Europe. Italian agriculture lobby Coldiretti estimates that the virus has created 300,000 newly poor people, based on surveys of the dozens of charity groups operating in the region.Caritas Ambrosiana provided help to 9,000 people during the spring lockdown, 20% of whom reported that their financial situation had “drastically” worsened over the 10-week closure. In October, nearly 700 families requested food aid for the first time.Nationally, one-third of all people seeking help from Caritas during the pandemic are first-time recipients, and in a reversal of usual trends, most are Italians and not foreign residents.More than 40 organizations provide food on a daily basis in Milan, Italy’s financial capital. One of the largest, Pane Quotidiano, serves some 3,500 meals a day. Many of those in need once worked in restaurants and hotels, which have been particularly penalized by the coronavirus restrictions, or as domestic help.“It is even more widespread than we knew, especially for a rich city like Milan,’’ Caritas Ambrosiana spokesman Francesco Chiavarini said. “These precarious jobs were lost. And we don’t know when or if they will be restored.”Researchers at Milan’s Bocconi University said in a working paper for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that blue-collar workers without college degrees paid the heaviest price for Italy’s virus restrictions. Half reported a drop in their salaries, compared with just 20% of the top earners, and many did not have the luxury of working remotely.“What we are seeing is a substantial increase in inequality,’’ Bocconi University researcher Vincenzo Galasso said.Those without solid job contracts are the most exposed in the pandemic that has already killed over 68,000 people in Italy, the highest death toll in Europe.Simone discovered too late that her cafeteria contract described her as an occasional worker, meaning she had no basis to request government support to replace lost income. Her cleaning jobs were off the books altogether, and she has recovered only two of the dozen she held before the pandemic.Even when workers qualify for Italy’s public-private short-term layoff scheme, the money has arrived late and is generally inadequate to cover a family’s basic expenses, Chiavarini said. Basic coverage is 400 euros ($490) a month, yet monthly rents in a city like Milan start around 600 euros ($735).Food security is emerging as a key issue as the pandemic enters winter.Progetto Arca, which runs shelters and provides other social services in Milan, started operating a food truck last month after seeing that homeless people who had filled their stomachs with restaurant and bar handouts were going hungry during the partial fall lockdown when many establishments had closed.And isn’t just the homeless coming by the food truck. On a recent night, a well-dressed man in a quilted jacket and dress trousers waited off to the side until the line had dissipated. He identified himself as a lawyer but declined further comment and asked not to be photographed as he took away two hot meals and two bags of food for the next day, one for his companion waiting at home.So far, government moratoriums on evictions and the firing of contracted workers have helped keep a cap on what charity workers see as an emerging poverty crisis.“When these are lifted, we will see the real price that we need to pay for this pandemic,’’ Chiavarini said. “We celebrate Milan as the capital of innovation, but beneath these skyscrapers of which we are so proud, there is a hidden world where people are living in conditions of real precariousness. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-coronavirus-pandemic-exposes-the-vulnerability-of-italy-s-new-poor/story-LSDth26Wk2IYyn6QUUREnI.html

Opinion polls show some two-thirds of the public want to follow suit.The Justice Ministry said that, at its request, Facebook took down four groups at the weekend that had disseminated texts, photographs and videos with “deliberately mendacious content designed to mislead about coronavirus vaccines”.Such “fake news” included arguments that vaccines would be used to plant government tracking chips in recipients’ bodies, to poison them and thus cull the population or to subject them to medical experimentation, the ministry said in a statement.A Facebook spokeswoman confirmed that four Hebrew-language groups had been taken down as part of the company’s policy against “spreading misinformation regarding the vaccines”.Israeli officials say the country has enough vaccines on order by year’s end to protect the most vulnerable 20% of the population and then lift some coronavirus curbs, but worry that turnout might be dampened if people get false information about the innoculations.Israel began administering vaccines to medical staff on Sunday. At Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, dozens of doctors and nurses danced as they prepared to receive their injections.Next in line are elderly Israelis or those in high-risk groups. The wider adult population is slated to get shots in early 2021.With a population of 9 million, Israel has logged 373,368 coronavirus cases and 3,074 deaths. It has imposed two national lockdowns and is mulling new curbs on high-contagion areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-govt-says-facebook-removed-anti-vaccine-fake-news-on-request/story-SDRKcyZrPKSyWPj525t0RM.html

20-12-2020||World||Pushed over the edge, PM Oli drops a bombshell on rivals that also hurts China||A little less than three years after he took oath as prime minister for the second time, Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli on Sunday morning dropped a bombshell on his rivals in the ruling Nepal Communist Party. PM Oli’s cabinet recommended dissolution of the 275-member House of Representatives that was elected in 2017 when the opposition Nepali Congress suffered a landslide defeat in the polls.PM Oli’s surprise move on Sunday sent his rivals within the ruling Nepal Communist Party running for cover, arguing that Nepal’s constitution did not have a provision for dissolving Parliament by the Prime Minister of a majority government.Bishnu Rijal, a central committee member of the ruling Nepal Communist Party said instead of seeking a compromise within the party, PM Oli had chosen to dissolve Parliament. “The prime minister has lost the majority in the parliamentary party, central committee and the secretariat of the party,” he said, according to a Reuters report.ALSO WATCH | ‘Learn from Sri Lanka’: CDS Gen Bipin Rawat cautions Nepal on ties with ChinaPresident Bidya Devi Bhandari has accepted the recommendation and announced national elections in two phases to be held on 30 April and 10 May.Also Read: PM Oli races to get new anti-graft watchdog boss, heads for a showdown with PrachandaPeople familiar with the matter said PM Oli’s move to dissolve Parliament, would give him a free hand to run the government and split the party formed in 2018 by the merger of his Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal- Maoist Centre.For months, Prachanda had been trying to pin PM Oli down and had led several rounds of revolts against the prime minister demanding a greater say in the government. PM Oli, who had led them to victory on the basis of a nationalist agenda, however, had refused to cede any space and dropped enough hints that he was prepared to split the communist party if he was pushed to the wall.This is an eventuality that China’s communist party had been struggling to avoid for months.Beijing had deputed its envoy to Nepal Hou Yanqi to hold a series of meetings in late April and early May - around the same time that China’s soldiers were crossing the line in east Ladakh - to hold consultations with Nepal’s communist leaders to get them to stay united.Ambassador Hou continued her interventions to keep the NCP in one piece over the next few months. But PM Oli’s camp soon enough figured that China was okay with ruling NCP giving PM Oli the pink slip if this is what it would take to avoid a split in the party.PM Oli, who had spent 14 years in jail for opposing the now-abolished monarchy in the 1970s and 1980s, wasn’t ready to fade into oblivion yet.Nepal watchers said China, which initially seemed to back 68-year-old Oli, had changed tack earlier this year and was willing to sacrifice him if it would help keep the NCP united.Ambassador Hou Yanqi was working on this pitch when last month, PM Oli is believed to have told her off, suggesting that he is capable of handling challenges within his party without any assistance from other countries.The Chinese envoy didn’t exactly back off but her subsequent interventions were done quietly. When meeting politicians from the ruling party, she would move around in unmarked cars or taxis in Kathmandu, said a Nepal watcher.“There were two other formulas that the Chinese envoy continued to work on,” a person who tracks developments in Nepal politics said. Apart from negotiating a format where the NCP’s former prime minister Dahal and Madhav Nepal hold the strings of power minus PM Oli, Ambassador Hou also explored the possibility of the NCP shunting out PM Oli and promoting Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam instead.Since Bamdev Gautam comes from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) that PM Oli headed before the 2018 merger, it was expected that this would minimise the damage that PM Oli could wreak on the party in case of a split. The fourth option that the Chinese envoy did explore was the possibility that the senior leadership of the NCP let the next generation leaders of the party who would be more amenable to a negotiated settlement take charge, a Nepal watcher said.PM Oli’s Sunday surprise, however, upended the Chinese efforts as well.Oli aide Rajan Bhattarai said the prime minister had made the move due to the backlash against him from his party, which had also asked him to consider quitting as its president.“So he decided to face the people in an election,” Bhattarai told Reuters. “This is the best way in a democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-oli-s-surprise-upends-his-rivals-plans-and-china-s-4-options/story-ttGgtv5Zn86mbUxY16D5VM.html
20-12-2020||World||US Congress poised to vote on $900 bn Covid aid package after Fed compromise||The US Congress appeared poised to vote on Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus aid package after senators struck a late-night compromise to clear one of the final hurdles, a dispute over Federal Reserve pandemic lending authorities.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the US Capitol late on Saturday night: “If things continue on this path and nothing gets in the way, we’ll be able to vote tomorrow.”Congressional leaders plan to attach the coronavirus aid package, which includes $600 direct payments to individuals and a $300 per week unemployment compensation supplement, to a $1.4 trillion spending bill funding government programs through September 2021.But they face a new government funding deadline of midnight on Sunday (0500 GMT Monday), risking a government shutdown without action.US President Donald Trump, whose administration has largely left negotiations up to congressional leaders, complained early on Sunday morning that a deal had not been reached. “Why isn’t Congress giving our people a Stimulus Bill? It wasn’t their fault, it was the fault of China,” Trump said on Twitter. “GET IT DONE, and give them more money in direct payments.”Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, had insisted on language that would guarantee that the central bank could not revive emergency lending programs for small businesses and state and local governments after Dec. 31, when they expire under the CARES Act Covid-19 relief legislation passed in March. Republicans had said the programs are an unnecessary government interference in private business that politicizes the Fed. They accused Democrats of seeking to extend them into 2021 as a backdoor way to provide unchecked funds for state and local governments controlled by members of their party.Democrats in turn accused the Republicans of trying to tie the Fed’s hands in order to limit Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s options for boosting the flagging economy after he takes office on Jan. 20. LANGUAGE DIFFERENCESToomey spokesman Steve Kelly said the senator’s agreement with Schumer “rescinds more than $429 billion in unused CARES Act funds; definitively ends the CARES Act lending facilities by December 31, 2020; stops these facilities from being restarted; and forbids them from being duplicated without congressional approval.”But a senior Democratic aide said Toomey had agreed to “drop the broad language in his proposal that would have prevented the Fed chair from establishing similar facilities in the future.”The Senate adjourned a rare Saturday session with a call from Republican leader Mitch McConnell to avoid last-minute disagreements that could delay new funding for Americans and small businesses.After news of a compromise on the Fed issue, McConnell spokesman Doug Andres said: “Now that Democrats have agreed to a version of Senator Toomey’s important language, we can begin closing out the rest of the package to deliver much-needed relief to families, workers, and businesses.”In the 11 months since the first cases of the new coronavirus were documented in the United States, Covid-19 has killed 311,000 Americans, by far the most in the world, and put millions out of work, with unemployment rising. Economists say growth will likely remain sluggish until vaccines are widely available in mid-2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-poised-to-vote-on-900-bn-covid-aid-package-after-fed-compromise/story-UBnnXUV9u8zrlfRKNpoSnK.html

20-12-2020||World||Canada: Covid-19 infections tally tops half-a-million mark even as vaccination is underway||While almost 12,000 Canadians have already received shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, worries remain across the country as the nationwide tally of coronavirus infections have now crossed the grim half-a-million mark.Canada reported 501,189 confirmed cases by Saturday evening, with the total number of fatalities from the deadly respiratory disease rising to 14,154. The country has lately been reporting more than 6,500 single-day infections.The number of persons getting the vaccine continues to rise, with the latest tally at 11,909. The initial batch of inoculations is covering the most vulnerable groups, including residents of long-term care homes and health care workers.Canada gave emergency authorisation to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine earlier this month, but won’t immediately follow the United States in granting approval to Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, which has received the US drug regulator’s nod. The Moderna vaccine is under review and Health Canada said in a statement, “There is still information and data to be provided by Moderna for review.” The agency said, “Health Canada is working hard to give Canadians access to Covid-19 vaccines as quickly as possible and will not compromise its safety, efficacy and quality standards.”All the provinces have now received shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.As for the pandemic situation in the country, federal projections say the peak may not yet have arrived; and the Christmas celebrations and gatherings - though understated this year - could contribute to a spike of over 20% in cases per day by January. Canada’s chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, noted in a statement that it “underscores that the partnership between public health and the public at large is still vitally important to bringing down the infection rate”.The current numbers, she warned, have put the country “on a trajectory for a strong resurgence for the next two months”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-covid-19-infections-tally-tops-half-a-million-mark-even-as-vaccination-is-underway/story-lNWNEZgbC8F6oZ1GupZ4zJ.html

In Europe, a million new cases were recorded over just five days, with Russia and France reporting more than 2 million cases since the coronavirus outbreak began. The United Kingdom and Italy both have approximately 1.9 million cases each.The United States became the first country in the world to record more than 300,000 deaths on Monday. The nation is reporting more than 2,500 deaths daily, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the previous seven days.Hospitals across the United States have begun giving the first shots of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine.The United States remains the country with most cases - more than 17 million since the outbreak started - followed by India and Brazil respectively.

A statement issued by Trudeau’s office said, “With the end of the first five years approaching, it is now time to provide longer-term certainty on the price of pollution out to 2030.”This has sparked dismay in Canada’s agriculture industry. The industry journal Western Producer noted that this “represents a 465% increase in Canada’s default carbon tax rate in less than 10 years”.“The increase could cost western Canadian farmers millions of dollars a year in extra taxes and increase costs for heating farm buildings, drying grain, moving commodities by rail and buying essential farm inputs, such as fertiliser and machinery,” it surmised.It quoted the general manager of the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan Duane Haave as saying, “This would be a major hit to farm margins and viability.”“What do we do when we have jeopardised farms in Canada with a $170 per tonne carbon tax and my neighbour 60 miles to the south of me in North Dakota pays nothing?” Campbell asked.“How can I compete? How will I be able to stay in business?”Bill Campbell, president of Keystone Agricultural Producers in the province of Manitoba, said, “What do we do when we have jeopardised farms in Canada with a $170 per tonne carbon tax and my neighbour 60 miles to the south of me (in North Dakota) pays nothing? How can I compete? How will I be able to stay in business?”Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association president Gunter Jochum echoed the sentiment, “I can’t believe that our federal government would put a crippling tax on small businesses and farmers.” Associations of farmers have also warned that this will lead to an increase in prices of groceries for all Canadians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-farmers-outraged-over-pm-justin-trudeau-s-move-to-hike-carbon-taxes/story-JbsdYunmEhKTS0TZK87G8O.html
20-12-2020||World||Israel begins virus inoculation drive as infections surge||Israel on Sunday began its coronavirus inoculation drive, aiming to vaccinate some 60,000 people a day in a bid to stamp out the illness that is once again surging among its population.The country will first immunize health workers, followed by the elderly, high-risk Israelis and those over 60 years old. Israel says it has secured sufficient doses for much of the country’s 9 million people from both Pfizer and Moderna, whose vaccine US authorities approved this week for emergency use.With public opinion polls showing many Israelis are reluctant to receive shots right away, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would set a “personal example” and insisted on being the first Israeli vaccinated. He received the shot Saturday night.Netanyahu expressed confidence in the vaccine before rolling up the right sleeve of his black, short-sleeve shirt and receiving the injection. He called it an “exciting moment” that would put Israel on the path to returning to its normal routines. The country’s health minister also received the vaccine Saturday.Israel has an agreement with Pfizer to secure 8 million doses of the US pharmaceutical company’s vaccine — enough to cover nearly half of Israel’s population since each person requires two doses. Israel reached a separate agreement with Moderna earlier this month to purchase 6 million doses of its vaccine — enough for another 3 million Israelis.With daily infection numbers trending upward and currently notching just under 3,000 a day, Israeli leaders are again debating whether to impose a third national lockdown since the pandemic began. Many restrictions remain in place from the country’s second lockdown in the fall, with most hotels still shuttered and restaurants open only for delivery and take out. Unemployment remains in the double digits.Israel has had mixed results in its fight against the virus. Netanyahu was lauded in the spring for sealing borders and locking down the country swiftly, a move that battered the economy but drove down infection rates.But a hasty and erratic reopening sent confirmed cases soaring in late summer, leading to what at the time was one of the world’s worst outbreaks.Israel has reported more than 368,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,000 virus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-begins-virus-inoculation-drive-as-infections-surge/story-nmEOsxdy02IliOm7Jt6DmN.html

The recommendation was cleared at an emergency meeting of the cabinet convened by PM Oli on Sunday morning.“Today’s Cabinet meeting decided to recommend the President to dissolve the Parliament,” said Barshaman Pun, energy minister in PM Oli’s cabinet announced in Kathmandu after the meeting.The surprise move comes at a time PM Oli was under intense pressure from the rival factions of the NCP led by former prime ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal better known by his nom de guerre Prachanda and Madhav Nepal.Also Read: PM Oli races to get new anti-graft watchdog boss, heads for a showdown with PrachandaPM Oli had last evening met President Bidya Devi Bhandari at her official residence ‘Shital Niwas’, one of the many meetings that he held on Saturday as he tried to convince his rivals to back down.The dissolution of parliament - he will continue to head the interim government - is seen as a precursor to a split in the party that had been piling pressure on him to withdraw an ordinance that his government had issued on Tuesday to give himself power to make crucial appointments.On Wednesday, the party’s standing committee had passed a resolution that asked PM Oli to withdraw the ordinance. He had agreed to comply at the committee’s meeting but later had other thoughts.On Saturday, PM Oli drove down to Prachanda’s house for one more attempt to reconcile their differences, offering to withdraw the ordinance if the political document that was sharply critical of him was also withdrawn. People familiar with the matter said PM Oli told Prachanda that they needed to work together and find a way out of the crisis. But Prachanda did not budge.PM Oli took the call soon after. He is learnt to have sounded out Home minister Ram Bahadur Thapa, who is seen to be close to Prachanda, and sought his support in dissolving the House.At his meeting with President Bhandari that continued till midnight, Nepal watchers said PM Oli was advised against taking such a drastic action. But PM Oli had made up his mind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-pm-oli-springs-a-surprise-on-detractors-dissolves-parliament/story-eUa1HK4to31fOCUrKd5bVK.html

It was not immediately clear when a snap election would be called if, as expected, Nepal’s president accepts the cabinet request.Opposition lawmaker Gagan Thapa of the Nepali Congress said on Twitter the cabinet decision was “unconstitutional and undemocratic”. He did not explain.After his 2017 win, Oli had vowed to fight corruption and poverty but made little progress, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic hammered the poor Himalayan country’s tourism-dependent economy.Infections of the virus that causes the disease have reached 253,184 with 1,777 COVID-19 deaths in the country of 30 million people.Sandwiched between China and India, Nepal is also influenced by the priorities of the giant neighbours keen on expanding their say in the strategically placed country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/recommendation-to-dissolve-nepal-parliament-made-in-emergency-meeting-called-by-pm-kp-sharma-oli-sent-to-president-says-minister/story-MSGC9W6Sy8owJUQ12Ubf1N.html

I measured his level of immunity, and he is good to go,” Fauci declared.“He can come down the chimney, he can leave the presents ... you have nothing to worry about.”Fauci’s good news comes as countries around the world are experiencing a surge in Covid-19 cases, with millions in England and Italy preparing to celebrate the holiday under tough “stay at home” orders.The United States, the country that has seen the most deaths linked to Covid-19, launched its mass vaccination campaign this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinates-santa-clause-myself-fauci-tells-children-he-is-good-to-go/story-YyXI7cWskInGMgFdkCeyCO.html

The Covid-19 vaccine has been authorised for use on people aged 18 years and older, and has joined Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine, already being administered since Monday, on the front lines of the battle against the virus.“There is much we still do not know about Sars-CoV-2 and Covid-19,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the most respected voice in the US on the pandemic and the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). “However, we do know that this vaccine is safe and can prevent symptomatic Covid-19 and severe disease.”The US regulator granted EUA to the vaccine a day after an advisory board of outside experts had cleared it. Its distribution awaits one more clearance, from the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is expected shortly.Also Read: US issues guidelines on Covid-19 vaccination after allergic reactionsThe country on Friday set yet another grim record by registering 249,709 new coronavirus cases, the highest recorded single-day spike in infections since the pandemic began, based on an update by the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

20-12-2020||World||US issues guidelines on Covid-19 vaccination after allergic reactions||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Saturday said it was monitoring reports of allergic reactions to the Covid-19 vaccination and made recommendations on how people with histories of allergies should proceed. Anyone who had a severe reaction to a Covid-19 vaccine should not get the second dose, the agency said, defining severe as needing the medication epinephrine or treatment in a hospital.People who have had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in a Covid-19 vaccine should avoid the vaccine formulation containing the ingredient, CDC said. Two vaccines have been approved in the United States under emergency use authorizations.Individuals with histories of severe allergic reaction to vaccines should consult their doctors about the Covid-19 shot. The CDC said people with severe allergies to food, pets, latex or environmental conditions as well as people with allergies to oral medication or a family history of severe allergic reactions could still get vaccinated. The US Food and Drug Administration is investigating around five allergic reactions that happened after people were administered Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine in the United States this week.On Friday, the FDA said that the Moderna Inc vaccine, which received emergency use authorization, should not be given to individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction to any components of the shot.Britain’s medical regulator has said that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reactions to a medicine or food, should not be given the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-issues-guidelines-on-covid-19-vaccination-after-allergic-reactions/story-ki6jpQ9StvKl7KtpUCfYYN.html
20-12-2020||World||Covid testing expanded in Sydney’s northern beaches amid cluster||Health authorities expanded testing for the coronavirus in Sydney to help contain a growing Covid-19 outbreak in the city’s Northern Beaches area. There are more than 300 Covid-19 testing locations across New South Wales, the state’s health department said in a Twitter post on Sunday. Premier Gladys Berejiklian, Minister for Health Brad Hazzard and other officials are scheduled to hold a press briefing at 11am Sunday.“It is absolutely vital everyone immediately comes forward for testing if they have even the slightest of Covid-19 symptoms,” New South Wales Health said.Restrictions will be imposed across Sydney to arrest a growing coronavirus outbreak that’s disrupting interstate travel and scuppered the nation’s premier yacht race.Authorities in New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, will limit gatherings in homes and entertainment venues from midnight Sunday after 30 community-acquired Covid-19 cases were recorded in the 24 hours through 8 p.m. Saturday, state Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.At least 28 of the new cases were linked to a growing cluster of infections in the city’s Northern Beaches area that stands at 66. Twenty-three community-acquired Covid-19 cases were reported the day before, prompting at least three states to impose restrictions or border measures on travelers from Sydney to prevent the coronavirus spreading ahead of Australians gathering to celebrate the Christmas holiday season.“Whilst the numbers are higher today than yesterday, the one positive is we still have not seen evidence of massive seeding outside of the Northern Beaches community,” Berejiklian said. “And our aim, of course, is to keep that in place.”The new outbreak caused the cancellation of the 2020 Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race. The 76-year-old race is the country’s most prestigious yachting event and was scheduled to start from Sydney on Dec. 26.Household gatherings in metropolitan Sydney will be limited to 10 visitors until at least 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 23, the New South Wales Health department said.Indoor settings including hospitality venues and places of worship will be limited to one person per 4 square meters (43 square feet), with a maximum of 300 people. Singing and chanting at indoor venues will also be barred.Stay at home orders for residents in the Northern Beaches Local Government area will also continue until midnight Wednesday.“We realize the effect this will have on residents and venues, and hope to lift the cap and restrictions as soon as possible,” Berejiklian said. “But we must take this action now to ensure we keep on top of this outbreak.”Australia’s New South Wales recorded 30 new coronavirus cases overnight on Sunday, the state’s Premier Gladys Berejiklian said, as an outbreak in the city’s northern beaches suburbs continues to grow.Of the new cases, 28 were directly linked to the cluster in the suburbs and two were under investigation, Berejiklian said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-testing-expanded-in-sydney-s-northern-beaches-amid-cluster/story-zEQcTJTlZNjsMoAzGVZYRJ.html
20-12-2020||World||Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu joins world leaders getting Covid-19 vaccine||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was vaccinated against the coronavirus on live television Saturday, becoming the first Israeli and one of the world’s leaders to be inoculated.Israel is set to begin vaccinating its health workers and nursing home residents beginning Sunday. Netanyahu said he wanted to be the country’s first recipient to set a personal example and to encourage Israelis to get the shot. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was vaccinated Friday in a similar attempt to boost public confidence in Covid-19 vaccines.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“I believe in this vaccine,” he said before receiving the injection of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at the Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv. Netanyahu rolled up the right sleeve of his black, short-sleeve shirt and waited for several minutes before receiving the injection. He called it an “exciting moment” that would put Israel on the path to returning to its normal routines.The event also gave Netanyahu, who has come under heavy public criticism for his management of the coronavirus crisis, a political boost as the country appears to be heading to its fourth election in just two years.Netanyahu’s coalition government with his rival, Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz, has been plagued by paralysis and dysfunction since taking office in May and will automatically collapse on Tuesday, if it cannot pass a budget. That would trigger a new election three months from now.After receiving his shot, Netanyahu was placed in observation for half an hour to monitor for possible allergic reactions. He told reporters afterwards that he was determined to lead the country out of the coronavirus crisis.Israel’s health minister, Yuli Edelstein, also was vaccinated Saturday. Other Israeli leaders, including the figurehead president and military chief, were expected to follow suit on Sunday along with frontline healthcare workers. The vaccination campaign is set to expand to the broader public in the coming weeks.Netanyahu has said the government has secured sufficient doses for Israel’s 9 million people from both Pfizer and Moderna, whose vaccine U.S. authorities approved this week for emergency use.But polls have shown that many Israelis are reluctant to receive shots right away.Also Read: Covid vaccine can turn people into ‘crocodiles’: Brazilian President BolsonaroIsrael has had mixed results in its fight against the virus. Netanyahu was lauded in the spring for sealing borders and locking down the country swiftly, a move that battered the economy but drove down infection rates.But a hasty and erratic reopening sent confirmed cases soaring in late summer, leading to what at the time was one of the world’s worst outbreaks. A second nationwide lockdown has only been partially lifted since then amid a new surge in daily reported cases. Unemployment remains in the double digits.Israel has reported more than 366,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,000 virus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. The country currently is recording nearly 3,000 new cases a day, and officials have begun debating the possibility of a third nationwide lockdown to bring the outbreak under control.As Netanyahu spoke about his vaccine experience, hundreds of protesters stood outside the prime minister’s official residence in Jerusalem calling for his resignation. Protesters, who have been gathering there weekly for over six months, say Netanyahu should not be prime minister when he is on trial on corruption charges. They also accuse him of bungling the coronavirus crisis.Struggling to beat back the virus and watching his popularity plummet, Netanyahu has for months seen vaccinations as the key to bringing an end to the havoc wrought by the virus.Israel has an agreement with Pfizer to secure 8 million doses of the U.S. pharmaceutical company’s vaccine — enough to cover nearly half of Israel’s population since each person requires two doses. Netanyahu had personally reached out multiple times to Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla, boasting that at one point he was able to reach the CEO at 2 a.m.He thanked Bourla on Saturday and called the Pfizer chief “my new personal friend.”Israel has mobile vaccination units with refrigerators that can keep the Pfizer shots at the required minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 F). Israel reached a separate agreement with Moderna earlier this month to purchase 6 million doses of its vaccine — enough for another 3 million Israelis. Officials expect to be able to administer over 60,000 doses a day.The vaccination rollout comes at an opportune time for Netanyahu, whose Likud Party has been weakened in public opinion polls in recent months and faces a challenge from a new faction led by a former Likud lawmaker. If the country is plunged into a new election campaign, a widespread vaccination drive might reverse the long-serving leader’s political fortunes.“This was a small injection for one man, but a great step for all of our health,” he quipped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-joins-world-leaders-getting-covid-19-vaccine/story-2xhXug7ZUsWEuWdhPkIFgN.html
20-12-2020||World||Joe Biden introduces his climate team, says ‘no time to waste’||President-elect Joe Biden on Saturday rolled out an environmental team that he hopes will steer America toward greater action to curb climate change and protect the nation’s air and water.“We literally have no time to waste,” Biden told reporters as introduced his choices.Biden compared the climate threat to the calamity of the coronavirus pandemic and he pledged to take action.“Folks, we’re in a crisis,” Biden said. “Just like we need a unified national response to Covid-19, we need a unified national response to climate change. We need to meet the moment with the urgency it demands as we would during any national emergency.”The approach is a shift from Donald Trump’s presidency, which has been marked by efforts to boost oil and gas production while rolling back government efforts intended to safeguard the environment. The incoming Biden team will try to undo or block many of the current administration’s initiatives. There also will be an emphasis on looking out for the low-income, working class and minority communities hit hardest by fossil fuel pollution and climate change.Also Read: Joe Biden’s transition team expresses concern over tensions with Defense DepartmentIn his remarks, Biden stressed the diversity of an emerging team that he described as “brilliant, qualified, tested and barrier-busting.”“Already there are more people of color in our Cabinet than any Cabinet ever,” said the former vice president, who has promised to assemble a group of department leaders who reflect the diversity of America.If confirmed by the Senate, New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland would be the first Native American to lead the Interior Department, which has wielded influence over the nation’s tribes for generations. Former two-term Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm is in line to be energy secretary.North Carolina official Michael Regan would be the first African American man to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Regan, the state environmental head since 2017, has made a name for himself by pursuing cleanups of industrial toxins and helping the low-income and minority communities significantly affected by pollution.Also Read: President Trump signs bill that could remove Chinese stocks from USBiden’s nominee to oversee the Council on Environmental Quality is Brenda Mallory.

20-12-2020||World||Alarm over new Covid-19 variant puts London in lockdown||Rapid transmission of a newly-discovered variant of Covid-19 in London and nearby areas prompted UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday to put the capital under similar restrictions that were imposed under the national lockdown in November, while relaxations allowed for Christmas have been cancelled.The new variant, he said, was no less lethal than the original version and there is no evidence that a vaccine is less effective against it; but he added that there is much that is not known about it. The World Health Organization has been informed of the development.Johnson announced the creation of a new tier – Tier 4 – in the Covid-19 alert system, under which towns and areas in England are placed. London has been in the top Tier 3 with the toughest restrictions, but has gone further in the lockdown-like Tier 4. The curbs take effect from Sunday morning until December 30.Johnson said in a televised briefing from Downing Street, “There is still much we don’t know. While we are fairly certain the variant is transmitted more quickly, there is no evidence to suggest that it is more lethal or causes more severe illness. Equally there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine will be any less effective against the new variant.“Our experts will continue their work to improve our understanding of the variant. So we are learning more about this variant as we go. But we know enough already to be sure that we must act now.“First, we will introduce new restrictions in the most affected areas – specifically those parts of London, the South East and the East of England which are currently in tier 3. These areas will enter a new tier 4, which will be broadly equivalent to the national restrictions which were in place in England in November.”Life under Tier 4 in London and southeast England from Sunday morning will be similar to the lockdown, which includes people staying at home, unless moving out for exemptions allowed; non-retail shops, gyms and leisure facilities to close; work from home; people must not travel out of Tier 4 areas.Health secretary announced the discovery of the variant in parliament on Monday, while Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, gave more details of the variant identified by Public Health England’s genomic surveillance. According to Whitty, this is a “critical and dangerous moment”.Whitty added, “As a result of the rapid spread of the new variant, preliminary modelling data and rapidly rising incidence rates in the southeast, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) now considers that the new strain can spread more quickly.“We have alerted the WHO and are continuing to analyse the available data to improve our understanding. There is no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments, although urgent work is underway to confirm this.”Johnson said Christmas this year “will be very different”, adding that people in all tiers should not travel, which will affect travel to meet families over the festive period. The curbs come days after he had announced relaxations for Christmas, which are now scrapped.“As prime minister, it is my duty to take the difficult decisions, to do what is right to protect the people of this country. Given the early evidence we have on this new variant of the virus, and the potential risk it poses, it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned,” Johnson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alarm-over-new-covid-19-variant-puts-london-in-lockdown/story-ECwIUiufDSjoQZkAIvawPI.html
