In the rest of England, people will be allowed to meet in Christmas bubbles for just one day instead of five, as the government originally planned.“It is with a very heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot proceed with Christmas as planned,” Johnson said.He said he concluded there was “no alternative open to me” and people must sacrifice this Christmas to have a better chance of protecting the lives of loved ones.Also Read: Moderna, McKesson and US Army general begin rolling out new Covid vaccine“I know how much emotion people invest in this time of year, and how important it is for grandparents to see their grandchildren,” Johnson said. “But when the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defense.”A fast-moving new variant of the coronavirus that is more than 70% more transmissible than existing strains appears to be driving the rapid spread in London and southern England, Johnson said. London now has the highest infection rates in England.“There’s no evidence to suggest it is more lethal or causes more severe illness,” he stressed, or that vaccines will be less effective against it.England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said the UK has alerted the World Health Organization that the new variant identified this week appears to be accelerating the spread of Covid-19. The government’s scientific advisers came to that conclusion based on preliminary modelling figures, and they are continuing to analyze the available data, he said.Viruses mutate regularly, and scientists have found thousands different of mutations among samples of the virus causing Covid-19. But many of these changes have no effect on how easily the virus spreads or how severe symptoms are.Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, told reporters after receiving notification from England this week that the UN health agency had “no evidence this variant behaves differently” and that it was similar to a variant initially reported among mink in Europe. She said scientists would study the virus strain to see if there might be any difference in how it prompts an immune response in people.Wales and Northern Ireland, which have their own devolved governments and independent rules for controlling the virus, have already announced fresh lockdowns once Christmas is over.UK officials reported another 28,507 confirmed cases on Friday, and 489 deaths of people within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. The UK has Europe’s second-highest Covid-19 death toll behind Italy, standing at 66,541 as of Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-nixes-christmas-gatherings-shuts-london-shops/story-emXJgeZZefYF9LQAqnatXP.html
19-12-2020||World||Moderna, McKesson and US Army general begin rolling out new Covid vaccine||Distribution of Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine to more than 3,700 locations in the United States has begun, vastly widening the rollout started last week by Pfizer Inc, US Army General Gustave Perna said on Saturday. Moderna has already moved vaccines from its manufacturing plants to warehouses operated by distributor McKesson Corp where they are being packed into containers and loaded on to trucks on Saturday, Perna said during a news conference. Trucks will set out on Sunday and shipments will start reaching healthcare providers as soon as Monday, he said. The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved an emergency use authorization for Moderna’s vaccine, the second Covid-19 vaccine to be approved. The jab developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE was approved Dec. 11. Workers in pharmaceutical services provider Catalent Inc’s facility in Bloomington, Indiana, are filling and packaging vials with Moderna vaccine and handing them to McKesson, which will ship doses from facilities including Louisville, Kentucky and Memphis, Tennessee. Those locations are close to air hubs for United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp.Also Read: US clears Moderna vaccine for Covid-19, 2nd shot in arsenalThe start of delivery for the Moderna vaccine will significantly widen availability of Covid-19 vaccines as US deaths related to the respiratory virus set records.“This is now a footrace between the vaccine and Covid,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Friday at a briefing on the virus. He said New York expects to receive 346,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine next week. Those will go to 292 medical facilities across the state. Pfizer organized its own distribution system but the US government’s Operation Warp Speed, led by an Army general, is in charge for Moderna. The Moderna delivery system will have some of the same players as Pfizer’s but will differ in key ways.Transportation companies UPS and FedEx are giving priority to vaccines on planes and trucks that are moving holiday gifts and other cargo. Their drivers will handle the bulk of the last-mile Moderna vaccine deliveries. They are going directly to vaccination sites, unlike Pfizer’s which was sent to large hubs and redistributed. Moderna’s vaccine is available in quantities as small as 100 doses and can be stored for 30 days in standard-temperature refrigerators, while the inoculations from Pfizer come in boxes of 975 doses, must be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), and can be held for only 5 days at standard refrigerator temperatures. Texas and Arkansas officials told Reuters they expect Moderna to be the primary vaccine for rural areas, which often lack the ultra cold storage equipment to store full trays of Pfizer’s vials. Once the plastic on a Pfizer 975-dose tray is opened, recipients have 120 hours to use the vaccine. Initial doses were given to health professionals. Programs by pharmacies Walgreens and CVS to distribute the Pfizer vaccine to long-term care facilities are expected to start on Monday, said Gareth Rhodes, a member of Cuomo’s Covid-19 task force. And a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel on Sunday will consider what groups should get vaccinated next. “The logistics will be easier with the Moderna vaccine,” said Jesse Breidenbach, senior executive director of pharmacy for Sanford Health, which operates almost four dozen hospitals in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. “Thirty days in the refrigerator will make it a bit easier to deal with,” Breidenbach said. Still, doses of vaccine must travel with security guards, including US Marshals, and will be stored in locked refrigerators.

Both vaccines were about 95% effective at preventing illness in clinical trials that found no serious safety issues. Separately, US officials said Pfizer is preparing to distribute 2 million additional doses of its vaccine to locations around the country next week, with preparations for shipping beginning over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-mckesson-and-us-army-general-begin-rolling-out-new-covid-vaccine/story-wj91lVHc2tocgVmakq1UjJ.html

Trial is scheduled for March.Cahill dismissed concerns by state prosecutors, who argued last month that recording audio and visuals of the trial would violate court rules and scare away potential witnesses. Attorney General Keith Ellison’s office, which is leading the prosecution, asked that Cahill rescind his previous ruling or consider narrowing the scope of outside access.Cahill declined to modify his original ruling, writing that although he had granted more extensive video coverage than allowed in court rules, he is permitted to modify the rules “in any case to prevent manifest injustice.”A coalition of media organizations, including The Associated Press, has requested camera access, arguing that cameras would increase transparency, especially during the pandemic.Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died May 25 after Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after Floyd said he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin faces second-degree unintentional murder and manslaughter charges. Lane, J. Kueng, Tou Thao and Thomas Lane are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. All four officers were fired.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/video-allowed-in-trial-of-officers-charged-in-floyd-killing/story-5VTeRVPU2ujHhRbDPllmsM.html

Breaking his silence for the first time on the major cybersecurity breach, Trump said he has been fully briefed on the matter and everything is “under control”. The US president also tried to undercut the assertions of top government officials, including State Secretary Mike Pompeo, who had suggested that Russia was behind the massive cyberattack. “Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!),” Trump tweeted.The outgoing president also suggested that the cyberattack could have also targeted the voting machines during the presidential polls, claiming that he won the election. “There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA,” he added. The tweet was promptly flagged by the micro-blogging site with the message, “Multiple sources called this election differently.” The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality.

What do we know about it?Earlier this week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) had revealed about the cyberattack which has affected networks within the federal government. While Pompeo didn’t reveal details about the alleged Russian links, he blamed Moscow for what is being described as the worst-even cyberattack on the government.“We can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,” Pompeo said on Friday.In a blog post published on Thursday, Microsoft president Brad Smith described the breach as an attack on the United States and its government and other critical institutions, including security firms. He said there are broader ramifications since the attackers used a technique that has put at risk the technology supply chain for the broader economy.A popular software called Orion, developed by the company SolarWinds, was compromised by a malicious code snuck into one of its upgrades in as early as March. The software provides network-monitoring services to a host of companies and government agencies around the world. The malware granted hackers remote access to networks of many of its targets.“The installation of this malware created an opportunity for the attackers to follow up and pick and choose from among these customers the organizations they wanted to further attack,” wrote Smith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-may-be-china-trump-undercuts-pompeo-s-assertion-on-cyberattack/story-8PIrStzRkBLnXep8sn8dCO.html

President Xi, who heads the Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall high-command of the two million-strong People’s Liberation Army (PLA), appointed Gen. Zhang Xudong as the Commander of the Western Theatre Command, according to the official media here. Xi has promoted four senior Chinese military and armed police officers. Among them was Gen. Zhang, Commander of the Western Theatre Command of the PLA, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Friday. The other officers who were promoted include Guo Puxiao, Political Commissar of the Logistic Support Department of the CMC; Li Wei, Political Commissar of the PLA Strategic Support Force and Wang Chunning, Commander. The new appointments at the top of the PLA Western Command comes in the midst of the standoff between the Chinese and Indian military in eastern Ladakh since May. Not much is known about Gen. Zhang, especially his association with Western Theatre Command, as he reportedly served mostly in other theatre commands of the PLA. He succeeds 65-year-old Gen. Zhao Zongqi who headed the Western Theatre Command during the 2017 Doklam standoff where the Indian Army stood up against the PLA’s plan of laying a road close to the Indian border in an area claimed by Bhutan. The Ladakh standoff also happened under the watch of Gen Zhao. It began in May after China dispatched thousands of troops which were mobilised for military exercises to eastern Ladakh borders, sparking a new round of tensions with India. India and China have held several rounds of talks at the diplomatic and military-level to resolve the prolonged standoff. At the latest round of foreign ministry-level talks on December 18, the two sides said that they have agreed to continue work towards ensuring complete disengagement of troops in all friction points along the LAC. The meeting also decided to hold the next round of military dialogue at an early date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ladakh-standoff-chinese-president-xi-jinping-appoints-new-general-for-pla-s-western-theatre-command/story-fu4FiygoRnsGv7NcGc3A4L.html

The Indian diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Office (FO) here a day after the Pakistan Army accused the Indian Army of “deliberately” targeting the UNMO, an allegation dismissed by India as completely false, baseless and factually incorrect. The FO said that the UN Observers were on their way to Polas village to meet with the victims of ceasefire violations when their vehicle was targeted. While the vehicle was damaged, the two UNMOs remained unharmed, it said. Military sources in New Delhi have rejected the allegation, saying reports of targeting the UN vehicle are not true. Meanwhile in New York, United Nations Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq, commenting on the incident on Friday, said: “I believe that the details we have are in fact that there was no one hurt but there has been a vehicle damaged in an incident and the mission is currently investigating the incident”. Official sources in New Delhi have said the reports emerging from the Pakistani side regarding attacks on the UN vehicle by Indian troops along the LoC are completely false, baseless and factually incorrect. The sources said there was no firing from the Indian side in that sector on Friday. Since movements of UN vehicles are known in advance, the question does not arise of any such firing, the sources said, adding the allegations are baseless. India maintains that the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), established in January 1949, has outlived its utility and is irrelevant after the Simla Agreement and the consequent establishment of the Line of Control.

19-12-2020||World||Hack attack adds to Putin mystique even if Russia faces pain||The storm over a cyber attack on US government agencies only helps Russian President Vladimir Putin’s image at home as a strong leader unafraid to confront the former Cold War enemy, even as the Kremlin denies involvement amid fears of a backlash when Joe Biden enters the White House.“Inside the country it bolsters the authorities’ prestige,” said Andrey Kortunov, head of the Kremlin-founded Russian International Affairs Council. “Outside Russia, it only deepens mistrust and this creates risks” by stoking hostility in Washington and other Western capitals, he said.Secretary of State Michael Pompeo became the highest ranking US official to link Moscow to the attacks, saying in a radio interview on Friday that Putin “remains a real risk to those of us who love freedom.”“This was a very significant effort, and I think it’s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,” Pompeo said. President Donald Trump has yet to comment publicly on the hacks.Those risks became apparent Friday when Russia’s ruble took a hit after rallying for two months, slumping as much as 1.4% amid renewed concerns over sanctions. After years of US and European sanctions, however, Russia’s grown more resistant to pressure and there may be little left for Washington to penalize without disrupting global energy and mineral resources markets where Russia is an important player.Putin himself brushes off any accusations he’s behind hacking campaigns. When a local rock-star-turned-journalist, Sergey Shnurov, asked tongue-in-cheek at the president’s annual news conference Thursday why Russian hackers couldn’t repeat their 2016 operation to help get Trump re-elected, Putin dismissed the question with a smile as a “provocation.”‘Revenge’ CampaignThe Kremlin leader also accused US intelligence of involvement in a recent leak about his family’s finances, calling it part of a “revenge” campaign against Russia.The fallout from the cyber attack on Texas-based SolarWinds Corp., which spread to its customers including the State, Treasury and Commerce departments and many Fortune 500 companies, may well unleash a new round of pressure on Russia, said three people close to the Kremlin who declined to be identified discussing internal matters.While Russia didn’t expect U.S. policy to soften under Biden, each new accusation weakens prospects for normalization because the president-elect will be unable to start his administration on a fresh page, said one of the people.Biden is taking office following four years of steadily worsening ties after US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election campaign to help elect Trump. The Kremlin denies the accusation.Few in Moscow expected a thaw from the new president, though there was at least an expectation of finding common ground on some issues.Unlike Trump, Biden has promised to extend the New START treaty that expires in February and is the last remaining nuclear arms agreement between Russia and the US.He has also pledged to return to the 2015 deal limiting Iran’s nuclear program that Trump abandoned, while calling for some changes to the accord.The SolarWinds scandal “is an effort to inject more negativity and increase anti-Russian rhetoric to sabotage Biden’s few positive initiatives,” said Alexander Dynkin, president of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, which advises the Kremlin. “These are dangerous games.”Deter AttacksBiden hasn’t threatened specific retaliatory measures yet, though he warned Thursday that his administration will move to deter cyber attacks from adversaries by “imposing substantial costs on those responsible.”The latest allegations aren’t as serious as in 2016, when Russian military intelligence was accused of targeting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton with a hack-and-leak operation, because they weren’t an attempt to interfere in U.S. politics, said Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat who’s now a foreign policy analyst in Moscow.“This is classic espionage. They’re the ones to blame, they should have protected their network better,” Frolov said. “Maybe there’ll be some diplomats expelled, but I doubt much more.”Putin underlined the rising competition between major powers in the virtual arena at a meeting of his Security Council on Friday, saying it would focus on “neutralizing threats to our country’s national security associated with the development of artificial intelligence technologies for military purposes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hack-attack-adds-to-putin-mystique-even-if-russia-faces-pain/story-cTyrMyTS8YCUsvOGV83XKM.html
19-12-2020||World||Covid-19: WHO was warned lives were at risk over yanked report on Italy||An author of a withdrawn World Health Organization report into Italy’s coronavirus response warned his bosses in May that people could die and the UN agency could suffer “catastrophic” reputational damage if it allowed political concerns to suppress the document, according to emails seen by The Associated Press.The comprehensive report examined how the Italian government and health system reacted after the country became the epicenter of the European outbreak in late February. , with real-time data and case studies of what worked and what didn’t. It was aimed at helping other countries prepare as the virus spread globally, but it hit a sensitive nerve among Italian officials because it noted that Italy went into the crisis with an out-of-date pandemic plan.The agency took it down a day after it was posted on its website, prompting the official who coordinated the work to appeal directly to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on May 28 and warn that the report’s disappearance was undermining WHO’s credibility. He cautioned that any further attempts at censorship would compromise the agency’s independence and its relations with donor nations that funded the research.The handling of the report could cause a “scandal of huge proportion — in a delicate moment for the UN health agency with the forthcoming COVID-19 investigation,” wrote Francesco Zambon, WHO’s chief field coordinator for Italy and its regions during the pandemic.In a statement Saturday, WHO said Zambon “expressed his views to many people and they were handled via appropriate channels.”The report, written by Zambon and a team of WHO public health experts and consultants, was posted May 13 after it had received necessary approvals within the UN system, according to internal WHO documents seen by AP. The agency later said it was withdrawn because of “factual inaccuracies” that it has not detailed and denied that it received any pressure from the Italian government to remove it.In the face of criticism that yanking the report deprived countries of data that could have helped them avoid Italy’s fate, WHO said Monday that it has offered another “mechanism” to assess pandemic responses. But that wasn’t rolled out until two months after the report was pulled.Concerns over the missing report have grown in recent weeks, fueling criticism of WHO’s leadership of the global response to the pandemic that led the agency to agree to an independent probe of its performance.The UN agency has been loath to publicly criticize countries that are top donors even when their policies could undermine public health.During the initial stages of the outbreak in January, for example, WHO officials were privately frustrated by the lack of information being shared by China, but publicly lauded the country for its transparency. As the pandemic gained pace in Europe, WHO scientists internally questioned Britain’s policies — such as when it suggested it would pursue “herd immunity” — but publicly emphasized their support.The missing report has cast a spotlight on preparedness in Italy, where Europe’s deadliest outbreak unfolded. In the hard-hit province of Bergamo, prosecutors have seized on it as part of their investigation into what went wrong.Paradoxically, the report isn’t even particularly critical of the Italian government and credited officials for their efforts, praising at one point how they counteracted with data “sensational displays of disagreement in talk shows” that stirred anxiety.The text did note that the Italian Health Ministry hadn’t updated its influenza pandemic preparedness plan since 2006. The 2006 plan was merely “reconfirmed” in 2016-2017 without being updated and was “more theoretical than practical.”“Unprepared for such a flood of severely ill patients, the initial reaction of the hospitals was improvised, chaotic and creative,” the report said. “It took some time before formal guidance became available.”Italy’s state-run RAI television investigative “Report” program has published emails showing that a top WHO official, Raniero Guerra, who worked as a liaison with the Italian government during the pandemic, told Zambon to “correct” that Italy’s preparedness plan had been “updated” in 2016, even though the 2016 version was identical to the 2006 one.Guerra had been in charge of prevention in the Italian Health Ministry from 2014 to 2017, when the plan should have been overhauled. He himself wrote to the then-health minister saying the plan needed to be updated, according to a copy of his 2017 memo seen by AP.WHO has said the Italian government “at no time” asked it to remove the report, which it now says it does not endorse. “The decision to remove the document from the website was taken by WHO’s Regional Office for Europe due to factual inaccuracies,” WHO said.Zambon says the only inaccuracy was an out-of-date timeline of the virus in China that he corrected immediately and had new copies without it printed. WHO on Saturday defended retracting the report altogether.“We are, of course, resolutely focused on saving lives, but published content needs to be accurate and based on proven methods,” WHO said.Guerra told the Financial Times he didn’t interfere. He added that the 2006 preparedness plan actually didn’t need to be updated because no significant flu strains had been identified since then and that the preparedness plan wasn’t relevant to the current pandemic because it was only meant to cover influenza.The deputy health minister, Pierpaolo Sileri, begged to disagree. “That plan was from 2006 and needed to be updated,” Sileri told the Corriere della Sera paper. Guerra didn’t immediately respond to questions from AP, saying he was traveling.The emails seen by AP suggest that WHO officials were concerned that the report had upset the Italians, offering rare insight into decision making by the UN agency, which is not subject to Freedom of Information requests.In a May 13 email to Zambon, Guerra noted that Italy had just made a 10 million-euro ($12.3 million) voluntary donation to the WHO, and that negotiations between WHO and Italy for funding the agency’s Venice office were about to begin.“There are already signs of institutional turmoil from the Italian side and unnecessary resentment against the WHO,” Guerra wrote to Zambon on May 14, the day the report was yanked.A day later, the head of WHO Europe, Dr. Hans Kluge, wrote to Zambon that the “key issue” at stake in the controversy was his relationship with the Italian health minister, Roberto Speranza, who he said had been “very disappointed” by the report.The Italian government, he said, feels “they are constantly attacked by the press and each word can be misinterpreted. They felt stepped (on) by a friend.”Kluge said he would propose to Speranza including Italian health officials in a review of the report. “We need MoH (Ministry of Health) happy and sign off for Venice,” he said, referring to the funding for the office.The ministry told RAI it doesn’t consider the report official.Meanwhile, Zambon was warning Tedros and Kluge that lives were being put at risk around the world by withholding Italy’s “lessons learned.”“A large team of experts worked literally days and nights with one motivation: making sure that what happened in Italy is not repeated in those countries behind in time in the epidemic curve,” Zambon wrote Kluge on May 27. “The report contains important messages, extrapolated from facts on what worked (many things) and the blind spots of the system.”A day later, in a message to the WHO chief, Zambon warned of a “risk of catastrophic damage in terms of independence and transparency if a ‘censored’ version of the above mentioned publication is modified,” as well as “compromised” relations with the government of Kuwait, which is one of WHO’s biggest donors and had funded the research with an $80 million grant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-who-was-warned-lives-were-at-risk-over-yanked-report-on-italy/story-UviRbwfBcF1joen7zMTMIP.html

She said scientists would study the virus strain to see if there might be any difference in how it prompts an immune response in people.Johnson is expected to announce to announce changes to current infection-prevention restrictions when he holds a news conference later Saturday.London now has the highest case rates in England, and this week moved under the highest level of coronavirus restrictions in the country’s three-tier alert system. Most of southern England joined the capital in an expansion of Tier 3 rules Saturday, meaning a total of 38 million people — or 68% of England’s population — are living under the toughest rules.Under the restrictions, people cannot socialize indoors or in most outdoor places, and restaurants and pubs only can offer takeaway service. Shops remain open, however.The government has said restrictions on socializing will be eased from December 23 to December 27 to allow people to travel and celebrate Christmas with family and friends. The temporary holiday rules allow a maximum of three households to meet in a “Christmas bubble,” though Johnson urged residents to keep their celebrations small and short.The planned relaxation of rules has raised increasing concerns given that infections are already climbing sharply in many places.The Prime Minister held an unscheduled meeting on Friday evening to discuss the latest evidence about the mutant strain with officials. He has refused to rule out the prospect of a third national lockdown for England.Wales and Northern Ireland, which have their own devolved governments and independent rules for controlling the virus, have already announced fresh lockdowns once Christmas is over.UK officials reported another 28,507 confirmed cases on Friday, and 489 deaths of people within 28 days of testing positive for the virus.

It has said that Russia had nothing to do with this latest assault.Here is some information about Russia’s possible motives for such an attack, and details about Russian cyber offensive and information warfare capabilities. Possible Russian motive The Kremlin has said many times it wants to improve ties with the United States, which are at a post-Cold War low and strained by issues from Ukraine to Syria. But it also openly views the United States as Russia’s main geopolitical adversary and as a threat to its national security. President Vladimir Putin has accused Washington of starting a new arms race and NATO of moving military infrastructure closer to Russia’s borders, and has complained about US sanctions, part of what Putin casts as an attempt to hold Russia back economically and technologically. Russia regularly probes US defences, flying nuclear-capable strategic bombers near Alaska and sending submarines into the Atlantic to lurk off the East Coast. Putin has complained that outgoing President Donald Trump was unable to improve U.S-Russia ties and has singled out what he has called President-elect Joe Biden’s harsh anti-Russian rhetoric.On Thursday, Putin blamed US intelligence agencies for a series of recent media investigations into people close to him. Without providing evidence, he also linked US intelligence agencies to what he presented as the stage-managed poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Putin did not congratulate Biden on his victory in the Nov. 3 election until Dec. 15. Putin said last month he was not worried that his delay in congratulating Biden would worsen US-Russia ties. “You can’t spoil a spoiled relationship,” said Putin. ‘Cozy bear’Some cyber researchers have suggested that Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service may have been behind the latest attack. In 2018, Dutch media cited unnamed intelligence officials as saying the AIVD, the Dutch intelligence agency, had linked a Russian hacking group known as “Cozy Bear” or APT29 (advanced persistent threat 29) to the SVR. The AIVD did not comment. The Washington Post cited sources on Dec. 13 as saying the United States had identified “Cozy Bear” as being responsible for the latest cyber attack referred to by Pompeo. Hackers from “Cozy Bear” were detected by cyber security firm CrowdStrike on the US Democratic Party’s servers in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election when email accounts of Hillary Clinton’s staff were hacked. In July, Britain, the United States and Canada accused “Cozy Bear” of trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine research from academic and pharmaceutical institutions around the world. ‘Fancy bear’Russian military intelligence, commonly known as GRU, has potent cyber offence capabilities, according to US intelligence agencies. In particular, GRU controls a hacking group known to cyber researchers as “Fancy Bear” or APT28 (advanced persistent threat 28) they have said. It was that group, according to a Department of Justice indictment filed in 2018, that hacked the email accounts of Hillary Clinton’s staff before the 2016 election.Reuters reported in September that Microsoft believed “Fancy Bear” had also targeted a firm working with Biden.In 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency accused Russian hackers of stealing confidential medical information about US Olympic athletes and publishing it online. The FBI later seized the domain of the site - http://www.fancybear.net - where the information was released.“Fancy Bear” hackers have also been linked by cyber security investigators to cyber attacks on the US and French elections.The FSBRussia’s Federal Security Service, the FSB, is the country’s main domestic intelligence agency. The United States in 2017 charged two FSB agents and two hackers with masterminding the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts. The Justice Department indictment included charges of computer fraud, economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, wire fraud, access device fraud and aggravated identify theft. It painted a picture of the Russian security services working hand-in-hand with cyber criminals, who helped spies further their intelligence goals in exchange for money.Internet research agency US prosecutors say the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) played a key role in Russian efforts to try to sway the 2016 election in favour of Trump. It did so, they say, by flooding social media with false reports and conspiracy theories in an attempt to exploit existing divisions.The group is a Kremlin-backed outfit whose employees have posed as Americans, according to US officials.The US Treasury Department in September imposed sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the financier of the IRA, who was charged in 2018, along with 12 other individuals and three entities, with conspiracy to defraud the United States for his alleged role in election meddling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-russia-s-potent-cyber-and-information-warfare-capabilities/story-JfcoM58TefQjZOBPvxD8lN.html

The European Commission last week approved the drug, branded Leqvio, which Novartis bought last year in a deal worth nearly $10 billion and expects to be a top seller.The purchase was a part of the drugmaker’s $9.7 billion takeover of The Medicines Co last November in a bid to challenge cardiovascular medicines from Amgen Inc, Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. “Novartis is confident in the quality of the regulatory submission for inclisiran....We look forward to meeting with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and our third-party manufacturing partner to discuss the feedback received and next steps,” Novartis Chief Medical Officer John Tsai said in a company statement. No onsite inspection was conducted by the FDA, the company said, adding that the regulator would schedule a facility inspection if it was deemed necessary once safe travel resumes.In an emailed response to a query, Novartis identified the supplier as Corden Pharma Caponago, based in Italy, which is responsible for drug product manufacturing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-declines-approval-of-novartis-cholesterol-lowering-drug/story-MPu86SITTQUtbVXU2ayrKJ.html
19-12-2020||World||UK discusses action after confirmation new Covid strain spreads more quickly||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was discussing with his senior ministers on Saturday what urgent action to take after it was confirmed that a new strain of the Covid-19 virus could spread more quickly and lead to a surge in cases.England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said that while there was no current evidence the variant of the novel coronavirus caused a higher mortality rate or impacted vaccines, urgent work was underway to confirm this.“We have alerted the World Health Organisation and are continuing to analyse the available data to improve our understanding,” Whitty said in a statement.The government said on Monday that a rise in infections across London and southeast England might be linked to a new, more transmissible variant of the virus.Johnson will hold a news conference with Whitty and the government’s chief scientific adviser at about 1600 GMT amid suggestions that he will announce new urgent measures to try to address the rise in cases caused by the variant Covid strain.Britain reported 28,507 new Covid-19 cases on Friday and 489 deaths, with the reproduction “R” number estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2, meaning the number of cases is rapidly increasing.Johnson said on Friday he hoped England would not need to go into a third lockdown after Christmas and has so far resisted calls to change plans to ease restrictions for five days over the festive period, allowing three separate households to meet indoors.Much of the country, including London, is currently in the highest of a three-tier system of restrictions to curb the spread. The Daily Telegraph newspaper said ministers could now announce curbs on travel between southeast England, including the capital, and the rest of the country.“Failing to act decisively now, will mean further suffering. We must keep asking ourselves ‘are we doing enough, are we acting quickly enough’,” Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), said on Twitter.The opposition Labour Party said the tiered system had failed to curb the virus’s spread.“It has been apparent for some days that the virus is again out of control in parts of the country,” said Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-discusses-action-after-confirmation-new-covid-strain-spreads-more-quickly/story-6glpSwmXRJSt1HylsffWUK.html

Critics demanded that the leader resign and tried to pelt him with eggs.The Azerbaijani army pushed deep into Nagorno-Karabakh in six weeks of hostilities that ended with a Russia-brokered peace deal on November 10 that saw Azerbaijan reclaim large parts of the separatist region and surrounding territories.The loss of lands that had been controlled by ethnic Armenian forces for more than a quarter-century has traumatized Armenians, triggering weeks of protests demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.On Saturday, thousands of protesters rallied near the Yerablur military memorial cemetery on the outskirts of the Armenian capital of Yerevan as Pashinyan visited it to honor the soldiers killed in the latest fighting. The nation is observing a three-day mourning period for the dead.The prime minister’s opponents, shouting “Nikol, you traitor!,” engaged in scuffles with his supporters and police. Police dispersed the protesters to clear the way for Pashinyan and his security guards covered him with shields and umbrellas as protesters attempted to hit him with eggs.Later in the day, about 20,000 opposition supporters marched across Yerevan for a memorial church service for the victims of the conflict.Also on Saturday, 14 retired military generals issued a statement calling for the resignation of the government over its handling of the latest fighting.Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands.In 44 days of fighting that began in late September and left more than 5,600 people killed on both sides, the Azerbaijani army fought its way deep into Nagorno-Karabakh, forcing Armenia to accept last month’s peace deal.Russia has deployed nearly 2,000 peacekeepers for at least five years to monitor the peace agreement and facilitate the return of refugees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-honors-nagorno-karabakh-dead-some-call-for-pm-resignation/story-43Jt68yj0uZDvZQPeCvosM.html

Speaking of the general situation in France, where the number of deaths passed 60,000 on Friday, he warned: “We have to be vigilant as the virus is gaining in strength again.” The French authorities are concerned that the holiday period could see a new spike in infections.On Friday, a total 15,674 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours in France, down from 18,254 the previous day.And the so-called positivity rate -- which measures the number of confirmed contaminations as a proportion of the number of tests carried out -- slipped slightly to 5.9 percent from 6.1 percent on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emmanuel-macron-stable-after-covid-19-infection-presidency/story-qIXGiUyyD5jJoQtW3qPKoI.html
19-12-2020||World||Brexit deal on a knife edge after day of high drama in talks||Brexit trade talks headed into a decisive weekend with neither side confident of a deal after a frantic 24 hours exposed just how far apart the UK and European Union still are on an issue that’s hampered the talks since March.With officials from both sides expecting a conclusion one way or the other within the next two days, talks resumed in Brussels on Friday afternoon -- but only after EU negotiators had spent the morning consulting their own national capitals over the scope for compromise on the issue of fishing rights. The UK rejected the bloc’s latest offer.British and European diplomats close to the negotiations insisted it’s still just as likely that talks will collapse without a deal being struck as they are to end with an accord. It sets up a critical two days that will define the UK’s relationship with the bloc when the country makes its final break with the European single market on Dec. 31.In a day of high drama:The whole trade deal is increasingly hinging on how much the EU is prepared to give up of its fishing catch in UK waters. The British feel they have the upper hand after making concessions on the other major roadblock, a level playing field for businesses, in recent days.A handful of fishAccording to officials close to the negotiations, the UK on Thursday rejected an EU offer that would see the bloc lose around 22% of the current 650 million euros ($800 million) of fish caught annually in British waters. After consultation with the capitals on Friday, the EU offered 25% and this was again rejected. The UK is pushing the reduction to be closer to 60%, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.To put that into context, the negotiations are snagged over fishing rights equivalent to about 0.01% of UK GDP. The British government’s own analysis in 2018 suggested the economy will be at least 2.6% smaller in 15 years’ time if there’s no trade deal.The EU offered to reduced the phase-in period of the new arrangements to six years, after originally wanting 10. The UK rejected the offer of six and has proposed just three years.The British see control of their fishing waters, previously under the jurisdiction of the EU, as a key element of the sovereignty that it is regaining with Brexit. For its part, the European side doesn’t want to give access to its single market without maintaining fishing rights in return.“Our door is open, we’ll keep talking,” Johnson said. “There’s a gap that needs to be bridged. We hope that our EU friends will see sense and come to the table with something themselves.”Officials said they expected talks to resume in Brussels on Saturday.On Saturday, French European Affairs Junior Minister Clement Beaune told France Inter radio that her country wouldn’t be bowed by the hard Sunday deadline.“It would be normal not to say, well it’s Sunday evening so let’s wrap it and sacrifice everything,” Beaune said. “It may be hard and sometimes tough to understand, but it’s necessary to take the time, and at any rate not to sacrifice our interests under the pressure of a calendar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-deal-on-a-knife-edge-after-day-of-high-drama-in-talks/story-qYj8cGPsPHohaOyU15DOML.html
19-12-2020||World||Biden to introduce team tasked with ambitious climate agenda||President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled to publicly introduce his climate and energy team on Saturday, a history-making group that will be tasked with advancing his ambitious climate policy and strengthening safeguards against pollution.Biden has promised to make tackling climate change one of the pillars of his Democratic administration. But with a slim majority in the US House of Representatives and control of the U.S. Senate still undecided, Biden and his new team may see little success in Congress and instead rely on rules from his regulatory agencies to enact sweeping change. The climate team will be formally introduced in Biden’s home state of Delaware on Saturday, during a press briefing where he’s expected to tease further details of his climate plan. The former Vice President to President Barack Obama tapped a familiar face, Obama’s US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Gina McCarthy, to lead a newly-created position as national climate adviser tasked with implementing the domestic Biden agenda. Biden nominated Michael Regan, North Carolina’s top environmental regulator, to head up the EPA. Regan, who worked at the Washington-based agency during the Clinton and Bush administrations, has served as secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality since 2017.Democratic congresswoman Deb Haaland will serve as Biden’s interior secretary, and former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm as his energy secretary.The team also includes Brenda Mallory, an environmental lawyer, as chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and Ali Zaidi, a leading climate expert and Biden adviser, as deputy national climate adviser.If confirmed by the US Senate, Haaland would be the first Native American to hold a US cabinet post, Mallory would be the first African American to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and Regan would be the first Black man to run the EPA.The team has been largely praised by environmental groups for its experience and diversity. But the powerful fossil fuel industry, which Biden has frequently targeted for criticism, said the administration must balance its climate efforts with preserving jobs.“We will also be watching closely to ensure that the incoming administration keeps President-elect Biden’s campaign promises to the energy workforce and protects the millions of jobs supported by our industry in states like New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and across the country,” American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-introduce-team-tasked-with-ambitious-climate-agenda-on-saturday/story-sz80J8iWdVQvPoLL9zJELI.html

Shanghai-based chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and Shenzhen-based drone giant SZ DJI Technology Co. were among the companies that were punished.“Such moves have seriously damaged the international economic and trade order and free trade rules, as well as the security of the global supply chain,” China’s commerce ministry said.DJI, the world’s biggest drone maker, said it was “disappointed” about the blacklisting but won’t stop US customers buying its products.

19-12-2020||World||US government hack: Espionage or act of war? What do we know about it?||The suspected Russian hack of US government agencies has led to heated rhetoric from lawmakers, with US Senator Dick Durbin calling it “virtually a declaration of war” and US Senator Marco Rubio saying that “America must retaliate, and not just with sanctions.”But cybersecurity and legal experts said the hack would not be considered an act of war under international law and will likely go down in history as an act of espionage.Here’s why.WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE HACK?The hack, first reported by Reuters, hijacked software made by Texas-based SolarWinds Corp. By inserting malicious code into updates pushed to SolarWinds customers, the hackers were for months able to explore the computer networks of private companies, think tanks, and government agencies.Sources familiar with the US investigation said the hack was likely carried out by Russia’s foreign intelligence service. Moscow has denied involvement.The magnitude of the hack is still unclear, but hackers are known to have monitored email or other data within several US government agencies.The breached federal agencies include the Commerce Department, Treasury Department, and Department of Energy. An Energy Department spokeswoman said malware had been “isolated to business networks only” and had not impacted US national security.WAS THE HACK AN ‘ACT OF WAR’?It is too early to say for sure, but probably not, according to cybersecurity experts.To qualify as an act of war, United Nations resolutions and other sources of international law require a certain level of force or destruction that does not appear to be the case this time.“Warfare implies violence, death and destruction,” said Duncan Hollis, a professor of law at Temple University specializing in cybersecurity.Hollis and other experts said the attack appears to have been carried out to steal sensitive US information, and should be viewed as espionage.“Simply stealing information, as much as we don’t like it, is not an act of war — it is espionage,” said Benjamin Friedman, a policy director at the think tank Defense Priorities.Experts said cyber attacks can be acts of war if they cause physical destruction.A Department of Defense law of war manual states that some cyber operations should be subject to the same rules as physical, or “kinetic” attacks. Examples include operations that “trigger a nuclear plant meltdown; open a dam above a populated area, causing destruction; or disable air traffic control services, resulting in airplane crashes.”John Bellinger, the top State Department lawyer under former Republican Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said it was not yet clear whether the hack could be considered an act of war.“It may simply be a massive act of espionage that would not constitute an act of war. We don’t know yet whether the Russians simply accessed US government computers or actually disrupted government functions,” said Bellinger, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.IS THERE ANY PRECEDENT FOR THE HACK?A hack in 2014 that targeted the US government’s personnel agency, the Office of Personnel Management, exposed sensitive personal information of millions of current and former federal employees and contractors.Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in 2015 that he suspected China of conducting the hack, and he said during congressional testimony two years later that in his view it was an act of espionage.“I think there is a difference between an act of espionage, which we conduct as well, and other nations do, versus an attack,” Clapper said at the time.A devastating 2017 hack attributed to Russia, known as “NotPetya,” crippled ports by paralyzing the shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk and other global corporations.Olga Oliker, a Washington-based expert on US-Russia relations, said in 2017 testimony before the US Senate that, if Russia was to blame for NotPetya, “it is an example of precisely the type of cyber operation that could be seen as warfare, in that it approximates effects similar to those that might be attained through the use of armed force.”HOW MIGHT THE UNITED STATES RESPOND?The Defense Department manual says the United States cannot use force to respond to a cyber operation that is not itself an act of force. Instead, the United States can respond with measures such as “a diplomatic protest, an economic embargo, or other acts of retorsion” the manual says.“We know that lots of countries engage in espionage, and we don’t bomb them in response,” said Friedman.US President-elect Joe Biden signaled on Thursday that he would use targeted financial sanctions to respond.“They’ll be held accountable,” Biden told The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “Individuals as well as entities will find ... there are financial repercussions for what they did.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-us-government-hack-espionage-or-act-of-war/story-UklwUFOYyy6EnyLIoHnNwM.html
19-12-2020||World||Portugal’s armed forces help nursing homes battle the virus||Tears well up in Diana Correia’s eyes as she recalls the October day that 24 of the 55 residents of her nursing home in Portugal tested positive for Covid-19.The stunning discovery set off a scramble to enact the home’s contingency plan and stiffen safety procedures. With some staff sent into isolation, others worked double shifts of up to 16 hours in full protective equipment, leaving them lathered in sweat and bone-weary. Some of the home’s residents, suddenly confined to their rooms or their floor, were bewildered and chafed at restrictions, even trying to take the elevator and escape confinement.“They were hard times,” Correia says, trying hard to keep her composure. “Very hard times.”As a resurgence of the pandemic in the fall looked set to overwhelm Portuguese nursing homes like Correia’s, and the country’s public health service struggled to cope, the government mobilized all the resources it could. That included deploying military units.The soldiers’ mission: fan out across the country to visit hundreds of nursing homes and help shore up their defenses against the pandemic.Long-term care facilities have proven vulnerable worldwide during the pandemic. The age of their residents, their physical closeness inside what is essentially a large house, and the residents’ underlying health problems put them in peril. On top of that, nursing home staff in Portugal commonly work in several different care homes and travel between them on public transport.Noting that international data on nursing home Covid-19 deaths is “imperfect and limited,” a study of 21 countries by the London-based International Long-term Care Policy Network, which includes scientific researchers, found in October that those homes’ average share of coronavirus deaths was around 46%.The European Centre for Disease Control, an EU agency that monitors 31 countries, said the same month that up to 66% of all fatal Covid-19 cases have been among nursing home residents.By that measure, Portugal hasn’t fared badly. Care home deaths through December 14 accounted for 30% of the country’s Covid-19 fatalities, the General Directorate for Health told The Associated Press.On Friday, Portugal’s total deaths reached almost 6,000.At the end of September, fearing a calamity, the Portuguese government sent a distress call to its military. As well as helping with contact tracing, disinfecting buildings and providing beds for hundreds of virus patients at military hospitals, the armed forces were now being asked to buttress nursing home protections.Dr. Maria Salazar, a physician and a colonel in the Portuguese Air Force, swiftly drew up a nationwide program to train care home staff at their workplace. The program also ensures the staff get the specific medical advice they need in almost daily online Q&A sessions with doctors, nurses and pharmacists.Within a week, the program was launched, coordinated from the CECOM military operations command center near Lisbon.About 140 teams of one to three people, taken from the Portuguese Army, Navy and Air Force, have traveled across the country since early October. They have already been to more than half of the targeted 2,770 care homes.Salazar, a 49-year-old gastroenterologist, says the military presence is reassuring for nursing home staff and residents who were spooked by the virus threat and desperately short of medical know-how.“Suddenly, all these staff ... felt like they didn’t know what they were doing and they were scared to death,” Salazar says.At the root of some muddled decision-making was, simply, fear. “We’ve identified that very clearly,” she says.In a first phase, troops go in person to the nursing homes and give talks with slideshows that go through the rudimentary rules of cooking, laundry, cleaning and social distancing. It’s Covid-19 101.Correia, the technical director of an AFID charitable association nursing home in Amadora, just north of Lisbon, acknowledges it’s nothing her staff haven’t heard many times before. The difference is who the instructions are coming from.“It’s a voice from the outside, a military voice with all the weight that carries,” she says.In a recent afternoon session at the AFID home, 10 of Correia’s staff listened intently to Sgt. Ari Silva, from the No. 2 Lancers Regiment, whose barracks are nearby. Wearing military fatigues, a beret and an olive-green face mask, Silva asked his audience how many times they had washed their hands that day. A man sitting at the front said four.Silva was unimpressed: “Friend, I’ve done at least double that,” he said.The benefits of the military presence are as much psychological as practical, says 38-year-old Correia.“We feel like someone outside of here feels concern for us,” she said. “It’s not just us who are concerned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/portugal-s-armed-forces-help-nursing-homes-battle-the-virus/story-bSbXLitEIrI5r4PU7MV0UO.html
19-12-2020||World||China says it tailed US warship Mustin in Taiwan Strait||China’s military tailed a US warship as it passed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Saturday, the Chinese military said, denouncing such missions as sending “flirtatious glances” to supporters of Taiwan independence.China, which claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory, has been angered by stepped-up US support for the island, including arms sales and sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait, further souring Beijing-Washington relations.The US Navy said the guided missile destroyer USS Mustin had conducted “a routine Taiwan Strait transit (on) Dec. 19 in accordance with international law”.“The ship’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” it added.This is the 12th sailing through the strait by the US Navy this year.China’s military, in a statement released by its Eastern Theatre Command, said its air and naval forces “tailed and monitored” the vessel throughout.Such missions “deliberately raise the temperature of the Taiwan issue, as they fear calm in the Taiwan Strait, and send flirtatious glances to Taiwan independence forces, seriously jeopardising peace and stability in the strait”, it said.The United States is engaging in a show of force and trying to use Taiwan as a pawn for its own selfish strategic purposes, the statement added.In Taipei, Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said the US ship had proceeded in a southerly direction, that it has also monitored its movements, and that “the situation was as normal”.Beijing believes Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is bent on a formal declaration of independence for the island, a red line for Beijing. She says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.Tsai has made bolstering Taiwan’s armed forces a priority in the face of repeated Chinese military activity near the island, including on occasion this year sending fighter jets across the Taiwan Strait’s median line, an unofficial buffer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-tailed-us-warship-mustin-in-taiwan-strait/story-3wtCOK1rF4P1lGFbR8BaFL.html
19-12-2020||World||Explainer: Iran, despite sanctions, has routes to Covid-19 vaccines||Although Iran faces crushing US sanctions, there are still ways for Tehran to obtain coronavirus vaccines as the country suffers the Mideast’s worst outbreak of the pandemic.After earlier downplaying the virus, Iran has since acknowledged the scope of the disaster it faces after 1.1 million reported cases and over 52,000 deaths. Getting vaccines into the arms of its people would be a major step in stemming the crisis.But while Iran is able to obtain vaccines, challenges remain ranging from sanctions imposed under President Donald Trump to the logistics of making mass vaccinations happen.HOW COULD IRAN GET THE VACCINE?Iran has signed up for COVAX, an international program designed to distribute coronavirus vaccines to participating countries around the world. That program is run in part by Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance. Gavi says the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control has already issued a license for Iran to take part. The Treasury declined to comment.For its part, Iran has alleged US sanctions have affected its ability to purchase medicine and vaccines. President Hassan Rouhani has said Iranians “should curse Trump a hundred times” over the difficulties. US sanctions do have specific carve-outs for medicine and humanitarian aid to Iran. However, international banks and financial institutions hesitate in dealing with Iran transactions for fear of being fined or locked out of the American market.Those sanctions, however, would not stop Iran from flying a load of cash to Geneva to pay for its participation in COVAX. Gavi declined to offer any information about Iranian payments or orders, though Iran under its rules at a maximum could order vaccines for 50% of its 82 million people.Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman at Iran’s mission to the United Nations, criticized the US for its sanctions and banking restrictions, which he said “cruelly put many obstacles in the way of Iran receiving the Covid19 vaccine.“Nonetheless, along with our own indigenous vaccine trials, we fully expect the international community and the relevant international drug companies to fulfill their humanitarian obligation and expedite all our orders,” Miryousefi said.Local efforts to produce a vaccine have not begun in earnest, meaning the Islamic Republic may need to rely on those abroad.DOES IRAN HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A MASS INOCULATION?When it comes to childhood vaccinations, Iran has nearly 100% success in inoculations, according to World Health Organization data. People from surrounding countries often come to Iran for medical care as well. Iran’s hospitals, doctors and nurses are known as some of the best in the wider Middle East, with a network of clinics from villages to big cities. State-run facilities offer subsidized care, while private hospitals can be incredibly expensive.However, there are questions about the logistics of a mass vaccination drive. Iran’s aging fleet of aircraft likely would need to fly to pick up vaccines made abroad. Many airlines don’t fly into Iran due to sanctions. Keeping vaccines ultra cold, like in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech’s required minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit), also likely would be a challenge. Mostafa Ghanei, the director of the scientific commission at Iran’s National Headquarters for Combating the Coronavirus, reportedly has said that Iran doesn’t want the Pfizer vaccine for that reason.WOULD IRAN ACCEPT AN AMERICAN-MADE VACCINE?That remains in question. Early in the pandemic, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei floated an unfounded conspiracy theory claiming the virus could be man-made by America. In those March remarks, he suggested that “possibly your medicine is a way to spread the virus more.” Those remarks appeared aimed at dismissing any US assistance out of hand from the Trump administration, but Iranian officials also now increasingly criticize President-elect Joe Biden.Iran is looking at Chinese and Russian vaccine options. However, if it relied on COVAX for the vaccines, the cooperative could choose to issue it American-made vaccines. There’s a cost implication as well for Iran if it decides to choose which vaccine it wants from COVAX. It would need to put up $3.50 a dose in advance to have the ability to refuse the vaccine offered, as opposed to $1.60 per dose. If Iran chooses to offer a deposit to vaccinate half its population through COVAX, that means a $143.5 million as opposed to a $65.6 million initial payment.Rejecting a COVAX vaccine offer could see Iran receive doses later as well.WHY IS IRAN UNDER US SANCTIONS?Since the 1979 US Embassy takeover and the 444-day hostage crisis in Tehran, Iran has been subject to a series of changing economic sanctions. Some were lifted under Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which saw Tehran limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for that relief. In 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from that accord, re-invoking sanctions that had crushed Iran’s long-anemic economy.Trump said he pulled out of the deal over Iran’s ballistic missile program, its regional ambitions and other issues — all of which were not part of the 2015 deal. Biden has signaled he could return America to the deal if Iran agrees to again honor its limits. However, a series of escalating incidents over the last year and a half across the Mideast have raised tensions between Tehran and Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-iran-despite-sanctions-has-routes-to-covid-19-vaccines/story-u6VjjiS3XjhZFfCVvtNiUM.html
19-12-2020||World||Switzerland grants authorisation for Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine||Switzerland has authorized Pfizer Inc.’s and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine, the first approved for use in the country.“The data available to date showed a comparable high level of efficacy in all investigated age groups, thus meeting the safety requirements,” drug regulator Swissmedic said in a statement Saturday. “The level of protection afforded seven days after the second injection is over 90% in adults.”Switzerland had previously signed contracts with the companies for the delivery of three million vaccine doses. “Deliveries will start in 2020 and occur throughout 2021,” BioNTech said in a separate statement.The Swiss nod comes after the UK and US among others have already approved the vaccine, while European regulators will be meeting next week to decide. Unlike the US and UK, which conducted emergency authorizations, Swiss and EU regulators have been reviewing the vaccine for a conditional marketing authorization. That process requires a higher evidence level, according to the EU commission’s directorate-general for health.The Swiss government on Friday announced that it will close restaurants and leisure venues to curb the spread of new infections. It also said it’s considering further steps should the situation worsen.The nation of about 8.5 million reported 4,478 new infections on Friday, with the seven-day average up 3% compared to last week. It’s had more than 400,000 cases and about 6,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic.Vaccinations will start in the “coming days,” Swiss Interior Minister Alain Berset said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-grants-authorisation-for-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine/story-8rg4ajNnX4fxlqDtcBdiTI.html
19-12-2020||World||Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to get clearance by year-end: Report||The Oxford University vaccine against Covid-19 being produced by AstraZeneca is likely to get regulatory approval from the UK’s independent regulator by the end of this year for a rollout to begin in early 2021, according to a UK media report.The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which had been formally tasked by the UK government last month with the process of clearance after the jab emerged “safe and effective” against the novel coronavirus in human trials, is expected to authorise the vaccine by December 28 or 29 after the final data is provided on Monday, ‘The Daily Telegraph’ quoted senior government sources as indicating.“Authorisation by the MHRA will also give confidence to countries across the world. India has already manufactured more than 50 million of the AstraZeneca vaccines,” the newspaper notes.In India, the vaccine is being produced as part of a tie-up with the Serum Institute of India. Health officials in the UK hope that the authorisation of the Oxford jab will prove a “game-changer”, allowing vaccines to be transported and administered far more easily compared to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine which must be stored at very cold temperatures. The Oxford vaccine can be stored in normal refrigerators but like the Pfizer vaccine, it also requires two doses – with a three-week gap between the two doses for the Pfizer jabs and a four-week gap for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.The Oxford/AstraZeneca, AZD1222, vaccine has taken longer for regulators to assess because of differences in the efficacy rates found in different groups, ranging from 62% to 90%. However, a study released this week suggests that leaving an adequate gap between doses is the most crucial way to boost efficacy, the newspaper reports. Although the first batch of 4 million doses will be delivered from the Netherlands and Germany, the bulk of manufacturing is set to take place in the UK. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has said a further 15 million doses of active ingredients are ready and can be filled into vials in a matter of days, the newspaper report adds. The full order of 100 million doses, in addition to 40 million doses of the Pfizer jabs being imported from Belgium, is believed to be enough to vaccinate the whole of the UK.The state-funded National Health Service (NHS), which is leading the UK’s mass vaccination drive with the Pfizer vaccine, has drawn up plans for “large scale” vaccination sites, in football stadiums, racecourses and conference centres to start administering jabs from the first week of January. The programme will also be expanded to high-street pharmacies and further general practitioner (GP) practices.The news of a second vaccine for the UK comes as the US cleared its second vaccine for emergency use against the deadly virus – the Moderna vaccine – and will begin rolling out thousands of doses soon alongside the Pfizer vaccine.The UK, meanwhile, has been vaccinating the highest risk categories of the population with the first of two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for over two weeks now, even as millions more across the country entered the toughest Covid-19 lockdown measures from Saturday due to a spike in infection rates.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called an unscheduled meeting of senior ministers on Friday night to hold talks over a worrying new variant of the deadly virus, which has been spreading more rapidly across London and the south east of England.“We’re hoping very much that we will be able to avoid anything like that. But the reality is that the rates of infection have increased very much in the last few weeks,” Johnson said, on being asked about the prospect of another complete nationwide lockdown in the New Year.Earlier in the week, all four nations of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland – agreed to not reverse a change in the law allowing up to three households to get together over Christmas with relaxed rules between December 23 and 27, but people are being advised to keep their “Christmas bubbles” as small and short as possible.Latest analysis suggests the R number, which represents how many people each infected person passes the virus onto, has risen above the dreaded mark of one again.On Friday, the UK recorded a further 28,507 cases, along with 489 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, taking the country’s death toll to 66,541.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-to-get-clearance-by-year-end-report/story-MZHIJzLzhJWGuwBNl80rZI.html

New South Wales (NSW) state government is to announce on Sunday whether further restrictions will be imposed on the rest of Sydney, home to around five million people. “I want to make that clear, to say to greater Sydney, please, please, do not go out tonight or the next few days unless you really have to,” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said at a news conference.The outbreak now totals 39 with two additional cases still under investigation. This up from five only two days ago, but authorities do not know the origin of the virus, which genome testing suggests is a U.S. strain.Australia has avoided the worst of the pandemic due to border closures, lockdowns, widespread testing and social distancing. It has recorded a total of around 28,100 infections.Until this week, the country had gone more than two weeks without any local transmission and had lifted most restrictions ahead of Christmas. The Sydney outbreak prompted states and territories to reimpose border restrictions, sending holiday travel plans for thousands into chaos.Western Australia state on Saturday said it would reimposed a hard border closure from midnight and other states such as Victoria may do the same if the Sydney cluster spreads rapidly.The island state of Tasmania imposed a 14-day quarantine for all Sydney arrivals placing the annual Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race starting Boxing Day is in jeopardy.The Sydney lockdown will mean people in the designated area will only be allowed to leave home for one of four essential reasons: grocery shopping, work, compassionate grounds including emergency medical treatment, or visiting an isolated relative.Local media on Saturday reported panic buying in some supermarkets in the area, leaving shelves empty. By nightfall beachside streets, usually thronging with people a week before Christmas, were eeriely deserted.Many restaurants, cafes and 14 hotels in the area voluntarily closed this weekend. Major public facilities in the area, such as swimming pools, beaches and playgrounds, have been closed and visitors banned from age care facilities.Authorities have pinpointed two clubs at Avalon beach as the original transmission sites for the cluster but have issued more than 30 potential secondary transmission sites, as far away as Bondi and Cronulla beaches in the east and south of the city.After more than 12,000 tests were conducted on Friday, people queued in Sydney for hours on Saturday to get tested and people rushed to stores to stock up on foodstuff. “That is the community responding in the way we want them to respond,” Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Paul Kelly said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-imposes-lockdown-on-beach-suburbs-as-covid-19-cluster-grows/story-ecu9zCTu2u7oh07bu71FdI.html

It is also peddling vaccines that lack essential data on safety and efficacy, due to a fundamental disregard for transparency and accountability regarding results from clinical trials. Both actions put Chinese citizens, and the world, at risk.”He further pointed out that the CCP has punished scientists, doctors and journalists who tried to alert the world to the dangers of the virus, which allowed a ‘controllable outbreak’ to become a global pandemic.The Secretary of State also called for other nations to demand transparency from Beijing regarding the origin of Covid-19, adding that if not done, China’s record of public health crises makes another future pandemic originating from the country ‘depressingly likely’.“Time and again, democracies that value transparency, the rule of law, property rights, and free-market capitalism have produced innovative solutions to public health crises. Freedom unleashes human potential, and competition spurs better outcomes, at lower costs. In contrast, authoritarian regimes control information and stifle innovation,” he said.China has been criticised widely across the world for its alleged role in the spread of the novel coronavirus that has infected over 75 million people across the world. More than 1.6 million people have lost their lives to the virus.While some accuse it of being complicit, others deem it culpable in the spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-accuses-ccp-of-blocking-who-investigation-spreading-misinformation/story-sbunvs5VTWy8YtJuZH8SZK.html

A simulator test was conducted for over a year by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a part of the recertification process to ensure that the aircraft could fly safely.According to the report, the staff of the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation started receiving information from whistleblowers after the second 737 Max crash, detailing numerous concerns related to aviation safety. The investigators said that the scope and breadth of the probe quickly expanded beyond the first allegations and dozens of whistleblowers revealed common themes.Also Read | Boeing 737 Max back in air 2 years after grounded by crashesHere are some of the most significant findings:1. The report suggests that the FAA continues to retaliate against whistleblowers instead of welcoming their disclosures in the interest of aviation safety.2. The investigators accused Boeing and the FAA of “attempting to cover up important information” that may have been contributed to those fatal crashes.3. The US agency repeatedly permitted Southwest Airlines to continue operating dozens of aircraft in an unknown airworthiness condition for several years, which put millions of passengers at potential risk.4. Boeing inappropriately influenced the FAA’s human factor simulator testing of pilot reaction times involving a Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) failure.5. The senior officials at the FAA may have obstructed a review of 737 Max crashes conducted by the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General.Last month, Boeing Co received the approval of the FAA, which was required to resume its 737 Max flights, however, the approval didn’t allow the Max aircraft to immediately return to the skies. The FAA had rescinded the order that grounded the aircraft and published an Airworthiness Directive, which specifies design changes that must be made before the aircraft returns to service. The US regulator also detailed training changes that the aviation company must incorporate to resume commercial flights after a 20-month grounding. On December 9, commercial flights with Boeing 737 Max jetliners resumed for the first time since they were grounded worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/attempting-to-cover-up-5-key-findings-by-us-senators-after-boeing-737-max-crashes/story-YZcSyim8zkWAfar6rkDVyH.html

19-12-2020||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan says Army ‘works under’ him: Report||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has asserted that the Army is a state institution which works under him, amidst Opposition’s allegations of the powerful military establishment’s interference in the country’s politics and elections. Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a 11-party opposition alliance, has been holding massive rallies since its inception in September to seek Khan’s ouster and press the military to stop interfering in politics. The PDM has been accusing the Pakistan Army of installing “puppet” Prime Minister Khan through a manipulated election in 2018.The Army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy. However, the military has denied meddling in the country’s politics. Khan also denies that the army helped him win the election in 2018.According to the ‘Lahore Declaration’ signed by the Opposition parties on Monday, the military establishment had stolen the people’s mandate in the 2018 election and imposed a “hybrid and inefficient” government on the masses.In an interview to SAMAA TV on Friday, 68-year-old Khan rebutted accusations that he does not have any real authority and said that the Pakistan Army is a state institution, which works under him.On Opposition’s claims that the government wouldn’t hold if not for the support from the powerful establishment, the cricketer-turned-politician said he is the country’s democratically elected prime minister and so the institutions back him.The PDM has set a January 31 deadline for Khan to step down or face a long march to Islamabad. The coalition pledged that it will make sure that there is no interference of the institutions of “the establishment and intelligence” in politics and at the same time it will make the security institutions stronger on the professional lines.Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz supremo and three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, 70, has been repeatedly blaming Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and spy agency ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed of meddling in Pakistan’s political affairs. Sharif was ousted from power in 2017 by the Supreme Court court on graft charges. The PML-N chief, currently out on bail, has been living in London since November last year after he was allowed by the courts and the government to go there for a period of eight weeks for medical treatment. But he did not come back, while his lawyers told the court that he was still recovering. Khan said the Opposition does not want to hold talks with the government and is instead pressuring the Army to send a democratic government packing. This can be called treason, he said.The real reason, Khan said, is that the Opposition wants all cases against them to be withdrawn and they be given an NRO-like concession. National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRP) was issued by former military dictator Pervez Musharraf to withdraw cases against Benazir Bhutto in 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-says-army-works-under-him-report/story-tXfetw116ovYqreg8sz4BM.html
19-12-2020||World||China to inoculate frontline workers first with Covid-19 vaccines||China will begin its Covid-19 inoculation programme by first vaccinating some key priority groups, including those involved in medical treatment and disease control, within the winter-spring period, before starting a mass roll out, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Saturday.The vaccination programme will also cover those who plan to work or study in counties and regions with medium or high risks of exposure to the virus, Cui Gang, an official with NHC’s disease control department, told reporters. This will help relieve the pressure on China in preventing and controlling imported Covid-19 cases, and lower the risks of domestic outbreaks of the epidemic, the official said. In a two-step vaccination drive, the vaccines will be first given to the priority groups, including those engaged in handling imported cold-chain products, and people working in sectors such as port inspection and quarantine, aviation, public transport, fresh market, medical treatment and disease control, said Cui.There is no word yet on the mass roll out of the vaccine programme and no announcement has been made about the government approval of various vaccines under trial.China has roped in more than a dozen countries, including Brazil, to conduct the final phase trials of its Covid-19 vaccines. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain have approved a vaccine developed by Chinese state-owned Sinopharm. Chinese officials say the coronavirus has been largely controlled in the country and herd immunity can be built with gradual roll out of the vaccination programme covering most of its population. The health officials said over a million people had been given vaccines under emergency use provision. The officials, who took part in Saturday’s press briefing, said no major side effects were reported during the trials. China has been focusing on developing five types of vaccines. In total, 11 vaccine candidates are at different stages of testing at home and abroad, Yang Sheng, Deputy Director of the National Medical Products Administration’s drug registration bureau told media earlier. China has joined COVAX, an international vaccine alliance. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said nine candidate vaccines, including two from China, are currently being evaluated for inclusion in the COVAX Facility. COVAX is co-led by Gavi, an international vaccine alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the WHO. Its aim is to accelerate the development and manufacture of vaccine. Zheng Zhongwei, head of China’s vaccine development task force, said China’s annual capacity to make Covid-19 vaccines was expected to reach 610 million doses this year and one billion doses by 2021, according to official media reports here. The novel coronavirus which originated from China’s Wuhan city last year has claimed 1.6 million lives and infected more than 75 million people globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-inoculate-frontline-workers-first-with-covid-19-vaccines/story-tjvFQVPVBylj5GVBizBCuJ.html

It appears, in this instance, FAA and Boeing were attempting to cover up important information that may have contributed to the 737 MAX tragedies.”The report citing a whistleblower who alleged Boeing officials encouraged test pilots to “remember, get right on that pickle switch” prior to the exercise that resulted in pilot reaction in approximately four seconds, while another pilot in a separate test reacted in approximately 16 seconds.The account was corroborated during an FAA staff interview, the committee added.Numerous reports have found Boeing failed to adequately consider how pilots respond to cockpit emergencies in its development of the 737 MAX.Boeing said Friday it takes “seriously the committee’s findings and will continue to review the report in full.”The FAA said Friday it was “carefully reviewing the document, which the committee acknowledges contains a number of unsubstantiated allegations.”The agency added it is “confident that the safety issues that played a role in the tragic (737 MAX) accidents involving Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 have been addressed through the design changes required and independently approved by the FAA and its partners.”Senate Commerce Committee chairman Roger Wicker said the report “details a number of significant examples of lapses in aviation safety oversight and failed leadership in the FAA.” The committee also said “multiple independent whistleblowers contacted the committee to allege FAA senior management was complicit in determining the 737 MAX training certification level prior to any evaluation.”Boeing resisted requiring simulator training for pilots before operating the 737 MAX but reversed course in January.The report also noted Southwest Airlines was able to operate more than 150,000 flights carrying 17.2 million passengers on jets without confirmation that required maintenance had been completed.The Senate report said the Southwest flights “put millions of passengers at potential risk.” Southwest said Friday it was aware of the report and added “we do not tolerate any relaxing of standards that govern ultimate safety across our operation.”Boeing still faces an ongoing criminal probe into the MAX. The committee said its review was “constrained due to the continued criminal investigation”Last month, the FAA approved the 737 MAX’s return to service and flights have resumed in Brazil. The first U.S. 737 MAX commercial flight with paying passengers is set for Dec. 29.Last month, the Senate committee unanimously a bill to reform how FAA certifies new airplanes and grant new protections for whistleblowers, among other reforms, while the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-inappropriately-coached-pilots-in-737-max-testing-us-senate-report/story-akpEzDJ67T43utUcGisRSJ.html

Most of Thailand’s recent cases have been imported.Thailand has kept infections at just 4,331 cases and 60 deaths, but its tourism-reliant economy has suffered from a travel ban imposed since April to curb the outbreak.The country on Thursday further eased restrictions to allow more foreign tourists to return.The government predicts about 8 million foreign tourists in 2021 after 6.7 million expected this year. Last year’s foreign visitors were a record of nearly 40 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-reports-jump-in-local-coronavirus-infections-linked-to-shrimp-market/story-MYBYSMvVGXitvPEntxdn0H.html

Ten people died on the scene, while four others later succumbed to their wounds, he said.A suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance gate of a stadium in the city of Galkayo on Friday, where Roble was expected to speak about the upcoming presidential election. The Islamist extremist group Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack, according to a broadcast on Radio Andalus, which supports the militant group.The Al-Qaeda-linked militants have waged an insurgency in Somalia since 2006 in a bid to impose their version of Islamic law. Al-Shabab continues to carry out suicide bombings and other attacks in the Horn of Africa country ahead of elections scheduled for early next year.US President Donald Trump earlier this month ordered most US forces to leave Somalia by early 2021. About 700 US troops are in Somalia on what is largely a counter-terrorism mission.The regional commander of an elite US-trained force that has helped build up Somalia’s weak security forces and his deputy also died in the attack, the New York Times reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-bomber-kills-14-in-attack-aimed-at-somali-pm/story-QIKxGUKML10WQlWS8Q1cBN.html

She said there are no casualties among civilians in the area.A NATO official confirmed the attack and said initial reports indicated that the airfield was not damaged.No one has immediately claimed responsibility. In April, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for five rocket attacks on the base. There were no casualties.The IS also has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in the capital Kabul in recent months, including on educational institutions that killed 50 people, most of them students.Violence in Afghanistan has spiked even as the Taliban and Afghan government negotiators hold talks in Qatar, trying to hammer out a peace deal that could put an end to decades of war. At the same time, The Taliban have waged bitter battles against IS fighters, particularly in eastern Afghanistan, while continuing their insurgency against government forces.Earlier this week, US Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, held an unannounced meeting with Taliban leaders in Doha to discuss military aspects of last February’s US-Taliban agreement.The agreement, signed in Qatar where the Taliban maintain a political office, was intended to set the stage for direct peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.After talks with the Taliban, Milley flew to Kabul to consult with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. He said he emphasized to both parties the need to rapidly reduce levels of violence across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-base-in-afghanistan-hit-by-rockets-no-casualties-reported/story-yszQsmRozyYdYxVP50hvaN.html

The government will take the advice of the Health Ministry regarding the percentage of people who need to be vaccinated,” Mohamed Azmin was quoted as saying by Bernama.Pfizer and their German partners BioNTech have supply deals with several countries including the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and Britain.They expect to produce globally up to 50 million doses of vaccines in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.More than 150 potential vaccines are being developed and tested globally to stop the Covid-19 pandemic, with 48 in human trials, the WHO says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-to-receive-first-batch-of-pfizer-vaccine-in-february/story-aiuJyat36JIUftXNLO8A0I.html

Even so, infection rates are likely to remain high for some time.More than 1.1 million people have been vaccinated in the US, UK, China and Russia, according to Bloomberg data, with the European Union expected to approve its first shot this coming week. As many as three vaccines could be available in the West by year-end, leaving governments and scientists hopeful the pandemic could start to turn a corner in the first half of 2021.“The one big victory we had about this outbreak was the extraordinary performance of getting vaccines available in less than a year,” Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview.While China has also deployed vaccines, it and other Asian nations have effectively parried the pandemic with measures such as mass testing, masks and social distancing.With older people and health-care workers among the priority groups in the vaccine drive, a decrease in the number of deaths and hospitalizations will likely be the first sign the inoculations are having an impact. But with little known about how well the shots might prevent transmission, it could take much longer to bring down infection rates.“The numbers of deaths should start to decrease slowly as the number vaccinated increases,” said Graham Medley, a professor of infectious disease modeling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the UK government’s Covid-19 advisory panel. But “if the vaccines do not stop transmission, then we will not see the numbers of infections change much.”With more than 310,000 deaths from Covid-19, the US has the most fatalities. Infections in the US have topped 17 million, with more than a million new cases occurring in the past week alone. More than 3,600 Americans died Wednesday, according to John Hopkins University.Across Europe, nearly 376,000 people have died from Covid-19, according to the latest weekly figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, with Italy and the UK suffering the most fatalities. The delay from the EU in approving the first vaccine has led to frustration from some corners, particularly in Germany, where the leading Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE shot was pioneered.European countries have moved in and out of lockdown as governments sought to contain rising infection rates and protect health systems in the face of additional winter pressures. Germany re-introduced lockdown measures this week, with all non-essential shops closed, after the country recorded its highest number of new cases since the pandemic began. In the UK, more than half the country is under the strictest curbs, with full shutdowns planned in Wales and Northern Ireland after Christmas.The UK and US both cleared the Pfizer vaccine this month, with the US also approving a second shot from Moderna Inc. on Friday. A third vaccine from AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford may be approved in the UK before the end of the year, or in early 2021. Together, the shots comprise a significant portion of global supplies and would go some way to getting the pandemic under control once deployed at scale.Even so, countries may need to keep social distancing restrictions in place through March or April to prevent hospitals from getting overwhelmed, said James Naismith, a professor of structural biology at Oxford University. Warmer weather, which would let people spend more time outside, should help Europe turn a corner by late spring, he said.“It’s a seesaw, and we’ll be on that seesaw until the vaccine changes the rules of the game,” said Naismith. “Hopefully by the time we get to spring, we can have a permanently lower level of restrictions. We may not get rid of them all at once, but the restrictions should be less.”The pace of change will partly depend on whether more vaccines get approved and the level of vaccine hesitancy among populations. Germany is planning to administer 11 million to 13 million doses in the first quarter -- assuming the front-runner shots get cleared -- but it could accelerate that schedule if regulators sign off on vaccines from developers such as AstraZeneca and CureVac NV, Health Minister Jens Spahn said at a press conference Friday.Still, it will take months before everyone who wants a shot will be able to get one, Spahn said, adding that measures like social distancing, hand-washing and mask-wearing will be necessary for the foreseeable future.How quickly the world emerges from the pandemic will also depend on how soon developing nations get vaccines, said David King, the UK’s former chief scientific adviser.“Where will we be by Easter? I think we’ll still be on the road,” said King. “We have the problem in a globalized economy that we actually depend on the health of people in other countries,” and developing nations will inevitably have last dibs on a vaccine.Things could get worse before they get better. As governments relax rules over Christmas, there’s the potential for infection rates to surge like they did in the US after Thanksgiving, leading to more deaths, according to Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. It’s really important people remember they could get a vaccine soon, he said.“I understand pandemic fatigue. I have that,” said Osterholm, who is advising President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team on the virus. But people must keep following the rules for the “few short months” until vaccines are more widely available, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-looks-to-spring-for-virus-relief-as-vaccinations-start/story-0BXNoUMkMIQhWoirAc7PjJ.html

US-Russia ties have been strained by issues ranging from conflicts in Syria to Ukraine, as well as allegations of Russian interference in US politics, which Moscow denies.Hackers believed to be working for Russia are accused of wide-ranging hacks of US government agencies and a private companies. Pompeo said on Friday it was “pretty clearly” evident that Russia was involved in the attacks that have sent computer network security teams worldwide scrambling to limit the damage.The Kremlin denies Russian involvement.At his annual news conference on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he hoped U.S. President-elect Joe Biden would help resolve some of the difficult issues in relations between Moscow and Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-halt-work-at-two-consulates-in-russia-after-covid-19-drawdown/story-GWpdJ20l2UgG8j8D2fLl4I.html
19-12-2020||World||Google blames Gmail, YouTube outage on error in User ID system||Google diagnosed a widespread outage that knocked out major services earlier this week, such as Gmail and YouTube, as a mistake with its system for identifying people online.Alphabet Inc.’s Google has several tools that enable it to verify and track logged-in users. In October, the company began moving those tools to a new file storage system, and in the process misreported portions of the data, according to a Friday post. That caused several of its services to go down for 47 minutes Monday morning, a rare technical misstep.Google’s explanation comes amid heightened cybersecurity vigilance. A hack on software provider SolarWinds Corp. has exposed companies including Microsoft Corp. and multiple US government agencies. A Google spokeswoman said on Friday that the internet giant has found no evidence the SolarWinds hack affected Alphabet or Google’s systems.About 15% of requests sent to Google’s cloud storage service were disrupted during the Monday outage, the company said. The cloud division offers an identification service similar to one from Okta Inc.On Tuesday, Google’s Gmail service had another disruption. The company attributed this to an issue with data migration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-blames-gmail-youtube-outage-on-error-in-user-id-system/story-akl2fyw87AXuMlGwIp5dxI.html
19-12-2020||World||‘So proud’: Dolly Parton’s association with Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine||US’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday approved its second vaccine candidate from Moderna against the coronavirus disease for emergency use. The vaccine, which has an efficiency rate of 94.1% and is bringing hope and good tidings to a world ravaged by the pandemic, has had a generous benefactor in Dolly Parton, known for her hit country numbers.Parton had announced in April that she has donated $1 million to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, after her good friend Dr Naji Abumrad, a professor of surgery at the university, told her about the work researchers were doing to come up with an effective Covid-19 vaccine. A part of her donation eventually went into funding the initial research for Moderna’s vaccine. “I just felt so proud to have been part of that little seed money that will hopefully grow into something great and help to heal this world,” she said on BBC One’s The One Show in November.Mark Denison, a professor of pathology, microbiology and immunology at Vanderbilt, told the New York Times that the contribution from the Dolly Parton Covid-19 Research Fund had helped finance the early stages of the vaccine trial before the US federal government’s investment of $1 million came through. Parton’s contribution is also funding a convalescent plasma study at Vanderbilt University. “Her money helped us develop the test that we used to first show that the Moderna vaccine was giving people a good immune response that might protect them,” Denison was quoted by NYT in November. The Jolene hitmaker is no stranger to the world of philanthropy as she has previously funded charities working with AIDS, and her Imagination library runs a book gifting program for children in five countries. Parton’s latest contributions have propelled her to new heights amongst her online fandom, many of whom have taken to social media to praise the country star. The Moderna vaccine is very similar to the one developed by Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech, both use messenger RNA technology. However, the Moderna vaccine is easier to store since it does not need to be kept at freezing temperatures. The coronavirus pandemic has paralysed the United States, which has been logging 216,000 new cases to its tally every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/so-proud-dolly-parton-s-association-with-moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-ZXYkfOJHSEZtqFlEuLxNgK.html

19-12-2020||World||Joe Biden’s transition team expresses concern over tensions with Defense Department||US President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team on Friday expressed concern regarding an ‘abrupt halt’ in cooperation with the Defense Department, according to The Hill.US media reported that acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller ordered a halt in cooperation with Biden’s transition amid frustration within President Donald Trump’s administration with the President-elect’s team.“We were concerned to learn this week about an abrupt halt in the already limited cooperation there, and as indicated by Department of Defense (DoD) earlier today, we expect that decision will be reversed,” Biden transition executive director Yohannes Abraham said in a briefing.Abraham also refuted claims of mutual agreement on any holiday break, saying there was no time to spare in continuing briefings and other engagements during this period.During his briefing, Abraham mentioned that the team has met isolated resistance in some corners including the DoD, and said that the cancelled meetings had ‘immediately and appropriately escalated’ the issue.The Pentagon acknowledged that about 20 meetings with 40 officials were being rescheduled until after January 1, but insisted that cooperation with Biden’s team was continuing, saying that the change was part of a mutually agreed pause for the holiday season, The Hill reported.“After the mutually agreed upon holiday pause, which begins tomorrow, we will continue with the transition and rescheduled meetings from today...Again, I remain committed to a full and transparent transition -- this is what our nation expects and the DoD will deliver AS IT ALWAYS HAS,” said Miller in a statement on Friday.The acting Defense Secretary also insisted that the Department has not cancelled or declined any interview with the Biden transition and that 139 meetings with 265 officials have already been conducted, according to The Hill.Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported the Trump administration was blocking meetings between transition officials and intelligence agencies that fall under the Pentagon’s control, including the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency.This comes after the US Electoral College certified Biden’s win in the presidential elections, amid repeated allegations of voter fraud made by Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-transition-team-expresses-concern-over-tensions-with-defense-department/story-SdsxISodEht66QTmVOUmsO.html
19-12-2020||World||South Africa identifies new coronavirus strain causing surge in cases||South Africa has identified a new variant of the coronavirus that is driving a second wave of infections, the health minister said on Friday, days after Britain said it had also found a new variant of the virus boosting cases. “We have convened this public briefing today to announce that a variant of the SARS-COV-2 Virus - currently termed 501.V2 Variant - has been identified by our genomics scientists here in South Africa,” Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize tweeted. “The evidence that has been collated, therefore, strongly suggests that the current second wave we are experiencing is being driven by this new variant,” Mkhize added.South Africa has recorded the highest number of coronavirus infections in Africa, approaching the 900,000 mark, with over 20,000 related deaths. A resurgence in cases saw the government tighten restrictions on society this week. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday it was in touch with the South African researchers who identified the new variant. The global body added there was no indication there were changes in the way the new strain of the virus was behaving.“We are working with them with our SARS-COV-2 Virus evolution working group. They are growing the virus in the country and they’re working with researchers to determine any changes in the behaviour of the virus itself in terms of transmission,” WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove told a news conference in Geneva.South African health authorities said the new variant seemed to spread faster than the previous iteration, but that it was too early to tell its severity and whether current vaccines would work against it.“In the UK they have also identified a new variant ... there are quite a few similarities between the two lineages ... there are also a similar number of mutations” said Prof Tulio de Oliviera, a member of government’s genomics consortium in a televised briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-identifies-new-coronavirus-strain-causing-surge-in-cases/story-wWLSSuaKmlr3jCjO4eX7zM.html
19-12-2020||World||Hackers’ broad attack sets cyber experts worldwide scrambling to defend networks||Suspected Russian hackers who broke into US government agencies also spied on less high-profile organizations, including groups in Britain, a US internet provider and a county government in Arizona, according to web records and a security source.More details were revealed on Friday of the cyber espionage campaign that has computer network security teams worldwide scrambling to limit the damage as a senior official in the outgoing administration of US President Donald Trump explicitly acknowledged Russia’s role in the hack for the first time.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on the Mark Levin radio show “I think it’s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.” Networking gear maker Cisco Systems Inc said a limited number of machines in some of its labs had been found with malicious software on them, without saying if anything had been taken. A person familiar with the company’s ongoing probe said fewer than 50 were compromised. In Britain, a small number of organizations were compromised and not in the public sector, a security source said.Shares in cyber security companies FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks and Crowdstrike Holdings rose on Friday as investors bet that the spate of disclosures from Microsoft Corp and others would boost demand for security technology.Reuters identified Cox Communications Inc and Pima County, Arizona government as victims of the intrusion by running a publicly available coding script from researchers at Moscow-based private cybersecurity firm Kaspersky. The hack hijacked ubiquitous network management software made by SolarWinds Corp. Kaspersky decrypted online web records left behind by the attackers.The breaches of US government agencies, first revealed by Reuters on Sunday, hit the Department of Homeland Security, the Treasury Department, State Department and Department of Energy. In some cases the breaches involved monitoring emails but it was unclear what hackers did while infiltrating networks, cybersecurity experts said.Trump has not said anything publicly about the intrusion. He was being briefed “as needed,” White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern told reporters. National security adviser Robert O’Brien was leading interagency meetings daily, if not more often, he said.“They’re working very hard on mitigation and making sure that our country is secure. We will not get into too many details because we’re just not going to tell our adversaries what we do to combat these things,” Morgenstern said.No determinations have been made on how to respond or who was responsible, a senior US official said.SolarWinds, which disclosed its unwitting role at the center of the global hack on Monday, has said that up to 18,000 users of its Orion software downloaded a compromised update containing malicious code planted by the attackers. The attack was believed to be the work of an “outside nation state,” SolarWinds said in a regulatory disclosure.People familiar with the matter have said the hackers were believed to be working for the Russian government. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the allegations.On Friday, US Representative Stephen Lynch, head of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform panel’s national security subcommittee, said the information provided by the Trump administration was “very disappointing.”“This hack was so big in scope that even our cybersecurity experts don’t have a real sense yet in terms of the breadth of the intrusion itself,” adding that it would take some time to fully vet all the agencies and targets.The breach appeared to provide President-elect Joe Biden with an immediate headache when he takes office on Jan 20. His transition team’s executive director Yohannes Abraham told reporters on Friday there would be “substantial costs” and the incoming administration “will reserve the right to respond at a time and in a manner of our choosing, often in close coordination with our allies and partners.”Microsoft, one of the thousands of companies to receive the malicious update, said it had notified more than 40 customers whose networks were further infiltrated by the hackers.Around 30 of those customers were in the United States, Microsoft said, with the remaining victims found in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, Britain, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Most worked with information technology companies, some think tanks and government organizations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hackers-broad-attack-sets-cyber-experts-worldwide-scrambling-to-defend-networks/story-y73X2g0UYFAhiATLd53MSO.html
19-12-2020||World||US clears Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use||The fight against Covid-19 received a major shot in the arm on Friday as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) to a second vaccine against the deadly coronavirus disease. Jointly developed by Moderna, a Massachusetts-based pharma company, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Covid-19 vaccine has been authorised for use on people aged 18 years and older, and has joined Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine, already being administered since Monday, on the frontlines of the battle against the virus.Moderna’s vaccine is similar to the one created jointly by Pfizer and BioNTech in many ways. They were both developed using the same cutting-edge mRNA technology and need to be administered in two doses, primary and booster. But they are also different: the Moderna vaccine is more convenient to store and transport; common refrigerators would serve the purpose instead of the super-coolers needed for the Pfizer-BioNTech vials. Also, the interval between the two doses is longer by a week.“There is much we still do not know about Sars-CoV-2 and Covid-19,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the most respected voice in the US on the pandemic and the head of the NIAID. “However, we do know that this vaccine is safe and can prevent symptomatic Covid-19 and severe disease.”Moderna expects to supply between 100 million and 125 million doses globally in the first quarter of 2021, with 85-100 million of those doses available in the US.The US food and drug regulator granted EUA to Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine a day after an advisory board of outside experts had cleared it overwhelmingly. Its distribution, however, will depend on one more clearance, from the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is expected to follow shortly.The United States is witnessing a continuing spike in Covid-19 cases. More than 233,000 new infections were reported in the last 24 hours and 3,270 fatalities. Dr. Fauci and other experts have warned of a grim winter with far more cases likely. More than 17 million Covid-19 cases have been reported in the US so far with at least 313,246 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-clears-moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use/story-scVlG4mqZdsfERf5No8pHP.html
19-12-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine update: US approves Moderna candidate, Odisha prepares for inoculation drive||Countries around the globe are gearing up to vaccinate citizens against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The US on Friday approved its second vaccine candidate, Moderna, for emergency use. The European Medicines Agency too is on the final leg of its approval process and is expected to come out with a decision on the Moderna vaccine on January 6, according to Reuters. The global vaccine alliance COVAX saw its member country sign deals for vaccine procurement for emergency use. With the global caseload nearing 75 million the world is racing against time to immunize its population against a virus that has been wreaking havoc for more than a year now. Here are the latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccine front:1. US regulator Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given approval to the Moderna vaccine for emergency use. This is the second approval for an inoculation drive in the United States and the first for Moderna. Data released by Moderna on November 30 of the late-stage trial shows that the vaccine has an efficiency rate of 94.1%, according to Reuters. Both Canada and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are currently slated to come out with their approvals soon. 2. AstraZeneca has started the process of seeking emergency use authorization in Britain and India. According to the data published by the pharmaceutical giant of the late-stage trial, their vaccine has an efficacy rate of 70% and as much as 90% for a subgroup of trial participants who were given a half dose first, followed by a full dose, reported Reuters. India is currently conducting an accelerated review and has asked for more data.3. Colombia, which is a part of the COVAX alliance, has signed deals with pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and AstraZeneca to provide 20 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, Reuters reported on Friday. The first group to be vaccinated will consist of healthcare workers, people over the age of 60, and those with pre-existing conditions, the country’s health minister said to Reuters. Colombia plans on providing free coronavirus vaccination for free under its national vaccination plan.4. The Odisha government has completed its database collection for the first phase of Covid-19 inoculation, reported news agency ANI on Saturday. The government has identified 3.2 lakh healthcare workers who are eligible for emergency vaccination. They have also demarcated 8,267 vaccinators and 29,276 centres to help carry out the vaccination process. For storage purposes, the state has assessed a total of 1,222 cold chain points across the state and readied 1,796 Ice Lined Refrigerators (ILRs) for transportation and 1,771 deep freezers for safe transportation of the vaccine all across the state, ANI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-us-approves-moderna-candidate-orissa-prepares-for-inoculation-drive/story-bGr0C9NdtVIZCfpAokGMMJ.html

In working with our public officials and out of an abundance of caution, a couple of employees have quarantined resulting in a temporary workforce reduction at the monument and its temporary closure,” he said.Bernhardt tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, a representative for the department said at the time, making him the latest in a series of Trump administration officials - including Trump himself - to have been infected by the virus.Bernhardt was asymptomatic and would continue to work while in quarantine, Interior said at the time.The Washington Monument, where visitors normally crowd into a small elevator to ascend to the top, is a DC tourist attraction. It had been closed for months after the onset of the pandemic, but reopened in October with new limits on the number of people allowed in the elevator at one time.The Washington Post, which first reported this story, said Bernhardt often led private tours of the monument after hours, including once earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iconic-washington-monument-shut-after-covid-infected-interior-secretary-s-visit/story-aJMfCPbTDmnLMf92NdzfWM.html
19-12-2020||World||Poorer nations to get virus vaccine early next year: WHO||Poorer countries will begin to receive coronavirus vaccination doses early next year from a facility created to ensure fair access, the World Health Organization and its partners said Friday.Almost two billion doses of candidate vaccines have been secured for the Covax facility, run by the WHO along with the Gavi vaccine alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).Countries including the United States and Britain have already begun to roll out a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, with another developed by Moderna expected to gain widespread approval soon.Neither drug is included in the two billion doses, but the WHO said it was in discussions with both companies.“The arrangements announced today will enable all participating economies to have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021,” the WHO, Gavi and CEPI said in a statement.Shipments of enough vaccines to protect health and social care workers would be delivered “in the first half of 2021 to all participating economies who have requested doses in this timeframe,” the statement said.It said deliveries were contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries’ readiness for delivery.20 percent target for 2021 WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference that “light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter”.“But we will only truly end the pandemic if we end it everywhere at the same time, which means it’s essential to vaccinate some people in all countries, rather than all people in some countries,” he said.The statement said that by the end of the year, 20 percent of the populations in participating countries should be covered.The WHO revealed Friday that it had signed an agreement with US pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson for 500 million doses of a candidate drug, adding to agreements already signed with AstraZeneca, Novavax and Sanofi-GSK.The UN health agency has previously said it was willing to include vaccines developed in China and Russia should those drugs prove safe and effective.CEPI chief Richard Hatchett said massive research and development efforts were paying off.“We now have safe and effective vaccines that can protect against Covid-19 and a clear pathway to securing two billion doses for the populations at greatest risk all around the world,” he said.Gavi chief Seth Berkley meanwhile hailed the “unprecedented speed and scale” of the project.“Securing access to doses of a new vaccine for both higher-income and lower-income countries, at roughly the same time and during a pandemic, is a feat the world has never achieved before,” he said.Covax is a collaboration between organisations, companies and 190 countries -- but neither the United States nor Russia have joined so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poorer-nations-to-get-virus-vaccine-early-next-year-who/story-xpF9BqjC3dnFRvWa4xotfO.html
19-12-2020||World||President Trump signs bill that could remove Chinese stocks from US||President Donald Trump on Friday signed legislation that could kick Chinese companies off of US exchanges unless American regulators can review their financial audits, a move likely to further escalate tensions between the two countries.The measure, which could affect corporate giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc., serves as another parting shot at Beijing before Trump leaves office in January.The president has long railed against China for what he calls unfair trading practices, and slapped tariffs on billions of dollars in imports. But his rhetoric sharpened this year as he blamed Beijing for the global coronavirus pandemic -- a central issue in his electoral loss to Joe Biden as Trump was widely criticized for his handling of the outbreak.The de-listing law won bipartisan support in the House early this month after easily clearing the US Senate in May. While it applies to any foreign company, the bill’s sponsors have said their goal was to target China.Chinese firms for years have used American capital markets and dollar-based finance as a key funding component to grow their businesses. While the measure includes a phase-in period, with penalties kicking in after three straight years of noncompliance, it could impose real damage on Chinese companies that fail to meet the audit standards.“US policy is letting China flout rules that American companies play by, and it’s dangerous,” Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, a lead sponsor of the new law, said in a statement.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing after passage of the House bill that China was “against politicizing securities regulation” and urged cooperation to protect investors’ rights.“It will undermine global investors’ confidence in the US capital markets and will undermine the US capital markets’ global standing and hurt US interests,” Hua said.Trump’s signing of the law capped a flurry of recent steps against China, including guidelines that would limit travel visas for 92 million Communist Party members. Any of them with a 10-year visa would now see it reduced to one month.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said that customs officers at American ports would impound “shipments containing cotton and cotton products originating from” the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps., a military-affiliated entity that’s one of China’s largest producers. This follows earlier US action against the company that bars it from making any transaction with American companies and citizens.Watershed MomentThe new law marks a watershed moment in a long-running dispute over China’s refusal to let the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board examine audits of firms whose shares trade in the US The requirement for the inspections by the agency, which was created in the wake of the Enron Corp. accounting scandal, is meant to prevent fraud and wrongdoing that could wipe out shareholders.In addition to requiring companies to allow US inspectors to review their financial audits, the measure -- introduced by Kennedy and Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat -- requires firms to disclose whether they are under government control.Van Hollen said in a statement that the delisting bill would protect people who “have been cheated out of their money after investing in seemingly legitimate Chinese companies that are not held to the same standards” as other public companies. “This bill rights that wrong, ensuring that all companies on the US exchanges abide by the same rules,” he said.Implementing the law falls heavily on the US Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump appointee, had been racing to propose rules before he stepped down by year’s end that would trigger the delisting of companies that don’t comply with US auditing rules. Clayton announced Friday that he was abandoning that effort to ensure that the agency’s plan conforms with the just-signed legislation.“While I am disappointed that I will not have an opportunity to consider the staff’s recommendation, I am pleased with the bipartisan, multi-agency approach to addressing these critical investor protection issues,” Clayton said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-signs-bill-that-could-remove-chinese-stocks-from-us/story-IiBFwBeTG4TjzXFTAj812I.html
19-12-2020||World||US clears Moderna vaccine for Covid-19, 2nd shot in arsenal||The US added a second Covid-19 vaccine to its arsenal Friday, boosting efforts to beat back an outbreak so dire that the nation is regularly recording more than 3,000 deaths a day.Much-needed doses are set to arrive Monday after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of the vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. and the National Institutes of Health.The move marks the world’s first authorization for Moderna’s shots. The vaccine is very similar to one from Pfizer Inc. and Germany’s BioNTech that’s now being dispensed to millions of health care workers and nursing home residents as the biggest vaccination drive in US history starts to ramp up.Also Read: Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine ‘overwhelmingly approved’, distribution to start soon, says US President TrumpThe two work “better than we almost dared to hope,” NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins told The Associated Press. “Science is working here, science has done something amazing.”Early results of large, still unfinished studies show both vaccines appear safe and strongly protective although Moderna’s is easier to handle since it doesn’t need to be stored at ultra-frozen temperatures.A second vaccine represents a ray of hope amid despair as the virus continues to spread unabated even before holiday gatherings that are certain to further fuel the outbreak.The scourge has claimed more than 312,000 US lives and killed 1.7 million people worldwide. New cases in the US are running at over 216,000 per day on average. Deaths per day have hit all-time highs, eclipsing 3,600 on Wednesday.California has emerged as one of the most lethal hot spots, with hospitals running out of intensive care beds and ambulances lining up outside emergency rooms in scenes reminiscent of the calamity around New York City last spring. California on Friday reported over 41,000 new cases and 300 more deaths.When New York’s hospitals were in crisis, health care workers from across the country came to help out. This time, “there’s no cavalry coming” because so many hospitals are swamped, said Dr. Marc Futernick, an emergency room physician in Los Angeles.The nation is scrambling to expand vaccinations as rapidly as Moderna and Pfizer can churn out doses. Moderna’s is for people 18 and older, Pfizer’s starts at age 16.It’s just the beginning of “what we hope will be a big push to get this terrible virus behind us, although it will take many more months to get to all Americans,” Collins said.Even with additional candidates in the pipeline, there won’t be enough for the general population until spring, and shots will be rationed in the meantime. And while health workers are enthusiastically embracing vaccination, authorities worry the public may need more reassurance to ensure more people get in line when it’s their turn.Also Read: Covid vaccine can turn people into ‘crocodiles’: Brazilian President Bolsonaro“Frankly if we don’t succeed in getting 80% or so of Americans immunized against Covid-19 by the middle of this 2021 year, we have the risk that this epidemic could go on and on and on,” Collins said.He is especially concerned that accurate information about the shots’ value reaches communities of color, which have been hard-hit by Covid-19 yet also are wary after years of health care disparities and research abuses.To try to help instill confidence, Vice President Mike Pence received the Pfizer-BioNTech shot on live TV Friday, along with Surgeon General Jerome Adams.FDA’s decision could help pave the way for other countries that are considering the Moderna vaccine, the first-ever regulatory clearance for the small Cambridge, Massachusetts, company. European regulators could authorize its use as soon as Jan. 6. Britain, Canada and a few other countries already have cleared the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, with a European Union decision due Monday.“What we want to always remember is one size does not fit all. We want to have options,” said Dr. Paul Duprex of the University of Pittsburgh.Moderna has about 5.9 million doses ready for shipment set to begin over the weekend, according to Operation Warp Speed, the government’s vaccine development program. Injections of health workers and nursing home residents continue next week, before other essential workers and vulnerable groups are allowed to get in line.Both Moderna’s and Pfizer-BioNTech’s shots are so-called mRNA vaccines, made with a groundbreaking new technology. They don’t contain any coronavirus – meaning they cannot cause infection. Instead, they use a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spike protein on the surface of the virus, ready to attack if the real thing comes along.Their development less than a year after the coronavirus first emerged set a speed record, but Collins stressed that shouldn’t worry people. The speed was due to billions in company and government investments paired with years of earlier scientific research, not any cut corners.“The rigor of the analysis of these vaccines is unprecedented,” Collins said. “We’re not done with this but hope is on the way, and the hope comes from this scientific brain trust that has pulled out all the stops.”Experts are hoping the two vaccines together will “break the back of the pandemic” when combined with masks and other precautions, said Dr. Arnold Monto of the University of Michigan, who chaired an advisory committee that publicly debated the shots’ evidence ahead of FDA’s decisions.The FDA’s main messages:--Both the new Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot require two doses several weeks apart. The second dose must be from the same company as the first.--In a study of 30,000 volunteers, the Moderna vaccine was more than 94% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in people 18 and older. It also strongly protected older adults, who are most vulnerable.--The inoculated can’t throw away their masks as it’s not yet clear either vaccine prevents silent, symptomless virus spread. But there was a hint that Moderna’s shot might provide some protection against asymptomatic infection.--The Moderna study uncovered no major safety problems. Like with the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, expect sore arms, fever, fatigue and muscle aches, which are signs the immune system is revving up.--Moderna’s study turned up no severe allergic reactions, like the handful reported with the Pfizer-BioNTech shots in Britain and Alaska. The vaccines’ ingredients aren’t identical. Still, after any Covid-19 vaccination, people should stick around for 15 minutes – or 30 minutes if they have a history of severe allergies – so if they do have a reaction, it can be treated immediately.--Both vaccines remain experimental, and the government is closely monitoring safety in case rare problems crop up.--Additional studies are needed to tell if the vaccine should be used by children and pregnant women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-clears-moderna-vaccine-for-covid-19-2nd-shot-in-arsenal/story-bgGVPZHyH8dfIpsubfpegJ.html
19-12-2020||World||Emmanuel Macron blames his Covid-19 on negligence, bad luck||French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday blamed his Covid-19 on a combination of negligence and bad luck, urging his compatriots to stay safe as critics called out slip-ups in his behavior to prevent infection, from a close-quarters handshake to repeated big-group meals over the past week.In what looked like a self-shot video from the presidential retreat in Versailles where he was isolating, Macron said he was experiencing symptoms that included headaches, fatigue and a dry cough. He promised to give daily updates and be “totally transparent” about the evolution of his illness.“I am doing well,” the 42-year-old French leader said, speaking softly with a bottle of gel on the desk behind him and dressed casually in a turtleneck top. “Normally, there is no reason for it to evolve in a bad way.”Also Read: French President Emmanuel Macron has tested positive for Covid-19Macron said his infection “shows that the virus really can touch everyone, because I am very protected and am very careful.”“Despite everything I caught this virus — perhaps, doubtless, a moment of negligence, a moment of bad luck, too,” he said.A fellow European leader who spent time with Macron at an EU summit last week, Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic, tested positive for the virus Friday. Ten other leaders at the EU summit have since tested negative; others either aren’t getting tested or haven’t released results.U.S. President Donald Trump, who tested positive for the coronavirus and spent three days at Walter Reed Medical Center in early October, spoke with Macron on Thursday and wished him a speedy recovery, the White House said Friday. Several White House aides and members of Trump’s campaign staff tested positive after he did.In France, Macron’s diagnosis brought criticism that he had set a bad example as the country sees a new uptick in cases and doctors warn families to take precautions this holiday season — especially at the dinner table.Macron usually wears a mask and adheres to social distancing rules, and has insisted that his virus strategy is driven by science. But he has been captured on camera in recent days violating France’s virus-control guidelines.He shook hands and half-embraced the head of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Angel Gurria, at a meeting Monday. Both were masked, but Macron’s office acknowledged Friday the move was a “mistake.”In his video message Friday, the president suggested that his behavior had helped limit the spread of the virus.“Had I not respected the rules, the barrier measures, I would have caught it much faster and, most of all, I would have transmitted it in the preceding hours to many more people,” Macron said.Also Read: Macron met several world leaders before testing Covid-19 positive. Here’s the listHe urged people to “hold firm” and look after each other during the festive season, warning: “The virus is picking up, even stronger.”Last week, Macron spent two days in intense negotiations at the EU summit in Brussels with the leaders of the other 26 member countries. Video excerpts released by the EU showed the leaders spread out in a circle in a huge meeting room — Macron, and most of the other leaders, were not masked.Macron also hosted or took part in multiple large-group meals in the days before testing positive Thursday, including with members of his centrist party and rival politicians, while French people are currently advised to avoid gatherings larger than six people. His office has been contacting those present for the meals, but told some people sitting far from the president that they were not considered at risk.Macron office isn’t providing details of his treatment. He is staying at the presidential residence of La Lanterne in the former royal city of Versailles, tucked in a grove tightly guarded by police.Macron’s positive test comes as French health authorities are again seeing a rise in infections and are warning of more as French families prepare to get together for Christmas and New Year festivities. France reported another 18,254 new infections Thursday and its death toll is just under 60,000.France’s Pasteur Institute released a study Friday suggesting that meal times at home and in public are a major source of contamination. Pasteur epidemiologist Arnaud Fontanet said on France-Inter radio Friday that during the holidays, “we can see each other, simply not be too numerous, and at critical moments at meals, not too many people at the same table.”Macron took a test “as soon as the first symptoms appeared” on Thursday morning and will self-isolate for seven days, in line with national health authorities’ recommendations, the presidency said. Macron plans to continue working, and went ahead with a planned speech by videoconference Thursday.The French health minister suggested that Macron might have been infected at the EU summit in Brussels last week, but Macron had multiple meetings in Paris as well.France had Europe’s first virus case in January, but Macron’s government came under criticism for not having enough masks or tests and not confining the population quickly enough. A strict two-month lockdown brought infections down, and France sent children back to school and their parents back to work.But infections surged again this fall so he declared a new, softer lockdown in October aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals. The measures were relaxed slightly this week, though restaurants, tourist sites, gyms and some other facilities remain closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emmanuel-macron-blames-his-covid-19-on-negligence-bad-luck/story-Z9b0XmkvfXCZDquSJOYBAO.html
19-12-2020||World||China offers to work with Biden, warns of new ‘McCarthyism’||China’s top diplomat on Friday offered cooperation on key priorities of President-elect Joe Biden, warning that Beijing’s many US critics were creating an atmosphere of “McCarthyism” and ignoring common interests.Taking aim at the hawkish approach of President Donald Trump, Foreign Minister Wang Yi voiced hope for a return of talks and “mutual trust” between the world’s two largest economic powers after Biden takes over on January 20.“It is important that US policy toward China return to objectivity and sensibility as early as possible,” Wang said in a virtual address to the New York-based Asia Society.Wang said that China saw “space for cooperation” with Biden on three of the four issues he has identified as immediate priorities -- Covid-19, economic recovery and climate change. Biden’s fourth stated priority is racial equity.On the pandemic, Wang said Beijing and Washington could collaborate in manufacturing vaccines and assisting third countries.“We hope that we will expand cooperation and manage differences through dialogue,” Wang said.The Trump administration says that decades of US engagement have failed with China, accusing Beijing of rampantly stealing intellectual property, widespread espionage and coercion of other nations through its blitz of infrastructure projects.In recent months, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has terminated Chinese-funded exchange programs for Americans and tightened visa rules for Chinese students as well as members of the Communist Party and their families, likely affecting hundreds of millions of people.“We see McCarthyism resurging and jeopardizing normal international exchanges,” Wang said, referring to the witch hunt for communists purported to be in the US government led by Republican senator Joe McCarthy following World War II.Wang accused unnamed senior US officials of “irresponsible presumption of guilt and emotional lashing-out.”“They ignore the vast common interests and room for cooperation between the two countries and insist that China is a main threat,” Wang said.“This is like misaligning the buttons on clothing. They get things wrong at the very beginning.”New curbs on technology The Trump administration has shown no sign of tapering off its tough stance on China as it enters its final month.On Friday, the Commerce Department said it was imposing restrictions on 77 entities that will need special clearance to receive advanced US technology.The targeted entities include two prominent universities -- the Beijing Institute of Technology, which allegedly sought to secure US items to benefit China’s military, and Tianjin University, which was accused of stealing trade secrets.Four companies were also targeted for assisting China’s drive to map citizens’ DNA, a campaign that activists say is used to control minorities, especially Uighur Muslims.“China’s corrupt and bullying behavior both inside and outside its borders harms US national security interests, undermines the sovereignty of our allies and partners, and violates the human rights and dignity of ethnic and religious minority groups,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.Pompeo separately marked the anniversary of the discovery of the first Covid-19 case in Wuhan to highlight the initial silencing of doctors who sounded alarm over the illness that has since killed more than 1.6 million people worldwide.He accused China of continuing to obstruct an investigation into the virus by the World Health Organization, from which Trump has ordered a US withdrawal.“It is also peddling vaccines that lack essential data on safety and efficacy, due to a fundamental disregard for transparency and accountability regarding results from clinical trials,” Pompeo said as the United States began mass vaccinations developed after intense Western research.“Both actions put Chinese citizens, and the world, at risk,” Pompeo said.Biden, who invested significant time in diplomacy with China as vice president, has broadly agreed that Beijing poses a global challenge and has called for a tougher response on human rights.But he is expected to take a less bellicose tone than Trump, with his nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, speaking of potential cooperation on climate change and the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-offers-to-work-with-biden-warns-of-new-mccarthyism/story-jAoXVytbIWroC7O9uaxQ2H.html
19-12-2020||World||Conservative group ‘True the vote’ says it’s challenging residency of 364K Georgia voters||A conservative group said Friday that it’s challenging the eligibility of more than 364,000 Georgia voters before election officials in each of the state’s 159 counties ahead of January runoff elections that will decide control of the US Senate.The Texas-based True the Vote said it’s working with Georgia residents across the state to make challenges under a state law that allows any registered voter to challenge the eligibility of any other voter within the same county. It’s up to local election boards to determine whether those challenges have merit.The Georgia Democratic Party’s executive director, Scott Hogan, called the voter challenges “blatant efforts to suppress the vote.” An attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union said they violate federal law.Georgia’s status as an electoral battleground was proven in November when Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia since 1992. Now GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler both face runoff elections Jan. 5. If both lose to Democratic challenges John Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, Democrats will take control of the Senate.Lawsuits filed by allies of President Donald Trump after the Nov. 3 election failed to turn up proof of widespread voter fraud. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, has defended the election results. Still, many Republicans have refused to accept the outcome and have tried to cast doubt in the fairness of the Senate runoffs.“Ongoing debates about the November election throughout the country have Americans focused intently on improving the integrity of our elections and restoring the faith of voters,” Catherine Engelbrecht, president of True the Vote, said in a statement Friday. “Today we assisted concerned Georgia voters in taking a stand for the sanctity of every legal vote.”The group said voters are being challenged based on questions about their residency based on change of address data obtained from the US Postal Service.Election officials in Cobb County on Friday rejected complaints brought by Jason Shepherd, the county’s Republican chairman, and a local GOP activist that sought to call into question the registration of more than 46,000 voters. The elections board voted unanimously, the Marietta Daily Journal reported.A similar challenge targeting more than 4,000 voters in Muscogee County, which includes Columbus, was found to have probable cause Wednesday by county election officials, the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reported. That means anyone on the challenged list who attempts to vote will have to prove their eligibility — as will anyone challenged who mailed absentee ballots that have yet to be opened.State law says counties can’t certify their vote totals until they have decided all challenges to people who voted.Rejection of a similar challenge filed over the summer in Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, ended up before a Superior Court judge. The judge refused to order county election officials to reconsider in a brief ruling that said federal election law preempted Georgia law.The ACLU of Georgia sent a letter to county election officials across Georgia urging them to reject the challenges, which the group said violates a federal law that prohibits any systemic removal of voters from the rolls less than 90 days before an election.Not only is Georgia’s election less than three weeks ago, but early in-person voting in the state began Monday.“We write to warn all county Georgia elections officials that participating in this charade violates state and federal law,” wrote Sean Young, legal director of the ACLU of Georgia. “Accordingly, you must reject such challenges because they lack probable cause, and you cannot force hundreds of thousands of Georgia voters to answer these baseless charges as a condition for having their ballot counted.”Because the challenges are carried out at the local level, Raffensperger has no role even though he’s the state’s top elections official. In a statement, he did not endorse the residency challenges but said he supports “any effort that builds faith in our election system that follows the proper legal procedure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/conservative-group-true-the-vote-says-it-s-challenging-residency-of-364k-georgia-voters/story-go6JzfBkQ4wn6zEmZXoPGM.html

But me, I won’t get vaccinated.”“Some people say I’m giving a bad example. But to the imbeciles, to the idiots that say this, I tell them I’ve already caught the virus, I have the antibodies, so why get vaccinated?”There have been a small number of cases of apparent reinfection although there is no certainty over whether a person can be reinfected or how long immunity lasts.Bolsonaro caught the virus in July but recovered within three weeks.Brazil is in the middle of a second wave of coronavirus infections.After peaking in June to August cases had been dropping but that changed in November.On Thursday, Brazil surpassed 1,000 daily deaths from covid-19 for the first time since September.The country’s immunization program has been widely criticized for being late and chaotic, not least given Bolsonaro’s opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-can-turn-people-into-crocodiles-brazilian-president-bolsonaro/story-ZfW9R6mJoibVm1Z4TK3FcN.html
19-12-2020||World||Biden to get Pfizer vaccine shot on Monday, Harris may get the week after: Official||President-elect Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, will get their first dose of coronavirus vaccine on Monday, a transition official said.Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, will get their first shots the following week.Biden has said he would take the vaccine as soon as was appropriate and that he would do so in public to raise trust and awareness.Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, were vaccinated earlier Friday, as was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Government officials are among the first to get the shots as part of longstanding plans to protect continuity of government.Recent polls have shown that confidence in the vaccine is increasing but that many Americans still harbor doubts.President Donald Trump has said he will take the vaccine, but hasn’t said when. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Tuesday declined to set a timeline, or to commit to him getting it while still in office.On Thursday, the transition announced that Representative Cedric Richmond, who has been named one of Biden’s White House aides, has tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first known infection among the president-elect’s senior advisers.Biden was tested after Richmond’s infection was known, and the president-electe tested negative for Covid-19 on Thursday. The transition team said Biden did not have “close contact” as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control when they appeared together at a campaign event Tuesday in Georgia, Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-elect-joe-biden-to-get-pfizer-vaccine-shot-on-monday-kamala-harris-likely-to-get-dose-the-week-after/story-NfBzsnwClBGkEvjauKL3sI.html
19-12-2020||World||Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine is ‘approved’, says Donald Trump; FDA’s nod awaited||US President Donald Trump announced on Friday that approval has been granted to Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, clearing the way for the distribution of a second inoculation against the deadly coronavirus within days of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.“Moderna vaccine overwhelmingly approved,” Trump tweeted. “Distribution to start immediately.” He added that “vaccines are on their way” to Europe and other countries hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.Trump’s announcement came even as the world awaited the Moderna vaccine’s formal authorisation by the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA), according to news reports.According to a Bloomberg report, FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said the agency was working quickly towards authorising the vaccine, which a panel of outside advisers backed on Thursday in a 20-0 vote.Moderna’s two-dose vaccine is similar to the Pfizer-BioNTech one; both have been developed using the mRNA technology. But it is said that Moderna’s vaccine is more convenient to store as it can be kept in refrigerators commonly available at health care facilities. In contrast, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine vials need much colder temperatures for storage.Meanwhile, US vice-president Mike Pence took a Pfizer vaccination shot on camera, seeking to demonstrate its safety to Americans who are sceptical of vaccines. President-elect Joe Biden and former presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama have said they intend to take their shots publicly, to reassure people distrustful of vaccines.The United States is witnessing a sharp increase in new Covid-19 cases, with more than 233,000 infections and 3,270 deaths reported in the last 24 hours, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker.Frontline health care workers and residents of long-term nursing homes are being prioritised for vaccination, which began to be administered in the US on Monday with the Pfizer vaccine’s shots. Nearly 3 million would have been administered the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by the end of the week at 600 sites.Moderna, which developed its vaccine with US health agencies and received federal funding, plans to distribute 20 million doses this month in addition to the 25 million shots supplied by Pfizer-BioNTech. In all, Moderna has committed to supplying 200 million doses in the US by the second quarter of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine-is-approved-says-donald-trump-fda-s-nod-awaited/story-kWAHYqoJhUodi9vafh7i1J.html
