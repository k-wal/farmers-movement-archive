08-12-2020||World||‘Quite frankly shocking’: US virus deaths hit record levels||Deaths from Covid-19 in the US have soared to more than 2,200 a day on average, matching the frightening peak reached last April, and cases per day have eclipsed 200,000 on average for the first time on record, with the crisis all but certain to get worse because of the fallout from Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s.Virtually every state is reporting surges just as a vaccine appears days away from getting the go-ahead in the US.“The epidemic in the US is punishing. It’s widespread. It’s quite frankly shocking to see one to two persons a minute die in the US — a country with a wonderful, strong health system, amazing technological capacities,” said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s chief of emergencies.The virus is blamed for more than 280,000 deaths and almost 15 million confirmed infections in the United States.On Thursday, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel is widely expected to authorize emergency use of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine, and shots could begin almost immediately after that. Britain on Tuesday started dispensing the Pfizer vaccine, becoming the first country in the West to begin mass vaccinations.Still, any vaccination campaign will take many months, US health experts are warning of a surge in the coming weeks, in part because of Americans’ disregard of warnings not to travel over Thanksgiving. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, said the upcoming holiday season could compound the crisis even more than Thanksgiving did.“It’s a very critical time in this country right now,” he told CNN on Monday.The WHO’s Ryan said that the US is accounting for one-third of all world cases over the last several weeks and that the “brutal reality” is that holiday hugs are ill-advised.In Georgia, the number of confirmed and suspected coronavirus infections has soared more than 70% in the past week, and hospitals are sounding alarms about their ability to absorb new Covid-19 patients.The stage is averaging more than 5,000 confirmed and suspected cases per day. Even then, Georgia ranks only 44th among the states for the most new cases per capita in the past 14 days because infections are spreading so rapidly everywhere else.Georgia is likely to record its 10,000th confirmed or suspected death from Covid-19 sometime this week. The state topped 500,000 confirmed or suspected infections overall on Sunday.More than 2,500 Covid-19 patients were hospitalized Monday statewide. That’s below the summer peak of 3,200 but more than double the most recent low point in mid-October.“We are effectively reversing the gains we made after the summer surge,” said Amber Schmidtke, an epidemiologist who does a daily analysis of Georgia’s Covid-19 numbers.Health experts warn that well after the vaccine arrives in the US, masks and social distancing will remain vital to bringing the coronavirus under control.In Pennsylvania, overwhelmed hospitals may have to begin rationing care and turning away patients, Gov. Tom Wolf warned Monday, calling it a “dangerous, disturbing scenario.”“If the worst happens, hospitals will not be able to treat all sick Pennsylvanians,” he said. “They’ll be forced to turn away people who need treatment, and that means more Pennsylvanians will die.”Even with that stark warning, Wolf, a Democrat, all but ruled out a return to the kinds of statewide restrictions he imposed last spring, when schools were closed, thousands of businesses deemed nonessential were shut down, and all 12.8 million Pennsylvanians were under a stay-at-home order.In Nevada, the number of people hospitalized with Covid-19 has more than tripled over the last month, as did the number of patients needing ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quite-frankly-shocking-us-virus-deaths-hit-record-levels/story-jWlyEzh1qzDJYI5PHowMIJ.html

Several of those identified for the North Korean violations are already subject to U.S. sanctions. The measures may also subject third country companies and individuals to U.S. sanctions if they are found to be engaging in transactions with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hits-iran-s-envoy-to-yemen-chinese-firms-with-sanctions/story-niyieVpHXSqUkXvaaE3hdJ.html

Only a few countries in the world maintain the huge, costly vessels.The new French aircraft carrier will be about 70,000 tons and 300 meters long, roughly 1.5 times the size of the Charles de Gaulle, which has been deployed for international military operations in Iraq and Syria in recent years, according to French presidential advisers.Its catapults will be electro-magnetic, and American-made, and the ship will be designed to accommodate next-generation warplanes and serve until around 2080, the advisers said.They didn’t provide a price tag but French media estimate it will cost around 7 billion euros ($8.5 billion).Macron also pledged 500 million euros in investment in the nuclear industry and a separate fund to modernize it, and promised “progress” on the persistent problem of how to permanently get rid of nuclear waste. Nuclear reactors provide the majority of France’s electricity, but many reactors are aging and delays have dogged new-generation reactors.Macron, who is co-hosting a global video summit on Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate accord, said France also must do more to develop wind, solar, hydrogen and other renewable energies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-build-new-nuclear-powered-aircraft-carrier-says-macron/story-ZpvJekXrt8UPLQnb2soxzN.html

The rover was attached to the Kazachok surface platform for the first time and the fit-check was conducted at the factory of Thales Alenia Space in Cannes, France.The platform and the rover together form the ‘landing module’, which will be integrated inside the descent module for mass balancing checks. The factory will conduct several tests, including electrical, power and data transfer checks between the two elements, before the rover returns to the TAS cleanrooms in Turin, Italy, for further functional testing. It will be then shipped to the launch site in Baikonur Cosmodrome, an area of southern Kazakhstan leased to Russia.Also Read | China launches first independent Mars probe, calls it ‘Questions to Heaven’Here’s all you need to know about the ExoMars Mission 2022:The ExoMars programme is a joint mission between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian State Space Corporation, Roscosmos. The mission will deliver a European rover and a Russian surface platform to the surface of Mars.The joint endeavour was supposed to leave Earth in July/August this year but the difficulties in preparing the hardware, in part due to the limitations triggered by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), caused the delay. The space agencies are now targeting a September 2022 launch window and landing on Mars in June 2023. Proton rocket will be used to launch the mission and the Rosalind Franklin rover will travel across the Martian surface to search for signs of life. During launch and cruise phase, a carrier module will transport the surface platform and the rover within a single aeroshell. A descent module will separate from the carrier shortly before reaching the atmosphere of the Red Planet. After landing, the rover will collect samples with a drill and analyse them with next-generation instruments. According to ESA, the mission’s goal is to determine the geological history of the landing site at Oxia Planum, once thought to host an ocean, and to determine whether life could ever have existed on the planet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-milestone-reached-in-exomars-mission-all-you-need-to-know-about-joint-endeavour-to-red-planet/story-V3hW2iDYNBNNoHdpF9BBRN.html

The vaccine administered to Keenan, called BNT162b2, uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which makes use of a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the novel coronavirus, thereby rendering immunity against it. Britain, the first Western country to start immunising its population, is also the worst-hit country in Europe with over 61,000 deaths. The country has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. Each person requires two doses, and 40 million doses are enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million.About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week, with care home residents and carers, the elderly and health service workers the top priority to get them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/go-for-it-says-90-year-old-who-got-world-s-first-pfizer-covid-vaccine-in-uk/story-jzRLDYKKX8BxOaLknVbOxL.html
08-12-2020||World||Melania Trump leaves mark on White House with new tennis pavilion||First the Rose Garden, now the South Lawn. Melania Trump made a further lasting mark on the White House grounds with a new tennis pavilion that “will function as both a place of leisure and gathering for future First Families,” the First Lady said in a statement issued on Monday. The project refurbished the existing White House Tennis Court and Grandchildren’s Garden and erected a new 1,200-square-foot building on the South Lawn. Construction of the pavilion began in October and drew inspiration from existing architecture—that is the neoclassical Federal style favored by President Donald Trump—according to a proposal submitted by the National Park Service, which operates the 18-acre grounds of the White House. The latest fixture on the White House lawn is 18 feet high. Clad in limestone and boasting a copper roof, it features such architectural elements unique to the White House as a colonnade and fanlight windows. The pavilion also has locker rooms and is meant to be a “unifying” part of the grounds, connecting the Children’s Garden and the tennis court. According to the statement, the tennis pavilion was funded by private donations. The south grounds of the White House have traditionally served as recreational space for first families since the early 20th century, with each president leaving a personal touch. Jimmy Carter had a treehouse built for his daughter, and Bill Clinton had a seven-seat hot tub installed. Tennis courts were first installed under Theodore Roosevelt; in 2009, Barack Obama had basketball court lines painted and added removable baskets so he could play full-court basketball. The grounds have also served as a canvas for first ladies to leave symbols of their legacies. The Children’s Garden was constructed in 1969 as envisioned by former first lady and ardent environmentalist, Lady Bird Johnson. In 2009, then-First Lady Michelle Obama planted the 2,800-square-foot Kitchen Garden as part of her work to promote healthy eating. Melania Trump’s project, approved in June by the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Planning Commission, drew criticism in March when the first lady posted an update on Twitter as coronavirus cases were spiking in the U.S. Critics lambasted the timing of the post; one called it “real Marie Antionette” energy.The pavilion is one of several design endeavors that the first lady has undertaken this year. She overhauled the White House Rose Garden in August, working with landscape architecture firms Perry Guillot Inc. and Oehme, van Sweden & Associates for the makeover, which involved digging up trees, replacing bright yellow and red floral beds with white and pastel roses, and installing limestone-paved walkways.  The revamp was completed before a rally for the Republican National Convention was held on the White House lawn. According to the original proposal, the tennis pavilion will not impact historic resources or prominent vistas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melania-trump-leaves-mark-on-white-house-with-new-tennis-pavilion/story-lU4bYKyjwXu9mHSk1MFRtL.html
08-12-2020||World||Oxford University-AstraZeneca first to publish final-stage Covid-19 vaccine trial results||Oxford University and AstraZeneca became the first Covid-19 vaccine makers to publish final-stage clinical trial results in a scientific journal Tuesday, clearing a key hurdle in the global race to produce safe and effective drugs for the new coronavirus.The study, published in the respected Lancet medical journal, confirmed that the vaccine works in an average of 70 percent of cases.It comes during a flurry of positive developments that have raised hopes the roll-out of vaccines can help begin to restrain a pandemic that has killed more than 1.5 million people and stricken societies worldwide. Britain on Tuesday became the first country in the Western world to start immunisations, using a rival vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech after approving it for general use last week. Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said publication in the Lancet showed developers were “transparently sharing the data”. He said a range of vaccines would be needed to bring the pandemic to heel, “otherwise we’ll still be in this position in six months time”. “This really can’t be a competition between developers, this has to be in competition against the virus,” he told a press briefing. The study showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 62 percent for those given two full doses, and of 90 percent in those given a half then a full dose.AstraZeneca and Oxford faced questions last month about their analysis -- which looks at data from a total of 23,000 people in separate trials with differing protocols -- after releasing an overview of the results. These centred on the smaller group who were given an initial half dose because of a mistake.Tuesday’s study confirmed that this group of 1,367 participants did not include adults over the age of 55 years.The authors said they provided extra analysis to Lancet peer reviewers that suggested improved results for the half-dose group was not down to other factors like age.But they said more research would be needed. AstraZeneca said it would be up to regulators to decide based on the data whether people would receive two full doses or a half dose followed by a full dose.“I think it is fair to say it needs more looking into to explain the intriguing result,” Pollard said. He confirmed that the use of a lower initial dose was “unplanned” and the result of a measurement discrepancy, but once researchers realised, it was incorporated into the trial with the agreement of regulators. - ‘Dilemma’ -The results are likely to present a “dilemma” for regulators, said Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading.He said while the half-dose regime showed better protection against disease and also in reducing asymptomatic transmission, the group was “relatively small”.“Moreover it did not contain any older participants (age 55 or over) and it remains possible that if the regulators allowed the vaccine to be used in this manner, the most at risk group may not be protected.” Overall, authors analysed data from phase 3 -- final stage -- clinical trials in Britain and Brazil, involving 11,636 people, alongside safety data from a total of 23,745 participants in trials in Britain, Brazil and South Africa. There were 131 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 disease more than 14 days after the second vaccine dose in these 11,636 people -- 30 of those were among the group that received a vaccine of either dosage and 101 were in the control group.The study said there had been no hospitalisations or severe disease reported in the Covid-19 vaccine group so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-and-astrazeneca-first-to-publish-final-stage-covid-19-vaccine-trial-results/story-XQJCnxDuEzAktn3oUNkPjP.html
08-12-2020||World||Donald Trump thought courts were key to winning. Judges disagreed||President Donald Trump and his allies say their lawsuits aimed at subverting the 2020 election and reversing his loss to Joe Biden would be substantiated, if only judges were allowed to hear the cases.There is a central flaw in the argument. Judges have heard the cases and have been among the harshest critics of the legal arguments put forth by Trump’s legal team, often dismissing them with scathing language of repudiation.This has been true whether the judge has been appointed by a Democrat or a Republican, including those named by Trump himself.The judicial rulings that have rejected Trump’s unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud have underscored not only the futility of the lame-duck president’s brazen attempt to sabotage the people’s will but also the role of the courts in checking his unprecedented efforts to stay in power.The rebukes have not stopped the litigation. On Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the states of Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, alleging that they violated the Constitution based on a litany of already-dismissed complaints. Paxton asked the U.S. Supreme Court to invalidate their 62 Electoral College votes for Biden — a move that would swing the election to Trump and would be unprecedented in American history.On Monday, U.S. District Judge Linda Parker threw out a lawsuit challenging Michigan’s election results that had been filed two days after the state certified the results for Biden. Parker, appointed by President Barack Obama, said the case embodied the phrase “This ship has sailed.”“This lawsuit seems to be less about achieving the relief plaintiffs seek ... and more about the impact of their allegations on people’s faith in the democratic process and their trust in our government.”The lawsuit filed on behalf of a group of voters claimed Biden benefited from fraud, alleging, as in much of the other litigation, a massive Democrat-run conspiracy to shift the results. It sought to reverse the certification and impound all voting machines for inspection — “relief that is stunning in its scope and breathtaking in its reach,” the judge said.“Plaintiffs ask this court to ignore the orderly statutory scheme established to challenge elections and to ignore the will of millions of voters. This, the court cannot, and will not, do,” she said.“The people have spoken.”Her ruling stands alongside others in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada that have a common thread: They all rejected Trump’s claims.Even in the face of these losses in court, Trump has contended that, in fact, he won the election. And he’s moved out of the courts to directly appeal to lawmakers as his losses mount. He brought Michigan lawmakers to the White House in a failed bid to set aside the vote tally, and phoned Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, asking him to order a special legislative session to overturn the states results. Kemp refused. Trump also called Pennsylvania Republican House Speaker Bryan Cutler, who said state law did not give the legislature the power to overturn the will of voters.And Trump tweeted in all caps, “I WON THE ELECTION, BIG.”While that is not the case, what is true is that Trump is rapidly running out of legal runway. Out of roughly 50 lawsuits filed, more than 35 have been dropped or dismissed. The U.S. Supreme Court was expected to weigh in later this week in a case from Pennsylvania. A great deal of the lawsuits highlight a lack of understanding of how elections actually work.In Georgia, U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten, appointed by President George W. Bush, dismissed a lawsuit filed by attorney Sidney Powell, who was dropped from the Trump legal team a few weeks ago but has still continued to spread faulty election claims.The lawsuit claimed widespread fraud meant to illegally manipulate the vote count in favor of Biden. The suit said the scheme was carried out in different ways, including ballot stuffing, votes flipped by the election system from Trump to Biden and problems with absentee ballots. The judge summarily rejected those claims.Batten said the lawsuit sought “perhaps the most extraordinary relief ever sought in any federal court in connection with an election.”He said the lawsuit sought to ignore the will of voters in Georgia, which certified the state for Biden again Monday after three vote counts.“They want this court to substitute its judgment for that of two-and-a-half million Georgia voters who voted for Joe Biden and this I am unwilling to do,” Batten said.Trump has appointed more than 150 federal court judges who have been confirmed by the Senate and pushed through three Supreme Court justices.Much like Trump, his lawyers try to blame the political leanings of the judge after their legal arguments are flayed.When a federal appeals panel in Philadelphia rejected Trump’s election challenge just five days after it reached the court, Trump legal advisor Jenna Ellis called their work a product of “the activist judicial machinery in Pennsylvania.”But Trump appointed the judge who wrote the Nov. 27 opinion.“Voters, not lawyers, choose the president. Ballots, not briefs, decide elections,” Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote as the 3rd U.S. Circuit panel refused to stop the state from certifying its results for Democrat Joe Biden, a demand he called “breathtaking.”All three of the panel members were appointed by Republican presidents.And they were upholding the decision of a fourth Republican, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann, a conservative jurist and Federalist Society member. Brann had called the campaign’s legal case, which was argued in court by Rudy Giuliani, a “haphazard” jumble that resembled “Frankenstein’s monster.”In state courts, too, the lawsuits have failed. In Arizona on Friday, Judge Randall Warner, an independent appointed in 2007 by Democratic former Gov. Janet Napolitano, threw out a bid to undo Biden’s victory.Arizona Republican Party Chairwoman Kelli Ward challenged of ballots in metro Phoenix that were duplicated because voters’ earlier ballots were damaged or could not be run through tabulators.Warner wrote: “There is no evidence that the inaccuracies were intentional or part of a fraudulent scheme. They were mistakes. And given both the small number of duplicate ballots and the low error rate, the evidence does not show any impact on the outcome.”In Nevada on Friday, Judge James Todd Russell in Carson City ruled that attorneys for Republican electors failed to provide clear or convincing evidence of fraud or illegality.Nevada judges are nonpartisan. But Russell’s father was a Republican governor of the state from 1951-59.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-thought-courts-were-key-to-winning-judges-disagreed/story-lzNz0079VaRPyALekPmH0I.html
08-12-2020||World||Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine’s effect on transmission still unknown, FDA says||Pfizer Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine prevents symptomatic cases of the virus, but it’s not clear if the shot keeps the disease from being transmitted, U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff found in a report issued Tuesday.The conclusion highlights a major unknown about vaccine candidates that persists ahead of an ambitious U.S. rollout of millions of shots: How effective they’ll be in stemming the spread of coronavirus at a population level.The answer to that question carries important implications for the continued use of public-health measures including masks and social distancing, even among those who have been immunized.Because the shots from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE avert symptomatic cases of Covid-19, their wide use could prevent virus transmission, the FDA staff report said. But if the vaccine doesn’t work as well in infections that lack symptoms, those cases “in combination with reduced mask-wearing and social distancing could result in significant continued transmission,” according to the staff report.The FDA report was issued ahead of a Thursday meeting of outside advisers to the agency, whose deliberations will inform whether the vaccine is cleared for U.S. use.Pfizer expects to report data on whether or not its vaccine stops virus transmission in the first quarter of 2021, Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said on Tuesday at a press briefing held by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-s-effect-on-transmission-still-unknown-fda-says/story-TqHeRPsdXnLa3p42kAKhGJ.html
08-12-2020||World||US provides anti-bomb, sniper’s equipment to Philippines||The U.S. defense chief announced Tuesday the delivery of nearly $30 million worth of weapons to the Philippines, which faces threats from Islamic State group-linked militants.Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Christopher Miller made the announcement during a brief visit to Manila, where he met with his Philippine counterpart and the foreign secretary. The weapons, including equipment for snipers and anti-bomb squads, were delivered ahead of Miller’s visit, officials said.“The new equipment will strengthen the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ joint precision strike, sniper, riverine and counter-improvised explosive device capabilities,” the U.S. Embassy said in a statement, without elaborating.The Department of Defense in Manila said Miller told Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana that the U.S. will also deliver a Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft to the Philippine military later this month. No other details were given. Lorenzana thanked the U.S. for helping the Philippines strengthen its defense capabilities.Miller said his talks with Lorenzana and Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. centered on “deepening our alliance and supporting a free and open South China Sea and Indo-Pacific region.”Miller is the latest senior U.S. security official to visit Manila and announce defense assistance to America’s oldest treaty ally in Asia. The visits project normalcy in Washington’s foreign relations as President Donald Trump continues to challenge the results of the Nov. 3 presidential election.U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien visited Manila three weeks ago and announced the delivery of precision-guided missiles and other weapons to help the Philippines battle Muslim militants. He also renewed a pledge to defend the Philippines if it comes under attack in the disputed South China Sea.O’Brien repeated U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s statement early this year that “any armed attack on Philippine forces, aircraft or public vessels in the South China Sea will trigger our mutual defense obligations.”O’Brien expressed hope for the continuance of a security agreement that allows American forces to train in large-scale combat exercises in the Philippines.President Rodrigo Duterte moved to abrogate the Visiting Forces Agreement with the U.S. early this year but later delayed the date the decision would take effect to next year, a move welcomed by O’Brien.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-provides-anti-bomb-sniper-s-equipment-to-philippines/story-T8Sx8ChghTD3mg818nxF5I.html
08-12-2020||World||Apple could block apps that don’t comply with new privacy feature||Apple threatened on Tuesday to remove apps from its widely-used App Store if they don’t comply with an upcoming private feature allowing users to block advertisers from tracking them across different applications. The new feature, dubbed App Tracking Transparency, was initially planned to debut this year, but was delayed to give developers more time to make changes to their apps and address privacy issues.Some tech companies and advertisers, such as Facebook, have criticised the planned change, saying it could hurt smaller developers such as gaming companies disproportionately.But Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering at Apple, said users should know when they are being tracked across different apps and websites. “Early next year, we’ll begin requiring all apps that want to do that to obtain their users’ explicit permission, and developers who fail to meet that standard can have their apps taken down from the App Store,” he said at the European Data Protection and Privacy Conference.The new feature will require a pop-up notification saying the app “would like permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.” Digital advertising firms expect most users will decline to grant that permission.“When invasive tracking is your business model, you tend not to welcome transparency and customer choice,” Federighi said, rejecting criticism of the new feature.“We need the world to see those arguments for what they are: a brazen attempt to maintain the privacy-invasive status quo.”Facebook and Google are the largest among thousands of companies that track online consumers to pick up on their habits and interests and serve them relevant ads.Apple itself was under fire last month when a Austrian privacy group, led by campaigner Max Schrems, filed complaints with data protection watchdogs in Germany and Spain, alleging an online tracking tool used in its devices breached European law. Apple rebutted the charge, calling it “factually inaccurate”.Federighi said the industry would adapt to provide effective advertising without invasive tracking.“Getting this right will take time, collaboration, listening — and true partnership across the entire technology ecosystem. But we believe the result will be transformative.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-could-block-apps-that-don-t-comply-with-new-privacy-feature/story-JpfJVdfFaJrrAvMF5xx4vJ.html
08-12-2020||World||Morocco to use Chinese vaccine to kick off mass Covid-19 vaccinations||Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious Covid-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80% of its adults in an operation starting this month that’s relying initially on a Chinese vaccine that has not yet completed advanced trials to prove it is safe and effective.The first injections could come within days, a Health Ministry official told The Associated Press. Facing a public skeptical about the vaccines’ safety and effectiveness, medical experts and health officials have appeared on television in recent weeks to promote the Covid-19 vaccines and encourage Moroccans to get immunized.While Britain began its vaccination program Tuesday with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the U.S. and European Union are racing to approve a series of Western-made vaccines, other governments are looking to use vaccines from China and Russia.The World Health Organization has said new vaccines should first be tested in tens of thousands of people to prove they work and don’t cause worrisome side effects before being rolled out broadly. But the U.N. health agency also says it’s is up to individual countries to decide whether there is an urgent domestic need to use a vaccine shot, even without such data.Morocco is battling a resurgence in virus infections, with the number of recorded deaths from the virus surpassing 6,000. The North African kingdom is pinning its hopes on two vaccine candidates, one developed by China’s Sinopharm and the other by Britain’s Oxford University and AstraZeneca.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. The AstraZeneca vaccine is still in advanced trials in countries including Britain and the U.S. and hasn’t been approved yet.Morocco’s government seeks to vaccinate 80% of its adults, or 25 million people, as soon as the vaccines are approved by domestic regulators. Priority will go to medical staff and other front-line workers, as well as the elderly.It will start with the Sinopharm vaccine, which was tested on 600 Moroccans as part of clinical trials this autumn. Morocco has ordered 10 million doses of the vaccine.The initial deliveries will come from China, but Morocco also plans to produce the vaccine locally, Abdelhakim Yahyan, a senior official at the Ministry of Health, told the state-owned news agency MAP.Health Minister Khalid Ait Taleb said Morocco is seeking vaccines from several sources because Covid vaccines are a scarce commodity and a single manufacturer’s production capacity is too limited to meet the needs of the whole world.In the Moroccan trial of the Sinopharm vaccine, carried out in Casablanca and the capital Rabat from August through November, healthy volunteers received two separate doses of the vaccine. In the advanced trial, volunteers either received the vaccine or a placebo. According to the health minister, early results have proven the vaccine to be “safe and effective” with no severe side effects reported.However, some Moroccans have taken to social media to question the safety of the vaccine, with some noting that China was the original epicenter of the pandemic or questioning how effective it will be.Sinopharm’s shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the vaccine made by Oxford and AstraZeneca, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus’ spike protein.In China, the state-owned Sinopharm subsidiary CNBG has given the vaccine to 350,000 people outside its clinical trials, a top CNBG executive has said.Critics in Morocco have also expressed concerns that citizens might be forced to take the vaccine, but the health minister insisted that Covid-19 vaccinations will not be mandatory and will be free.Prime Minister Saad-Eddine El Othmani has sought to reassure the vaccine-hesitant about the robustness of the country’s regulatory process for vaccine approval, saying that no corners have been cut in making sure the Chinese vaccine is safe to administer.Morocco’s mass immunization operation will include 2,888 vaccination stations and the deployment of mobile units to vaccinate people at factories, offices, campuses and prisons. The health ministry said it would mobilize over 12,000 health professionals as well as the military to ensure rapid distribution.The vaccine will be available in a first phase to those at highest risk of contracting the virus: health professionals, security personnel, essential workers at vital sectors and people suffering from chronic diseases.No exact date has been set for the rollout, but the health minister said “we are doing our best to get it started in mid-December.”Separately, Morocco is expected to be among 92 low- and middle-income countries supported by Covax, an international effort to ensure that vaccine supplies reach developing countries, if the group meets its funding targets, according to the World Health Organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/morocco-to-use-chinese-vaccine-to-kick-off-mass-vaccinations/story-l3vRrgJzq1QOB17FpD0KRK.html

Under one of the plans, minorities alleging they have been the subject of genocide can for the first time apply to the High Court of England and ask for judges to determine if a country trading with the UK has perpetrated genocide.Bilateral trade agreements can then be revoked if the court makes a preliminary ruling against that country.The proposals were intended as a way around the lack of international action in addressing human rights abuses in countries such as China.Proponents argue that despite mounting evidence of atrocities targeting Uighurs in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, the United Nations is highly unlikely to refer Beijing to the International Criminal Court because China, a permanent member of the Security Council, will veto the move.“Parliament has had enough of this unconscionable inertia. We owe it to Uighurs to find another way, and now we have,” said Conservative lawmaker Anthony Mangnall.Britain’s Conservative government opposes the measures, which will go to the lower house of Parliament next for debate.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said he is considering further action to address the Chinese government’s alleged rights abuses against Uighur Muslims, including mass detentions and forced birth control. Beijing has repeatedly denied Western reports of rights abuses in Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-house-of-lords-vote-to-bar-trade-deals-with-genocidal-countries/story-JA9vESBlytsb8NfBy7MwdI.html
08-12-2020||World||China cancels special stamp launch with India to mark 70 years of ties||China has cancelled the joint launch of a commemorative stamp with India amid the ongoing military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.China’s top postal bureau has decided to cancel its plan to jointly launch commemorative stamps with India, a state media report quoted a statement put out on its website on Tuesday.“The State Post Office has decided to cancel the planned joint issue of stamps between China and India in the 2020 special stamp-issue programme,” the one-line statement said.The statement was published in Mandarin under the headline: “Notice from the State Post Office on the cancellation of the joint issue of stamps between China and India.”No reason was given for the decision to cancel the launch of the commemorative stamp.The stamp was to be jointly launched as part of celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in 1950.The launch was agreed during the second informal summit meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping held in Chennai in October, 2019.On November 7, 2019, China’s State Post Office announced plans for issuing special stamps for the year 2020.As part of the list, the stamp to be jointly issued jointly with India, entitled “The 70th Anniversary of the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and India,” was originally scheduled to be issued on April 1, 2020.The stamp was to be on the Mogao Caves, a renowned site in China’s Gansu province where the Buddhist grottoes reflect ancient Sino-Indian cultural links.However, possibly because of the Coronavirus pandemic, the event was postponed until further notice.Until Tuesday, when the cancellation of the stamp was announced.As many as 70 events were expected to be held through 2020 to mark the landmark year in bilateral ties between the two neighbours.Instead, New Delhi and Beijing are now dealing with the worst chill in ties in decades.Though the standoff began in May, diplomatic relations have been particularly tense since June, when at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in Galwan Valley after being attacked by Chinese troops using rocks and clubs.Beijing hasn’t revealed the casualty figures of the People’s Liberation Army.Several rounds of talks including eight military-level dialogues – the last one held on November 8 – have yielded no result as the standoff continues in eastern Ladakh.Neither side has officially explained the month-long delay in holding the 9th round military talks – an indication that the situation on the ground is far from any resolution.The Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday gave no definitive answer when asked when the next rounds of talks between the two countries would be held or what was causing the delay.“China and India have been in communication through diplomatic and military channels on the border issue and we are working for further de-escalation of the border situation,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying said at the regular ministry press briefing on Tuesday.“Based on the implementation of the current consensus, we will have consultations to determine specific arrangements for further talks,” Hua said without giving any indications when future talks will be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-cancels-special-stamp-launch-with-india-to-mark-70-years-of-ties/story-p0CgtUaff9fKIXTIpDe6uM.html
08-12-2020||World||World Economic Forum to be held next year in Singapore||Singapore will host the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual meeting next year in May, discussing the ongoing global issues. The meeting will be held from May 13 to 16 next year, before returning to Davos, Switzerland, in 2022, The Strait Times reported.“The event will be the global leadership event to address worldwide recovery from the Covid-19 situation,” The Straits Times quoted WEF as saying.Announcing its decision to shift the annual forum from Switzerland in view of the Covid-19 situation in Europe, the WEF said that the meeting in Singapore “will be the first global leadership event to address worldwide recovery from the pandemic”.“The WEF’s decision reflects its confidence in the country’s management of the Covid-19 pandemic and will also boost the Republic’s meetings and conferences sector,” The Straits Times quoted Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) as saying.“A global leadership summit is of crucial importance to address how we can recover together,” Klaus Schwab, WEF founder, and executive chairman said.“The Special Annual Meeting 2021 will be a place for leaders from business, government, and civil society to meet in person for the first time since the start of the global pandemic. Public-private cooperation is needed more than ever to rebuild trust and address the fault lines that emerged in 2020,” Schwab added.Hosting the WEF will give a boost to Singapore’s meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (Mice) sector and other sectors like hospitality, Ministry said.“The annual forum will in a first include a virtual component to allow greater participation amid the Covid-19 pandemic,” Ministry added.The annual forum saw about 3,000 participants gather in Davos in January, The Strait Times reported.During the usual “Davos week” next year, the forum will hold a virtual event from Jan 25 to 29. It will also host a global technology governance summit in Tokyo in April, WEF said.“All international conferences held in Singapore will similarly adhere to strict public health and safety measures,” Ministry said.In a Facebook post, Chan Chun Sing, Trade and Industry Minister said that the WEF’s decision “speaks volumes of the international community’s trust and confidence in Singapore’s handling of the pandemic thus far”.Singapore looks forward to supporting the WEF in its efforts to effect positive change globally via dialogue and engagement, Sing added.“May we be a positive example of how to resume economic activities safely and sustainably,” Chan said adding “Successful execution of such high-level meetings will help re-establish ourselves as a premier global business hub.”This is the second time the World Economic Forum meeting will be held outside of Switzerland since it began in 1971, and the first time it will be held in Asia. The 2002 edition was held in New York, to show solidarity with the United States and the people of the city after the September 11 terror attacks the year before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-economic-forum-to-be-held-next-year-in-singapore/story-TMWNBNBzIGu1TsAS60eJUM.html
08-12-2020||World||How Britain approved Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine before US and EU||The UK on Tuesday created history when Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old grandmother from Britain, became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine outside of a trial. The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) gave Pfizer authorization for emergency use at a record speed, just three weeks after Pfizer published the first data from the final stage of its clinical trial. Hours after it gave authorization, both the European Union (EU) and the United States gave out statements saying more thorough work is needed before any kind of permission can be given. Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases commented that the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was proceeding in “the correct way” and the UK “did not do it as carefully”How did Britain authorize a vaccine before the US and EU?The US and UK adopt different strategies in vetting vaccines. US regulator FDA does not accept the findings of vaccine makers as proof. They analyze raw data from vaccine trials and summon committees of experts for advice. It will hold these meetings on December 10 and December 17 — to discuss the findings for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively. These findings are made public and put out in the public domain. The MHRA, on the other hand, relies on analysis and findings provided by the vaccine makers. They do not undertake data analysis unless there are doubts or anomalies. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), the agency in charge of approving medicinal products, unlike the MHRA, is in favour of granting “conditional marketing authorisation”, which is a long-term authorization that needs to be substantiated by more evidence than the kind supported by Pfizer for temporary approval. A temporary approval means MHRA will have to approve each batch of vaccine separately. A market authorization, on the other hand, lasts for four years. EMA is further constrained by the need for approval from all 27 EU member states. Even though the process has been accelerated, it still takes several days for all the countries to weigh in with their analysis and opinions. Did Brexit help UK expedite the process?Under EU law, the EMA has to authorize vaccines for use but countries can apply an emergency procedure that allows temporary distribution of vaccines in their domestic markets. Moreover, the UK is still subject to EU rules till the end of this year. UK health minister Matt Hancock and many other Conservative Party politicians claimed on December 2 that the MHRA could rapidly approve the vaccine because of UK’s departure from the EU, but the MHRA pointed out to the emergency provision in EU’s laws as a reason for the quick approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-britain-approved-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-before-us-and-eu/story-RMfy8rGlz12wGPo6KOFwaO.html
08-12-2020||World||Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine ‘highly effective with no safety issues’: US regulator||The coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech SE is highly effective in preventing Covid-19 and there are no safety concerns that would prevent it from being granted an emergency-use authorization, according to a report by staff of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The report offers a first look at the U.S. review of the vaccine ahead of a public meeting Thursday of outside advisers to the agency. The FDA could clear the shot shortly after the meeting, with as many as 6.4 million doses immediately available to kick off a vast immunization effort designed to end a pandemic that has killed more than 283,000 Americans.The findings, posted on the agency’s website Tuesday, echoed previously disclosed data from the companies that showed the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19. It also said that two months of trial data revealed no significant safety issues.Pfizer requested an emergency authorization in the U.S. on Nov. 20. Regulators in the U.K. approved the vaccine earlier this month, and on Tuesday, the National Health Service there launched an ambitious vaccination campaign that will begin with tens of thousands of people over the age of 80 in the coming days. The shot is also under review in the European Union.The vaccine uses technology called messenger RNA that transforms the body’s cells to fight the virus. Moderna Inc. also makes an experimental Covid-19 vaccine based on messenger RNA, and FDA advisers will meet next week to consider whether it should receive emergency authorization.In their report, FDA staff wrote that analyses “showed similar efficacy point estimates across age groups, genders, racial and ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe Covid-19.” Common side effects included injection-site reactions, fatigue and headache.Pfizer has said the shot protected people of all ages and ethnicities, but there isn’t enough data on children younger than 16 to determine whether it will work in pediatric populations, FDA staff said. Data is also insufficient to make any determinations about pregnant, lactating or immunocompromised people.Among participants in the Pfizer clinical trial who didn’t show signs of Covid-19 infection during vaccination, there were eight virus cases among those who received the shot and 162 among those who got a placebo, according to the report.It’s unclear whether the vaccine is effective at preventing Covid-19’s spread, according to the report. It’s possible the vaccine didn’t work as well at preventing cases where people didn’t have virus symptoms as it did at preventing symptomatic cases, meaning there will likely be a continued need for basic public-health measures.“Asymptomatic cases in combination with reduced mask-wearing and social distancing could result in significant continued transmission,” FDA staff wrote.If Pfizer’s vaccine is cleared by the FDA, Trump administration officials have said it could begin to be distributed within 24 hours. Between Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines, 40 million doses are expected to be available by the end of the year, enough for 20 million people to get the two-shot regimen.The Trump administration is confident that the U.S. will have enough supply to eventually vaccinate everyone, a senior administration official said Monday on a call with reporters, though only the shots made by Pfizer and Moderna are expected to be cleared by the FDA this month. The U.S. also has agreements to get shots from AstraZeneca Plc, Johnson & Johnson and others.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization committee recommended health-care workers and long-term care residents be first in line, totaling roughly 23 million people. It will be up to the states to determine exactly how to distribute the vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-highly-effective-with-no-safety-issues-says-us-regulator/story-NRkcSxjN6j6UYEe9TM3UFO.html
08-12-2020||World||Facebook may block news content from being shared on its platforms in Australia. Here’s why||Australia is set to introduce a contentious bill into the parliament on Wednesday which could prompt Facebook to block news from being shared on its platforms Down Under. The government has come up with a new code after Australia’s competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), said in a report that tech giants like Google and Facebook are more than mere intermediaries in the supply of news. The competition watchdog had noted that the tech giants are increasingly performing similar functions as media businesses, like selecting, curating and ranking content. Australia’s leading news publishers demanded that Google and Facebook should pay at least 10 per cent of the news advertising revenue to local new organisations.The bill may force tech giants like Google and Facebook to share advertising revenue with local news companies and broadcasters. Ahead of the introduction of the bill, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg stressed that the Big Tech firms must negotiate with local publishers and broadcasters over the sharing of advertising revenues. Calling it “world-first” reforms, the treasurer said that the law will sustain Australia’s media landscape. “Our legislation will help ensure that the rules of the digital world mirror the rules of the physical world ... and ultimately sustain our media landscape,” Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra.Also Read | Australia to reveal laws to make Google and Facebook pay for newsWhy Facebook may block news content from being shared?Both tech companies have opposed the bill, saying it will impact users’ experience in the country. Facebook recently said in a blog post that the new regulation misunderstands the “dynamics of the internet”, warning that the law will damage the “very news organisations the government is trying to protect.” The social media giant threatened to block publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on its platforms. “This is not our first choice – it is our last. But it is the only way to protect against an outcome that defies logic and will hurt, not help, the long-term vibrancy of Australia’s news and media sector,” wrote Will Easton, Managing Director, Facebook Australia and New Zealand.How Google may retaliate?Google Australia official had warned that the proposed code would force the company to provide Australian users with “dramatically worse” Google Search and YouTube. In an open letter, Mel Silva, Managing Director for Google Australia, said that the law could also lead to data being handed over to big news businesses.“We’ve always treated all website owners fairly when it comes to information we share about ranking. The proposed changes are not fair and they mean that Google Search results and YouTube will be worse for you,” the letter read.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-may-block-news-content-from-being-shared-on-its-platforms-in-australia-here-s-why/story-NdeC0t0054vl7VO9EkD7cL.html
08-12-2020||World||Japan unveils 708 billion dollars in fresh stimulus with eye on post-Covid growth||Japan announced a fresh $708 billion economic stimulus package on Tuesday to speed up the recovery from the country’s deep coronavirus-driven slump, while targeting investment in new growth areas such as green and digital innovation.The new package will include about 40 trillion yen ($384.54 billion) in direct fiscal spending and initiatives targeted at reducing carbon emissions and boosting adoption of digital technology, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said in a meeting with ruling party executives.Policymakers globally have unleashed a wall of monetary and fiscal stimulus to prevent a deep and prolonged recession as the coronavirus closed international borders and sent millions out of work. In the United States, a $908 billion coronavirus aid plan is currently under debate in Congress.In Japan, the pandemic has forced the government to put its fiscal reform agenda on the backburner, despite holding the industrial world’s heaviest public debt burden, which is twice the size of its gross domestic product.“We have compiled the new measures to maintain employment, sustain business and restore the economy and open a way to achieve new growth in green and digital areas, so as to protect people’s lives and livelihoods,” Suga said at the meeting.Suga’s cabinet is set to endorse the stimulus package later on Tuesday, which would bring the combined value of coronavirus-related stimulus to about $3 trillion.The government will compile a third extra budget for the current fiscal year worth around 20.1 trillion yen to fund the fresh economic stimulus, a government source told Reuters on Tuesday.Some investors expect the additional new bond issuance needed to fund the third extra budget to be around 15 trillion yen.“Japan needs to make a plan for fiscal reform and shift to reconstructing public finance at some point. But now is the time to help firms and households hit by the pandemic,” said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.“The government’s new bond issuance is expected to top 100 trillion yen for this fiscal year. But I don’t think the size of the package will roil the market.”Two previous packages this year worth a combined $2.2 trillion focused on dealing with the immediate strain on households and business from the pandemic.The new plan includes a 2-trillion yen fund to promote carbon neutrality by 2050, 1 trillion yen to accelerate digital transformation and 1.5 trillion yen in subsidies to support restaurants hurt by shortened trading hours due to Covid-19.Japan’s economy, the world’s third-largest, rebounded in July-September from its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter, though many analysts expect a third wave of Covid-19 infections to keep any recovery modest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-unveils-708-billion-dollars-in-fresh-stimulus-with-eye-on-post-covid-growth/story-l5MThgyuXcVFMo4KzCZJtM.html

08-12-2020||World||China a ‘principal military, economic threat’ in Asia, says US Commerce Secretary||US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross on Tuesday chided China for not complying with the international trade rules and called Beijing a principal military and economic threat in the Asian region.Ross made these remarks while speaking at the Milken Institute Asia Summit, CNBC reported.“China continues to be both the largest potential market and the principal military and economic threat in the region,” Ross said.The US Secretary of Commerce said that China makes up a good portion of the US entity list that restricts companies’ access to American suppliers for national security reasons, adding that Beijing accounts for 210 out of 539 anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders imposed by the US.Anti-dumping and countervailing duties are slapped on products suspected of being sold at an unfairly low price.Chinese firms that have been put on the entity list include telecommunications giant Huawei.Commenting on the recently signed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership between China and 14 other Asia-Pacific Countries, Ross said that the pact will not tackle the “most sensitive issues” in trade. Those issues include subsidies to state-owned companies, protection of intellectual property and equal market access, he said.“It is essential that we continue to encourage freer and fairer trade everywhere while protecting our national security and our economic interest,” he said. “The US is actually the least protectionist major economy.”China and the US are at loggerheads since President Donald Trump took office over many issues including trade, Indo-Pacific, coronavirus and Uyghurs. The tensions between the two countries have escalated in recent times.Over the last two years, the two countries have imposed retaliatory tariffs on each others’ products triggering a trade war that threatened the global economy.The tariff fight came to a pause this year when both sides signed the “phase one” trade agreement, which Ross on Tuesday said “deals with some of our bilateral issues.” Among other things, the deal commits China to buy at least USD 200 billion more in US goods and services over two years -- in 2020 and 2021 -- on top of its purchases in 2017.Ross said China has since purchased over USD 23 billion of US agriculture products -- or around 70 percent of the agreed amount for this year. However, China has bought “lesser percentages” of other items under the deal, he added.“Now that China has announced its recovery from the pandemic, we hope they -- as a result -- will meet the phase one two-year target,” said Ross.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-a-principal-military-economic-threat-in-asia-says-us-commerce-secretary/story-DAU1VTYBDoBZhDUROFpizO.html

Prince William’s tour criticized amid pandemic||A national train tour by Prince William and his wife Kate has received a frosty welcome from leaders in Wales and Scotland, with one Welsh official saying he would rather “no one was having unnecessary visits” during the coronavirus pandemic.William and Kate arrived in the Welsh capital of Cardiff on Tuesday for the final day of their three-day royal train tour, meant to spread Christmas cheer and thank medical staff and other frontline employees for their hard, dangerous work during the pandemic.But Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he wasn’t “particularly bothered or interested” when asked on BBC radio if he thought the couple should travel to Wales when the region has been seeing high Covid-19 infections.Gething said Monday that Wales was the only part of the UK where infections were not falling at the end of November, and warned that further restrictions may be needed.Asked if it was the right moment for the royal couple to visit, Gething said Tuesday: “I’d rather that no one was having unnecessary visits. And people always have divisive views about the monarchy, but their visit isn’t an excuse for people to say that they are confused about what they are being asked to do.”On Monday, Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon suggested that William and Kate travelled to the Scottish capital of Edinburgh despite their office being made aware of coronavirus restrictions for those wanting to cross the border.Royal officials have said the visits were planned in consultation with the Scottish and Welsh governments, and that William and Kate were allowed to travel across the border because they were working.Wales and Scotland have their own devolved governments and different sets of coronavirus restrictions from England even though they are all part of the UK Welsh and Scottish officials have discouraged people from the rest of the UK from travelling to their regions without a reasonable excuse in a bid to reduce the virus’s spread.Britain has Europe’s deadliest outbreak, at over 61,000 reported dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tone-deaf-prince-william-s-tour-criticized-amid-pandemic/story-55JyePGmNSb9NaHEEtLotJ.html
08-12-2020||World||Election officials face threats, intimidation as Trump pushes false fraud claims||Jocelyn Benson, Michigan’s top election official, had just finished hanging Christmas decorations with her young son on Saturday night when a crowd demanding November’s presidential election result be reversed gathered outside her home to denounce her as a “traitor” and a “criminal.”The demonstrators, some armed and holding up placards saying “Stop the Steal”, clustered on the sidewalk outside Benson’s Detroit home as security and police officers looked on, video broadcast live on Facebook by one of the participants showed.“Through threats of violence, intimidation, and bullying, the armed people outside my home and their political allies seek to undermine and silence the will and voices of every voter in this state,” Benson, Michigan’s Democratic Secretary of State, said in a statement on Sunday.The demonstration was the latest of what election authorities across the United States describe as a tide of intimidation, harassment and outright threats in the charged aftermath of the Nov. 3 election, which Republican President Donald Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden.Trump has made unsubstantiated claims of widespread electoral fraud and is trying but failing to overturn Biden’s victory, challenging the outcome in court in multiple states while also pressing state officials, lawmakers and governors to throw the results out and simply declare Trump the winner.Courts have so far rejected those requests.Supporters of Trump in recent weeks have staked out election officials’ offices in Georgia, mounted armed protests in Arizona and left menacing telephone messages for election officials across the country, producing political turmoil unlike any other in modern US history.Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said that the baseless fraud claims and subsequent threats against election officials are “very damaging to our democracy. I hope it’s not the end of our democracy.”“We cannot allow our elected officials to live in fear at all times whenever someone doesn’t like how they believe they’ve perform their job duties,” Nessel told Reuters.Michigan, Arizona and Georgia were among a handful of hotly contested battleground states that Biden won, helping to secure his 306 to 232 advantage in the Electoral College that will officially select the next president on Dec. 14.But the threats have not been confined to places where the election was close. In Vermont -- a state no Republican presidential candidate has won since 1988 -- election officials said they received a voice message threatening them with “execution by firing squad.”“No public servant should ever have to feel threatened or concerned for their safety while they are doing their work,” Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos, a Democrat, told Reuters.“The conspiracy theories and unfounded rhetoric that are being pushed by the president and his campaign team really could inspire some dangerous behavior somewhere in this country. It starts at the top and it really needs to stop.”Asked to comment, a spokesman for Trump’s campaign, Tim Murtaugh, said: “No one should engage in threats or violence, and if that has happened, we condemn that fully.”He added that the campaign’s lawyers had themselves been “inundated with threats from leftist Biden supporters” and their personal information posted online.TRUMP ATTACKS HIS OWNTrump and his political backers have blasted Republicans leaders and election officials in Georgia and Arizona for certifying Biden as the winner in their states.Trump himself has described Georgia’s Republican secretary of state as an “enemy of the people”, and one of his lawyers, Joe diGenova, said last week the administration’s former election cybersecurity chief should be “taken out at dawn and shot” for publicly defending the integrity of the election.Several election workers contacted by Reuters said they did not want to speak about the threats they had received for fear it would make things worse.Georgia officials were similarly reticent until last week, when threats online targeted a young contract worker for Dominion Voting Systems, whose voting machines were used in the state. One post on Twitter included a swinging noose.That day, Gabriel Sterling, the Republican in charge of the voting machines, walked to a podium visibly angry and demanded that Trump “stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence.”In an interview with Reuters, Sterling said that he personally had received a message calling him a him “traitor” that included his home address. Someone else wished him a happy birthday in a tweet saying it would be his last.After his local police chief suggested he notify his neighbors, he posted on a local Facebook page urging them to call authorities if they saw anything suspicious.“I shouldn’t have to do that,” he said.On Monday, Georgia again certified that Biden had won after counting ballots for a third time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/election-officials-face-threats-intimidation-as-trump-pushes-false-fraud-claims/story-ni2yFn04nnGXC9jcMPDaDI.html

Flournoy would have been the first woman defense secretary.Austin, who retired in 2016, needs a waiver from Congress to take the post, as he has been out of the military less than the required seven years. President Donald Trump’s first Pentagon chief, retired Marine general James Mattis, also needed a waiver to serve.Known as a shrewd strategist with deep knowledge of the armed forces, he developed a working relationship with Biden during the Obama administration and has been advising the transition team on national security issues, the person familiar with the decision to name him said.The nomination could draw fire from some progressive groups given Austin’s role in retirement on the board of a number of companies, including weapons maker Raytheon Technologies Corp .But it will help answer complaints from advocacy groups about the need for more racial diversity in Biden’s Cabinet appointments, including complaints from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about the number of Latinos and from civil rights groups about the lack of prominent Black nominees.After Biden introduces the leadership of his new health team on Tuesday he will have a virtual meeting with civil rights leaders who have been pressing him about the need for more Blacks in top administration posts.Biden has promised the most diverse Cabinet in US history, and he made a point in his victory speech last month of telling Black voters that he would remember them.The choice of Austin also will resonate among proponents for greater diversity in the leadership of the US armed forces, which is regularly criticized for failing to promote Black service members and whose top tier has been largely white.Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, has been scrambling to put together the nominees who will lead on his top priorities since he defeated Trump in the Nov. 3 election.Biden has already named many of his national security and economic leaders, and his health team will guide the response to his first big challenge - containing a resurgent Covid-19 virus that has killed more than 283,000 Americans, and finding ways to jump-start an economy reeling from pandemic-fueled job losses.Biden will introduce California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Latino former congressman, for secretary of health and human services and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, to run the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was named as Biden’s chief medical adviser on the virus.Biden picked Jeff Zients, an economic adviser known for his managerial skills, as coronavirus “czar” to oversee a response that will include an unprecedented operation to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of a new vaccine, coordinating efforts across multiple federal agencies.Biden’s choice of Becerra, 62, a Latino former congressman, adds a politician to a health effort that otherwise largely relies on government administrators and health experts.But Becerra also has a long record of supporting the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. He played a key role in passing the landmark law during his time in Congress, and in his current California role leads the coalition of 20 states defending the program, including in a case before the Supreme Court last month.A person familiar with Biden’s choice of Austin for the Pentagon said his experience with difficult logistical challenges such as leading the transition of USand Coalition forces out of Iraq could help the Pentagon as it plays a huge role in the vaccine rollout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-nominate-retired-general-at-pentagon-introduce-health-team-to-battle-covid-19/story-JnC3J0rvHRJNrLRWfCSNJK.html
08-12-2020||World||German broadcast fee raise blocked after political standoff||A German state governor moved on Tuesday to block a small rise in the amount Germans pay to finance public broadcasters, attempting to defuse a dispute that revived broader questions about how far Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right party will stand firm on refusing to cooperate with the far right.The plan called for the amount every German household must pay to finance public television and radio broadcasters to be raised by 86 cents to 18.36 euros ($22.26) a month Jan. 1. It needed approval from all 16 of Germany’s state legislatures this month to take effect.Saxony-Anhalt, where a state election is due in June, was the only holdout. Local lawmakers from Merkel’s Christian Democrats objected to the raise with a variety of arguments, questioning the wisdom of raising the levy during the coronavirus crisis.Together with the far-right Alternative for Germany, which is strong in the region and fiercely critical of public broadcasters, the Christian Democrats would have had a majority in the state legislature to vote the deal down.Instead, the governor’s office in the eastern state said Tuesday governor Reiner Haseloff, a Christian Democrat, decided to withdraw the plan from being voted on in the state legislature later this month.That at least takes off the table the prospect of his party being seen voting with the far-right, a possibility that had turned the issue into a major political headache.Haseloff’s coalition partners in the state, the center-left Social Democrats and Greens, made clear that his party teaming up with the far-right would bring down the coalition.And if the Christian Democrats and Alternative for Germany voted together, that would again raise doubts over repeated insistences by Merkel’s party that it won’t cooperate in any way with the far right.Earlier this year, local Christian Democrats joined with the far right in electing a pro-business politician as governor of another eastern state, Thuringia.That convulsed the party. National leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said she would step down after failing to rein in the local branch there. A replacement, who likely would run to succeed Merkel as chancellor in next year’s national election, hasn’t yet been chosen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-broadcast-fee-raise-blocked-after-political-standoff/story-xp3Us8GycTIdT87M8g8EfM.html

08-12-2020||World||New Zealand mosque shooter travelled to India before carrying out attack: Report||Brenton Tarrant, the Australian-born attacker who killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, travelled extensively around the world, including India where he spent nearly three months, before moving to New Zealand to carry out the country’s worst massacre in 2019, according to a detailed report into the shootings released on Tuesday. Five Indians were among those killed in the terror attack on March 15 last year that also left dozens of others wounded and had shaken New Zealand, regarded as one of the most peaceful countries in the world. The 792-page Royal Commission of Inquiry report notes that after leaving school, the 30-year-old attacker worked as a personal trainer at a local gym until 2012 when he suffered an injury. “He never again worked in paid employment. Instead, he lived off the money that he had received from his father and income from investments made with it… With the money from his father, the individual travelled extensively. First, in 2013, he explored New Zealand and Australia and then between 2014 and 2017 he travelled extensively around the world,” it said. Between April 15, 2014, and August 17, 2017, the individual travelled extensively and always alone, except for his travel to North Korea as part of a tour group. “The longest visit the individual made to any one country was to India where he stayed between November 21, 2015, and February 18, 2016. The countries that he visited for periods of about a month or more included China, Japan, Russia, South Korea among others,” said the report that took about 18 months to compile.The inquiry report did not provide details of what Tarrant was doing in India during his nearly three-month stay in India. However, The New Zealand Herald reported that there was no evidence that he met with extremist groups while oversees, investigated potential targets, or carried out any training, in a report. The inquiry did not believe that the travel fuelled his racist views to any great extent, rather concluding: “Put simply, he travelled widely because he could and had nothing better to do.” it said. But he did visit right-wing internet forums, subscribe to right-wing YouTube channels, and “read a great deal about immigration, far right political theories and historical struggles between Christianity and Islam”, it added. About the attacker’s upbringing in Australia, the Royal Commission of Inquiry report notes that it was marked by a number of stressors, including his parents’ separation and his mother’s subsequent relationship with an abusive partner. He expressed “racist ideas” from an early age and was also an avid internet user, it said. “In February 2017, he booked flights to New Zealand to arrive in Auckland on August 17, 2017, and then on to Dunedin on August 20, 2017. We see these activities as the first manifestations of his terrorist intent,” said the report that details the extensive world travels of Tarrant. “We are satisfied that by January 2017 the individual had a terrorist attack in mind. We are also satisfied that when the individual came to live in New Zealand on 17 August 2017, it was with a fully-developed terrorist ideology based on his adoption of the Great Replacement theory and his associated beliefs that immigration, particularly by Muslim migrants, into Western countries is an existential threat to Western society and that the appropriate response (at least for him) was violence,” it said. In a 74-page manifesto the attacker had posted online, he described himself as a white supremacist who was out to avenge attacks in Europe perpetrated by Muslims. Tarrant was sentenced in August to life in prison without the possibility of parole after pleading guilty to 92 counts of terrorism, murder and attempted murder. The report contains interviews with hundreds of people including security agencies, Muslim community leaders, international experts and officials in England, Norway and Australia, along with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who was praised globally for her compassionate response to the attack. The prime minister swiftly banned the sale of the high-capacity semi-automatic weapons used in the attack at two mosques in the South Island city and launched a global movement against online extremism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-mosque-shooter-travelled-to-india-before-carrying-out-attacks-report/story-tPlBcCNMWRdatMJe7S4BHI.html

It is the only other zoo where large felines are known to have contracted coronavirus. All recovered.“The Zoo has contacted and collaborated with international experts such as the Veterinary Service of the Bronx Zoo, the only one that has documented cases of Sars-CoV-2 infection in felines,” the Barcelona zoo said in a statement.“The lions were given veterinary care for their mild clinical condition - similar to a very mild flu condition - through anti-inflammatory treatment and close monitoring, and the animals responded well.”The four-year-old male and the females, who are all 16 years old, have had no contact with other animals at the zoo, which is open to visitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/four-lions-at-spanish-zoo-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-V7ZHZCVmDkq4TcSGShihlL.html
08-12-2020||World||90-year-old gets first Covid-19 vaccine in UK. What’s next for Pfizer?||American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer in collaboration with German biotechnology company BioNTech carried out the world’s first Covid-19 vaccination on a 90-year-old British individual, Margaret Keena, on Tuesday. The vaccine, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which makes use of a chemical messenger to instruct cells into making proteins that mimic the outer surface of the novel coronavirus, thereby rendering immunity against it. Messenger RNA banks on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured rapidly in weeks, and produced at scales much faster than conventional vaccines. After the UK rolled out plans for emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, the pharma giant applied for similar approvals elsewhere in the world. Mentioned below are the main details on the vaccine’s progress and current status in various nations.1. India is accelerating its review process for three vaccines produced by three pharmaceutical firms-- Pfizer, Serum Institute of India (SII), and Bharat Biotech. Pfizer was the first one to submit a request for approval to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), followed by SII and Bharat Biotech. A panel of experts is scheduled to review the findings and come out with the result as early as December 9. 2. Pfizer and BioNTech have sought clearance from the European Union for emergency use. The European Medical Agency (EMA) announced on December 1 that it has scheduled a meeting for assessment on December 29, after it’s done with its review process. If the EMA decides that the benefits of the vaccine outweighs its risks, then Pfizer will be given conditional approval for rolling out vaccines.3. Pfizer had also applied for emergency use clearance with the US government. The Food and Drug Administration(FDA) has scheduled a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on December 10 to review Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine. It had earlier in July granted ‘fast track’ status to the vaccine. 4. Pfizer has initiated procedures for emergency authorization in Canada. Canadian authorities were holding talks and on December 8 they announced plans for starting vaccination drives before the end of this month. Canada is all set to receive six-million doses of vaccine from Pfizer and Moderna by the end of March. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in a press conference that vaccinations could start as early as next week, as some 249,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine are expected to arrive in Canada in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/90-year-old-gets-first-covid-19-vaccine-in-uk-what-s-next-for-pfizer/story-bns7KYbhm4n42w0oe6ujLJ.html
08-12-2020||World||Travel restrictions effective in countries with low number of Covid-19 cases: Lancet study||Travel restrictions are effective in countries with low numbers of Covid-19 cases, or that have strong travel links with nations experiencing high rates of the viral infection, according to a study published in The Lancet Public Health journal.The study also suggests that travel restrictions may have been most effective during the early stages of the pandemic, and the measures are unlikely to be effective when the virus is already spreading rapidly within a country.“We recognise that these measures carry a high economic and social cost, so it is important that governments use travel restrictions in a targeted way,” said Professor Mark Jit from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the study.“Before introducing restrictions, they should take into account local infection figures, epidemic growth rates, and the volume of travellers arriving from countries heavily-affected by the virus,” Jit explained.The researchers used detailed flight data to compare the number of expected Covid-19 cases arriving from international flights with the number of infections arising from transmission within individual countries.They produced estimates of international travellers in May and September 2020 based on two scenarios.One scenario used flight data for the same months in 2019, assuming no reduction in travel numbers, and the other scenario was based on the expected reduction in passenger numbers.Numbers of Covid-19 cases and infection rates were estimated using a mathematical model that adjusts recorded cases to take account of asymptomatic and unreported infections.Results were determined based on how imported Covid-19 cases would affect local epidemic growth rates, using country-specific reproduction number, or R number, estimates.Where imported cases accounted for more than 10 per cent of infections within individual countries, they were considered to have a major impact on growth of the epidemic, the study found.The work estimated that when imported cases accounted for less than 10 per cent, their impact on the growth of the epidemic is usually small, while those below 1 per cent would have an almost undetectable effect on epidemic size.The researchers noted that had there been no travel restrictions or reduction in travel volumes in May 2020, the imported Covid-19 cases would account for more than 10 per cent of infections in the majority of countries included in the analysis, the researchers said.Imported cases would account for no more than 10 per cent of infections in 34 out of 136 countries, and less than 1 per cent in four, they said.According to the estimates based on expected passenger numbers in May 2020, imported cases would have contributed to more than 10 per cent of total incidence in 74 countries, less than 10 per cent of total incidence in 62 countries, and to less than 1 per cent in eight countries.However, by September 2020, had there been no travel restrictions or reduction in travel volumes, imported cases would account for more than 10 per cent of infections in only a small number of countries.Imported cases account for less than 10 per cent of infections in 106 out of 162 countries, and less than 1 per cent in 21, the researchers said.According to the estimates based on expected passenger numbers in September 2020, travel restrictions would have contributed to more than 10 per cent of infections in only 37 countries, less than 10 per cent in 125 countries and less than 1 per cent in only 44 countries.The findings indicate that international travel restrictions were most effective at limiting local transmission of the virus during earlier stages of the pandemic, said the researchers, adding this is because imported cases led to outbreaks in countries with very few or no existing cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/travel-restrictions-effective-in-countries-with-low-number-of-covid-19-cases-lancet-study/story-xJL8hHHv2ZlEfVPLzJzOBO.html
08-12-2020||World||I just got a Covid-19 vaccine. Now what?||Britain will become the first country in the world on Tuesday to roll out the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, initially making the shot available at 50 hospitals.The country’s National Health Service will give priority to vaccinating people over the age of 80, frontline healthcare workers and nursing home staff and residents.Here is what people getting the vaccine should expect.WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE GETS THE VACCINE?The vaccine, developed with new messenger RNA technology using a manufactured fragment of the coronavirus’ genetic code, is injected into the arm. The immunization is given in two doses, three weeks apart, and has been shown in trials to protect up to 95% of recipients from contracting Covid-19.Also Read: Britain expects next batch of Pfizer vaccine next week, says health ministerPfizer has said side effects in trial volunteers were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly. The most severe side effects occurred after the second dose: fatigue in 3.8% of volunteers and headache in 2%. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events.WHAT KIND OF PROTECTION DOES IT GIVE?The vaccine prevented Covid-19 illness seven days after the second injection - which is about a month after the first shot. Clinical trials so far have not been designed to determine if an immunized person can still spread the coronavirus to someone else. Some vaccines, such as hepatitis A, do provide such protection - known as sterilizing immunity - but others do not. Covid-19 vaccine makers focused trials on determining whether the drug stopped people from getting ill. It will also be several more months before it becomes clear how long the vaccination will protect someone from coronavirus infection. Also Read: UK PM Boris Johnson thanks health workers after Covid-19 vaccine launch“Until then, it is better to avoid the pub, and other in-person gatherings with many people,” said Dr. Anita Shet, infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.DOES THE VACCINE MEAN BACK TO NORMAL LIFE?Since there is no evidence that the immunization prevents transmission of the virus - and no vaccine is 100% effective - scientists call for continued vigilance, including mask-wearing, hand-washing and social distancing.“As with all vaccines, it may work really great in certain patient subsets, but not as well in others ... Does that mean you are free to hop on a plane or have 30 people over at your house? Probably not,” said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director for infection prevention at Colorado’s UCHealth.She said vaccination campaigns are unlikely to reach “a critical mass” until next spring or early summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-just-got-a-covid-19-vaccine-now-what/story-pW1ZRWL5yYcTPwAcpQnclJ.html
08-12-2020||World||William Shakespeare among first to get Covid-19 vaccine in UK||Margaret Keenan, 90, became the first person to be vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine early on Tuesday, but the second person to get it also hit the headlines and tickled some funny bones – the reason: his name is William Shakespeare.Both received the vaccine in the University Hospital in Coventry in the Midlands, not far from Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of the better-known Bard of Avon. The modern-day Shakespeare is 81, which makes him eligible to be in the first group to receive the vaccine.His name sparked much ado and creativity on the social media, evidence that there is lots in a name. The image of Shakespeare receiving the vaccine was widely shared, with remarks such as: ‘The Taming of Flu’ and ‘The Two Gentlemen of Corona’.One commentator wondered if Keenan were to be called Patient 1A, would Shakespeare be “Patient 2B or not 2B?” Another said he was “glad he (Shakespeare) wasn’t Bard from having it”, and some hoped that “In a world when people hardly ever remember who came second, the second person to get the Covid jab might stick in the memory”.Health secretary Matt Hancock also had a laugh on live television that the second person to receive the vaccine was named William Shakespeare, insisting the vaccine roll-out “makes you so proud to be British”.Among those lined up to first receive the vaccine are Hari Shukla, a retired teacher and race relations campaigner in north England, and his wife, Ranjan, 83, at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. They are among the over-80-year-olds prioritised to receive the first of the 800,000 doses in 50 hospitals across the UK. The vaccine is administered in two doses, 21 days apart.Awarded the royal honours of MBE, OBE and CBE for his work in race relations, the Uganda-born Shukla said: “I am delighted to be doing my bit by having the vaccine, I feel it is my duty to do so and do whatever I can to help. I feel very comfortable and happy to be the first one”.“As far as I’m concerned, I’m excited about it. We were waiting for this vaccine for a very long time. Having been in contact with the NHS staff, I know how hard they all work and I am grateful for everything they have done to keep us safe during the pandemic”.The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine and is expected to receive 4 million more by the end of this month. The UK regulator is also evaluating the clinical data of the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccine candidates.Shukla, widely seen as a local hero, added: “We hope that everybody will participate in it and get back to next to normal. I have been following the news and our scientists have done a wonderful job. I have no doubt in my mind they are the best in the world.”Several individuals such as Shukla and Ranjan receiving the vaccine is being publicised widely by the UK’s health authorities to overcome anti-vaccine anxieties among some people, as well as content on social media.Queen Elizabeth, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, are also expected to be among the first to receive the vaccine.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “Today marks a huge step forward in the UK’s fight against coronavirus. As the programme ramps up in the weeks and months ahead, it is as important as ever to keep to the Covid winter plan - following the rules in your area and remember the basics of hands, face and space.”Simon Stevens, NHS England’s chief executive, called the start of the vaccine programme a “turning point”, and said: “The deployment of this vaccine marks a decisive turning point in the battle with the pandemic. NHS vaccination programmes which have successfully helped overcome tuberculosis, polio and smallpox now turn their focus to coronavirus.”As of Monday evening, 61,434 people have died in UK hospitals and care-homes, making it the worst affected country in Europe, including over 1,000 people of Indian origin. The number of cases has climbed to 17,37,960.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/william-shakespeare-among-first-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-in-uk/story-zFqxHhRal6QIPE2NR3oHXJ.html

08-12-2020||World||Germany commissions report that will address police racism||After a lengthy political standoff, Germany’s top security official has commissioned a study into police work that will include examining the extent of racism in the force.The study is to be conducted over three years, the Interior Ministry said Tuesday, meaning it will fall to Germany’s next government to consider what to do with the results. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who plans to retire from politics after next year’s election, won’t be part of that government.In July, calls to study the use of racial profiling by police — a practice that human rights activists say is widespread in Germany — led to divisions in the governing coalition of conservatives and center-left Social Democrats.The conservative-run Interior Ministry, which oversees federal police, initially agreed to the idea but then backtracked.Seehofer insisted that there was “no structural problem,” but eventually agreed to a broader study that is billed as exploring the everyday working life of police officers and their motivation for going into the police force, as well as violence against police.The study will be conducted by the German Police University, the Interior Ministry said. It said that “zero tolerance” measures against anti-Semitism, right-wing extremism and racism will “be further developed if needed.”The university plans to compile the study using questionnaires, interviews and other observations.Debates about racial profiling and the broader issue of systemic racism in Germany were amplified this year by the worldwide protests that followed the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed Black man, in the United States. A white police officer pressed his knee against the 46-year-old Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-commissions-report-that-will-address-police-racism/story-lj3CbY6T96dyIXcUmE9tVM.html
08-12-2020||World||Trump administration passed up chance to buy more Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine doses||President Donald Trump aims to take credit Tuesday for the speedy development of forthcoming coronavirus vaccines, even as his administration is coming under scrutiny for failing to lock in a chance to buy millions of additional doses of one of the leading contenders.That decision could delay the delivery of a second batch of doses until manufacturer Pfizer fulfills other international contracts.The revelation, confirmed Monday by people familiar with the matter, came on the eve of Trump’s plans to host a White House summit aimed at celebrating the expected approval of the first vaccine later this week. His administration is seeking to tamp down public skepticism over the vaccine and secure a key component of the Republican president’s legacy.The focus was to be on the administration’s plans to distribute and administer the vaccine, but officials from President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team, which will oversee the bulk of the largest vaccination program in the nation’s history once he takes office January 20, were not invited.Pfizer’s vaccine is expected to be endorsed by a panel of Food and Drug Administration(FDA) advisers as soon as this week, with delivery of 100 million doses — enough for 50 million Americans — expected in coming months.Under its contract with Pfizer, the Trump administration committed to buy an initial 100 million doses, with an option to purchase as many as five times more.This summer, the White House opted not to lock in an additional 100 million doses for delivery in the second quarter of 2021, according to people who spoke about the matter on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.Days ahead of the vaccine’s expected approval, the administration is reversing course, but it is not clear that Pfizer, which has since made commitments to other countries, will be able to meet the latest request on the same timeline.The Pfizer vaccine is one of two on track for emergency FDA authorization this month, the other coming from drugmaker Moderna.The Trump administration insisted late Monday that between those two vaccines and others in the pipeline, the US will be able to accommodate any American who wants to be vaccinated by the end of the second quarter of 2021.The administration’s decision not to lock in additional Pfizer purchases last summer was first reported by The New York Times. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told NBC the administration is “continuing to work across manufacturers to expand the availability of releasable, of FDA-approved vaccine as quickly as possible. … We do still have that option for an additional 500 million doses.”The “Operation Warp Speed” summit will feature Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a host of government experts, state leaders and business executives, as the White House looks to explain that the vaccine is safe and lay out the administration’s plans to bring it to the American people.Senior administration officials provided details on the summit on Monday. An official with the Biden transition confirmed no invitation was extended.Officials from the pharmaceutical companies developing the vaccines also were not expected to attend, despite receiving invitations, according to people familiar with the matter. Some expressed concerns about the event contributing to the politicization of the vaccine development process and potentially further inhibiting public confidence in the drugs.Trump is set to kick off the event with remarks aiming to “celebrate” vaccine development, according to an official who previewed the event. Trump also will sign an executive order to prioritize Americans for coronavirus vaccines procured by the federal government. A second official said the order would restrict the US government from donating doses to other nations until there is excess supply to meet domestic demand. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans for the summit.It was not immediately clear what, if any, impact the order would have on other nations’ abilities to access the vaccines. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Monday he expects his country to receive about 250,000 doses of a vaccine from Pfizer by the end of the year.The Food and Drug Administration’s panel of outside vaccine experts is to meet Thursday to conduct a final review of the Pfizer drug, and it will meet later this month on a vaccine developed by Moderna. The FDA is not required to follow the panel’s advice, though it usually does. Agency decisions on the two drugs are expected within days of each meeting. Both have been determined to be 95% effective against the virus that causes Covid-19. Plans call for distributing and then administering about 40 million doses of the two companies’ vaccines by the end of the year — with the first doses shipping within hours of FDA clearance.Biden said Friday that “there’s no detailed plan that we’ve seen” for how to get the vaccines out of containers, into syringes and then into people’s arms.Trump administration officials insist that such plans have been developed, with the bulk of the work falling to states and municipal governments to ensure their most vulnerable populations are vaccinated first. The administration says it has leveraged partnerships with manufacturers, distributers and health care providers, so that outside of settings like veterans’ hospitals, “it is highly unlikely that a single federal employee will touch a dose of vaccine before it goes into your arm.”In all, about 50,000 vaccination sites are enrolled in the government’s distribution system, the officials said.Each of the forthcoming vaccines has unique logistical challenges related to distribution and administration. The Pfizer vaccine must be transported at super-cooled temperatures, and comes in batches of 975 doses. Each vial contains five doses, requiring careful planning. The administration has prepared detailed videos for providers on how to safely prepare and administer doses, to be posted after the FDA issues its emergency use authorization.One such plan is to be announced Tuesday: Pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens have stood up a “mobile vaccination service” ready to vaccinate people in every nursing home and long-term care facility in the country. The roughly 3 million residents of those facilities are among the most vulnerable for Covid-19 and have been placed at the front of the line to access the vaccine, along with more than 20 million healthcare workers. So far 80-85% of the facilities have signed on to the service, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-passed-up-chance-to-buy-more-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-doses/story-Hv3ks92z4wmqbgAt1MGv9N.html
08-12-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson says brexit talks ‘very tricky’ but still hopeful||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave a downbeat assessment of the state of trade talks with the European Union, saying the situation is “very tricky” but he still hopes to reach a deal.“It’s looking very, very difficult at the moment,” Johnson told reporters in his first public comments since announcing he will travel to Brussels in a bid to break the deadlock in negotiations.“Hope springs eternal, and I’ll do my best to sort it out if we can.”Johnson is due to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen this week after eight months of negotiations to resolve three key disagreements between the two sides: what access EU boats will have to UK fishing waters, how any agreement will be governed, and the extent to which the UK will have to align its rules with the EU in future.“We’re willing to engage at any level political or otherwise, we’re willing to try anything,” Johnson said. “But there are just limits beyond which, obviously, no sensible independent government or country could go.”The UK will leave the European single market and customs union on Dec. 31 -- with or without an agreement. Both the European and UK parliaments need to ratify any accord, so one has to be reached before then to be implemented in time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-says-brexit-talks-very-tricky-but-still-hopeful/story-voDCMc2Zuke5wP6IX9ekdL.html
08-12-2020||World||It’s 8,848.86 metres: China, Nepal jointly announce new height for Mount Everest||Mount Everest, the world’s tallest peak, is 8,848.86 metres ( 2,9031.69 feet) tall, China and Nepal jointly announced on Tuesday, also marking a new peak in the two countries’ increasingly close ties.Nepal until now had recognised the height of the mountain as 8,848 metres as measured by the Survey of India in 1954. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Nepalese counterpart Bidya Devi Bhandari announced the new height of the tallest mountain in the world through an exchange of letters, Chinese official media announced.Tuesday’s announcement marked the end of a debate between Beijing and Kathmandu - although it was hardly an issue in their close bilateral ties - over a “three-metre” height difference the two neighbours had on the mountain’s height.Mount Everest straddles the two countries. It is from the Nepalese side that climbers mostly make it to the peak.Previous calculations by Chinese researchers from a 2005 survey put the mountain’s height at 8,844 metres while Nepal had maintained it was a little taller. In his letter, Xi said that the two countries had reached a consensus to jointly announce the latest elevation of Mount Everest. Xi pointed out that Mount Everest was a symbol of friendship between the two countries for generations. “The two countries have established the world’s highest peak as the boundary peak between China and Nepal and the ‘China-Nepal Friendship Peak’”, the Chinese President said.The joint announcement fully reflects the high-level of sustained development of China-Nepal ties, Xi told Bhandari.With the joint efforts of both sides, the political mutual trust between the two countries has been increasing day by day, the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” is progressing steadily, and the trans-Himalayan three-dimensional interconnection network is changing from a vision to a reality, the Chinese President said.On her part, Bhandari was quoted by Chinese official media as saying the joint announcement was of “historical significance”.Nepal and China have always been good neighbours, good friends, and good partners, Bhandari said, adding that cooperation between the two countries in areas such as economic development, connectivity, and humanities is in the interests of both countries. According to the official news agency, Xinhua, Nepalese surveyors had reached the top of the mountain in May 2019 to measure it.A team of Chinese surveyors also climbed it in May, 2020.The Nepali government’s efforts to measure the height had come amid speculations from some scientists that the world’s tallest mountain has shrunk after Nepal’s devastating earthquake in 2015.It was the first time Nepal itself measured its height.“In 1975, Chinese surveyors measured Mt. Qomolangma as standing at 8,848.13 metres above sea level, which was recognised by the international community,” the Xinhua report said.In this survey, the Chinese team, for the first time in human history, erected a survey marker atop the summit, allowing six survey points at the foot of the mountain to simultaneously measure the height of the peak.“In 2005, China remeasured the elevation of Mt. Qomolangma, combining traditional geodetic (land survey) methods and satellite technologies. The task adjusted the height after measuring the depth of the snow cap atop the summit”.In 1999, the US National Geographic Society and Boston’s Museum of Science measured the height of the peak at 8,850 metres including snow, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-8-848-86-metres-china-nepal-jointly-announce-new-height-for-mount-everest/story-JuF3vpRbYqtVh2EHDVXJQP.html
08-12-2020||World||UK-EU talks near collapse ahead of Johnson Brussels trip||Britain and the European Union warned Tuesday that talks on a post-Brexit free-trade deal are teetering on the brink of collapse, with just over three weeks until an economic rupture that will cause upheaval for businesses on both sides of the English Channel.Officials downplayed the chances of a breakthrough when Prime Minister Boris Johnson heads to Brussels for face-to-face talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in the next few days.With negotiators deadlocked on key issues after months of tense talks, German European Affairs Minister Michael Roth said the bloc’s confidence in Britain was hanging in the balance.“What we need is political will in London,” said Roth, whose country currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency. “Let me be very clear, our future relationship is based on trust and confidence. It’s precisely this confidence that is at stake in our negotiations right now.“We want to reach a deal, but not at any price,” Roth told reporters before chairing videoconference talks among his EU counterparts.Johnson’s Downing St. office said the situation was “very tricky” and collapse of the talks was a distinct possibility.Johnson and von der Leyen, head of the EU’s executive arm, spoke by phone Monday for the second time in 48 hours. They said afterwards that “significant differences” remained on three key issues — fishing rights, fair-competition rules and the governance of future disputes — and “the conditions for finalizing an agreement are not there.”The two leaders said in the joint statement that they planned to discuss the remaining differences “in a physical meeting in Brussels in the coming days.”Leaders of the EU’s 27 nations are holding a two-day summit in Brussels starting Thursday.The UK left the EU politically on January 31, but remains within the bloc’s tariff-free single market and customs union through Dec. 31. Reaching a trade deal by then would ensure there are no tariffs and trade quotas on goods exported or imported by the two sides, although there would still be new costs and red tape.Both sides would suffer economically from a failure to secure a trade deal, but most economists think the British economy would take a greater hit because the UK does almost half its trade with the bloc.While both Britain and the EU say they want a trade deal, trust and goodwill are strained after months of testy negotiations.The relationship has been further strained by British legislation that breaches the legally binding Brexit withdrawal agreement Johnson struck with the EU last year.Britain says the Internal Market Bill, which gives the government power to override parts of the withdrawal agreement relating to trade with Northern Ireland, is needed as an “insurance policy” to protect the flow of goods within the U.K. in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The EU sees it as an act of bad faith that could imperil Northern Ireland’s peace settlement.The House of Lords, Parliament’s unelected upper chamber, removed the law-breaking clauses from the legislation last month, but the elected House of Commons restored them on Monday night.As the parliamentary tussle continues, the British government has offered the bloc an olive branch on the issue, saying it will remove the lawbreaking clauses if a joint UK-EU committee on Northern Ireland finds solutions in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-talks-near-collapse-ahead-of-johnson-brussels-trip/story-lvfDLOdYhapg3G8tkIkiIL.html
08-12-2020||World||China condemns new US Hong Kong sanctions, Taiwan arms sale||China on Tuesday lashed out at the US over new sanctions against Chinese officials and the sale of more military equipment to Taiwan.The US actions are part of what critics see as an effort by the Trump administration to put in place high-pressure tactics toward Beijing that could make it more difficult for President-elect Joe Biden to steady relations.The Cabinet’s office for Hong Kong affairs expressed “strong outrage and condemnation” over the sanctions levelled against 14 members of the standing committee of China’s legislature, which passed a sweeping Hong Kong National Security Law earlier this year.Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, meanwhile, demanded the US cancel its latest arms sale to Taiwan and said China would make a “proper and necessary response.” The State Department on Monday said it added 14 members of the Chinese legislature’s standing committee to the list of officials banned from traveling to the US or having access to the US financial system over the crackdown on civil rights in Hong Kong.It also announced the approval of a $280 million sale of advanced military communications equipment to Taiwan.President Donald Trump’s administration has incensed Beijing with 11 separate arms sales and closer military and political ties with the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its own territory, to be annexed by force if necessary.China has stepped up military flights near the island and pledged to punish US companies involved in the arms deals in response.Taiwan’s government welcomed the announcement, saying it showed Washington was honoring its commitment to help strengthen the island’s defenses.“Taiwan has been at the receiving end of such military threats on a daily basis,” President Tsai Ing-wen told reporters Tuesday. “Only through engagement and by working together can we tackle the threats and challenges that beset our region and the world.” The US earlier imposed sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials over the passage of the National Security Law, which is seen as rolling back civil liberties in the territory, as well as over abuses against Muslim minority groups in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.This year it forced the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston and last week cut the duration of US visas for members of the ruling Communist Party and their family members from 10 years to one month.The Trump administration appears to be using Taiwan, Hong Kong and other issues to heighten the level of confrontation in China-U.S. relations, said Su Hao, professor of international relations at China Foreign Affairs University.“Trump would like to see a formation of a solidified structure of China-US relations that will make it difficult for Biden to make changes,” Su said.Trump may view the increased toughness toward China as a legacy of his time in office, said Diao Daming, associate professor in the School of International Studies at Beijing’s Renmin University.“This is hurting bilateral relations, harming the interests of the countries and their citizens, and failing to meet the expectations of international society,” Diao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-condemns-new-us-hong-kong-sanctions-taiwan-arms-sale/story-jylVtTyYOQ0N5rIXTa44cL.html
08-12-2020||World||Donald Trump adviser Peter Navarro violated Hatch Act by criticising Joe Biden, says watchdog||A federal watchdog agency on Monday reported that one of President Donald Trump’s economic advisers repeatedly violated the law during the campaign season with his criticisms of Joe Biden, now the president-elect.The Hatch Act prevents federal employees from engaging in political work while performing their official duties. The agency charged with enforcing the act said that Peter Navarro, director of the White House Office for Trade and Manufacturing Policy, used his position to influence the 2020 presidential election through his statements in television interviews and on social media.“His comments were directed at undermining Mr. Biden’s presidential candidacy and persuading voters not to support him in the 2020 election,” the Office of Special Counsel report stated.White House lawyers have asserted Navarro did not violate the Hatch Act because factual or policy statements do not constitute advocacy for or against a candidate, the report stated. They argued, for example, that Navarro’s statement about Biden “kowtowing to the Chinese” was acceptable for him to make in his official capacity.But the Office of Special Counsel found that argument lacking. It said federal employees violate the law when they make statements intended to encourage others to vote for or against a candidate for political office or when they promote or disparage a candidate’s campaign.“Dr. Navarro violated the Hatch Act because he engaged in that very activity,” the report said.The report said it’s up to the president to determine the “appropriate disciplinary action,” showing the limits of the law. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a private advocacy group, said that it submitted multiple complaints about Navarro to the Office of Special Counsel and that “the referral for action demonstrate the severity of Navarro’s misconduct.”“In an administration full of people illegally using their government positions to influence an election, Navarro has been one of the worst,” said the group’s executive director, Noah Bookbinder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-adviser-peter-navarro-violated-hatch-act-by-criticising-joe-biden-says-watchdog/story-fjDmfVABGItRA5yJC1SC8N.html
08-12-2020||World||Chuck Yeager, pilot who broke sound barrier, dies at 97||Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Charles “Chuck” Yeager, the World War II fighter pilot ace and quintessential test pilot who showed he had the “right stuff” when in 1947 he became the first person to fly faster than sound, has died. He was 97.Yeager died Monday, his wife, Victoria Yeager, said on his Twitter account. “It is w/ profound sorrow, I must tell you that my life love General Chuck Yeager passed just before 9pm ET. An incredible life well lived, America’s greatest Pilot, & a legacy of strength, adventure, & patriotism will be remembered forever.”Yeager’s death is “a tremendous loss to our nation,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement.“Gen. Yeager’s pioneering and innovative spirit advanced America’s abilities in the sky and set our nation’s dreams soaring into the jet age and the space age. He said, ‘You don’t concentrate on risks. You concentrate on results. No risk is too great to prevent the necessary job from getting done,’” Bridenstine said.“In an age of media-made heroes, he is the real deal,” Edwards Air Force Base historian Jim Young said in August 2006 at the unveiling of a bronze statue of Yeager.He was “the most righteous of all those with the right stuff,” said Maj. Gen. Curtis Bedke, commander of the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards.Yeager, from a small town in the hills of West Virginia, flew for more than 60 years, including piloting an X-15 to near 1,000 mph (1,609 kph) at Edwards in October 2002 at age 79.“Living to a ripe old age is not an end in itself. The trick is to enjoy the years remaining,” he said in “Yeager: An Autobiography.”“I haven’t yet done everything, but by the time I’m finished, I won’t have missed much,” he wrote. “If I auger in (crash) tomorrow, it won’t be with a frown on my face. I’ve had a ball.”On Oct. 14, 1947, Yeager, then a 24-year-old captain, pushed an orange, bullet-shaped Bell X-1 rocket plane past 660 mph to break the sound barrier, at the time a daunting aviation milestone.“Sure, I was apprehensive,” he said in 1968. “When you’re fooling around with something you don’t know much about, there has to be apprehension. But you don’t let that affect your job.”The modest Yeager said in 1947 he could have gone even faster had the plane carried more fuel. He said the ride “was nice, just like riding fast in a car.”Yeager nicknamed the rocket plane, and all his other aircraft, “Glamorous Glennis” for his wife, who died in 1990.Yeager’s feat was kept top secret for about a year when the world thought the British had broken the sound barrier first.“It wasn’t a matter of not having airplanes that would fly at speeds like this. It was a matter of keeping them from falling apart,” Yeager said.Sixty-five years later to the minute, on Oct. 14, 2012, Yeager commemorated the feat, flying in the back seat of an F-15 Eagle as it broke the sound barrier at more than 30,000 feet (9,144 meters) above California’s Mojave Desert.His exploits were told in Tom Wolfe’s book “The Right Stuff,” and the 1983 film it inspired.Yeager was born Feb. 23, 1923, in Myra, a tiny community on the Mud River deep in an Appalachian hollow about 40 miles southwest of Charleston. The family later moved to Hamlin, the county seat. His father was an oil and gas driller and a farmer.“What really strikes me looking over all those years is how lucky I was, how lucky, for example, to have been born in 1923 and not 1963 so that I came of age just as aviation itself was entering the modern era,” Yeager said in a December 1985 speech at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.“I was just a lucky kid who caught the right ride,” he said.Yeager enlisted in the Army Air Corps after graduating from high school in 1941. He later regretted that his lack of a college education prevented him from becoming an astronaut.He started off as an aircraft mechanic and, despite becoming severely airsick during his first airplane ride, signed up for a program that allowed enlisted men to become pilots.Yeager shot down 13 German planes on 64 missions during World War II, including five on a single mission. He was once shot down over German-held France but escaped with the help of French partisans.After World War II, he became a test pilot beginning at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.Among the flights he made after breaking the sound barrier was one on Dec. 12. 1953, when he flew an X-1A to a record of more than 1,600 mph. He said he had gotten up at dawn that day and went hunting, bagging a goose before his flight. That night, he said, his family ate the goose for dinner.He returned to combat during the Vietnam War, flying several missions a month in twin-engine B-57 Canberras making bombing and strafing runs over South Vietnam.Yeager also commanded Air Force fighter squadrons and wings, and the Aerospace Research Pilot School for military astronauts.“I’ve flown 341 types of military planes in every country in the world and logged about 18,000 hours,” he said in an interview in the January 2009 issue of Men’s Journal. “It might sound funny, but I’ve never owned an airplane in my life. If you’re willing to bleed, Uncle Sam will give you all the planes you want.”When Yeager left Hamlin, he was already known as a daredevil. On later visits, he often buzzed the town.“I live just down the street from his mother,” said Gene Brewer, retired publisher of the weekly Lincoln Journal. “One day I climbed up on my roof with my 8 mm camera when he flew overhead. I thought he was going to take me off the roof. You can see the treetops in the bottom of the pictures.”Yeager flew an F-80 under a Charleston bridge at 450 mph on Oct. 10, 1948, according to newspaper accounts. When he was asked to repeat the feat for photographers, Yeager replied: “You should never strafe the same place twice ’cause the gunners will be waiting for you.”Yeager never forgot his roots and West Virginia named bridges, schools and Charleston’s airport after him.“My beginnings back in West Virginia tell who I am to this day,” Yeager wrote. “My accomplishments as a test pilot tell more about luck, happenstance and a person’s destiny. But the guy who broke the sound barrier was the kid who swam the Mud River with a swiped watermelon or shot the head off a squirrel before going to school.”Yeager was awarded the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star, the Air Medal and the Purple Heart. President Harry S. Truman awarded him the Collier air trophy in December 1948 for his breaking the sound barrier. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985.Yeager retired from the Air Force in 1975 and moved to a ranch in Cedar Ridge in Northern California where he continued working as a consultant to the Air Force and Northrop Corp. and became well known to younger generations as a television pitchman for automotive parts and heat pumps.He married Glennis Dickhouse of Oroville, California, on Feb. 26, 1945. She died of ovarian cancer in December 1990. They had four children: Donald, Michael, Sharon and Susan.Yeager married 45-year-old Victoria Scott D’Angelo in 2003.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chuck-yeager-pilot-who-broke-sound-barrier-dies-at-97/story-pR3HbWZuONN9EzGijuedBM.html
08-12-2020||World||Thailand uses drones for border surveillance as coronavirus risk grows||Thailand is stepping up border surveillance by deploying drones and ultraviolet cameras after dozens of new Covid-19 cases were found linked to a town in neighboring Myanmar.At least 16 people who illegally crossed the borders and avoided the mandatory 14-day quarantine have tested positive for coronavirus since late November with two local transmissions being traced back to the group that came from Myanmar, according to officials. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha ordered officials on Monday to erect barricades along the porous border to stop illegal crossings and curb infection risks.The virus situation is “under control” and the latest bout of infections among those returning from Myanmar isn’t yet considered a second wave as they can be traced, Deputy Premier and Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Tuesday.Thailand-Myanmar border is one of the key challenges for authorities to curb infection risks as the 1,500-mile boundary runs through mostly mountainous forests and uninhabited areas, making it difficult for surveillance. Military, police and volunteers have now been deployed to enforce stricter control of border areas.Total cases in Thailand stood at 4,126 where authorities have managed to virtually eradicated the pathogen domestically, with the majority of recent cases found in quarantine among people arriving from other countries. Myanmar, on the other hand, has seen spikes in infections over the past several weeks, adding more than 1,000 each day.The Covid-19 surge has already hurt domestic tourism, with some travelers canceling their planned long weekend trips to the northern region, which borders Myanmar. Any shutdown of border crossings between the two countries could also hurt Thailand’s trade and the economic activities of border towns.Thailand received about 1,200 foreign tourists in October, the first set of visitors in six months after authorities unveiled a special long-stay tourist visa to revive the battered industry. A revival in tourism, which netted more than $60 billion in revenue from about 40 million visitors in 2019, is seen as key to returning the nation’s economy to the pre-pandemic levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-uses-drones-for-border-surveillance-as-coronavirus-risk-grows/story-hHExO7nZxft5GXQaYv5U1O.html
08-12-2020||World||Britain expects next batch of Pfizer vaccine next week, says health minister||Britain is confident that the next batch of the Pfizer vaccine will be delivered next week, said its health minister Matt Hancock, after Margaret Keenan became the first Briton to be vaccinated on Tuesday.“We have a high degree of confidence in the delivery that will come next week,” Hancock told Sky News.He said he felt “quite emotional” seeing the pictures of the first vaccination taking place, adding that the programme was starting across 70 hospitals in the UK.Britain is due to receive several million more doses of the vaccination over the course of this month, he added. Britain began the mass-vaccination of its population against Covid-19 on Tuesday, becoming the first Western nation to do so in a global endeavour that poses one of the biggest logistical challenges in peacetime history.On a day dubbed “V-Day”, health workers started inoculating people with a shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, with the country a test case for the world as it contends with distributing a compound that must be stored at -70C (-94F).Read more| UK PM Boris Johnson thanks health workers after Covid-19 vaccine launchBritain is the first country globally to begin mass inoculations with that vaccine, one of three shots that have reported successful results from large trials after being developed in record time.Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old grandmother from Britain, was the first person in the world to receive the vaccine outside of a trial following its rapid clinical approval.Health minister Matt Hancock described the start of vaccinations as “V-Day”. “If we manage to do that for everybody who is vulnerable to this disease, then we can move on and we can return to normal,” he said. The launch will fuel hope that the world may be turning a corner in the fight against a pandemic that has killed more than 1.5 million people and crushed economies. Britain, the worst-hit European country with over 61,000 deaths, has ordered enough supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot to vaccinate 20 million people. The developers said it was 95% effective in preventing illness in final-stage trials. Britain approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use less than a week ago, and is rolling it out ahead of the United States and European Union, from which it will finally part ways at the end of the year.“The deployment of this vaccine marks a decisive turning point in the battle with the pandemic,” said Simon Stevens, head of the publicly funded NHS health service. In total Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. As each person requires two doses, that is enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million.But the country is spreading it bets and has ordered 357 million doses of seven different Covid-19 vaccines in all.Russia and China have both already started giving domestically produced vaccine candidates to their populations, though before final safety and efficacy trials have been completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-expects-next-batch-of-pfizer-vaccine-next-week-says-health-minister/story-VvZgytfCVfyLKMBCXwPUsL.html
08-12-2020||World||‘Unsupervised internet access, racist ideas’: 800-page report on how New Zealand mosque shooter eluded detection||A comprehensive report into the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in which 51 Muslim worshippers were slaughtered sheds new light on how the gunman was able to elude detection by authorities as he planned out his attack.The nearly 800-page Royal Commission of Inquiry report released Tuesday shows that the attacker, Brenton Tarrant, kept a low profile and told nobody of his plans.It concludes that despite the shortcomings of various agencies, there were no clear signs the attack was imminent — aside from the manifesto Tarrant sent out just eight minutes before he began shooting, which came too late for agencies to respond.But the report does detail failings in the police system for vetting gun licenses, and says that New Zealand’s intelligence agencies were focused on the threat posed by Islamic extremism rather than white supremacists.Among 44 recommendations, the report says the government should establish a new national intelligence agency.New Zealand currently has one intelligence agency that focuses on domestic threats and one that focuses on international threats. Often those agencies are focused on immediate events like keeping visiting dignitaries safe. The report recommends establishing a new, well-financed intelligence and security agency that’s more strategic in nature and can focus on emerging threats and developing a counter-terrorism strategy.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the government has agreed to implement all of the recommendations and apologized for agency shortcomings.Tarrant, who is Australian, was sentenced in August to life in prison without the possibility of parole after pleading guilty to 92 counts of terrorism, murder and attempted murder.The report details the extensive world travels of Tarrant but also shows he had almost no meaningful interactions with people in New Zealand because he was introverted and didn’t work.As a child, Tarrant had unsupervised access to the internet and became interested in video games from the age of six or seven, the report says. He began expressing racist ideas from a young age and told his mother he started using the 4chan internet forum from age 14.He put on a lot of weight as a teenager before starting to exercise compulsively at gyms and going on a diet, losing about 50 kilograms (110 pounds). His father Rodney was diagnosed with lung cancer caused by exposure to asbestos and in 2010 killed himself at home, leaving an inheritance of 457,000 Australian dollars (USD 339,000) to Tarrant.The gunman worked for about three years as a personal trainer at a gym in the Australian town of Grafton, but stopped working after an injury and then used his inheritance to live and travel. He visited dozens of countries around the world, including India, China, Russia, North Korea, and many countries in Africa and Europe.He moved to New Zealand in 2017 and focused on planning for his attack. The report said he only had superficial interactions with people at a gym and the rifle club where he practiced rapid-fire shooting. Yet when needed, Tarrant could present himself to others in a way that didn’t arouse suspicion.Tarrant told investigators that although he frequented extreme right-wing discussion boards on websites like 4chan and 8chan, he found YouTube a far more significant source of information and inspiration.Ardern said she planned to speak to the leaders at YouTube “directly” about how the gunman had become inspired by videos on the site.In 2018, Tarrant was treated at Dunedin Hospital for injuries to his right eye and thigh after telling doctors he accidentally fired a gun while cleaning it at his apartment, the report says. He got government compensation for his injury, which wasn’t reported to the police. The hospital registrar said the accident appeared to be careless and “a little unusual” but otherwise didn’t set off alarm bells.Health authorities also wrote that Tarrant was taking illicit steroids and injecting testosterone after he was treated for abdominal pain, but they didn’t report that to the police either.As part of the process for getting a gun license, Tarrant was required to provide to police the names of two referees who could speak to his good character. He gave them the name of a friend he knew mostly online from gaming together, along with that friend’s father. Vetting officers interviewed Tarrant and the referees, and recommended he be given his license.Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said that in deciding whether Tarrant was “fit and proper” to hold a gun license, “we could have done more to consider whether the two referees knew the individual well enough to serve as referees.” The report also found that the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, the domestic spying agency, had chosen to concentrate scarce counter-terrorism resources on the threat of Islamist extremist terrorism inspired by groups like Islamic State at the expense of other threats.Despite the shortcomings of various agencies, the report concludes, there was no plausible way Tarrant’s plans could been detected “except by chance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsupervised-internet-access-racist-ideas-800-page-report-on-how-new-zealand-mosque-shooter-eluded-detection/story-XjWQbW3mOqLN491AOfsA6O.html
08-12-2020||World||Angela Merkel is losing her touch at the worst possible time||At a critical juncture for Germany and the European Union, Angela Merkel is faltering.In the final months of her 16-year tenure, the German chancellor is within touching distance of a historic budget settlement that would underpin the recovery from the pandemic, bind the European Union(EU) closer together and accelerate the shift to a carbon-neutral future. It’s threatening to slip through her fingers.For years, Merkel has allowed rule-of-law violations in Hungary and Poland to fester. Now they could derail the 1.8 trillion-euro ($2.2 trillion) budget and jointly funded recovery package that was supposed to be the centerpiece of Germany’s EU presidency. To make matters worse, the dispute with the UK over post-Brexit trade ties is overshadowing preparations for Thursday’s crucial EU summit and raising the risk of another economic shock.With negotiations hamstrung by restrictions on face-to-face meetings, Merkel’s European allies are talking about pressing ahead with the recovery fund without the two eastern holdouts. That would open a breach at the heart of the EU, fuel concerns that more member states could ultimately follow Britain’s exit, and interrupt the reintegration of former Communist states that has been a leitmotif throughout the chancellor’s political career.“We had imagined our presidency differently,” Merkel told European lawmakers last week. “The presidency is marked by the pandemic. That’s just the way it is, and you have to take things as they are.” Dissenters within her party say the chancellor should also shoulder some of the blame.Inside the concrete edifice of Berlin’s chancellery, Merkel has been switching between crisis meetings over the mounting number of Covid-19 cases in Germany and phone calls with EU leaders aimed at finding ways forward, according to an official, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations.Normally, her spokesman Steffen Seibert issues a statement after such conversations, but during the budget crisis, there’s been little communication -- a sign of just how sensitive the issue has become. Even when French President Emmanuel Macron mentioned he’d be speaking to the chancellor on Monday, Seibert refused to comment.In an effort to resolve the stalemate, Merkel is resorting to an old trick, said the official familiar with her thinking. She tries to get herself into the mindset of her opponent to understand their weaknesses and find an opening for a compromise.The threat of EU funds drying up is one obvious pressure point, but for Hungary’s Viktor Orban and his Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki, there’s more at stake, including national identity and a cultural agenda that collides with EU principles. That’s tough for the notoriously pragmatic German leader to crack.Making Merkel’s position more difficult is that she let Orban flout the rules for years without suffering any consequences, his party Fidesz even remained a member of the same European grouping as Merkel’s Christian Democrats. During the refugee crisis of 2015, which marked a watershed in Merkel’s relationship with German voters, Orban refused to take on Hungary’s allotment of migrants even when threatened with a cut in EU funding. And he ultimately suffered no repercussions.This time it’s not just the EU’s moral authority at stake, this fight is about its economic and political future. And the chancellor’s normally unflappable demeanor is starting to show the strain.Her frustration was evident when she addressed European parliamentarians last week on the results of the German presidency. She bemoaned her lack of progress and unusually complained about the demands put on her.“There are those who tell me: don’t make a compromise here and don’t change a single comma there. And then the same people tell me: but please come back with a result,” the 66-year-old chancellor said. “Without compromise from all sides, this won’t work.”Back home in Germany, some in her political movement are suggesting the chancellor carries some of the responsibility for her problems. In the Christian Social Union(CSU) -- the Bavarian sister party of Merkel’s Christian Democrats -- many officials say she misjudged support for the recovery fund and put Germany into an untenable position, just like she did with her open-door refugee policy.EU leaders should have known that the connection between the budget and democratic standards would provoke a hard confrontation, according to Alexander Dobrindt, leader of the CSU caucus in the Bundestag.Her most prominent critic is Ralph Brinkhaus, who leads the CSU and Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union(CDU) in Germany’s lower house. Brinkhaus spent political capital persuading conservatives in their party to support the EU’s controversial joint-debt plan only to see the agreement among leaders fall apart.When the recovery fund was agreed in July, Merkel was also winning plaudits for the low rate of infection during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. But the country has been hit much harder during the fall and Merkel’s partial lockdown policy has come in for heavy criticism while failing to bring the virus under control.That’s another point of friction for German conservatives -- already on edge as they struggle to chart a path for the post-Merkel era. The country’s soft shutdown is costing the federal government at least 15 billion euros a month to support affected bars, gyms and cinemas.At a meeting in November, state leaders rejected and openly criticized the chancellery’s push for harsher restrictions, including limiting kids to one playmate. By proposing measures that were too ambitious for the states to accept, Merkel wound up empty-handed, delaying a longer term strategy and leaving Germany most likely facing tighter curbs.Tension in the ranks over the disjointed strategy erupted at a closed-door meeting of CDU leadership last week. Volker Bouffier -- the state premier of Hesse, home of the Frankfurt financial center -- shouted down Brinkhaus over his criticism of the lack of state financing for pandemic support.“Let me make it clear we are no longer willing to watch your grandstanding,” he said, while Merkel sat quietly as the exchange unfolded, according to an official familiar with the meeting. A spokesman for Bouffier didn’t respond to a request for comment.Her pending departure from the political scene after elections in the fall is also playing into her fading authority. Markus Soeder, the Bavarian premier who’s the front-runner to succeed her, has grabbed the coronavirus spotlight. He pre-empted harsher national rules by implementing a state of emergency starting Wednesday, including a strict curfew in hard-hit areas.At a meeting with Merkel last week, which extended national curbs to Jan. 10, he slammed the current approach as too timid.“The question is whether we can keep the country in this kind of half-sleep all the time, or whether we will have to think again at some point to take a very clear and consistent deeper approach in some places,” he said.Merkel shot him an irritated look, but her own plans for tougher measures on a national level had been shot down by state premiers in November. They both knew she was powerless to change things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-is-losing-her-touch-at-the-worst-possible-time/story-NQu0Qk1lzkCxiLUzJBQoxL.html

08-12-2020||World||US again designates China, Pakistan as countries of concern over violation of religious freedom||The US has again designated Pakistan and China as “countries of particular concern” for systematic and egregious violations of religious freedom, a move that could lead to the imposition of certain sanctions against them. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced on Monday that the US had designated China, Eritrea, Iran, Nigeria, Myanmar, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan as “countries of particular concern under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998”. The action was taken as these countries were “engaging in or tolerating systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious freedom”, he said. China, Pakistan, Myanmar and Saudi Arabia have figured in the list of countries of particular concern in recent years, though the state department has granted waivers to these countries from any meaningful action related to the designation because of US security interests. In 2019 alone, the state department issued three such waivers for Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Tajikistan. Pompeo also said the US had placed the Comoros, Cuba, Nicaragua and Russia on a “special watch list” for governments that have engaged in or tolerated “severe violations of religious freedom”. The US also designated terror groups al-Shabaab, al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Islamic State and its affiliates in Greater Sahara and West Africa, Jamaat Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin and the Afghan Taliban as “entities of particular concern” under the Frank R Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2016. The US didn’t renew the “entity of particular concern” designations for al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Islamic State-Khorasan, which operates in Afghanistan, due to “total loss of territory formerly controlled by these terrorist organisations”, Pompeo said. “The US will continue to work tirelessly to end religiously motivated abuses and persecution around the world, and to help ensure that each person, everywhere, at all times, has the right to live according to the dictates of conscience,” he said. Also read | China sends warplanes, troops for drill in PakistanThe US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), an independent, bipartisan federal government entity, has recommended that Pakistan be designated a country of particular concern every year since 2002, and the state department finally made the designation for the first time in 2018, and again in 2019. USCIRF also recommended in its 2020 report that Pakistan be designated a country of particular concern for its systematic violations of religious freedom. Though Pakistan took some positive steps during 2019-20, including its Supreme Court upholding the acquittal of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for alleged blasphemy, and the government reopening Shawala Teja Singh temple in Punjab to Hindus and opening the Kartarpur Corridor with India for Sikh pilgrims, USCIRF said the country’s “particularly severe religious freedom violations persisted, largely due to the ongoing enforcement of blasphemy and anti-Ahmadiyya laws and the culture of impunity for violence against religious minorities”. USCIRF also said in its 2020 report that religious freedoms in China had continued to deteriorate. It said an estimated 900,000 to 1.8 million Uighur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz and other Muslims had been detained in more than 1,300 concentration camps in Xinjiang, and former detainees had reported suffering torture, rape, sterilisation and other abuses. The Chinese government also continued to pursue a strategy of “forced assimilation and suppression of Tibetan Buddhism”, as reflected by laws designed to control the next reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other eminent lamas. Some 6,000 monks and nuns were displaced when authorities demolished thousands of residences at Yachen Gar Tibetan Buddhist centre in Sichuan province in 2019, while authorities also raided or closed down hundreds of Protestant house churches and continued to harass and detain bishops who refused to join the state-affiliated Catholic association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-again-designates-china-pakistan-as-countries-of-concern-over-violation-of-religious-freedom/story-3JnDdz5jHnA0dY9IoYOBhK.html
08-12-2020||World||New Zealand’s Ardern apologises as report into mosque attack faults focus on Islamist terror risks||New Zealand security agencies were “almost exclusively” focused on the perceived threat of Islamist terrorism before a white supremacist gunman killed 51 Muslim worshippers last year, a report into the country’s worst massacre found. The Royal Commission of Inquiry also criticised police for failing to enforce proper checks when granting a firearms license to Australian gunman Brenton Tarrant, who released a racist manifesto shortly before the attack and streamed the shootings live on Facebook.But despite the shortcomings, the report found no failings within government agencies that would have prevented the attack at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, 2019.“The commission made no findings that these issues would have stopped the attack. But these were both failings and for that I apologise,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said after the report was released.Tarrant was sentenced to life in prison without parole in August for the attack, which left dozens injured.Ardern received global praise for her compassionate response to the attack and for swiftly banning the sale of the high-capacity semi-automatic weapons Tarrant used. She also launched a global movement against online extremism.However, authorities were criticised for ignoring repeated warnings from the Muslim community that hate crimes against them were escalating.The 800-page report said there was an “inappropriate concentration of resources” on the threat of Islamist extremist terrorism. Submissions to the commission by various Muslim organisations described how they felt they were targeted by security agencies while threats against them were not taken seriously.“We find it concerning that the Commissioners found systemic failures and an inappropriate concentration of resources towards Islamic terrorism, and yet state that these would not have made a difference to the terrorist being detected prior to the event,” the Islamic Women’s Council said in a statement.The report said there was no plausible way Tarrant’s plans could have been detected “except by chance.”Gamal Fouda, the Imam of Al Noor mosque targeted by the shooter, said the report showed “institutional prejudice and unconscious bias” exists in government agencies.The government accepted all 44 recommendations in the report, including establishing a new national intelligence and security agency, and appointing a minister to coordinate the government’s response.It said it would create an ethnic community ministry and a graduate programme for ethnic communities to support the country’s diverse population. The government would also tighten firearm licensing laws, strengthen counter-terrorism laws, and make changes so police can better record and respond to hate crime. The report found that despite having no history in New Zealand, Tarrant’s application for a firearms license was approved by the police.It recommended mandatory reporting of firearm injuries by health professionals, after it was revealed Tarrant was treated by doctors in the months leading up to the attack after accidentally shooting himself.The report described Tarrant as “socially isolated” with few childhood friends but an avid internet user and online gamer.Before arriving in New Zealand in August 2017, he travelled extensively, visiting dozens of countries between 2014 and 2017, mostly alone. “The individual could present well and conducted himself in a way that did not attract suspicion. He was not identified as someone who posed a threat,” said the report.Other than an email Tarrant sent eight minutes before he opened fire, there was no other information available that could have alerted authorities to the attack, it said.Tarrant trained for the attack in New Zealand by developing expertise with guns at a rifle club, working out at a gym and taking steroids to bulk up, the report said.He frequented extreme right-wing discussion boards such as those on 4chan and 8chan but YouTube was a far more significant source of information and inspiration.Ardern said she planned to raise this directly with the leadership of YouTube.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-s-ardern-apologises-as-report-into-mosque-attack-faults-focus-on-islamist-terror-risks/story-hpltighb3V6VS8XHlIXWNP.html

And coexistence,” it added.The Pope has long sought a trip to Iraq and told a meeting of Catholic aid agencies last year that he wanted to travel there in 2020, CNN citing Vatican News reported.“I think constantly of Iraq -- where I want to go next year -- in the hope that it can face the future through the peaceful and shared pursuit of the common good on the part of all elements of society, including the religious, and not fall back into hostilities sparked by the simmering conflicts of the regional powers,” Francis said during the June 2019 meeting.On Monday, Iraqi President Barham Salih called the planned visit “a message of peace to Iraqis of all religions.”“The journey of Pope Francis to Mesopotamia - the cradle of civilization, the birthplace of Abraham, father of the faithful - will be a message of peace to Iraqis of all religions & serve to affirm our common values of justice & dignity,” Salih said in a tweet.CNN reported that Around 1 per cent of Iraq’s population is Christian from a “number of denominations”. The country has seen an exodus of Christians in recent years as Iraq was wracked by cycles of violence, including the rise of ISIS. Terrorist groups have repeatedly targeted churches since the 2003 US invasion which triggered civil unrest.Prior to the pandemic, Pope Francis visited several Muslim-majority countries, including the United Arab Emirates. His trip to the UAE in February 2019 marked the first-ever visit by a pontiff to the Arabian peninsula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-to-visit-iraq-in-march-2021/story-5TUxUUl1HDGFGiYs3UI9jJ.html

That department’s chief medical officer, Dr Supriya Sharma, has said it may be possible this very week. “The regulatory process needs to be as rigorous as it always is. There are no corners cut by Health Canada in terms of approving a vaccine for safe use by Canadians,” Trudeau said.“This is the largest mobilisation of vaccines in Canada’s history,” Trudeau said during a news conference, adding that it was a “good thing” that the country will start with a small sample and then “rapidly scale up as the flow of vaccine doses starts increasing.”His government is already facing a motion in the House of Commons related to the tardy nature of the vaccine roll-outplan for Canada.According to a recent survey from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute, the government has lost 10% of its approval ratings over its handling of the vaccine issue, going down to 56%.The Pfizer vaccine has to be delivered in two doses and brings with it logistical challenges, having to be stored at temperatures ranging between -80 degree Celsius and -60 degree C.While 14 distribution centres for the vaccine have been identified for the vaccine, it will not reach the country’s backward Arctic regions, with its indigenous populations, due to the storage and delivery challenges.About four million more doses are expected to arrive in Canada within the first quarter of next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-may-roll-out-covid-vaccines-next-week/story-DN5zR6qB1G7dlZnHjMo1WJ.html
08-12-2020||World||Does Trump have power to pardon himself? Legal experts divided||President Donald Trump has declared that he has “absolute power” to issue a pardon to himself. Yet the law is much murkier than his confidence suggests.No president has attempted to pardon himself while in office, so if Trump tries to do so in the next six weeks, he will be venturing into legally untested territory without clear guidance from the Constitution or from judges.Legal experts are divided on an inherently ambiguous question that was left vague by the Founding Fathers and has never had to be definitively resolved in court.“It’s impossible to anticipate every factual scenario that could come up under a legal provision. This is why we have the courts,” said University of Baltimore law professor Kimberly Wehle.Talk of a potential pardon comes with Trump facing a swirl of investigations as he prepares to leave office, including New York State inquiries into whether he misled tax authorities, banks or business partners.In favor of a self-pardon is the broad power the Constitution affords a president when it comes to absolving federal crimes — both charged and not-yet charged — and the absence of any law or language that explicitly prohibits such an act.But some scholars say a self-pardon collides with other provisions of the Constitution or even fundamental principles of law. The Constitution’s text — affording the president “power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment” — can be read to suggest that the Founding Fathers envisioned some sort of limitations on a president’s pardon power. It could also mean the power is to be used on someone else, not yourself.“You could say, implicit in the definition of a pardon or implicit in the notion of granting a pardon — because the Constitution uses the word ‘grant’ — is that it’s two separate people,” said Brian Kalt, a constitutional law professor at Michigan State University. “You can’t grant something to yourself. You can’t pardon yourself.”It would also seem to run afoul of the fundamental principle that no one — in this case, a president issuing himself a pardon — may serve as a judge in his own case.That was the reasoning cited in a 1974 opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, dated days before President Richard Nixon’s resignation, that said “it would seem” a president could not pardon himself.But that same opinion does suggest a potential workaround, envisioning as legally acceptable a scenario in which a president declares himself temporarily unfit for office under the Constitution’s 25th Amendment and transfers power to the vice president, who could then issue a pardon. The president could then either resign or resume his duties, the opinion said.The question of whether Trump will do it, though, is as unsettled as the question of whether he can.A self-pardon, which Trump has openly mused about, would on one hand be fitting as a final norm-shattering act in a presidency defined by them. But it might also be at odds with his oft-stated conviction that he has done nothing wrong for which he needs to be absolved.Regardless, the question has occupied Trump’s attention for years.In June 2018, 13 months into special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, Trump tweeted, “As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?”Mueller’s report laid out facts that federal prosecutors could potentially use as the basis for an obstruction of justice prosecution, though the odds of that are unclear.If prosecutors were to bring a case against Trump in spite of any pardon he grants himself, the issue could wind up in court and before a judge for the first time.Mark Tushnet, a retired Harvard Law School professor, said he doubted any court could overturn a presidential self-pardon, though he said such an act would constitute an abuse of power that would have been abhorrent to the framers of the Constitution.“For them, I believe it would have been unthinkable that the American people would ever elect the kind of person who would pardon himself. Which is why they didn’t say anything about the possibility,” Tushnet said.Since presidential pardons don’t cover state crimes, it would seem unlikely a self-pardon would extend in any event to the state investigations Trump is facing. But, Tushnet said, Trump’s lawyers could conceivably try to invoke double-jeopardy arguments to claim that a federal pardon should bar any New York state prosecution based on the same conduct.On the federal level, a self-pardon obviously handcuffs the Justice Department under President-elect Joe Biden from pursuing any federal case against Trump. But it would also spare Biden from having to face questions about a prosecution that risks distracting from his agenda and keeping Trump in the spotlight.Ethan Leib, a law professor at Fordham University, said it is a well-established norm that presidents behave in the public interest rather than for personal gain. In this case, he said, it was possible Trump could argue that pardoning himself is motivated by the public interest and a desire to the extent it could pre-empt a divisive prosecution that could upend democracy and “trigger civil war,” Leib said.But, he noted, “The irony is this particular president does not seem particularly public spirited and public-interest minded.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/does-trump-have-power-to-pardon-himself-legal-experts-divided/story-3P9lwN3z0uHIDW5rM0OCPM.html
08-12-2020||World||Hong Kong arrests eight more activists as crackdown on opposition shows no sign of let-up||Hong Kong police arrested eight more activists on Tuesday over an anti-government protest in July, the latest move by authorities in a relentless crackdown on opposition forces in the Chinese-ruled city. The police did not identify the people, saying only that they were aged between 24 and 64. Local media said former pro-democracy lawmaker and veteran activist Leung Kwok-hung, known as Long Hair, was among those arrested. The move comes a day after eight people aged between 16 and 34 were arrested, including three on suspicion of violating a sweeping national security law, over a brief demonstration at a university campus last month.Hong Kong police fired water cannon and tear gas to disperse protesters on July 1, the anniversary of the former British colony’s handover to Chinese rule, as thousands demonstrated despite a police ban on the annual protest. More than 300 were arrested in the rally that came after Beijing imposed security legislation on its freest city, saying it was vital to plug gaping holes in national security defences exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government protests that rocked the city over the last year.The law punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail. Opposition politicians and Western governments fear the law is being used to suppress dissent and erode wide-ranging freedoms guaranteed to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. On Monday, the United States announced further sanctions to punish Beijing for imposing the law on Hong Kong, escalating tensions between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-arrests-eight-more-activists-as-crackdown-on-opposition-shows-no-sign-of-let-up/story-TMaHH0EKd4mAKmtQOrMNtL.html
08-12-2020||World||Tech startups raise record $41 billion in Europe this year||European tech companies defied the pandemic this year to draw record levels of investment overall, though early-stage founders still struggled to clinch funding.Europe’s tech sector is on track for about $41 billion in venture capital investment this year, up around $500 million from 2019, according to VC firm Atomico’s annual State of European Tech Report published Tuesday. The slight increase was driven by greater numbers of $100 million to $250 million funding rounds, it said.Overall investment dropped around March, as large swathes of Europe went into lockdown, but began recovering by the end of summer and continued into the fall. September saw the highest-ever month of investment into European tech with more than $5 billion invested, Atomico said.“It’s not going to increase by much, but for a long period of time this year it was looking like we’d see a reduction,” said Tom Wehmeier, partner at Atomico, and co-author of the report. “Even creeping above last year’s figure represents quite an achievement for the ecosystem.”Still, entrepreneurs looking to raise rounds of about $20 million to $50 million struggled to do so this year in many sectors as the pandemic made it harder to demonstrate growth potential.“When it looks like your year may come in flat or it may even decrease, that is a much harder story to tell investors,” Wehmeier said.The US still vastly outpaces Europe when it comes to tech investments, attracting about five times as much capital in 2020, Atomico said. Foreign investors from the US and Asia saw continued appetite to invest in Europe this year, however. A record 19% of funding rounds in Europe during 2020 included participation from at least one U.S. investor, up from 16% in 2019, according to the report.Atomico also highlighted ongoing challenges with diversity in Europe’s tech industry. Its report concluded that little data about ethnicity exists at the European level, and what does emerge is “grim.” Between 2009 and 2019, only 0.24% of capital in the UK went to black founders, according to the report.Meanwhile, progress on gender has stagnated, Atomico said, with 90.8% of all capital going to men-only teams this year, compared to 90.3% last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tech-startups-raise-record-41-billion-in-europe-this-year/story-PW0PQ7FROh0dHY1TbFHvML.html

But Twitteratis trolled him for feeling “inferior to former PM Nawaz Sharif”.According to a report by The News International, on Monday evening, users of Pakistani Twitter space noticed that PM Imran Khan was no longer following anyone on Twitter from his official @ImranKhanPTI account.Meanwhile, the Twitteratis have noticed that he unfollowed Jemima Goldsmith, a film producer and his former wife.Imran Khan, who had created his Twitter profile in 2010, had continued to follow his first wife Jemima Goldsmith even after parting ways with her and getting married twice.While not many comments have been made on Khan unfollowing everyone, people seem to have not like him unfollowing his first wife.“Bro @ImranKhanPTI unfollowed @Jemima_Khan?!?!” said one of the Twitter users.“Imran Khan visited Nawaz Sharif’s @NawazSharifMNS Twitter timeline, realised NS does not follow anybody. Got angry that this might reflect poorly on him. Went back to his own timeline and unfollowed all his MNAs and ex-wife,” another user said.Another user said, “Even though @ImranKhanPTI unfollowed everyone but I am sure something inside Jemima just broke.”“Baqi sub to theik hai khan sahib ne jemima ko b unfollow kr dyia (Unfollowing is still ok but Imran Khan unfollowed even Jemima?),” said one of the Twitteratis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-unfollows-everyone-on-twitter-gets-trolled/story-zW5autdabirR9dNloS4pRK.html
08-12-2020||World||Biden to name former general Lloyd Austin III as US defence secretary||President-elect Joe Biden is expected to name retired Gen Lloyd Austin III as US secretary of defence. He will become the first Black person to hold the top Pentagon job if confirmed.Austin, a four-star general, is the only African American to head the vaunted US Central Command with responsibility for American military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen. He oversaw the US troop surge in Iraq in 2006 and the withdrawal in 2011.Austin retired in 2016 and his nomination, and confirmation by US Senate, will require a congressional waiver of a law that mandates a cooling off period of seven years for US military personnel to head the Pentagon. It would be a second time for this to be done in recent years. James Mattis, who was outgoing President Donald Trump’s first secretary of defence, needed a waiver as well in 2017; he had retired in 2013. His last assignment was head of the Central Command. He was succeeded by Austin.Austin’s nomination is expected to be announced on Tuesday, according to Politico, which first reported the selection.India will be watching Austin’s nomination and confirmation closely. Growing defence ties — both operationally through military exercises, agreements and exchange of sensitive information and technologies; and commercially through deals — account for a large portion of the bilateral relationship.The 2+2 India-US ministerial dialogue between the defence and foreign ministers of the two countries, the third edition of which was held in New Delhi this October, has emerged as the key driver of the relationship, between summit-level meetings.Antony Blinken is Biden’s nominee for the second leg of the 2+2 as secretary of state. He has been an outspoken supporter of stronger ties with India as a foreign policy spokesperson for Biden and has promised India will be a part of the incoming administration’s uncompromising stance towards China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-name-former-general-lloyd-austin-iii-as-us-defence-secretary/story-BuQSL8xIflXTZShU8LqwKI.html
08-12-2020||World||Thai demonstrators plan protest against Royal defamation law||Thailand’s pro-democracy groups will hold a gathering this week to press for the abolition of a law that penalizes insulting and criticizing the nation’s top royals, after authorities invoked the act against protest leaders who are demanding monarchy reform.The protesters, who have been rallying regularly in capital Bangkok and other cities since mid-July, will hold “an important event” on Dec. 10, the United Front of Thammasat and Demonstration said on Twitter. The day also marks Thailand’s Constitution Day and International Human Rights Day.More than a dozen protest leaders are facing lese majeste charges, which entail prison terms of as many as 15 years, as authorities seek to curb the growing taboo-breaking movement that calls for the monarchy power to be reined in. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha, who’s rejected calls to quit, last month said the government “will now enforce all laws available to deal with protesters who break the law and ignore other people’s rights and freedom.”“We’re heading toward more conflict,” Arnon Nampa, a human rights lawyer and one of the protest leaders who have been charged with lese majeste, said in a Facebook post. “The Thai establishment has used lese majeste law as its weapons.”A call to government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri went unanswered on Tuesday, and the Bureau of the Royal Household declined to comment.The protest movement is calling for the constitution to be rewritten to make it more democratic. They’re also seeking the resignation of Prayuth, a former army chief who took power in 2014 and returned as premier after elections last year under rules written during his military government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-demonstrators-plan-protest-against-royal-defamation-law/story-NNyYmsMiJAW5XMPeInnDUO.html
08-12-2020||World||Australia to reveal laws to make Google and Facebook pay for news||Australia’s government will reveal legislation in Parliament on Wednesday that would make Facebook and Google pay for journalism.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Tuesday that the legislation to create the News Media Bargaining Code will be scrutinized by a parliamentary committee following its introduction and before lawmakers vote on it next year.“This is a huge reform,” Frydenberg told reporters. “This is a world first. And the world is watching what happens here in Australia.”“This is comprehensive legislation that has gone further than any comparable jurisdiction in the world,” he added.The legislation differs from draft proposals that were released in July after consultations with the social media platforms as well as Australian media organizations.The government had initially planned to exclude state-owned media — Australian Broadcasting Corp. and the Special Broadcasting Service — from being compensated by the tech giants for their journalism.Frydenberg said those broadcasters would be paid under the latest draft legislation like commercial media businesses.Facebook has warned it might block Australian news content rather than pay for it.Google has said the proposed laws would result in “dramatically worse Google Search and YouTube,” put free services at risk and could lead to users’ data “being handed over to big news businesses.”Frydenberg said Google was taking 53% of online advertising dollars and Facebook took a 23% share.Michael Miller, executive chairman of News Corp Australia, one of the nation’s largest media organizations, described the draft legislation as a “significant step forward in the decade-long campaign to achieve fairness in the relationship between Australian news media companies and the global tech giants.”“All we have ever sought is a fair commercial outcome and fair payment for the valuable news content our journalists create,” Miller said in a statement. “I believe this code puts in place the framework for this to be achieved.”Neither Facebook nor Google immediately responded to a request for comment on Tuesday.The conservative government might need the support of the center-left opposition Labor Party to get the legislation through the Senate, where no party or coalition holds a majority of seats.Senior Labor lawmaker Jim Chalmers said his party gave in-principle support for “efforts to ensure that the playing field is levelled between the tech platforms and the news media organizations.”But Chalmers said the government had yet to brief Labor on the legislation’s details.The legislation would create an arbitrator to address the bargaining imbalance between the tech giants and news businesses. If a platform and a news outlet can’t reach an agreement on price, an arbitrator would be appointed to make a binding decision.Spain and France and have both failed to make Facebook and Google pay for news through copyright law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-reveal-laws-to-make-google-and-facebook-pay-for-news/story-dDfzKgXGIocoieZUuZyaxJ.html
08-12-2020||World||Georgia recertifies election results showing Joe Biden won||Georgia’s top elections official on Monday recertified the state’s election results after a recount requested by President Donald Trump confirmed once again that Democrat Joe Biden won the state, and the governor then recertified the state’s 16 presidential electors.“We have now counted legally cast ballots three times, and the results remain unchanged,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said during a news conference at the state Capitol before the results were recertified.Georgia law allows a losing candidate to request a recount if the margin between the candidates is within 0.5%. Trump requested the recount after the results certified by Raffensperger showed that Biden led by a margin of 12,670 votes, or 0.25% of the roughly 5 million ballots cast.During the recount, which was done using scanners that read and tally the votes, there were discrepancies in vote totals in some counties. Since the results of a recount become the official results, those counties had to recertify their results. Once that was done the secretary of state recertified the statewide results, his office said in a news release.Kemp then recertified the state’s slate of 16 presidential electors — all prominent Democrats — as required by state law, spokesman Cody Hall said. The recertification of results comes before the federal “safe harbor” deadline on Tuesday — electors named by that date in accordance with state law cannot be disregarded by Congress.The recount was the third tally of votes in the presidential race in the state. After the initial count following Election Day, Raffensperger selected the presidential race for an audit required by state law. The tight margin meant the audit required the roughly 5 million votes in that contest to be recounted by hand, he said. That count also affirmed Biden’s victory.The total number of votes in the recount results certified Monday and posted on the secretary of state’s website was 766 fewer than the number certified when the ballots were first tallied after the election. Biden’s lead dropped from 12,670 to 11,779. That appears to be largely due to a discrepancy in Fulton County, the state’s most populous county that includes most of Atlanta.Fulton County’s recount results showed 880 fewer votes than the results certified after election night, with an overwhelming majority of those votes coming from Biden’s total in the county. Gabriel Sterling, who oversaw the implementation of the state’s new voting system, called the discrepancy in the county “a little worrisome” but said it’s a big county that’s had managerial issues. He also noted the difference isn’t enough to change the overall outcome of the election.Also Monday, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed on behalf of would-be Republican presidential electors by former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell. The suit alleged widespread fraud and sought to decertify the results of the presidential race in Georgia, among other things.In the lawsuit, “the plaintiffs essentially ask the court for perhaps the most extraordinary relief ever sought in any federal court in connection with an election. They want this court to substitute its judgment for that of 2 and a half million Georgia voters who voted for Joe Biden and this I am unwilling to do,” U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten as he dismissed the suit following a hearing.Separately, an election challenge filed Friday by Trump, his campaign and Georgia Republican Party Chairman David Shafer was rejected by the Fulton County Superior Court because the paperwork was improperly completed and it lacked the appropriate filing fees.Even as lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies have been rejected around the country, the president has continued to make repeated baseless claims of widespread fraud. In Georgia, he has rained criticism on Raffensperger and Kemp, both fellow Republicans. Raffensperger, meanwhile, has been steadfast in his defense of the integrity of the election in the state and Kemp has said he has no power to intervene in elections.“I know there are people that are convinced the election was fraught with problems, but the evidence, the actual evidence, the facts tell us a different story,” Raffensperger said during the news conference Monday.Hours before coming to Georgia for a rally Saturday night, Trump called Kemp and asked him to call a special legislative session. The governor declined.In a tweet Sunday, Trump criticized Kemp and Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan for inaction and again called for a special session.After four Republican state lawmakers on Sunday also requested a special session, Kemp and Duncan put out a statement saying that convening a special session to select a different slate of presidential electors would not be allowed under state or federal law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-recertifies-election-results-showing-joe-biden-won/story-LDcGWB8McDmaEg1q6wudmM.html

08-12-2020||World||87-year-old Indian-origin man first to get Covid-19 vaccine in UK||An 87-year-old Indian-origin man from the north east of England will become one of the first people in the world to get a vaccine against Covid-19 when he receives his Pfizer/BioNTech jab at a hospital in Newcastle on Tuesday. Hari Shukla from Tyne and Wear said he feels it is his duty to receive his first of the two-dose vaccine, a moment UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed as a “huge step forward” as Tuesday was dubbed “V-Day” or Vaccine Day in the UK.“I’m so pleased we are hopefully coming towards the end of this pandemic and I am delighted to be doing my bit by having the vaccine, I feel it is my duty to do so and do whatever I can to help,” said Shukla.“Having been in contact with the NHS (National Health Service), I know how hard they all work and the greatest respect for them – they have a heart of gold and I am grateful for everything they have done to keep us safe during the pandemic,” he said.Shukla was notified by the NHS based on the criteria set by the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation as part of a phased rollout plan based on those at the highest risk of death from the deadly virus. People aged 80 and over, care home workers as well as NHS workers who are at higher risk will be first in line to receive the “life-saving jab”.“Today marks a huge step forward in the UK’s fight against coronavirus, as we begin delivering the vaccine to the first patients across the whole country. I am immensely proud of the scientists who developed the vaccine, members of the public who took part in trials, and the NHS who have worked tirelessly to prepare for rollout,” said Johnson.However, the UK PM struck a note of caution to warn that mass vaccination will take time and urged the public to remain “clear-eyed” and continue to follow the lockdown rules over the winter months ahead.The NHS said it is undertaking the biggest and most highly anticipated immunisation campaign in history at 50 hospital hubs, with more starting vaccinations over the coming weeks and months as the programme ramps up after the first set of doses arrived from Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Belgium.“We will look back on today, V-day, as a key moment in our fight back against this terrible disease, and I am proud our health services across the United Kingdom are about to embark on our largest ever vaccination programme,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.“With over-80s and frontline health and care staff receiving their vaccinations from today, the whole country will breathe a collective sigh of relief as our most vulnerable loved ones start to be given protection from the virus. Now’s the time to sit tight and remain patient until you get notified by the NHS that it’s time for your vaccination,” he said, adding that the light at the end of the tunnel is visible but there is still a long way to go.Since the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine got the green light from the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) last week, the NHS said its workers have been working around the clock to manage the large-scale logistical challenge of deploying the vaccine. “Coronavirus is the greatest health challenge in NHS history, taking loved ones from us and disrupting every part of our lives,” said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS Chief Executive.“The deployment of this vaccine marks a decisive turning point in the battle with the pandemic. NHS vaccination programmes which have successfully helped overcome tuberculosis, polio, and smallpox, now turn their focus to coronavirus. NHS staff are proud to be leading the way as the first health service in the world to begin vaccination with this Covid jab,” he said.The Pfizer/BionTech formula is an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. It is delivered in two doses of 21 days apart and, according to experts, it has shown a strong immunity response kicking in after seven days of the second dose. The MHRA has stressed it has been cleared for mass rollout only after “rigorous” safety tests despite the process being speeded up due to the urgency of finding an effective vaccine against a pandemic which has wreaked havoc around the world.NHS national medical director, Professor Stephen Powis, has warned that the roll out of a vaccine will be a “marathon” not a sprint.The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at -70C before being thawed out and can only be moved four times within that cold chain before being used. General Practitioners (GPs) and other primary care staff have also been put on standby to start delivering the jab on a phased basis.Vaccination centres treating large numbers of patients in sporting venues and conference centres will subsequently start up when further supplies of vaccine come on stream, with a bulk of the rollout expected in the early part of the New Year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/87-year-old-indian-origin-man-first-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-in-uk/story-zYeQ6G9CqZMtJFR0defQpM.html

Last week, the UK health authorities had granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) to the vaccine candidate.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn India, Hyderabad’s Bharat Biotech International Limited on Monday became the third firm to seek approval for its vaccine candidate, Covaxin, for emergency cases. Last week, both Pfizer and Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) had applied to be granted EUA in India. Bharat Biotech has thus become the second Indian firm, after SII, to seek approval for use in emergency cases in India.Here are the latest developments on the Covid-19 vaccine front:1. The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) has said people over the age of 80 will be given first preference in what the agency has described as the “biggest immunisation campaign” in its history. Vaccinations will begin early Tuesday morning in what prime minister Boris Johnson says is a “huge step forward” in the fight against the coronavirus, of which the country has more than 1.7 million cases with more than 61,000 people succumbing to the infection.2. Bharat Biotech, whose Covaxin is in the third stage of trials in India, has applied to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) seeking approval for its candidate to be used in emergency cases. Covaxin, which has been developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), will be India’s first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine if approved. It is also the first vaccine candidate to have reached Phase 3 trials in India.3. South Korea’s government has said it has signed deals with four firms to vaccinate a total of 44 million people. While 20 million doses each will be delivered by AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, four million more doses will be delivered by Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen. Additional 10 million doses will be procured through the World Health Organization’s global vaccine project, COVAX.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-uk-to-begin-pfizer-vaccinations-bharat-biotech-seeks-nod-for-emergency-use-in-india/story-BacpRGu4v8KyFps3JCqGcJ.html
08-12-2020||World||Joe Biden chooses retired general Lloyd Austin as defense secretary: Reports||President-elect Joe Biden has chosen retired General Lloyd Austin, who oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East under President Barack Obama, to be his defense secretary, two people familiar with the decision said on Monday. Austin, who would be the first Black U.S. secretary of defense, was a surprise pick over Michele Flournoy, a former top Defense Department official who was considered the leading contender for the job. Flournoy would have been the first woman defense secretary.The news was first reported by Politico.Austin, who retired in 2016, will need a waiver from Congress since it has been less than the required seven years since he served. He would be the second Pentagon chief in four years to need a waiver, after President Donald Trump picked James Mattis, a retired Marine general, to be his first defense secretary.The nomination of Austin, who headed U.S. Central Command under Obama, could draw fire from some progressive groups given his role in retirement on the board of a number of companies, including weapons maker Raytheon Technologies Corp.But Biden and Austin developed a working relationship during the Obama administration and the retired general has been advising the transition team on national security issues, one of the people familiar with the decision to name him said.Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, on Monday also announced key members of his health team to lead the administration’s response to the raging coronavirus pandemic.Biden chose California Attorney General Xavier Becerra for secretary of health and human services and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, to run the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was named as Biden’s chief medical adviser on the virus.Biden’s first major challenge in the White House will be containing a resurgent COVID-19 virus that has killed more than 283,000 Americans, and finding ways to jump-start an economy still reeling from millions of pandemic-fueled job losses.He installed Jeff Zients, an economic adviser https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2II2BN known for his managerial skills, as coronavirus “czar” to oversee a response that will include an unprecedented operation to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of a new vaccine, coordinating efforts across multiple federal agencies.“This team of world-class medical experts and public servants will be ready on Day One to mobilize every resource of the federal government to expand testing and masking,” Biden said in a statement, adding they would “oversee the safe, equitable, and free distribution of treatments and vaccines.”DIVERSITY PUSHBiden’s choice of Becerra, 62, a Latino former congressman, adds a politician to a health effort that otherwise largely relies on government administrators and health experts.The choice also comes as Biden faces pressure to ensure diversity in his Cabinet appointments, including complaints from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about the number of Latinos and from civil rights groups about the lack of Black nominees.Biden’s decision to nominate the first Black defense secretary in Austin helps him make good on his diversity promise. It also will resonate among proponents for greater diversity in the leadership of the U.S. armed forces, which is regularly criticized for failing to promote Black servicemembers and whose top tier has been largely white.Austin has not cultivated a public persona and is not seen as someone who enjoys the media spotlight. However, he is known to be a shrewd military strategist with deep knowledge of the U.S. armed forces.Earlier on Monday, the Democrat who leads the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Adam Smith, had openly shown his preference for Flournoy. “I think Michelle Flournoy is hands-down the best-qualified person to do the job,” Smith said.But David Segal, executive director of the progressive group Demand Progress, said Austin was a better choice given his role presiding over drawdowns of forces from Iraq and Afghanistan.And while he had some concerning ties to major companies like Raytheon, they were not as broad in scope as those of Flournoy. “He doesn’t seem to have a web of entanglements that are as opaque and dense as hers,” Segal told Reuters.Biden, a Democrat, has pressed ahead with the transition to the White House even as Trump, a Republican, refuses to concede the Nov. 3 election and wages a foundering effort to overturn the results with unsubstantiated claims of fraud.Dozens of Trump’s legal challenges have been rejected by the courts, the latest on Monday when judges in Detroit and Atlanta tossed bids to decertify Biden’s election victories in Michigan and Georgia. Biden won Michigan by about 154,000 votes and Georgia by about 12,000 votes.In Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Monday certified the state’s results, a statement said, after a third count confirmed Biden’s win. The Electoral College will formalize results nationwide on Dec. 14.Raffensperger, a Republican, said continued debunked claims about voting fraud were “hurting our state.” Runoff elections for Georgia’s two U.S. Senate seats, scheduled for Jan. 5, will determine which party controls the chamber.

We plan to achieve this target by 2025, five years ahead of the deadline. To reach its goal, India has started implementing the National Strategic Plan and has substantially increased fund allocation for TB control,” he added.Mathur further claimed that the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic had highlighted the systemic weaknesses in health systems and vulnerabilities incapacity to prevent and respond to its threats.“We need to address the major weaknesses and gaps to strengthen global coordination to ensure that the world is better prepared to curb impacts of the future health-related crisis,” he said.He asserted the need to capitalise on existing programs such as Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACTA), and COVAX facility to ensure affordable and equitable global access to diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, while strengthening health systems.“We are committed to partner with member states and other stakeholders to synergise our efforts to accelerate progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage with the most productive, efficient and effective utilisation of resources,” Mathur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-needs-to-come-up-with-long-term-strategies-to-tackle-future-pandemics-india-at-unga/story-Vx2OAAzsi6dv0Pw4GQ63cI.html
08-12-2020||World||Brazil in advanced talks with Pfizer to buy 70 million Covid-19 vaccine doses||Brazil’s government is in advanced talks with Pfizer Inc to buy 70 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine and a Memorandum of Intent should be signed this week, the Health Ministry said on Monday.The ministry said in a statement that the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, whose final trial results showed it had a 95% success rate and no serious side effects, will be delivered next year.Earlier on Monday, President Jair Bolsonaro said that the government will offer Covid-19 vaccines to all Brazilians free of charge, once health regulator Anvisa gives it scientific and legal approval.In a post on his Twitter account, Bolsonaro said the economy ministry has assured him that there will be no shortage of resources to administer a vaccine to everyone who wants one.“Once certified by @anvisa_oficial (scientific guidelines and legal precepts), @govbr will offer the vaccine to all, free of charge and not mandatory,” Bolsonaro tweeted.Bolsonaro’s tweet came shortly before the president of Sao Paulo’s Butantan Institute biomedical center, Dimas Covas, said all necessary data for the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd has been or will soon be sent to health regulator Anvisa.He expects Anvisa to approve it, regardless of the political storm between Bolsonaro and Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria over competing vaccines.“I want to think that no political problem is bigger than people’s lives,” Covas said in an interview with GloboNews.Doria said earlier on Monday that the country’s most populous state plans to start vaccinating its population against Covid-19 on Jan. 25, The federal government expects to roll out its own immunization plan at least a month later.Doria’s ambitious timeline comes even though the Sinovac vaccine has yet to be approved by Anvisa.Doria has frequently clashed over the vaccine with Bolsonaro, an aggressive China critic who has baselessly dismissed the Sinovac candidate as lacking credibility.A successful early rollout would mark a significant political victory for Doria, a center-right politician who is expected to run against Bolsonaro in the 2022 presidential elections.Brazil has the world’s third highest coronavirus case count at more than 6.6 million, and the second heaviest death toll of more than 177,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-in-advanced-talks-with-pfizer-to-buy-70-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses/story-hJlLX3weD0lJlM7x3OqrMN.html

A senior FDA official, Dr. Peter Marks, is scheduled to address the Tuesday event.Invitees at the meeting include drug distributors, pharmacies and logistics companies such as McKesson Corp, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, CVS Health Corp, United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp.The New York Times reported that Pfizer may not be able to provide more of its vaccine to the United States until next June because of its commitments to other countries.An administration official noted that Pfizer’s vaccine was still in clinical trials last summer and that the government secured advanced deals to acquire multiple other vaccine candidates.“Anyone who wanted to sell us, guaranteed without an EUA (FDA emergency authorization) approval, hundreds of millions of doses back in July and August was just not going to get the government’s money,” the person added.About 85 percent of long-term care and assisted living facilities around the country had signed up for a mobile vaccination service provided by CVS and Walgreens, the official said. The U.S. government was concerned about cyber attacks related to the vaccine and had protected itself against them, he added.Pfizer spokeswoman Sharon Castillo said: “The U.S. government placed an initial order of 100 million doses for Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine, and Pfizer is ready to begin shipping initial doses soon after receiving an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. Any additional doses beyond the 100 million are subject to a separate and mutually acceptable agreement.”Representatives from Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team were not invited to the summit. Trump, a Republican who lost the Nov. 3 election to Biden, has refused to concede.Trump and other officials will speak at the Tuesday event, which will focus on informing the public about how distribution of the vaccine will work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-order-priority-access-to-us-covid-19-vaccines-for-americans/story-boyJBAtLGpPIJwXXJSCvSO.html
08-12-2020||World||Pfizer, Astra shots to be combined in UK Covid vaccine trials||Even as it begins the first Covid immunizations with a shot from Pfizer Inc., the U.K. plans to test it in combination with another vaccine from AstraZeneca Plc.Studies aimed at determining whether using the two jabs together can enhance immunity are planned for next year, according to the U.K. Vaccine Taskforce. The group disclosed the plans as it published a report on its work so far, including deals for 357 million doses from seven makers and investments in three sites to expand the nation’s manufacturing capacity.The UK is set to begin administering doses from Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE on Tuesday, making it the first Western country to receive a vaccine. The massive logistical challenge of inoculating as many as 67 million people is getting underway at about 50 hospitals.Approval for the shot from Astra and its partner, the University of Oxford, could come by the end of the year. That would set the stage for the combination trials, which will involve initial shots from either of the two vaccines, followed by a booster jab with the other.“These will be relatively small studies,” Clive Dix, taskforce deputy chair, said at a press briefing. “They’ll only be with the approved vaccines.”Dix will take over as taskforce chair on an interim basis when Kate Bingham steps down this month.Brexit PlansThe panel said plans are in place to protect the U.K. from any vaccine fallout if there’s a no-deal Brexit. Some of the initial U.K. doses of the Astra-Oxford vaccine are set to be imported, although more than 80 million of the 100 million-dose order will be produced onshore, according to Ian McCubbin, manufacturing lead for the taskforce.“The vast, vast, vast majority of what will be produced by AstraZeneca for the U.K. will be in the U.K.,” said McCubbin at the briefing. “It’s just that the initial supply, and it’s a little bit a quirk of the program, actually comes from the Netherlands and Germany.”The taskforce is also looking to build a bulk antibody manufacturing site in Britain. More than half a million people in the U.K. are heavily immunosuppressed and potentially unable to have a vaccine, according to the report. An antibody cocktail, like the one being developed by Astra that the taskforce has purchased up to one million doses of, could be used to protect those individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-astra-shots-to-be-combined-in-uk-covid-vaccine-trials/story-3vPYJXofHiE6sIa6VEGJVN.html
08-12-2020||World||US AstraZeneca vaccine trial will clear confusion on how well it works: Scientist||A top US scientist overseeing Covid-19 vaccine trials expects a large U.S. study to determine how effective AstraZeneca’s experimental inoculation is, following perplexing results from other trials released by the company and partner Oxford University.AstraZeneca Plc is one of the leading vaccine developers, but interim data released Nov. 23 from trials in Britain and Brazil showed a vastly divergent performance when the vaccine was tested in two different dose combinations.According to the company, a small group of trial subjects inadvertently received a half dose followed by a full dose, instead of the planned two full doses. In that group, the vaccine proved to be 90% effective at preventing illness. But the larger group that received two full doses showed a 62% success rate.Although 62% efficacy is above the benchmark set by regulators to declare a Covid-19 vaccine a success, it pales when compared with efficacy of 95% and 94.1% demonstrated in large trials for vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, respectively. A U.S. study of AstraZeneca’s vaccine involving about 30,000 volunteers is in the works and should produce data by late January.“We feel very comfortable that we designed a really good trial in the United States, where everybody’s getting boosted in a uniform time, and we know what the dose is,” said Dr. Larry Corey, co-leader of the U.S. Coronavirus Vaccine Prevention Network, who helped design and is overseeing trials for the U.S. government Operation Warp Speed program.The dosing in the British trial “wasn’t done correctly,” Corey maintains. Still, the dosing difference does not fully explain the variation in effectiveness seen in the U.K. and Brazilian trials, he said.“One of the issues with the Oxford data is that there’s a lot of lack of uniformity in the schedule and the dose that makes interpretation of the results difficult at best,” he said in a phone interview.There were also differences in the intervals between doses in the U.K. trial versus the Brazilian trial, as well as significant differences in the age range included in the studies. For example, everyone in the 90% effective group was under the age of 55, a group less susceptible to severe Covid-19.“My personal summation is that there seems to be effectiveness in the AstraZeneca vaccine from this other trial that provides optimism that the current trial in the United States will define that effectiveness,” said Corey, a virologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.AstraZeneca did not respond immediately to a request for comment.Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser for the Operation Warp Speed vaccine program, said last week the British and Brazilian trials may not be enough to ensure the vaccine receives a U.S. Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization.Results and potentially a request for U.S. emergency use authorization by AstraZeneca could come in late January, he said.AstraZeneca has said it is considering a new global trial based on the half dose first regimen. The U.S. trial calls for testing the original regimen of two full doses.Should AstraZeneca decide to run a new U.S. trial testing the half dose first option, Corey said, the United States was unlikely to help foot the bill.“Companies get to decide what they want to do,” he said. “I’m sure they’ll have to fund it themselves, or maybe somebody else would fund it for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-astrazeneca-vaccine-trial-will-clear-confusion-on-how-well-it-works-scientist/story-j74LLjiLsYVZpAzHHnHvYM.html
08-12-2020||World||Hailing ‘turning point’, Britain begins roll-out of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine||Britain will start rolling out the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech on Tuesday, the first Western country to start vaccinating its general population in what was hailed as a decisive watershed in defeating the coronavirus.The mass inoculation will fuel hope that the world may be turning a corner in the fight against a pandemic that has crushed economies and killed more than 1.5 million, although ultra-cold storage and tricky logistics will limit its use for now.Britain is the worst-hit European country from Covid-19, with over 61,000 deaths, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to turn the tide against the disease by rolling out the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine before the United States or European Union.Britain approved the vaccine for emergency use less than a week ago, and is rolling it out through its National Health Service (NHS).“The deployment of this vaccine marks a decisive turning point in the battle with the pandemic,” said NHS chief executive Simon Stevens. “NHS staff are proud to be leading the way as the first health service in the world to begin vaccination with this Covid jab”In total Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. As each person requires two doses, that is enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million.About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week, with care home residents and carers, the over 80s and some health service workers the top priority to get them.The roll-out provides a test case for Pfizer and BioNTech’s distribution networks. The shot must be stored at -70C (-94F) and only lasts five days in a regular fridge.While Britain is relatively small and has good infrastructure, the logistical challenges mean it will first be applied in 50 hospitals and cannot yet be taken into care homes.Pfizer and BioNTech said their shot proved 95% effective in preventing illness in final-stage trials. In all, Britain has ordered 357 million doses of seven different Covid-19 vaccines.Russia and China have both started giving vaccine candidates to their populations before final safety and efficacy trials have been completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hailing-turning-point-britain-begins-roll-out-of-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-3JGlhlcbgdwO8CfZym1VbN.html
08-12-2020||World||Moderna, Pfizer won’t attend White House summit on vaccines||Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., the two pharmaceutical companies closest to gaining U.S. clearance for a Covid-19 vaccine, won’t attend a White House summit intended to build confidence in the shots.With the Food and Drug Administration expected to decide on whether to allow the companies’ vaccines to be distributed in the coming days, there was worry that regulators and executives shouldn’t be seen rubbing elbows at the Tuesday meeting.Operation Warp Speed had early discussions with several vaccine makers about attending the event, according to a senior administration official. However, the focus of the gathering shifted after Peter Marks, the head of the FDA center that reviews vaccines, volunteered to make a presentation.Since it would be would inappropriate to have vaccine company executives touting their shots while in the same room with their regulator, a decision was made not to include any drugmakers in the meeting, the official said on a call with reporters on Monday.Pfizer said in a statement it had informed the White House that it wouldn’t attend the Tuesday event, but didn’t elaborate. Moderna spokesman Ray Jordan said in a statement the company was contacted by Operation Warp Speed to be part of the meeting and that it was willing to participate, but later learned that its participation wouldn’t be required, based on the agenda.Both Pfizer and Moderna could soon gain authorization for their messenger RNA-based shots. A group of outside advisers to the FDA is scheduled to consider the case for clearing Pfizer’s vaccine, which it is developing with German drugmaker BioNTech SE, on Thursday. An advisory panel is set to scrutinize Moderna’s shot at a meeting on Dec. 17.Soon after each of those meetings, the FDA could grant authorization for the shots, setting off what is expected to be one of the largest mass immunization efforts in history.The Tuesday meeting hosted by President Donald Trump is designed to boost confidence in the shots at a time when some groups have voiced reluctance to take them. The summit is likely to focus on distribution, with Trump planning to sign an order directing his Department of Health and Human Services to prioritize getting them to people in the U.S. before helping other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-pfizer-won-t-attend-white-house-summit-on-vaccines/story-3XrUTWmfACCaMUVvrZACfN.html

08-12-2020||World||US schools go back and forth on in-person learning||New York City reopened classrooms to many of its youngest students on Monday in what has become a frustrating, stop-and-start process in many school systems around the US because of the alarming surge in the coronavirus.The nation’s largest school district, with 1 million students, had shut down in-person learning just two weeks ago but decided to bring back preschoolers and elementary school children after parents pushed for it and the mayor concluded it was safe to do so with beefed-up testing.In contrast, school systems in Detroit, Boston, Indianapolis, Philadelphia and suburban Minneapolis in recent weeks abandoned in-person classes or dropped plans to bring students back because of soaring infections.The retreat in some places and the push forward in others are happening as the virus comes back with a vengeance across much of the US, with deaths per day averaging over 2,200 — about the same level seen during the very deadliest stretch of the outbreak, last spring in the New York City area.Newly cases are averaging close to 200,000 a day, the highest level on record, and the number of Americans now in the hospital has reached all-time highs at over 100,000.The virus is blamed for more than 280,000 deaths and over 14.8 million confirmed infections in the US, with the crisis widely expected to worsen in the coming weeks because of Americans’ disregard of warnings to stay home and avoid others over Thanksgiving.Health officials say the virus does not appear to be spreading rapidly in classrooms themselves, perhaps because children may be less likely to spread or contract the virus. Instead, many cases among youngsters and educators have been traced to activities outside school.Still, the infections have alarmed parents and educators, and the illnesses and quarantines among teachers and other employees have left some schools short of adult supervision.Also Read| Covid-19 vaccine: The next steps in the United StatesAt the same time, parents and others have complained that children are not getting a good education at home in front of a computer. And the switch to remote learning has caused hardship for many families by forcing parents to watch over their children instead of going to work.In South Carolina, where Covid-19 cases have spiked to levels higher than those seen when the state was one of the nation’s hot spots over the summer, school districts are considering cutting back on how much time students spend in the classroom. More than 2,450 new Covid-19 cases have been reported in South Carolina in each of the past three days.A teacher group there is asking districts to go back to all-virtual teaching until the spike can be flattened, citing not just health concerns but a shortage of adults to keep students safe.The plea was given more emotional weight after the death on November 11 of 50-year-old Staci Blakely, a third grade teacher in Lexington.At least four school districts in South Carolina have returned to all-virtual learning. The largest so far, Orangeburg County, sent its 12,000 students home to learn, starting Monday, until at least the end of Christmas break. Nearly a quarter of the state’s districts are teaching in person every day.In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced just last month that school buildings would close after the city crossed a threshold of 3% in the share of coronavirus tests coming back positive for the virus. The rate is now 5%, according to the city, but de Blasio said new testing protocols made it safe to reopen classrooms, in part because few infections have been linked to transmission inside schools.About 190,000 students are eligible to return. Middle schools and high schools will remain all-remote at least until after the holiday break.“This is a good day for New York City, even against a tough backdrop,” de Blasio said on Monday.Miriam Petrovitch was among staffers welcoming children back at an elementary school on Manhattan’s Lower East Side.“We miss them dearly,” Petrovitch, who works as a parent coordinator, said at a union news conference. “There’s no school without children.” After closing schools in March, New York became one of the first large US cities to reopen classrooms in September, but the majority of parents chose online-only learning for their children. Other parents chose a hybrid in which students were in their classrooms only a few days a week.Since the beginning of the New York City school year, more than 1,740 students and 2,240 staff in the public system have gotten the virus, according to city statistics.It’s been a struggle for American schoolchildren for the entire year — academically, psychologically and physically.School districts across the country, both big and small, have reported an increase in the number of students failing classes. Students for whom English is not their native language, students with disabilities and poor children are suffering the most.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-schools-go-back-and-forth-on-in-person-learning/story-JBNcYQU2P74zF8S1gcvaaK.html
08-12-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine: The next steps in the United States||How quickly can Americans hope to get the coronavirus vaccine? Here is a look at the next steps in the approval and distribution process:Short term: first authorizationsThe vaccine advisory committee of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will meet Thursday after poring over data from clinical trials carried out by Pfizer/BioNTech.The FDA should then give its authorization for emergency use of the vaccine. That decision could come “within days after the advisory committee” meets, Health Secretary Alex Azar said.On December 17, the same process will unfold for the Moderna vaccine. In each case, distribution will begin immediately after FDA approval. US Army General Gus Perna, in charge of logistics for the government’s Operation Warp Speed to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, has set a December 15 target date for Pfizer. “Within 24 hours of FDA green lighting with authorization we’ll ship to all of the states and territories that we work with. And within hours they can be vaccinating,” Azar said.December: 20 mn vaccinatedThe number of available doses would be limited at first. The government says 40 million doses will be distributed by year’s end, meaning that 20 million people can be vaccinated, as each requires two doses separated by three to four weeks.Officials say the logistics are in place to distribute the first batch of roughly 6.4 million Pfizer vaccine doses right away.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that health care workers (21 million) and residents of long-term care facilities (three million) be first in line.In the end, though, state governments decide who gets priority for the vaccine, but most will adhere to CDC guidelines.Early 2021: 100 mn vaccinatedAfter that, the details of the process are a bit fluid. Of course, Donald Trump will leave office and President-elect Joe Biden will take over on January 20, though much will be in place by then.“By the middle of the month of March, we should have really covered most of the highly susceptible population, about 100 million people,” Moncef Slaoui, Warp Speed’s chief science advisor, said Sunday.Initially, he had set end-February for that 100 million target.Who will these 100 million people be, exactly? Authorities have not yet finalized their priority groups. And experts don’t all agree about who should come next.Deborah Birx, a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, told AFP the first 100 million should be those whose pre-existing conditions put them at high risk if they get infected.But other experts advising the CDC suggested they would recommend that 87 million essential workers in fields such as education, food service, law enforcement and transportation be given priority after health care workers and nursing home residents.Moderna said last week that it would be able to deliver 85 to 100 million vaccine doses to the United States in the first quarter of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-the-next-steps-in-the-united-states/story-xpRHz8d0OC6wT9Mz091STJ.html

The speech in Atlanta will come less than a month before the run-off elections for the Georgia Senate seats and follows weekend senatorial campaign appearances in the state by President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.Pompeo will discuss “the China challenge to US national security and academic freedom,” the university said. The administration has rapidly and steadily ramped up sanctions against China over the past two years, limiting visas for Chinese researchers, scientists and academics, closing China’s consulate in Houston and imposing penalties on Chinese and Hong Kong officials.Pompeo, who is widely seen as a contender for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, has been heavily criticized for departing from the traditionally non-partisan role of the nation’s top diplomat by making appearances that have political overtones over the past several months. Most notably, those include a video address to the Republican National Convention in August that he taped during a trip to Israel.Although secretaries of state often speak to domestic audiences, Pompeo’s RNC speech prompted calls from congressional Democrats for an investigation into whether it violated the Hatch Act that bars political appointees from overtly partisan activities. Pompeo has said a probe is underway, although State Department ethics officials have cleared him.But, the RNC speech from the roof of a Jerusalem hotel is not the only Pompeo appearance that has raised eyebrows. Pompeo has spoken at The Villages, a heavily Republican retirement community in the battleground state of Florida, as well as at an Evangelical church in Texas and religious gatherings in Iowa and Florida, over the past 18 months.In addition, he has spoken several times to conservative religious groups that have taken clear political positions on November’s presidential election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.Pompeo has yet to unambiguously recognize that Biden won the contest, although the State Department and other federal agencies are now cooperating with the Biden transition team. Pompeo, who made a point of discussing his outreach to his predecessors when he took over the job from fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, has yet to publicly acknowledge any contact with his designated successor, Antony Blinken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-to-speak-in-georgia-as-senate-run-offs-loom/story-tVGkCqq9Kj9afWtmS5zJyN.html
08-12-2020||World||California becomes biggest US state to launch virus contact-tracing app||California on Monday announced an app to help people track their exposure to the coronavirus, becoming the biggest US state to take advantage of new technology from smartphone software makers Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google.Beginning on Thursday, people in California can activate the exposure notifications tool from the settings menu on iPhones or by downloading the CA Notify App in the Google Play store on Android devices.The apps enable Bluetooth signals between devices to determine when they are in close proximity, and the apps then anonymously alert users when a recent contact later tests positive. At least 6 million people in the United States have tried the system in recent months across the 21 states and two territories that made apps available before California. Colorado and New York are among other states with apps.Public health experts say adoption has lagged because of technical shortcomings in the earliest apps, privacy concerns and dismissive attitudes toward taking precautions to avoid the virus.

08-12-2020||World||Angela Merkel warns Germany needs tougher lockdown to get through winter||German leaders came out on Monday in favour of stricter measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus, a few days after the country posted its highest one-day death toll so far.Chancellor Angela Merkel told party colleagues that existing lockdown measures - with bars and restaurants closed and shops admitting limited numbers - were too little to get the virus under control.“The situation is getting very serious: these measures will not be enough to get us through the winter,” participants said she had told a meeting of her conservative bloc’s legislators.Daily infections are no longer rising as sharply as previously in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, but they have stagnated at a high level and the highest single-day coronavirus death toll yet was reported last Wednesday.Markus Soeder, premier of the southern state of Bavaria, which has the nation’s highest death toll, said he was certain regional and national leaders would agree tighter measures before Christmas. They had previously agreed not to revisit lockdown rules before Jan. 10.Although vaccines that are expected to help contain the pandemic are on their way, available doses are limited, meaning that only certain groups, notably the very elderly, can expect to be inoculated during the winter, an expert panel ruled on Monday.Meanwhile, some states are going further on their own initiative: Rhineland-Palatinate banned takeaway sales of mulled wine in a bid to discourage disease-spreading impromptu street parties.From Wednesday, Bavaria will allow people to leave home only for essential reasons, while evening curfews are planned for hotspots with the highest infection rates.Data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases on Monday morning showed the number of confirmed cases rose by 12,332 in the past 24 hours to 1,183,655. The reported death toll rose 147 to 18,919 - still well below that of large European peers such as Spain, France and Italy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-warns-germany-needs-tougher-lockdown-to-get-through-winter/story-jeDxfGEgBOBWsE9xwmAFQK.html
