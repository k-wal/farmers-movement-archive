Ten of them did so in 2016.But they are expected to confirm Biden as the winner by 306-232 electoral college votes as had been projected just days after the close of polling on November 3 and as was certified by states last week in another election ritual getting rare public attention because of Trump’s obduracy.Voters in Georgia, at the same time, started casting their ballots in the January 5 run-off election to elect two US senators. In the fray are incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both Republicans. They face Democrats Joe Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively.If the Republicans win, their party will retain control of the senate. But if the Democrats win — both of them — their party will take over the upper chamber, completing their hold over Congress as they are already in power in the House of Representatives. And they will be in control of the White House as well, shutting out the Republicans completely.Georgia is a solidly Republican state which, however, voted for Biden in the November 3 presidential election. Trump campaigned there for Perdue and Loeffler earlier this month, but the party fears that his claims of election fraud in the state, as in other swing states that he lost, could discourage Republican voters from showing up for the run-off election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/electors-meet-to-affirm-biden-s-win-georgia-run-off-voting-starts/story-M0LIBPKVwjg71ZtI9CDadN.html
14-12-2020||World||There’s light at end of the tunnel, says first NYC recipient of Covid vaccine||An African American healthcare worker became on Monday the first to get a shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in New York, the city hit the hardest by the pandemic, as first doses of the drug were administered to Americans around the country amid much cheering and applause.“There’s light at the end of the tunnel ... I encourage everyone to take the vaccine,” said Sandra Lindsay, a critical care worker, after she was administered a primary shot of the two-dose vaccine at a New York city hospital, as other healthcare workers applauded, joined in by Governor Andrew Cuomo through video link. Many in the African American community are distrustful of vaccines because of a history of racially charged medical experimentations.“First Vaccine Administered. Congratulations USA! Congratulations WORLD!” President Donald Trump wrote in a tweet shortly, but it was not immediately clear if he was referring to Lindsay or some other case as first shots of the vaccine began to be administered around the country on Monday. Earlier, he had reversed a White House decision to vaccinate personnel around the president in the first lot. He moved them back to their usual positions in the priority line.Frontline healthcare workers and residents of long-term nursing home facilities have been prioritised by US public health authorities for vaccination, which started Monday following expedited approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech medicine by the drug and food safety regulator and related health surveillance agencies over the weekend. The vaccine’s journey from Pfizer’s manufacturing facility in Michigan was followed breathlessly by news TV crews, for a nation starving for good news. Cameras recorded trucks carrying the vaccines emerging from the facility and cargo flights carrying them from a nearby airport for onward destinations.A local Michigan couple came to the airport to watch the flights take off. That was the stuff of history, like the moon landing, they said.Nearly 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines will be administered at 600 sites around the country immediately, with millions more over the next days.A second vaccine — from Moderna — is on the way as well, and is expected to become available for emergency use through the same expedited process.New York state accounted for more than 35,000 of the nearly 300,000 Americans killed by coronavirus in the United States thus far, according to the Johns Hopkins University. An estimated 65% of the New York deaths were in New York City making it the worst hit in the world. The United States has been the most badly affected in the world with more than 16 million infections and it is undergoing a new surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/there-s-light-at-end-of-the-tunnel-says-first-nyc-recipient-of-covid-vaccine/story-q1u3Qu4JwJuYLj8NdcdA5L.html
14-12-2020||World||Identical to previous results, Sputnik V stands 91.4% effective against Covid||Russia’s vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Sputnik V, efficacy stands at 91.4 per cent after the final control point analysis of data procured post 21 days of the first dose, as per the statement. Fresh results from the trial of the vaccine were published by the Russian shot developers on Monday. Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Previously, after the second interim data analysis of Phase 3 clinical trial, the vaccine showed the same rate of efficacy in protection against Covid-19, as per the results declared by Gamaleya Center and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) on November 24.The Gamaleya Institute along with RDIF released the new data based on a trial on 22,714 volunteers, out of which 78 turned out to be positive for the coronavirus disease. The researchers at the institute said out of 78 cases, 62 confirmed positives had received a placebo. As per the statement, 20 of the volunteers receiving placebo had severe symptoms of Covid-19 while there were no severe cases of the virus in the 16 of the participants who were trialled with the vaccine.The Sputnik V website says more than 50 countries have requested for more than 1.2 billion doses of the vaccine. RDIF, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, had joined hands with India’s leading pharmaceutical company Hetero biologics arm Hetero Biopharma last month to produce around 100 million doses of the world’s first registered vaccine.The developers have also collaborated in India for clinical trials with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. Phase II/III clinical trials have begun in the country after receiving the necessary clearance from Central Drugs Laboratory.“This is another significant step as we continue to collaborate with multiple entities along with the government bodies to fast-track the process for launching the vaccine in India. We are working towards making the vaccine available with a combination of import and indigenous production model,” said G V Prasad, Co-chairman and Managing Director, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories. Also Read | Moscow starts mass Covid-19 vaccination with its Sputnik V shotThe Russian vaccine that has got its name from Soviet-era space satellite claims to be unique because it uses two different vectors based on human adenovirus allowing a stronger and longer immune response to the virus in contrast to the vaccine using single and same vector for two doses.“Adenovirus vectors are genetically modified viruses of the regular flu that cannot reproduce in a human body. When the Sputnik V vaccine is used, the coronavirus itself does not enter the body as the vaccine only contains genetic information about part of its outer protein coat, the so-called “spikes” forming its crown. This completely eliminates the possibility of getting infected as a result of vaccination while also causing the body’s stable immune response,” as per Gamaleya institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/identical-to-previous-results-sputnik-v-stands-91-4-effective-against-covid/story-McZ9j0lJcbJwuyVJnG9lzL.html
14-12-2020||World||First Covid-19 vaccine administered in the US, tweets President Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump on Monday announced the administration of the first Covid-19 vaccine on Twitter as shipments of frozen vials reached the United States to battle the coronavirus disease. Marking the onset of what will be the largest vaccination campaign in the US history, shots made by Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech are the first authorised for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Several other countries also have given their nod of acceptance for the vaccine, including the UK, which started vaccinating last week.First Vaccine Administered. Congratulations USA! Congratulations WORLD!Packed in dry ice to stay at ultra-frozen temperatures, the first of nearly 3 million doses being shipped in staggered batches this week made their way by truck and by plane around the country Sunday from Pfizer’s Kalamazoo, Michigan, factory. Once they arrive at distribution centres, each state directs where the doses go next.Also read: US set for first Covid-19 shots as shipments begin arrivingThe US will vaccinate health care workers first, who along with nursing home residents, have spent months battling a coronavirus that still is surging in the country and around the world. Authorities are expected to rush against time to rapidly get the vaccine into the arms of millions, not just doctors and nurses but other at-risk health workers such as janitors and food handlers — which will be immediately followed by a second dose three weeks later.According to FDA – the world’s most strict medical regulator – the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appears safe and strongly protective. The agency has also laid out the data behind it in a daylong public meeting last week for scientists and consumers alike to see. Experts have pointed out that the shots can cause temporary fever, fatigue and aches as they rev up people’s immune systems, forcing hospitals to stagger employee vaccinations.(With inputs from Associated Press)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-19-vaccine-administered-in-the-us-tweets-president-donald-trump/story-SIdxPEoYwWdpHaeF92HEJM.html
14-12-2020||World||US set for first Covid-19 shots as shipments begin arriving||Hospital workers begin unloading precious frozen vials of Covid-19 vaccine Monday, with the first vaccinations against a scourge that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans expected later in the day.“It feels like the cavalry is arriving,” Robert C. Garrett, CEO of Hackensack Meridian Health, said as New Jersey’s largest health network awaited delivery.Shots made by Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech are the first authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration -- beginning what will become the largest vaccination campaign in US history. Several other countries also have OK’d the vaccine, including the UK, which started vaccinating last week.For health care workers who, along with nursing home residents, will be first in line for vaccination, hope is tempered by grief and the sheer exhaustion of months spent battling a coronavirus that still is surging in the US and around the world.“This is mile 24 of a marathon. People are fatigued. But we also recognize that this end is in sight,” said Dr. Chris Dale of Swedish Health Services in Seattle.Packed in dry ice to stay at ultra-frozen temperatures, the first of nearly 3 million doses being shipped in staggered batches this week made their way by truck and by plane around the country Sunday from Pfizer’s Kalamazoo, Michigan, factory. Once they arrive at distribution centers, each state directs where the doses go next.Some hospitals across the country spent the weekend tracking their packages, refreshing FedEx and UPS websites for clues.More of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will arrive each week. And later this week, the FDA will decide whether to green light the world’s second rigorously studied Covid-19 vaccine, made by Moderna Inc.Now the hurdle is to rapidly get vaccine into the arms of millions, not just doctors and nurses but other at-risk health workers such as janitors and food handlers — and then deliver a second dose three weeks later.“We’re also in the middle of a surge, and it’s the holidays, and our health care workers have been working at an extraordinary pace,” said Sue Mashni, chief pharmacy officer at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City.Plus, the shots can cause temporary fever, fatigue and aches as they rev up people’s immune systems, forcing hospitals to stagger employee vaccinations.A wary public will be watching closely to see whether health workers embrace vaccination. Just half of Americans say they want to get vaccinated, while about a quarter don’t and the rest are unsure, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Health Research.The FDA, considered the world’s most strict medical regulator, said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appears safe and strongly protective -- and laid out the data behind it in a daylong public meeting last week for scientists and consumers alike to see.“Please people, when you look back in a year and you say to yourself, ‘Did I do the right thing?’ I hope you’ll be able to say, ‘Yes, because I looked at the evidence,’” Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. “People are dying right now. How could you possibly say, ‘Let’s wait and see.’”Still, emergency use means the vaccine was cleared for widespread use before a final study in nearly 44,000 people is complete -- and that research is continuing to try to answer additional questions. While effective against Covid-19 illness, it’s not yet clear if vaccination will stop the symptomless spread that accounts for half of all cases.The shots still must be studied in children, and during pregnancy. But the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said late Sunday that vaccination should not be withheld from pregnant women who otherwise would qualify.While the vaccine was determined to be safe, regulators in the UK are investigating several severe allergic reactions. The FDA’s instructions tell providers not to give it to those with a known history of severe allergic reactions to any of its ingredients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-set-for-first-covid-19-shots-as-shipments-begin-arriving/story-4zjc6kuPXrjkRg3ZDPBfJN.html
14-12-2020||World||Families marry off daughters to ease finances amid Covid-19||The man first caught a glimpse of Marie Kamara as she ran with her friends past his house near the village primary school. Soon after, he proposed to the fifth-grader.“I’m going to school now. I don’t want to get married and stay in the house,” she told him.But the pressures of a global pandemic on this remote corner of Sierra Leone were greater than the wishes of a schoolgirl. Nearby mining operations had slowed with the global economy. Business fell off at her stepfather’s tailoring shop, where outfits he had sewn now gathered dust. The family needed money.Her suitor was a small-scale miner in his mid-20s, but his parents could provide rice for Marie’s four younger sisters and access to their watering hole. They could pay cash.Before long, Marie was seated on a floor mat in a new dress as his family presented hers with 500,000 leones ($50) inside a calabash bowl along with the traditional kola nut.“The day they paid for me was on a Friday and then I went to his house to stay,” she says flatly, adding that at least now she gets to eat something twice a day.Many countries had made progress against such traditional and transactional marriages of girls in recent decades, but Covid-19’s economic havoc has caused significant backsliding: The United Nations estimates that hardships resulting from Covid-19 will drive 13 million more girls to marry before the age of 18.Though most such marriages take place in secret, Save the Children estimates that this year alone, nearly half a million more girls under 18 are at risk of being married off worldwide, most in Africa and Asia, but also in the Middle East. One aid organization said staffers in a remote corner of Sierra Leone overheard a relative offering up a girl as young as 8 for marriage earlier this year. When chastised, the grandmother later denied doing so.In most cases, needy parents receive a dowry for their daughter — a bit of land or livestock that can provide income, or cash and a promise to take over financial responsibility for the young bride. The girl, in turn, takes on the household chores of her husband’s family and often farm work too.In pre-pandemic Jordan, only about 10% of girls were married before the age of 18, a much lower percentage than in Africa or South Asia. The number, though, was greater among Palestinian and Syrian refugees there and they are ever more vulnerable, according to the Girls Not Brides organization.“Sadly, we have seen an increase in child marriage in refugee camps since the beginning of the pandemic as families struggle to cope,” said Tanya Chapuisat, the UNICEF representative for Jordan.India’s harsh lockdown to contain the virus in late March caused millions of impoverished migrants to lose their jobs in cities and many journeyed back to the towns and villages they had left in search of work.With schools closed and pressure on household finances mounting, marrying off young girls has become a more viable option for reducing expenses.The ChildLine India recorded 5,214 early marriages in just four months of lockdown between March and June 2020 across India, considered to be a vast undercount as the majority of cases are not reported, the organization says.In one instance, a 13-year-old girl in Uttar Pradesh notified police that her unemployed father intended to forcibly marry her, said officer Narendra Nath Srivastava. The marriage was averted but not before he took 50,000 rupees (about $675) from the boy’s family.“As the money transaction had taken place, the father was arrested because we feared that the poor girl could have been pushed to child trafficking,” the police officer said.Similarly, in Pakistan’s southern Sindh province, child protection services reported 17 child marriages that were stopped or later dissolved in the first 10 months of the year.“It’s a small number compared to reality. We know that,” said Fauzia Masoom, director of Sindh Child Protection Authority.Intervention is only sometimes effective at preventing the marriages, even where they are illegal. In many countries the legal age to marry is 19, often there are loopholes for parental consent that are used in cases of economic need and early pregnancy to blunt social stigma.Child protection authorities in Bangladesh said they received an 8:30 p.m. call back in June warning that a child marriage was to take place within the hour.The girl’s family thought they could use the lockdown to marry off their daughter in secret. As soon as the officials arrived, however, the groom and his family ran away.Authorities counseled the girl’s family on the consequences of early marriage for their daughter — an end to her education and likely a pregnancy before she is ready. The family said they were desperate because the father was out of work due to the Covid-19 crisis, but promised not to have her marry before she becomes an adult.Then they simply waited for officials to leave and held the wedding at two in the morning.—-In Sierra Leone, the rate of marriage under 18 had dropped from 56% in 2006 to 39% in 2017 — a major achievement in the eyes of child protection activists. Then Covid-19 hit, schools closed in March and child marriages accelerated as many village girls who had been attending classes in nearby towns returned home to their parents.It wasn’t clear when or even if school ever would resume and many parents feared their idle daughters would get pregnant out of wedlock, said Isata Dumbaya, who manages reproductive and maternal health for Partners in Health Sierra Leone.“When you marry, your father is no longer responsible for feeding you, for paying your fees or doing anything else for you,” she said. “And if you come from a house with a lot of other children, indeed, this is one less person (to feed).”The willingness to sacrifice a daughter in periods of economic hardship underscores the lives many young girls have in this part of Africa. They are largely seen as household help as children, sent out to gather firewood or water at sunrise, and often the last to be fed at mealtime, until they join their future husbands to perform the same chores and more.Many of the girls’ mothers were themselves married off as teenagers, said Dumbaya, and see early marriage as normal. “They do not see it as harming their children,” she said.It’s a mindset that Sierra Leone’s first lady, Fatima Maada Bio, knows first hand and has been working to change with her “Hands Off Our Girls” campaign since her husband took office in 2018.Bio managed to escape to the United Kingdom as a teenager after learning her father intended to marry her off to someone. A cousin told her father the pair were headed upcountry. Instead, Bio was taken to the airport without his knowledge and did not marry the man chosen for her.She has made it her life’s work to help other underage girls: “Early marriage in all forms is legalized rape,” she told The Associated Press in a recent interview.Sex with underage girls is illegal in Sierra Leone, but it is rarely enforced. Police say cases aren’t reported because the families already have agreed to the marriage whether the brides have or not.While the billboards with the first lady’s image and “Marriage is My Choice; Education is My Right” still line the roadsides, Covid-19 precautions mean the campaign has had to scale back many of its outreach efforts. That means fewer face-to-face meetings with Sierra Leone’s traditional leaders who are known as paramount chiefs, some of whom govern swaths of the country so remote they lack an FM radio signal let alone internet.“Unfortunately when you can’t congregate, you are limited,” she said. “Not everybody here is conversant with technology where you can say, ‘Let’s have a Zoom meeting.’ And even if you have a community meeting, how many people can log in?”As a result of the lack of contact and scrutiny, Sierra Leone’s first lady acknowledges that she does not have a complete picture of the rising rate of child marriages.“I believe that a whole lot of girls would have gone through early marriage silently because movements were restricted and we can’t reach them,” she said.___Sierra Leone closed its borders before the country had registered its first Covid-19 case. As a result, the country has seen only 2,434 confirmed cases and 74 deaths. Only 76 of those cases were confirmed in Kono district, but the economic toll here has brought many families already living on the edge to a breaking point.Underage marriages are now on the rise across ethnic groups and religions, according to interviews with school officials, traditional leaders and the health workers who treat the young and pregnant.The men are always older, though most child brides don’t even know their husbands’ ages. Some don’t even know their own in a country where few have birth certificates. The schoolgirl Marie thought she might be 16, though most of her classmates are 12.Gladys Katingor, a midwife in Koidu, has seen girls as young as 13 come in pregnant, some with husbands old enough to be their grandfathers. The nurses here say some of the youngest ones only develop breasts with their pregnancies.Most of the time since Covid-19 there is not even a marriage ceremony at the local mosque or church: Parents simply accept suitors’ proposals and then deliver their daughters to the groom’s home, paramount chiefs say.And even when the marriage turns violent, the girl is pressured to stay.Kadiatu Mansaray, now 15, says her widowed mother pushed her into marriage during the pandemic because of financial hardship and because the teenager’s prospects for a husband already were considered limited as she had gotten pregnant once before at 12. She can’t be sure just how much money was offered as a bride price: She was crying too hard at the ceremony to see straight.“I was not ready to get married. I wanted to learn something first,” she says.The man had met her while she was washing clothes in a nearby brook in this forested corner near the border with Guinea. The divorce came as swiftly as the marriage.A month after leaving her husband, Kadiatu’s left eye is still blackened from his last beating. Her offense, he said, was sharing their limited food with others.“He told me: ‘We don’t have money to buy food. I asked you not to give food to others and you did anyway.’”Now she’s back in the village with her mother, walking to the closest village of Kombayendeh on market days to sell oranges.Early marriages were happening so often in this part of Sierra Leone that traditional leaders in the Lei chiefdom instituted a new bylaw imposing a 500,000 ($50) fine on anyone having sex with a minor, even if the man is married to the child. Yet local leaders in Kombayendeh can’t recall a single fine being issued.On rare occasions, some teenagers manage to escape early marriage with the help of supportive relatives but that assistance is often temporary.Naomi Mondeh was just 15 and had only finished the fifth grade when her parents said that they could no longer afford her schooling. A man from neighboring Liberia working in the timber trade offered the cash-strapped family a 50-kilogram bag of rice.“They came and told me that someone wants my hand in marriage, and they said: ‘Naomi, you know our situation now. We do not have anything. And there is a man who wants to marry you and help you,’” she recalled. “They told me that if I reject him, they would not take care of me anymore.”Naomi didn’t know his age, or that he already had one wife. Soon she was competing for attention and money with another woman. Her husband often would leave her alone with no money for food. Only through the generosity of neighbors could she eat during his long absences.She complained bitterly to her parents, but her fate was sealed.“They said: ‘Your husband already married you, so you must be patient.’ But I told them that I can’t be patient with this kind of marriage, this type of forced marriage that you put me into, I can’t be patient with it.”Even amidst the rainy season when roads turn to sludge, isolating her village from the rest of the world, Naomi was able to escape in November by motorcycle taxi to Koidu, the largest nearby town, where an aunt was willing to take her in.Only now her parents know where she is. They have told her she can stay while they try to work things out. Naomi is resolute, though, that she is done with her husband and is learning how to become a seamstress.“There is nothing that will make me to return to him again because there will be more suffering for me. I will stand firm to not go back.”___Since many rural areas in Sierra Leone do not have secondary schools, teenage girls often move in with relatives or friends in distant towns to continue their education. Mariama Conteh, who estimates her age at 17 but seems much younger, had left her remote village near the border with Guinea to live with an aunt in Koidu and attend school. Then in April a 28-year-old man in their compound expressed interest in her.It took a month for Mariama to say yes over her aunt’s threats to send her back to her village, where her father is struggling to feed two wives and 10 other children and her mother would be embarrassed by her return.“The people in the village would mock us,” she says. “It would be shameful for me and my mom.”She bursts into uncontrollable sobs when she thinks of the future she once hoped for. Her older sister was able to go on to senior secondary school before she was married, something now completely out of reach for Mariama.“It is what it is,” she says, now 7 months pregnant and soon to put a baby on her back instead of a schoolbag. “It has happened.”Mariama’s husband senses her unhappiness but is enthusiastic about the pregnancy and hopes the baby will be a boy. So does Mariama.If she has a daughter, one thing is certain, she says: “I will not give my child to anybody. I will take care of her.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/families-marry-off-daughters-to-ease-finances-amid-covid-19/story-CQVp3wKpnZTSvRYrfgkJqI.html
14-12-2020||World||London may move into toughest tier of Covid-19 restrictions||London is likely to be placed into the toughest tier of Covid-19 restrictions following a sharp rise in coronavirus infection rates, the BBC reported on Monday, as one of the world’s richest cities struggles to contain the disease.Earlier this month, the government implemented a three-tiered system of restrictions in England to try to keep a second wave of the virus under control following a month-long lockdown. More than 40% of citizens were placed in the highest risk category.However the capital, whose 9 million people and world-leading financial centre make it the engine of the British economy, is currently only in the second highest tier of restrictions.A countrywide review of the tier system is scheduled to take place on Dec. 16, although London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was possible a decision on London could come as early as Monday.“We’ve seen over the last few days a big increase in the virus,” Khan told Sky News.Health secretary Matt Hancock was due to speak in parliament at 1530 GMT.The main difference between the top two tiers is that bars and restaurants, which can stay open under certain conditions in tier two, must close their doors in tier three and can only operate takeaway services.There are also additional restrictions on socialising, but workplaces and schools are told to remain open.Data published last week showed case rates per 100,000 people in London stood at 191.8, putting the city ahead of regions that have stricter rules in place, such as the West Midlands.Based on that data, the government raised concerns about the spread of the virus in London schools and announced a programme of mass testing. On Sunday, one region of the capital unilaterally decided to close its schools altogether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-may-move-into-toughest-tier-of-covid-19-restrictions/story-YMsMP0WD6rwMXqFLpXtAjJ.html
14-12-2020||World||US Election 2020: What happens when the electoral college meets||More than one month after voters cast their ballots in the US presidential election, the electoral college meets on December 14 to cast their ballots. The US constitution gives the electors the power to choose the president and when all the votes are counted, president-elect Joe Biden is expected to have 306 electoral votes, more than the 270 needed to elect a president, to 232 votes for President Donald Trump.Here’s everything you need to know about the electoral college and what happens next:What is the electoral college?The electoral college is a middle ground between electing the president by popular vote and having US Congress chooses the president. Under the US Constitution, states get a number of electors equal to their total number of seats in Congress: two senators plus however many members the state has in the House of Representatives. With the exception of Maine and Nebraska, states award all of their electoral college votes to the winner of the popular vote in their state.Why is the concept of the electoral college criticised?The electoral college has been the subject of criticism for more than two centuries mostly because the person who wins the popular vote can nonetheless lose the presidential election. That has happened twice in the last two decades — in 2000 with the election of George W Bush and in 2016 when Donald Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes.Who are the electors and what do they do?Presidential electors typically are elected officials, political hopefuls or long-time party loyalists. The electoral college doesn’t meet in one place. Instead, each state’s electors and the electors for the District of Columbia meet in a place chosen by their legislature, usually the state capitol.Electors cast their votes by paper ballot: one ballot for president and one for vice president. The votes get counted and the electors sign six certificates with the results. Each certificate gets paired with a certificate from the governor detailing the state’s vote totals.Those six packets then get mailed to various people specified by law. The most important copy, though, gets sent to the president of the Senate, the current vice president. This is the copy that will be officially counted later.Are electors obligated to vote for the candidate who won in their state?In 32 states and the District of Columbia, laws require electors to vote for the popular-vote winner. The US Supreme Court unanimously upheld this arrangement in July. Electors almost always vote for the state winner anyway, because they generally are devoted to their political party.What will happen next?Once the electoral votes are cast, they are sent to Congress, where both houses will convene on January 6 for a session presided over by vice president Mike Pence. The envelopes from each state and the District of Columbia will be opened and the votes tallied.If at least one member of each house objects in writing to some electoral votes, the House and Senate meet separately to debate the issue. Both houses must vote to sustain the objection for it to matter, and the Democratic-led House is unlikely to go along with any objections to votes for Biden. Otherwise, the votes get counted as intended by the states.And then the next step is Inauguration Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-what-happens-when-the-electoral-college-meets/story-Ms9xqQu7FVjqun9IEWgKSO.html

The clampdown, which has ensnared top-ranking military officials as well as low-level bureaucrats, is widely dubbed as a “mini Ritz” operation, a reference to a 2017 swoop that saw princes and tycoons locked up in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel on graft charges.In dramatic gumshoe-style investigations published on state media, the official anti-corruption agency Nazaha says it has caught bribe-seekers “red-handed” in live raids and sniffed out illicit cash hidden in attics, an underground safe and even a mosque.The crackdown has led to dozens of arrests in recent months and sent confiscated cash to state coffers -- and has won praise from the public.Saudis have been offered a toll-free number to report any suspected cases of corruption.“The message (Saudi) rulers are sending to the corrupt is that ‘you won’t be going to the Ritz, you will be going to a real prison’,” a local official told AFP, declining to be named.“Anyone taking bribes and kickbacks now fears, ‘are we next?’“Underscoring the seriousness of the campaign, Nazaha reported in October the arrest of one of its own employees for corruption.Saudi Arabia, which ranks 51 out of 180 countries on Transparency International’s corruption index, has for decades faced endemic graft and the deeply ingrained social practice of “wasta”, or using influence and personal connections to get ahead.But the issue has gained a new spotlight since November 2017, when the opulent Ritz-Carlton became a gilded prison for dozens of elites swept up in a purge that critics labelled a shakedown and a power grab by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Following weeks of detention, wealthy princes and businessmen were released after agreeing significant financial settlements, with authorities saying they recovered more than $107 billion.- ‘One sheriff in town’ -The recent drive, targeting everyone from powerful defence chiefs to low-key municipal, health and environment officials, reinforces the iron reign of Prince Mohammed, the 35-year-old heir to the throne who already controls all major levers of power.As one observer in the kingdom put it, the drive emphasises that “there is only one sheriff in town”.Prince Mohammed told the advisory Shura Council last month that the anti-corruption campaign had yielded 247 billion riyals ($66 billion) over the last three years in addition to assets, real estate and stocks worth billions more.But the crackdown has raised concerns, with Human Rights Watch warning earlier this year of “unfair legal proceedings” in an opaque judicial system.There has also been hushed speculation over whether the clean-up was a cover to replenish state coffers amid a sharp economic downturn.One Saudi academic said he suspects the “real targets are not the corrupt, but fines and new sources of revenue”.There is no transparency, the academic told AFP, over how the government will utilise the seized cash and assets.Others have suggested that the campaign aims to weed out security officials not deemed loyal enough to the rulers.“While I imagine there are a few political opponents caught in the corruption net, the primary reasons for the crackdown are ending corruption, spurring development and raising badly needed funds,” David Rundell, former chief of mission at the US embassy in Riyadh, told AFP.“And it seems to be working. Many Saudi businessmen tell me that corruption has declined -- not gone away, but declined and become less socially acceptable,” he added.- ‘Undermine opponents’ -Local observers describe the drive as necessary shock therapy to steer the petro-state away from a decades-old culture of excess and poor accountability that it can ill-afford in an age of soft oil prices.The widespread “cancer” of corruption was “endangering development and prosperity”, depleting “five to 15 percent” of the annual state budget, Prince Mohammed told the Shura Council.But raising speculation that it was also a tool against political rivals, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius wrote in July that the kingdom was preparing “corruption and disloyalty charges” against deposed former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who has been detained since March.Saudi authorities have not publicly commented on the reasons for his detention.Further triggering shockwaves, joint forces commander Prince Fahad bin Turki -- a senior royal -- and his son Abdulaziz bin Fahad, the deputy emir of northern Al-Jouf region, were fired in late August and placed under investigation for corruption.Such moves illustrate an attempt by the Saudi establishment to “undermine possible opponents”, Capital Economics said in September.“The experience of the 2017 anti-corruption purge is that this could undermine renewed efforts to increase foreign investment in the kingdom,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-mini-ritz-corruption-crackdown-evokes-awe-fear/story-ObOO6oJfWuWKLzoyiCCNTI.html
14-12-2020||World||South Korea orders schools to shut as Covid-19 cases spike||South Korea ordered schools to close from Tuesday in the capital Seoul and surrounding areas as it battles its worst outbreak of novel coronavirus since the pandemic began, surpassing the previous peak in February.Schools in the capital region would move classes online until the end of the month, in the latest ratcheting up of social distancing measures which so far have failed to reverse the spike in infections.The school closure is a step towards the imposition of Phase 3 social distancing rules, a move that would essentially lock down Asia’s fourth-largest economy.Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said such a step required careful review, as the government comes under mounting pressure to do more to step the rise of infections.“The government will not hesitate to make the decision to upgrade to Phase 3 if it is considered necessary as it takes into account the opinions of related ministries, local governments, and experts,” he told a meeting of health officials according to a transcript from his office.The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) on Monday reported 718 new coronavirus cases, down from the record daily increase of 1,030 a day earlier. Of the new cases, 682 were locally transmitted, it said.Most of the new cases were in Seoul, the neighbouring port city of Incheon, and Gyeonggi Province, home to over 25 million people.South Korea’s total infections now stands at 43,484, with 587 deaths.The government launched a massive tracing effort involving hundreds of troops, police and officials to help track down virus carriers.Health authorities said a recent wave of infections mainly centre around gatherings with friends and families, which limits the effectiveness of social distancing rules. Drawn up from the reproduction rate, or the number of people who become infected from each positive case, the number of daily infections could rise up to 1,200, KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong told a briefing.“It is more than ever important to actively partake in social distancing and minimise the chances of contact,” said Jeong. “Please refrain from visiting crowded venues and cancel all gatherings with family and friends.”Some experts said the government and the public needed to do more.“This is the time to send an impactful message to the public, so that they can take voluntary actions,” said Kim Dong-hyun, president of Korean Society of Epidemiology and a professor at Hallym University College of Medicine.Under a Phase 3 lockdown, only essential workers would be allowed into offices and gatherings would be capped at less than 10 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-orders-schools-to-shut-as-covid-19-cases-spike/story-q9uxYRpoVcbkIoAhpK1n0H.html
14-12-2020||World||US agencies hacked in monthslong global cyberspying campaign||US government agencies were ordered to scour their networks for malware and disconnect potentially compromised servers after authorities learned that the Treasury and Commerce departments were hacked in a monthslong global cyber espionage campaign discovered when a prominent cybersecurity firm learned it had been breached.In a rare emergency directive issued late Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity arm warned of an “unacceptable risk” to the executive branch from a feared large-scale penetration of US government agencies that could date back to mid-year or earlier.“This can turn into one of the most impactful espionage campaigns on record,” said cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch.The hacked cybersecurity company, FireEye, would not say who it suspected — many experts believe the operation is Russian given the careful tradecraft — and noted that foreign governments and major corporations were also compromised.News of the hacks, first reported by Reuters, came less than a week after FireEye disclosed that nation-state hackers had broken into its network and stolen the company’s own hacking tools.The apparent conduit for the Treasury and Commerce Department hacks — and the FireEye compromise — is a hugely popular piece of server software called SolarWinds. It is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations globally, including most Fortune 500 companies and multiple US federal agencies that will now be scrambling to patch up their networks, said Alperovitch, the former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.The DHS directive — only the fifth since they were created in 2015 — said US agencies should immediately disconnect or power down any machines running the impacted SolarWinds software.FireEye, without naming any specific targets, said in a blog post that its investigation into the hack of its own network had identified “a global campaign” targeting governments and the private sector that, beginning in the spring, had slipped malware into a SolarWinds software update. Neither the company nor the US government publicly identified Russian state-backed hackers as responsible.The malware gave the hackers remote access to victims’ networks, and Alperovitch said SolarWinds grants “God-mode” access to a network, making everything visible.“We anticipate this will be a very large event when all the information comes to light,” said John Hultquist, director of threat analysis at FireEye. “The actor is operating stealthily, but we are certainly still finding targets that they manage to operate in.”On its website, SolarWinds says it has 300,000 customers worldwide, including all five branches of the US military, the Pentagon, the State Department, NASA, the National Security Agency, the Department of Justice and the White House. It says the 10 leading U.S. telecommunications companies and top five US accounting firms are also among customers.FireEye said it had confirmed infections in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, including in the health care and oil and gas industry — and had been informing affected customers around the world in the past few days. It’s customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.It said that malware that rode the SolarWinds update did not seed self-propagating malware — like the NotPetya malware blamed on Russia that caused more than $10 billion in damage globally — and that any actual infiltration of an infected organization required “meticulous planning and manual interaction.”That means it’s a good bet only a subset of infected organizations were being spied on by the hackers. Nation-states have their cyberespionage priorities, which include Covid-19 vaccine development.On Sunday, Russia’s US embassy described as “unfounded” in a post on its Facebook page the “attempts of the US media to blame Russia for hacker attackes on US governmental bodies.”The Treasury Department referred requests for comment to the National Security Council, whose spokesman, John Ullyot, said the government was “taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation.”The government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it was working with other agencies to help “identify and mitigate any potential compromises.” The FBI said it was engaged in a response but declined to comment further.President Donald Trump last month fired the director of CISA, Chris Krebs, after Krebs vouched for the integrity of the presidential election and disputed Trump’s claims of widespread electoral fraud.In a tweet Sunday, Krebs said “hacks of this type take exceptional tradecraft and time,” adding that he believed that its impact was only beginning to be understood.Federal agencies have long been attractive targets for foreign hackers looking to gain insight into American government personnel and policymaking.Hackers linked to Russia, for instance, were able to break into the State Department’s email system in 2014, infecting it so thoroughly that it had to be cut off from the internet while experts worked to eliminate the infestation. A year later, a hack at the US government’s personnel office blamed on China compromised the personal information of some 22 million current, former and prospective federal employees, including highly sensitive data such as background investigations.The intrusions disclosed Sunday included the Commerce Department’s agency responsible for internet and telecommunications policy. A spokesperson confirmed a “breach in one of our bureaus” and said “we have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate.”Austin, Texas-based SolarWinds confirmed Sunday a “potential vulnerability” related to updates released between March and June for software products called Orion that help monitor networks for problems.“We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state,” said SolarWinds CEO Kevin Thompson said in a statement. He said it was working with the FBI, FireEye and intelligence community.FireEye announced on Tuesday that it had been hacked, saying foreign state hackers with “world-class capabilities” broke into its network and stole tools it uses to probe the defenses of its thousands of customers. The hackers “primarily sought information related to certain government customers,” FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia said in a statement, without naming them.Former NSA hacker Jake Williams, the president of the cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec, said FireEye surely told the FBI and other federal partners how it had been hacked and they determined that Treasury had been similarly compromised.“I suspect that there’s a number of other (federal) agencies we’re going to hear from this week that have also been hit,” Williams added.FireEye responded to the Sony and Equifax data breaches and helped Saudi Arabia thwart an oil industry cyberattack — and has played a key role in identifying Russia as the protagonist in numerous aggressions in the burgeoning netherworld of global digital conflict.Mandia said there was no indication they got customer information from the company’s consulting or breach-response businesses or threat-intelligence data it collects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agencies-hacked-in-monthslong-global-cyberspying-campaign/story-0wZvid8hOmThecXG1JZP9K.html

14-12-2020||World||Italy considers new Covid-19 restrictions for holidays||Italy is considering more stringent nationwide coronavirus restrictions during the Christmas and New Year holidays as concerns rise over a possible spike in infections in January. After some restrictions put in place last month were eased, crowds of shoppers flocked to many city centres on Sunday, as Italy reported 484 coronavirus-related deaths. On Saturday, Italy surpassed Britain as the European country with the worst death toll.The government could decide to put the country under so-called “red-zone” lockdown rules from Dec. 24 to at least Jan. 2, extending night curfews, banning non-essential movement and closing shops, bars and restaurants on weekends and holidays, with the exception for those selling essential goods, Italian media reported. A decision is expected after a Monday morning meeting between Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, ministers and the scientific committee that has been advising the government since the beginning of the coronavirus emergency. It would follow a similar move by Germany, which on Sunday said it would close most shops from Wednesday until at least Jan. 10 after reporting 321 COVID-19 deaths and 20,200 new cases.“The crowds are unjustifiable, irrational, irresponsible,” Regional Affairs minister Francesco Boccia told Italian daily la Repubblica.He said “business and health are not reconcilable at the moment”, adding that he endorsed Germany’s decision. Earlier this month, the government had approved rules to avoid a surge in infections over Christmas and the New Year, banning midnight mass and halting movement between towns.. It decided that on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day, Italians will not be able to leave their towns and a current nighttime curfew would be extended until 7 a.m. on New Year’s.

This is to show you, especially seniors like me, that we believe the vaccines are safe,” Lee said in a national broadcast.Singapore has also signed advanced purchase agreements and made early down-payments on promising vaccine candidates including those being developed by Moderna and Sinovac, setting aside more than $1 billion for shots, authorities said.“We have acquired sufficient doses of the vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents,” the health ministry’s director of medical services, Kenneth Mak, later told a media briefing.The United States, Canada and a handful of other countries have approved the Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE vaccine, with a mass inoculation programme underway in Britain and one getting going in the United States.Lee also said Singapore would lift some anti-virus curbs from Dec. 28, including allowing groups of eight to congregate in public, up from a limit of five.“Our situation is now stable,” Lee said. “Now that vaccines are becoming available, we can see light at the end of the tunnel.”Singapore has reported only a handful of local cases of Covid-19 over the last two months.Of Singapore’s more than 58,000 cases, 29 people have died - one of the world’s lowest fatality rates. More than 70 million people have been infected with the virus worldwide with 1.61 million deaths, according to a Reuters tally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-approves-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-expects-first-shots-by-year-end/story-4UEyf6GwyngHgHOAavdTDN.html
14-12-2020||World||‘Pure propaganda’: German scientist rebuts Chinese media on Covid origin||A top German biochemist quoted by Chinese state media as saying that the coronavirus did not originate in Wuhan has called it “pure propaganda” and said there is no evidence to suggest that the virus did not come from the central Chinese city.Earlier this month, Chinese news outlets quoted Alexander Kekule, director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research in Halle, Germany, as saying that the virus originated in Italy.“The novel coronavirus running rampant around the world is not the Wuhan variant, but a variant that mutated in north Italy,” China’s national broadcaster quoted Kekule as saying in an interview on German television.“The starting point of the pandemic is not in Wuhan, ” official news agency Xinhua quoted him as saying. In an emailed interview with the Hindustan Times, Kekule strongly denied the version of his argument published in Chinese state media, saying his words were twisted out of context.“Chinese media are quoting from my recent bestseller book Der Corona-Kompass (The Corona Compass, available only in German so far) and from an interview I gave about the book in the popular German TV show Markus Lanz,” said Kekule, who also holds a chair as University Professor and Director of the Institute for Medical Microbiology at Martin Luther University in Halle.“The origin of the virus in China is described in detail in my book, and also the Chinese efforts to conceal the magnitude of the outbreak at the beginning. I never stated that the virus originally came from Italy, this is pure propaganda,” he added.The coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, 2019, before spreading across China, and triggering a global pandemic.China has denied that it deliberately hid information about the spreading virus in January or earlier.A year into the Coronavirus pandemic, China has effectively controlled the spread of Covid-19 within its borders, putting in place efficient lockdown and contract tracing measures and conducting mass testing for the virus for every small outbreak.At the same time, Beijing, in the face of global criticism, has been trying to change the virus-origin theory and shift the blame outside. Several theories are in circulation – the origin could be the Indian subcontinent including India and Bangladesh or Saudi Arabia, Italy, the US and the US military, or imported frozen packaged food.Kekule’s interview to a German channel was similarly picked up to fit into the narrative.By the time the German expert reacted, his interview had spread across Chinese social media, with many thanking him for clearing China’s name.“Unfortunately, they are taking one or two phrases out of context, giving my statement a made-up twist. Chinese state media are referring to my account of the outbreak in Northern Italy and my critique of the WHO and EU in this context,” Kekule said.“There is, however, no scientific basis to deny that the virus originally came from China… I explained (on the television show) that the virus came of course from China, but the “G” variant was able to prevail in northern Italy because the outbreak was not detected there for several weeks, paving the way to the pandemic around the globe, including re-imports to China.”Kekule explained that the “G variant” (carrying a D614G mutation in the S gene) of the virus emerged in northern Italy, possibly because the outbreak went undetected for several weeks there.“The G variant is most likely more contagious than the variant originally detected in Wuhan. This might be the reason why it spread world-wide from Italy. Since July 2020, more than 99% of the virus strains analysed worldwide are G variants, i.e. the viruses presently circulating have their common origin in Northern Italy.”The German scientist said that he went on the same television show to explain his position.“The same evening I spoke again on the TV show Markus Lanz and we made it crystal clear that I had been misquoted in an act of propaganda,” he said.“Science tells us, that humankind must change its behaviour towards nature, including the habit of killing wild animals that carry dangerous viruses,” he said.“When even nations refuse to take responsibility of their actions, how should individuals learn to change their dangerous habits?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-expert-denies-saying-covid-origin-not-in-wuhan-as-china-passes-the-buck/story-C97H1gRVT4VjBQ4CwLGTAK.html

We will only rest after it is brought to an end.”The next general elections in Pakistan are scheduled for 2023.This was the first time in the recent history of the country that the PML-N held a public meeting at Minar-i-Pakistan, the first rally at this venue for its Vice President Maryam.Similarly, it was Bilawal’s first appearance at a political gathering at Minar-i-Pakistan. His late mother, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, held a historic public meeting at Minar-i-Pakistan in 1986.After the sixth power show held in Lahore, PDM called a meeting of top party leaders to discuss strategy for the next rally that will be held in Larkana.According to a report by ARY News, the meeting would be attended by JUI-F chief, Maryam Nawaz, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, and other leaders.Anadolu News has reported that tens of thousands of opposition supporters rallied in Pakistan’s northeastern city of Lahore on Sunday, despite a government ban on public gatherings due to coronavirus.

14-12-2020||World||EU chief negotiator Barnier still sees hope to clinch Brexit trade deal||European Union chief negotiator Michel Barnier said Monday he still has the firm belief that a Brexit trade agreement is possible, and whittled the outstanding disputes to be settled ahead of the New Year to just two.Barnier said that the nine-month negotiations had come down to finding settlements on fair-competition rules and fishing rights, no longer mentioning the issue of legal mechanisms for resolving future disputes that also long dogged the negotiations.“Two conditions are not met yet,” he said as he entered a meeting to brief the 27 EU nations on progress in the talks. He is expected to continue negotiations with his UK counterpart David Frost later on Monday. “This deal, it is still possible,” he added.Both sides are teetering on the brink of a no-deal Brexit departure, but have committed to a final push ahead of Jan. 1, when a transitional period following Britain’s Jan. 31 departure from the bloc is to end.On Sunday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ditched a self-imposed deadline and promised to “go the extra mile” to clinch a post-Brexit trade agreement that would avert New Year’s chaos and costs for cross-border commerce.Barnier is willing to accept British trade with no tariffs or quotas, but only if they respect the rules and regulations that have made the EU’s single market of almost 500 million consumers so successful. “Free and fair competition, fair and free, equitable and open, the two go together,” Barnier said.Johnson, however, says he does not want British business to be hemmed in by EU restrictions, especially if those restrictions would have to be progressively adapted to mainland standards in the future.On fisheries, Barnier demanded “an agreement that guarantees a reciprocal, I insist, reciprocal access to markets and waters.” It highlighted that just as EU fishermen crave to continue working in British waters, the UK seafood industry is extremely dependent on exports into the 27-nation bloc.Johnson has made fisheries and UK control over its waters a key demand in the long saga of leaving the EU. It has been four-and-a-half years since Britons voted narrowly to leave the EU and — in the words of the Brexiteers’ slogan — “take back control” of the UK’s borders and laws.Johnson said over the weekend that the “most likely” outcome was that the two sides wouldn’t reach a deal and would trade on World Trade Organization terms, with the tariffs and barriers that would bring.Exporters and importers face customs declarations, goods checks and other obstacles. EU citizens will no longer be able to live and work in Britain without a visa — though that doesn’t apply to the more than 3 million already there — and Britons can no longer automatically work or retire in the EU.Without a deal, the disruption would be far greater. The UK government has acknowledged a chaotic exit is likely to bring gridlock at Britain’s ports, temporary shortages of some goods and price increases for staple foods. Tariffs will be applied to many UK goods, including 10 per cent on cars and more than 40 per cent on lamb, hurting the UK economy as it struggles to rebound from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-chief-negotiator-barnier-still-sees-hope-to-clinch-brexit-trade-deal/story-mLPMAHN9mUls5ovXg0BhBI.html

14-12-2020||World||Early in-person voting begins in Georgia Senate runoffs||What could be the main event in Georgia’s twin US Senate runoffs -- early in-person voting -- begins Monday. More than half of the record 5 million votes in the November 3 general election were cast during the two-week early voting period. Early in-person voting could be even more important in the January 5 runoffs because of the short time frame for voters to request and send back ballots by mail, as the two races decide which party will control the US Senate. “It’s very important,” Democrat Raphael Warnock, who is challenging Republican US Senator Kelly Loeffler in one of the races, said Friday after a speech to labor union canvassers. “It’s how we won in the general and it’s how we’re going to win in the runoff.” No one expects turnout to be as high in the Warnock-Loeffler contest or the race between US Senator David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. But Bernard Fraga, an Emory University professor who studies voting, said overall turnout could rise as high as four million. More than 125,000 people cast ballots in October on the first day of early in-person voting before the general election. Gabriel Sterling, election system implementation manager for the Georgia Secretary of State, said he expects a surge of people on Monday. Some Atlanta-area early voting sites in October and November saw people frequently lined up for hours. “As always, on the first day of early voting, it’s kind of like when the iPhone comes out,” Sterling said last week. “People want to go get the new iPhone at the Apple store. They’re going to stand in line for a while.” One question is how many mail-in ballots will be cast in the election. By Friday, 1.2 million mail-in ballots had been requested and 200,000 returned. In the general election, Democrat Joe Biden won 65 per cent of the 1.3 million absentee ballots that were returned, a record fueled by the coronavirus pandemic. More than 86,000 voters who did not vote in November had requested ballots as of Friday, according to statistics from Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who tracks voting. Fraga said it’s possible that mail-in ballots, if anything, will be even more favorable for Democrats in the runoff because of attacks on the integrity of mail-in voting by President Donald Trump and many Georgia Republicans. “I don’t think Republicans are going to be voting by mail even at as high of rates as they did in November,” Fraga said. That means early in-person voting, which Trump narrowly won in November, could be even more important for Republicans. Both parties may also drive voters toward the early polls with Christmas and New Year’s holidays looming before January 5. “Any compressed timeline means people will be less likely to vote by mail,” Fraga said. Each of Georgia’s 159 counties must offer at least one location for early voting during business hours, with many in metro Atlanta offering multiple locations, extended hours and weekend voting. Early voting will run as late as December 31 in some places. Preparation for early voting has been marred by squabbles over cuts to early polling places. Cobb County, once a suburban Republican stronghold trending Democratic, planned to cut early polling places from 11 to five. The county election manager said employees are exhausted and she didn’t have enough to staff more than that. After an outcry that closures would harm Black voters, the county will open two more locations and relocate a third. Heavily Republican Forsyth County is cutting early voting locations from 11 to five and cutting hours, rejecting on Tuesday an effort to expand sites and cuts. Elections Director Mandi Smith told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that fewer voters and a shorter ballot won’t require as many sites. Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta said the move will make lines longer and make voting harder for people who don’t speak English well. Forsyth Republicans applauded the move, saying on the party Facebook page that the county rejected the “Democrats scheme” for more sites. The GOP reasoned that even early in-person voting is prone to cheating, although it didn’t explain how, with voters required to appear in person with photo identification. “We fought to protect the integrity of our elections and not allow opportunities for more fraud,” the party wrote. Republican Hall County, with a large Latino population, is cutting early voting sites from eight to four. Democratic Douglas County will also have fewer voting sites. The Center for New Data, a nonprofit group, counted 42 early polling sites statewide scheduled to close for the runoff. In some cases, polling places are being relocated nearby. The center found voters at polling locations slated to close waited an average of 49 minutes before the general election, compared to an average of 43 minutes at locations staying open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-in-person-voting-begins-in-georgia-senate-runoffs/story-06YYOWPezFL9Myi7tzTaSL.html

14-12-2020||World||Indian-American TIME’s ‘Kid of the Year’ Gitanjali Rao focuses on effective Covid-19 vaccine distribution||Young Indian-American scientist Gitanjali Rao, TIME magazine’s first-ever ‘Kid of the Year’, has said she is brainstorming about solutions for the effective vaccine distribution to address a pressing challenge posed by the coronavirus, and has set her sights on preventing future pandemics. In an interview with PTI, the 15-year-old inventor said she was focussed on using technological tools to offer solutions for vaccine distribution, a challenge that confronts the world grappling with the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Rao was named by TIME magazine this month as the first-ever ‘Kid of the Year’ for her “astonishing work using technology to tackle issues ranging from contaminated drinking water to opioid addiction and cyberbullying”. She was selected among over 5,000 nominees for the honour. “I definitely do want to look at the pandemic. The next biggest problem we’re going to face is vaccine distribution and prioritisation. So I’m looking at my potential data and analytics approach towards that,” Rao said. “But I think the next biggest problem that I’ll probably look towards solving is preventing future pandemics from happening because I think it’s safe to assume that this isn’t the last one and we probably will have another one before 100 years,” she said. Rao says she is still at a “brainstorming and observing” phase but is looking at the whole idea of vaccine distribution and how widespread it needs to be. “Also, how important it is because everybody needs to receive this vaccine. So I’m looking at how we can use predictive analytics and data models in order to create a plan of how vaccine distribution will roll out,” she said. TIME had said in its profile that “exceptional leadership” is what made the “brilliant” Rao stand out for the honour. “Rao not only researches scientific tools such as artificial intelligence and carbon nanotube sensor technology and applies them to problems she sees in everyday life, like cyberbullying and water contamination. She also shows other kids how to tap into their curiosity, aspiring to create a generation of innovators,” it said. Rao said it was very “exciting” to be named Kid of the Year “but more than that it’s honoring and humbling to be that face of Generation Z as well as have the opportunity to be featured on the cover of TIME among so many other fantastic people. I’m so beyond humbled and I’m just excited to see where this keeps going”. The youngster, who through her work is an inspiration for many, counted her parents - Bharathi and Ram Rao - and the family as her “biggest inspirations”. Rao said she had always received an incredible amount of support from her parents. “If I wanted to play a certain sport, learn something new, I had all the resources in front of me,” she said. Rao recalled how her mother brought nearly a dozen books for her in third grade on clouds when she wanted to learn about the subject. “Experiences like that are what changed my life forever, having that support and being able to do what I love without any backlash,” she said. Rao said she was also “truly inspired” by scientists and inventors who go beyond themselves and innovate for positive change, particularly Jonas Salk, who invented the polio vaccine and never patented it. “He never claimed it as his own because he wanted it to be something that everyone could use, and I really aspire to be that selfless and put others before me,” Rao said. The young scientist, who has been featured in Forbes list of 30 Under 30 achievers, was named America’s Top Young Scientist and is a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) promoter, wants to see more young girls being given opportunities to study and work in the field. “I think another thing is just showing them role models in the field and I honestly aspire to be one of them,” she said, adding that when she was in second grade, she did not know females could be scientists. “I didn’t know it was possible because everybody I had seen in the media and learned about was a male. I was excited personally to learn that a girl could be a scientist which is almost problematic because I was able to learn about that but what if people didn’t have that inspiration, didn’t have that opportunity for growth. We just need to involve more girls in STEM by showing them that they can do it,” she said. Rao has also been working tirelessly on creating a community of innovators and has so far mentored thousands of students. She runs workshops for students from across the globe who want to become innovators and solve global problems. “Everyone comes out of that workshop with one solution and a process that they can take to implement it in the real world. If I can do it, you can do it and anyone can do it,” she says. Rao says she is interested in working on several things in the future and wants to look at genetic research with product design involved. “Hopefully whatever I’m doing, I’m changing the world for the better,” she said. For Rao, her own passion right now is working on solutions for the contamination of natural resources. “I’m looking at water contamination specifically and water parasitic contamination is the biggest problem that I’m seeing out there today. I really want to find a way to prevent that from happening,” she said, adding that she is using genetically engineered microbes to detect parasites in water. “I’m using living things to find living things which I think is a very interesting concept,” she said.

14-12-2020||World||Despite Trump’s claims Georgia voters ready for runoffs||Many Republican voters in Georgia are angry. They’re convinced that widespread voter fraud — claims that are baseless — cost President Donald Trump the election to Democrat Joe Biden.But will those concerns put them on the sidelines for runoff elections Jan. 5 that will determine party control of the US Senate? No way, said Trump supporter Lori Davis.“Everyone that I’m around, we’re ready to vote now,” said the 57-year-old businesswoman, as she awaited the arrival of Vice President Mike Pence at a rally for GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in Augusta on Thursday.Trump has relentlessly promoted false claims that the election was rigged against him and he has savaged Republican elected officials he perceives as standing in the way of his quest to subvert the results. Some Trump allies have gone as far as calling for voters to skip the Georgia runoffs altogether — alarming words for the GOP campaigns banking on a strong turnout.But interviews with voters and party activists in the state suggest there’s little sign that Trump’s voters are planning to stay home in protest. Most Republican voters interviewed said they were prepared to put their skepticism aside to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in their races against Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively.“There are people who are discouraged about (Trump) losing Georgia or being behind. But I haven’t talked to people who’ve said, ‘Oh, the heck with this, it’s all rigged anyway,’” said Tim Phillips, president of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, which has done canvassing of GOP-leaning voters.Phillips was among those who worried that the distrust could affect Republican enthusiasm. But he said his group’s weeks in the field, combined with a recent visit from Trump, have eased his worries.Trump’s December 5 campaign stop in Valdosta, Georgia, was his first since he lost the state to Biden by about 11,700 votes — a result that was confirmed by two recounts, including a hand tally of all ballots. But those recounts haven’t stopped the president from blasting Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.Kemp has rebuffed Trump’s call for a special session of the legislature to subvert the election results, while Raffensperger has repeatedly said there is no evidence of systemic fraud or irregularities in the November election.Trump and his allies have continued to push false claims of fraud. Trump turned up the heat on Kemp via Twitter early Monday, pushing him to take action on the requests for legislative action or hamper the reelection bids of incumbents Perdue and Loeffler.“What a fool Governor @BrianKempGA of Georgia is,” Trump tweeted. “Could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way. Demand this clown call a Special Session and open up signature verification, NOW. Otherwise, could be a bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th.” What a fool Governor @BrianKempGA of Georgia is. Could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way. Demand this clown call a Special Session and open up signature verification, NOW. Otherwise, could be a bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th.Sidney Powell, who was removed from Trump’s legal team last month, has teamed up with Georgia attorney Lin Wood, who is known for his representation of several high-profile clients, particularly in defamation cases. The lawyers have repeatedly encouraged Georgia Republicans not to vote in the runoff election and questioned whether Perdue and Loeffler have sufficiently backed Trump’s efforts.“Why would you go back and vote in another rigged election?” Wood said during a recent rally in a suburb north of Atlanta.Trump has asked his supporters to get out and vote. The “seats are the last line of defense to save America and protect all that we’ve accomplished,” he said at the recent Georgia event. During the rally, Trump weaved back and forth between pressing his own grievances about the election and encouraging the crowd to turn out for Perdue and Loeffler.“You know a lot of people, friends of mine, say ‘Let’s not vote. We’re not going to vote because we’re angry about the presidential election,’” Trump told the crowd.“But if you do that, the radical left wins,” he said.Phillips said he believes that message is getting through to the conservative base much more so than any isolated calls for boycotts or even the president’s broadsides against Kemp and Raffensperger.“These aren’t people taking their cues from CNN or conventional political media. They listen to the president directly. And they’re open to his message and our message of not letting (Democratic Senate leader) Chuck Schumer finish the job,” Phillips said.Republicans are depending on voters such as Terry McCreary, a 65-year-old retiree in Cherokee County. McCreary calls himself a “conservative independent,” but he’s voted almost exclusively for Republicans since casting presidential ballots for Democrat Bill Clinton in the 1990s.McCreary says he finds it “hard to believe” Biden won the election fair and square. McCreary cites several misleading and disproven theories that Trump and his allies have pushed in recent weeks.“It just doesn’t feel right,” he said from his home in the Atlanta suburbs.But none of that, McCreary said, will keep him from voting in the runoffs. “I’m concerned about the election on Jan. 5” being legitimate, he said. “But I always vote. Every time.”Perdue and Loeffler have tried to placate Trump and his supporters by backing a lawsuit from Texas that sought to overturn Biden’s win but was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday, and by calling for Raffensperger to resign, citing unspecified “mismanagement” in the election.Nonetheless, they’ve faced pushback from hardcore Trump supporters. As the pair strained to speak at Trump’s rally in Valdosta, cries of “Fight for Trump” filled the crowd, largely drowning out the senators.Jeanne Seaver, a Republican activist in Georgia who worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign, said she believes that Republican voters will still come out to support Perdue and Loeffler despite the anger on the ground.“I think if Donald Trump says get out and vote for Kelly and David, then the Trump folks are loyal to Donald Trump and will get out and vote,” Seaver said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-trump-s-claims-georgia-voters-ready-for-runoffs/story-QgIOMsKb4k9NEHjJ2Qnz1M.html
14-12-2020||World||Donald Trump cancels plan for early vaccination of White House staff||President Donald Trump said Sunday that he was reversing an administration directive to vaccinate top government officials against Covid-19, while public distribution of the shot is limited to front-line health workers and people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.Trump made the announcement hours after his administration confirmed that senior US officials, including some White House aides who work in close proximity to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, would be offered coronavirus vaccines as soon as this week under federal continuity of government plans.“People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary,” Trump said in a tweet. “I have asked that this adjustment be made. I am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time.”It was not immediately clear what the scale of the vaccination program was supposed to be, according to two people briefed on the matter, or what effect Trump’s tweet would have on the government’s efforts to protect top leadership.News that White House staff would receive the vaccine early drew criticism on social media. Trump and his aides have consistently flouted the Covid-19 guidelines issued by his own administration, including hosting large holiday parties with maskless attendees this December.Officials said earlier Sunday that doses of the newly approved vaccine from Pfizer would be made available to those who work in close quarters with the nation’s top leaders. They said the move was meant to prevent more Covid-19 spread in the White House and other critical facilities. Trump was hospitalized with the virus for three days in October.“Senior officials across all three branches of government will receive vaccinations pursuant to continuity of government protocols established in executive policy,” National Security Council spokesperson John Ulyot had said. “The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the United States government on the advice of public health professionals and national security leadership.”The two people briefed on the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The New York Times first reported that top US officials would get early access to the vaccine.The move to vaccinate top US officials would be consistent with the rollout of rapid testing machines for the coronavirus, which were similarly controlled by the federal government with kits reserved to protect the White House complex and other critical facilities.According to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is not yet enough information to determine whether those who have had Covid-19 should also get the vaccine.Pence has not come down with the virus, and his aides have been discussing when and how he should receive the vaccine as the administration looks to boost public confidence in the shot.The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses administered three weeks apart, meaning Trump administration officials would receive the final shot just weeks before leaving office.Aides to President-elect Joe Biden have been discussing when and how he should receive the vaccine and have been working to establish plans to boost virus safeguards in the West Wing to keep the 78-year-old Democrat healthy.According to a Capitol Hill official, lawmakers have not been informed how many doses would be made available to them, adding it would be premature to speculate who might receive them. The official was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-cancels-plan-for-early-vaccination-of-white-house-staff/story-Cro6xKItnPvrOk4z4F1kFP.html
14-12-2020||World||Joe Biden will follow Fauci’s guidance on when to take Covid vaccine: Report||President-elect Joe Biden will follow the guidance of Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious disease expert, about when to take a coronavirus vaccine and will have it administered in public, a transition official said Sunday as the Trump administration prepared to begin offering the vaccine to top officials.For months Biden has said he would heed Fauci’s advice about the safety of the vaccine and will continue to do so after he takes office in little more than a month. He’s asked Fauci to continue on in his role as head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and to also be his chief medical adviser.Biden said earlier this month that he would “be happy” to take the vaccine in public, just as former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have said they would.“When Dr. Fauci says we have a vaccine that is safe, that’s the moment in which I will stand before the public,” Biden said in an interview with CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-will-follow-fauci-s-guidance-on-when-to-take-covid-vaccine-report/story-6TUN5wNaCGWXH75ubvN6yI.html
14-12-2020||World||First batch of Pfizer coronavirus vaccines arrives in Canada||The first Covid-19 vaccines landed on Canadian soil on Sunday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, and some Canadians are expected to roll up their sleeves for a shot as soon as Monday. Canada and the United States are set this week to become the first Western nations after the UK to begin inoculations with the newly approved vaccine.“The first batch of doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine have arrived in Canada,” Trudeau said on Twitter on Sunday night above a picture of a cargo plane apparently used to transport the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech SE.The initial 30,000 doses will go to 14 sites across Canada. The most vulnerable people, including the elderly in long-term care facilities and healthcare workers, will be first in line for shots.The vaccines left Belgium, where they were produced, on Friday, and traveled to Germany and the United States before being split up and sent to different parts of Canada. “The intent here is to ensure that we continue to have regular drip feed of vaccines in the coming weeks,” with 249,000 doses expected by the end of the year, Major-General Dany Fortin, who is in charge of vaccine distribution, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp earlier in the day. While it is “good news” that the vaccine has arrived, Trudeau said: “Our fight against Covid-19 is not over.” Forecasting a rapid acceleration of the spread of the novel coronavirus during the second wave, Canada’s federal health authorities called on Friday for provinces to impose more health restrictions heading into the holidays.The country has had 460,743 confirmed Covid-19 cases, with 5,891 new infections reported on Sunday. On Friday, health officials said Canada could see 12,000 new cases a day by January.The highly contagious respiratory disease has claimed 13,431 lives in Canada, including 81 on Saturday.‘BRIDGE TO RECOVERY’“While we have a long way to go, this marks the beginning of our bridge to recovery,” Procurement Minister Anita Anand said on Twitter of the vaccine arrival.Canada is expected to approve a second vaccine from Moderna Inc “reasonably soon” and the country will be ready to accept shipments of it by the end of the week, Fortin said earlier.Supriya Sharma, senior medical adviser at Health Canada, said on the CBC the review of the Moderna vaccine was ongoing and that important data was expected later this week.She also outlined guidance about potential allergic reactions to the Pfizer shot after reports of two such incidents on the first day of vaccinations in Britain.On Saturday, Canada said anyone with vaccine allergies should not take the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.“If you have an allergy to a vaccine or this vaccine or any components of the vaccine, you should not get it,” Sharma said. “But if you have other allergies, you can go ahead and get vaccinated.” Health Canada will be monitoring people who are inoculated for adverse reactions or side effects, she said.Officials have said they expect to receive 6 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines before the end of March. Each vaccine requires two doses, given about three weeks apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-batch-of-pfizer-coronavirus-vaccines-arrives-in-canada/story-gEHXbvVcwczacvJjflZGRO.html
14-12-2020||World||Suspected Russian hackers spied on US Treasury emails||Hackers believed to be working for Russia have been monitoring internal email traffic at the US Treasury and Commerce departments, according to people familiar with the matter, adding they feared the hacks uncovered so far may be the tip of the iceberg.The hack is so serious it led to a National Security Council meeting at the White House on Saturday, said one of the people familiar with the matter. US officials have not said much publicly beyond the Commerce Department confirming there was a breach at one of its agencies and that they asked the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate.National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot added that they “are taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation.”The US government has not publicly identified who might be behind the hacking, but three of the people familiar with the investigation said Russia is currently believed to be responsible for the attack. Two of the people said that the breaches are connected to a broad campaign that also involved the recently disclosed hack on FireEye, a major US cybersecurity company with government and commercial contracts.The Russian foreign ministry did not immediately return a message seeking comment late Sunday. The cyber spies are believed to have gotten in by surreptitiously tampering with updates released by IT company SolarWinds, which serves government customers across the executive branch, the military, and the intelligence services, according to two people familiar with the matter. The trick - often referred to as a “supply chain attack” - works by hiding malicious code in the body of legitimate software updates provided to targets by third parties.In a statement released late Sunday, the Austin, Texas-based company said that updates to its monitoring software released between March and June of this year may have been subverted by what it described as a “highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state.” The company declined to offer any further detail, but the sheer diversity of SolarWind’s customer base has sparked concern within the US intelligence community that other government agencies may be at risk, according to four people briefed on the matter. SolarWinds says on its website that its customers include most of America’s Fortune 500 companies, the top 10 US telecommunications providers, all five branches of the US military, the State Department, the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Office of President of the United States.‘Huge cyber espionage campaign’The breach presents a major challenge to the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden as officials investigate what information was stolen and try to ascertain what it will be used for. It is not uncommon for large scale cyber investigations to take months or years to complete. “This is a much bigger story than one single agency,” said one of the people familiar with the matter. “This is a huge cyber espionage campaign targeting the US government and its interests.” Hackers broke into the NTIA’s office software, Microsoft’s Office 365. Staff emails at the agency were monitored by the hackers for months, sources said. A Microsoft spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did a spokesman for the Treasury Department.The hackers are “highly sophisticated” and have been able to trick the Microsoft platform’s authentication controls, according to a person familiar with the incident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak to the press. “This is a nation state,” said a different person briefed on the matter. The full scope of the breach is unclear. The investigation is still its early stages and involves a range of federal agencies, including the FBI, according to three of the people familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said they have been “working closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.”The FBI and US National Security Agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. There is some indication that the email compromise at NTIA dates back to this summer, although it was only recently discovered, according to a senior US official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspected-russian-hackers-spied-on-us-treasury-emails/story-yzw2lne8vP8Q5Ih8XA4aCK.html
14-12-2020||World||14 dead in migrant shipwreck between Venezuela and Trinidad||The Venezuelan government said Sunday it had found 14 bodies after a ship carrying migrants bound for Trinidad and Tobago was wrecked en route.The government said in a statement that 11 bodies were found by a Coast Guard patrol on Saturday afternoon, and “today, following up on the events that occurred, we found 3 dead, 2 adult males and 1 female on the beach.”The Trinidadian Coast Guard had said Saturday that Venezuelan authorities informed them that “11 bodies had been recovered that day in waters near the Venezuelan coastal town of Guiria,” in the northeastern state of Sucre.Preliminary information suggested that the boat left on December 6 with more than 20 people on board.Venezuelan opposition deputy Robert Alcala, who represents Sucre state, said that migrant departures to Trinidad often used precarious boats loaded with too much weight.The deputy said the boat was “allegedly detained in Trinidad and was returned to Venezuela,” as part of the island nation’s response to the arrival of Venezuelans fleeing their country’s economic crisis.Citing a police report, he said that the bodies were tied together supposedly to protect themselves from heavy waves and were in an advanced state of decomposition.The Trinidadian Coast Guard, however, said that it had not intercepted any boats from Guiria.Venezuela has been crippled by a political and economic crisis causing runaway inflation, long queues for petrol, shortages of water and gas, and power cuts.The UN estimates that more than five million Venezuelans have left their country since 2015 due to the crisis, some 25,000 of whom fled to Trinidad and Tobago.About 100 people have disappeared during the dangerous journey from Guiria to Trinidad between 2018 and 2019 alone.The island nation, with a population of 1.3 million, says it has facilitated the registration of 16,000 Venezuelans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-dead-in-migrant-shipwreck-between-venezuela-and-trinidad/story-6B2EtUVILfI5a4uXVkIrsL.html

14-12-2020||World||Joe Biden considering former USEPA chief Gina McCarthy for domestic climate czar: Reports||President-elect Joe Biden is considering appointing Gina McCarthy, who headed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under former President Barack Obama, as domestic “climate czar” in charge of coordinating climate policies across federal agencies, according to two people familiar with the plan. Biden is also now considering Michael Regan, an African American who runs North Carolina’s environmental agency, to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the two sources said.If appointed, Regan would be a surprise choice over one-time frontrunner Mary Nichols, who is retiring from the California Air Resources Board, as environmental justice activists and civil rights leaders push for more diversity at the incoming administration.The Biden transition team did respond to requests for comment. McCarthy, Regan and Nichols did not respond to requests for comment. Biden has made tackling climate change a pillar of his upcoming administration, seeking to restore the United States as a global leader on the issue while forcing all federal agencies to rethink their roles in tackling the problem. Biden, the former Democratic vice president under Obama, selected John Kerry to serve as his global climate czar, making him part of the U.S. national security team and tasking him with coordinating with other counties on the environment.If selected, McCarthy, who currently serves as the president of the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, a leading national environmental group, would serve as the domestic counterpart to Kerry.Former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm is also under consideration, the sources said.Biden is expected to make a slate of announcements later this week that will be heavily scrutinized by the nation’s environmental groups, the sources say, including his pick to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, domestic climate czar and the Interior Department. The sources stressed the choices have not been finalized and the situation remains fluid. Nichols was long considered a frontrunner for the EPA but her nomination now looks less likely as the president-elect seeks to diversify his Cabinet appointments, the sources said.Dozens of environmental justice groups in California recently wrote a letter to Biden opposing Nichols, saying she too often sided with the industry. In an interview with Reuters last week, Nichols defended herself against the criticism, calling it “disappointing” and saying she stands by her work and the people who carried it out.In recent days, Regan has emerged as a surprise leading candidate, according to three sources familiar with the process. Regan has run the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality since 2017 and has been part of the push to hold big companies like Duke Energy accountable for pollution. Under his leadership at the North Carolina agency, Duke Energy agreed to the largest coal ash cleanup in the United States in January.

Many experts suspect Russia is responsible for the attack against FireEye, a major cybersecurity player whose customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.The apparent conduit for the Treasury and Commerce Department hacks — and the FireEye compromise — is a hugely popular piece of server software called SolarWinds. It is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations globally, including most Fortune 500 companies and multiple US government agencies who will now be scrambling to patch up their networks, said Alperovitch, the former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.The attacks were disclosed less than a week after a National Security Agency advisory warned that Russian government hackers were exploiting vulnerabilities in a system used by the federal government, “allowing the actors access to protected data.”The US government did not publicly identify Russia as the culprit behind the hacks, first reported by Reuters, and said little about who might be responsible.National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot said in a statement that the government was “taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation.”The government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said separately that it has been working with other agencies “regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.”President Donald Trump last month fired the director of CISA, Chris Krebs, after Krebs vouched for the integrity of the presidential election and disputed Trump’s claims of widespread electoral fraud.In a tweet Sunday, Krebs said “hacks of this type take exceptional tradecraft and time” and raised the possibility that it had been underway for months.“This thing is still early, I suspect,” Krebs wrote.Federal government agencies have long been attractive targets for foreign hackers.Hackers linked to Russia were able to break into the State Department’s email system in 2014, infecting it so thoroughly that it had to be cut off from the internet while experts worked to eliminate the infestation.Reuters earlier reported that a group backed by a foreign government stole information from Treasury and a Commerce Department agency responsible for deciding internet and telecommunications policy.The Treasury Department deferred comment to the National Security Council. A Commerce Department spokesperson confirmed a “breach in one of our bureaus” and said “we have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate.” The FBI had no immediate comment.The Washington Post reported Sunday, citing three unnamed sources, that the two federal agencies and FireEye were all breached through the SolarWinds network management system.Austin, Texas-based SolarWinds confirmed Sunday in an email to The Associated Press that it has a “potential vulnerability” related to updates released earlier this year to its Orion products, which help organizations monitor their online networks for problems or outages.“We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state,” said SolarWinds CEO Kevin Thompson in a statement.The comprise is critical because SolarWinds would give a hacker “God-mode” access to the network, making everything visible, said Alperovitch.Last Tuesday, FireEye said that foreign government hackers with “world-class capabilities” broke into its network and stole offensive tools it uses to probe the defenses of its thousands of customers. Those customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.The hackers “primarily sought information related to certain government customers,” FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia said in a statement, without naming them. He said there was no indication they got customer information from the company’s consulting or breach-response businesses or threat-intelligence data it collects.Former NSA hacker Jake Williams said it seemed clear that both the Treasury Department and FireEye were hacked using the same vulnerability.“The timing of the release here is, I think, not at all a coincidence,” said Williams, the president of the cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec.He said FireEye surely told the FBI and other federal partners how it had been hacked and they determined that Treasury had been similarly compromised.“I suspect that there’s a number of other (federal) agencies we’re going to hear from this week that have also been hit,” Williams added.FireEye responded to the Sony and Equifax data breaches and helped Saudi Arabia thwart an oil industry cyberattack — and has played a key role in identifying Russia as the protagonist in numerous aggressions in the burgeoning netherworld of global digital conflict.Neither Mandia nor a FireEye spokesperson said when the company detected the hack or who might be responsible. But many in the cybersecurity community suspect Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-agencies-hacked-russia-a-possible-culprit/story-wo2zKqzVsilRCnQXcnOePM.html

14-12-2020||World||Pfizer may offer shots to trial volunteers who received placebo||Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE may soon allow participants in its Covid-19 vaccine trial to learn whether they received a placebo, rather than the real thing, and get the actual shot if they wish.“Pending required approvals, Pfizer and BioNTech plan to provide an option for clinical trial participants who received the placebo to get the vaccine at scheduled time points in the study,” Pfizer said in an emailed statement. “This option will be voluntary and implemented in alignment with the regulatory authorities where the trial is being conducted.”The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which oversees human trials of new drugs and vaccines, didn’t immediately comment.Regulators and ethicists have debated for months over whether to keep participants blind to what they received or to give all trial volunteers the vaccine, which was found to protect people against the deadly virus. Placebo groups are important for comparisons, and giving everyone in the trial the vaccine may reduce the possibility of identifying long-term side effects.John Vanchiere, who leads a trial site at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, said he plans to email the 245 people who participated in the trial through the center to give them instructions pending a final decision on unblinding the trial.Allowing participants who received a placebo to now take the vaccine itself might also hold implications for other vaccine developers, including Moderna Inc., which could receive emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 experimental vaccine as soon as this week.A go-ahead may allow some 19,000 people who received placebos to get Pfizer’s shot, which is in short supply. Pfizer’s emergency use application provided data from 37,586 volunteers, the majority of whom were in the US, according to the FDA. Of those, 18,785 people received a saline placebo.Vanchiere said he has vials of Pfizer’s vaccine stored in an ultra-cold freezer and could start administering the shots as soon as Monday, the same day the vaccine is expected to start being offered to health-care workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-may-offer-shots-to-trial-volunteers-who-received-placebo/story-QEvzW6JGEr08qyWiIyh5RO.html
14-12-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine shipments begin in historic US effort||The first of many freezer-packed Covid-19 vaccine vials made their way to distribution sites across the United States on Sunday, as the nation’s pandemic deaths approached the horrifying new milestone of 300,000.The rollout of the Pfizer vaccine, the first to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ushers in the biggest vaccination effort in US history — one that health officials hope the American public will embrace, even as some have voiced initial skepticism or worry. Shots are expected to be given to health care workers and nursing home residents beginning Monday.Quick transport is key for the vaccine, especially since this one must be stored at extremely low temperatures — about 94 degrees below zero. Early Sunday, workers at Pfizer — dressed in fluorescent yellow clothing, hard hats and gloves — wasted no time as they packed vials into boxes. They scanned the packages and then placed them into freezer cases with dry ice. The vaccines were then taken from Pfizer’s Portage, Michigan, facility to Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids, where the first cargo plane took off amid what airport officials called a “jubilant” mood.Also Read | How Britain approved Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine before US and EU“This is a historic day,” said Richard W. Smith, who oversees operations in the Americas for FedEx Express, which is delivering 630-some packages of vaccine to distribution sites across the country. United Parcel Service (UPS) also is transporting a share of the vaccine.Helping with the transport of the vaccine has special meaning to Bruce Smith, a FedEx package handler at the Grand Rapids airport, whose older sister, Queen, died after she contracted the coronavirus in May. She was hospitalized in Georgia one day after he saw her on a video chat, and they never spoke again.“I think she would be ecstatic to know that something that has ravaged our family — that a family member is going to be part of such a big project,” said Smith, 58, whose nephew, Queen’s son, also got sick and is still undergoing therapy for stroke-like symptoms. “It is very, very important.”Tracked with GPS-enabled sensors, the initial shipments were expected to contain about 3 million doses, with many more to come. Federal officials say the first shipments of Pfizer’s vaccine will be staggered, arriving in 145 distribution centers Monday, with another 425 sites getting shipments Tuesday, and the remaining 66 on Wednesday. Doses of the vaccine, co-developed by German partner BioNTech, are given out based on each state’s adult population. Then the states decide where they go first.In California, where health care workers will be among the first to be vaccinated, state health officials are prioritizing hospitals that have adequate storage capacity, serve high-risk populations and have the ability to vaccinate people quickly.Initial surveys have found that even some health care workers don’t want to be first in line. Dr. Graham Snyder, who’s led the vaccine task force at Pennsylvania health care giant UPMC, estimates that about half of its employees are willing to get the vaccine as soon as it’s offered.But many health officials expect enthusiasm to grow.“There’s that thought that maybe they don’t have to be so afraid to come to work if they can be vaccinated and be immune,” said Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, medical director of hospital quality at the 40-hospital Oschner Health System in Louisiana and Mississippi. Employees approved for the first round are getting texts and emails directing them to schedule their initial injection, she said. Enough vaccine is being saved so that each person who gets the first dose of vaccine can get a second required shot a few weeks later.Senior US government officials, including some White House officials who work in close proximity to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, are among those who will be offered coronavirus vaccines as soon as this week, two people familiar with the matter confirmed.A survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about half of Americans want to get the vaccine as soon as possible. Another quarter aren’t sure, while the remaining quarter say they aren’t interested. Some simply oppose vaccines in general. Others are concerned that the vaccines have been rushed and want to see how the rollout goes.Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the FDA, which approved the Pfizer vaccine Friday, has repeatedly insisted that the agency’s decision was based on science, not politics, despite a White House threat to fire him if the vaccine wasn’t approved before Saturday.Speaking to Fox News Sunday, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief science adviser to Operation Warp Speed, a US effort to get vaccines developed quickly, also said he is “very concerned” about the skepticism about the vaccine in some circles.“Unfortunately ... there’s been a confusion between how thorough and scientific and factual the work that has been done is, and the perception that people are thinking that we cut corners ...,” Slaoui said. “I can guarantee you that no such things have happened, that we follow the science.”He called the development of vaccines from several pharmaceutical companies, including Moderna and AstraZeneca, “a remarkable achievement of science, academia, the industry ecosystem and the US government, working together.”While the vaccine was determined to be safe, regulators in the UK are investigating several severe allergic reactions. The FDA’s instructions tell providers not to give it to those with a known history of severe allergic reactions to any of its ingredients.The Moderna vaccine will be reviewed by an expert panel Thursday and soon afterward could be allowed for public use..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-shipments-begin-in-historic-us-effort/story-QgZvlON4lllzD1764MPaAJ.html
14-12-2020||World||Former aide accuses New York Governor Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment||Lindsey Boylan, a former aide of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, has accused him of sexually harassing her for years.In a series of tweets, Lindsey Boylan said, “Yes, @NYGovCuomo sexually harassed me for years. Many saw it, and watched. I could never anticipate what to expect: would I be grilled on my work (which was very good) or harassed about my looks. Or would it be both in the same conversation? This was the way for years.”“I am angry to be put in this situation at all. That because I am a woman, I can work hard my whole life to better myself and help others and yet still fall victim as countless women over generations have. Mostly silently. I hate that some men, like @NYGovCuomo abuse their power,” she said in another tweet.Boylan worked for Empire State Development, the state’s economic development public-benefit organisation, until March 2018, when she became deputy secretary for economic development and special adviser to Cuomo, Fox News said.She further said that her first encounter with workplace sexual harassment was during her mother’s first real job after graduating from college.“When my mom got her first real office job after graduating from college when I was in high school. She was so excited to be taken “seriously.” Her bossed isolated her and kissed her. She never had that type of job again. It was then how I learned how hard it is for women. How hard this world can be for us when we are trying to be taken seriously and help our community. How easily jerks can destroy the lives of women,” Boylan said.“And I promised myself I would never let those kinds of guys win. I would work hard my whole life to put myself in positions of power to change things. To end the violence and corruption. Give voice to the voiceless. I am not stopping. I refuse. I will never give up,” she further said. (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

14-12-2020||World||Don’t want to talk about that: Trump on attending Biden’s inauguration ceremony||US President Donald Trump has refused to comment on whether he will be skipping his successor Joe Biden’s inauguration ceremony in January.Citing an interview with “Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade aired on Sunday on Fox News, The Hill quoted the President as saying, “I don’t want to talk about that.”Instead, Trump went on saying, “I want to talk about this that we have done a great job. I got more votes than any president in the history of our country. In the history of our country, right? Not even close -- 75 million far more than Obama, far more than anybody. And they say we lost an election. We did not lose. If I got 10 million fewer votes, they say I could not have lost.”Speaking on the situation that would arise if he does not concede by the time of Joe Biden’s inauguration, Trump said, “I worry about the country having an illegitimate president. That’s what I worry about.”“A president that lost and lost badly. This was not like a close election. You look at Georgia. We won Georgia big. We won Pennsylvania big. We won Wisconsin big. We won it big,” he added.On Friday, the US Supreme Court had rejected a bid by Texas’ attorney general to block the ballot of voters in battleground states that favoured President-elect Joe Biden.According to a CNN report, the court’s move to dismiss the challenge is the strongest indication yet that Trump has no chance of overturning election results in court that even the justices whom he placed there have no interest in allowing his desperate legal bids to continue.This comes as the US President continues to repeatedly question the legitimacy of Biden’s win, accusing fraud and impropriety in the elections, and seeking recounts in several states, despite election officials in battleground states having already certified the President-elect’s victory in the presidential polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-want-to-talk-about-that-trump-on-attending-biden-s-inauguration-ceremony/story-aHuN7IPYGNetpsUaZOf6XK.html

The study was based on data from 165 countries.Also Read: How chronic air pollution may trigger more Covid deaths in the country“Working in a healthcare facility without water, sanitation and hygiene is akin to sending nurses and doctors to work without personal protective equipment,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.These elements “are fundamental to stopping Covid-19. But there are still major gaps to overcome, particularly in least developed countries.” According to WHO figures, while health professionals make up less than three percent of the population, they account for 14 percent of Covid-19 cases recorded around the world.“Sending healthcare workers and people in need of treatment to facilities without clean water, safe toilets or even soap puts their lives at risk,” said UNICEF chief Henrietta Fore.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe report also found that one in three health facilities around the world could not guarantee hand hygiene, while one in 10 did not have access to sanitation services.The figures are even worse for the world’s 47 least-developed countries (LDCs), where half of healthcare centres have no access to drinking water, a quarter have no access to water for hygiene purposes, and three in five lack basic sanitation services.The WHO and UNICEF calculated that it would cost around $1 per inhabitant to provide basic water services in these countries’ health centres -- and 20 cents each to maintain such facilities each year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-centre-water-crisis-increasing-covid-19-risk-who/story-CVe6AEwpdDTxP6BqoX5NXL.html

New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea later told reporters the gunman had died.The shooting occurred outside the landmark cathedral for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, located at Amsterdam Avenue and West 112th Street, about 15 minutes after the conclusion of an outdoor choir performance on the church steps drew an audience of about 200 people.The choir’s annual Christmas holiday concert had been moved outside in keeping with Covid-19 health safety rules. Only about 15 people were still present when the gunman appeared at the top of the steps, screaming, “Kill me,” and “shoot me,” as he fired a handgun, sending bystanders running for cover in panic, according to a Reuters photographer who was on the scene.Police officers who had taken cover ordered the suspect several times to drop his weapon before shooting him, the photographer said. Members of the choir were already back inside the church by the time of the shooting, which lasted several minutes, she said.Reuters photographs of the gunman showed him wearing a black winter coat, a white baseball-style cap and a face mask emblazoned with the flag of the Dominican Republic, as he stood wielding two pistols, one in each hand. He also was carrying a large backpack strapped to his shoulders. Police said officers recovered two firearms from the scene after the shooting.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter that “quick action of our NYPD officers kept the crowd safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunman-open-fires-at-new-york-church-after-outdoor-concert-shot-and-killed-by-police/story-YMytQTJ7ncqLOklCghvwjL.html
14-12-2020||World||Covid-19: White House, other top officials to get early vaccine access||Senior US government officials, including some White House officials who work in close proximity to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, will be offered coronavirus vaccines as soon as this week, while its public distribution is limited to front-line health workers and people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.Doses of the newly approved vaccine from Pfizer will be made available to those who work in close quarters with the nation’s top leaders, two people familiar with the matter confirmed. They said the move was meant to prevent more Covid-19 spread in the White House, which has already suffered from several outbreaks of the virus that infected Trump and other top officials, and other critical facilities.It was not immediately clear how many officials would be offered the vaccine initially and whether Trump or Pence would get it.The Trump administration is undertaking the vaccination program under federal continuity of government plans, officials said.“Senior officials across all three branches of government will receive vaccinations pursuant to continuity of government protocols established in executive policy,” said National Security Council spokesperson John Ulyot. “The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the United States government on the advice of public health professionals and national security leadership.”The two people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The New York Times first reported the news.The move to vaccinate top US officials would be consistent with the rollout of rapid testing machines for the coronavirus, which were similarly controlled by the federal government with kits reserved to protect the White House complex and other critical facilities.According to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is not yet enough information to determine whether those who have had Covid-19 should also get the vaccine. Pence has not come down with the virus, and his aides have been discussing when and how he should receive the vaccine as the administration looks to boost public confidence in the shot.The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses administered three weeks apart, meaning Trump administration officials would receive the final shot just weeks before leaving office.The Trump administration’s vaccination plan could prove to be a boon for his successor, as aides to President-elect Joe Biden have been discussing when and how he should receive the vaccine and working to establish plans to boost virus safeguards in the West Wing to keep the 78-year-old Democrat healthy.According to a Capitol Hill official, lawmakers have not been informed how many doses would be made available to them, adding it would be premature to speculate who might receive them. The official was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-white-house-other-top-officials-to-get-early-vaccine-access/story-8sm6WSfQtqmmUZ1uLuVejL.html
14-12-2020||World||Novelist John le Carre, who defined Cold War era, passes away||David Cornwell, better known as John le Carre, whose brief career in British intelligence gave him inputs for a literary career spanning nearly 60 years and 25 books, has died after a short illness aged 89, prompting a flood of tributes across the globe.Among his most popular works are The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, which were among many of his works adapted into films and television series. He worked for the British intelligence services in the 1950s and 1960s during the Cold War.Jonny Geller, his agent, said: “For six decades, John le Carré dominated the bestseller lists and review pages with his monumental body of work. His dramatic launch onto the global scene began with the publication of his third novel in 1963, ‘The Spy Who Came in from the Cold’, and the public revelation of his secret life working with the British Intelligence Services”.“Devoting his life to writing, he went on to define the Cold War era with the help of his character, George Smiley, and through his complex plots and beautiful prose, beamed a harsh light at the injustices of our world”, he added.Writer Margaret Atwood said the “Smiley novels are key to understanding the mid-20th century”, while Brazilian author Paul Coelho tweeted: “John le Carre, you were not only a great writer, but a visionary. Enjoy your new home #Rip”.Based in Truro, Cornwall, John le Carre was named as a finalist of the 2011 Man Booker International prize, but he said in a statement issued through his publishers: “(I) do not compete for literary prizes and have therefore asked for my name to be withdrawn.”In a rare media interview, the author, described by several writers as a “literary giant”, expressed his criticism of Brexit and the politics of Prime Minister Boris Johnson while talking to The Guardian in October 2019.He said: “I think Brexit is totally irrational, that it’s evidence of dismal statesmanship on our part, and lousy diplomatic performances. Things that were wrong with Europe could be changed from inside Europe.”“I think my own ties to England were hugely loosened over the last few years. And it’s a kind of liberation, if a sad kind...Mob orators of the sort we have, the Boris Johnson sort, do not speak reason. When you get into that category, your task is to fire up the people with nostalgia, with anger”.Geller, his agent, also shared a short statement on behalf of the family: “It is with great sadness that we must confirm that David Cornwell – John le Carré – passed away from pneumonia last Saturday night after a short battle with the illness”.“David is survived by his beloved wife of almost fifty years, Jane, and his sons Nicholas, Timothy, Stephen and Simon. We all grieve deeply his passing. Our thanks go to the wonderful NHS team at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro for the care and compassion that he was shown throughout his stay. We know they share our sadness”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novelist-john-le-carre-who-defined-cold-war-era-passes-away/story-mD1nds1LXFylFFdXqVNTKI.html
