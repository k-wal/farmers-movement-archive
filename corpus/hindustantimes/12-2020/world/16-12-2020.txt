During the proceedings, France was struck by new attacks, a wave of coronavirus infections among the defendants, and devastating testimony bearing witness to bloodshed that continues to shake France.All three attackers died in police raids. The widow, Hayat Boumeddiene, fled to Syria and is believed to still be alive. The two men who spirited her out of France, who were also tried in absentia, are thought to be dead, although one received a sentence of life in prison just in case.Eleven others were present and all were convicted of the crime, with sentences ranging from 30 years for Ali Riza Polat, described as the lieutenant of the virulently anti-Semitic market attacker, Amédy Coulibaly, to four years with a simple criminal conviction.The Jan. 7-9, 2015 attacks in Paris left 17 dead along with the three gunmen. The 11 on trial in a specially formed terrorism court, all men, formed a loose circle of friends and criminal acquaintances who claimed any facilitating they may have done was unwitting or for more run-of-the mill crime like armed robbery.One gambled day and night during the three-day period, learning what had happened only after emerging blearily from the casino. Another was a pot-smoking ambulance driver. A third was a childhood friend of the market attacker, who got beaten to a pulp by the latter over a debt.It was the coronavirus infection of Polat, who arranged the weapons and vehicle purchases, that forced the suspension of the trial for a month. Polat’s profane outbursts and insults drew rebukes from the chief judge. A handwriting expert testified it was Polat who scrawled a price list of arms and munitions.In all, investigators sifted through 37 million bits of phone data, according to video testimony by judicial police. Among the men cuffed behind the courtroom’s enclosed stands, flanked by masked and armed officers, were several who had exchanged dozens of texts or calls with Coulibaly in the days leading up to the attack.Also testifying were the widows of Chérif and Saïd Kouachi, the brothers who stormed Charlie Hebdo’s offices on Jan. 7, 2015, decimating the newspaper’s editorial staff in what they said was an act of vengeance for its publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad years before. The offices had been firebombed before and were unmarked, and editors had round-the-clock protection. But it wasn’t enough.In all, 12 people died that day. The first was Frédéric Boisseau, who worked in maintenance. Then the Kouachis seized Corinne Rey, a cartoonist who had gone down to smoke, and forced her upstairs to punch in the door code. She watched in horror as they opened fire on the editorial meeting.“I was not killed, but what happened to me was absolutely chilling and I will live with it until my life is over,” she testified.The next day, Coulibaly shot and killed a young policewoman after failing to attack a Jewish community center in the suburb of Montrouge. By then, the Kouachis were on the run and France was paralyzed with fear.Authorities didn’t link the shooting to the massacre at Charlie Hebdo immediately. They were closing in on the fugitive brothers when the first alerts came of a gunman inside a kosher supermarket. It was a wintry Friday afternoon, and customers were rushing to finish their shopping before the Sabbath when Coulibaly entered, carrying an assault rifle, pistols and explosives. With a GoPro camera fixed to his torso, he methodically fired on an employee and a customer, then killed a second customer before ordering a cashier to close the store’s metal blinds, images shown to a hushed courtroom.The first victim, Yohan Cohen, lay dying on the ground and Coulibaly turned to some 20 hostages and asked if he should “finish him off.” Despite their pleas, Coulibaly fired a killing shot, according to testimony from cashier Zarie Sibony.“You are Jews and French, the two things I hate the most,” Coulibaly told them.Some 40 kilometers (25 miles) away, the Kouachi brothers were cornered in a printing shop with their own hostages. Ultimately, all three attackers died in near-simultaneous police raids. It was the first attack in Europe claimed by the Islamic State group, which struck Paris again later that year to even deadlier effect.Prosecutors said the Kouachis essentially self-financed their attack, while Coulibaly and his wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, took out fraudulent loans. Boumeddiene, the only woman on trial, fled to Syria days before the attack and appeared in Islamic State propaganda.One witness, the French widow of an Islamic State emir, testified from prison that she’d run across Boumeddiene late last year at a camp in Syria and Boumeddiene’s foster sisters said they believed she was still alive. Testifying as a free man after a brief prison term, for reasons both defense attorneys and victims described as baffling, was the far-right sympathizer turned police informant who actually sold the weapons to Coulibaly.Three weeks into the trial, on Sept. 25, a Pakistani man steeped in radical Islam and armed with a butcher’s knife attacked two people outside the former Charlie Hebdo offices on Nicolas-Appert street long since vacated by the publication.Six weeks into the trial, on Oct. 16, a French schoolteacher who opened a debate on free speech by showing students the Muhammad caricatures was beheaded by an 18-year-old Chechen refugee.Eight weeks into the trial, on Oct. 30, a young Tunisian armed with a knife and carrying a copy of the Quran attacked worshippers in a church in the southern city of Nice, killing three. He had a photo of the Chechen on his phone and an audio message describing France as a “country of unbelievers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-people-convicted-of-terrorism-charges-for-charlie-hebdo-kosher-market-attacks-in-france/story-cHYiOL17PSmqQFvowTbafJ.html

The reference was to President-elect Joe Biden taking over from President Donald Trump in the days to come.“We’re not that far away from a deal like that,” said Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative of the outgoing Trump administration. “We have a political change going on over here and that’s going to be a bit of a setback, certainly to the extent that I can facilitate that I’d be happy to do it, but there’s going to be some change and my guess is that’s going to slow things up.”That, in other words, was the possible end of the Trump administration’s efforts to get a smaller, interim trade deal with India to set up a larger and more ambitious Free Trade Agreement (FTA) at a later stage. Lighthizer put the prospects of that larger deal in perspective with characteristic bluntness, saying, “In terms of a major deal, the kind of deal that I know that your minister and our bosses would like, at least in concept - my guess is that’s going to take a while, my guess is, that’s not going to be happen anytime soon.”Lighthizer was participating in a Confederation of Indian Industry’s (CII) annual summit, held virtually this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic.India and the US have long-running trade differences, persisting across administrations in both countries. The Trump administration forced the pace of ongoing talks by ending special trade benefits for India in the summer of 2019. Talks had since then been under way to find a resolution - a smaller, interim deal addressing immediate concerns to be followed up by a larger trade deal at a later stage.The interim trade deal - that was referred to by Lighthizer on Wednesday as the small deal - was to reinstate India’s terminated trade benefits of duty-free exports to the US under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) in return for greater access for American companies to certain Indian markets and some concessions.The two sides had wanted to have a deal ready to be signed and announced during Trump’s visit to India in February, but outstanding differences stayed in the way. Lighthizer, known to be a tough negotiator, had cancelled a visit to India ahead of the president’s trip in a clear sign that the talks were stalemated.Still publicly optimistic of a deal - which was described as “just a few phone-calls away” at one stage - the two sides had then said they will sign an interim agreement at a later time, either before or immediately after the November 3 election. But, as Lighthizer indicated, it’s over to the Biden administration now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-trade-negotiator-gives-up-on-trade-deal-with-india/story-S4Rp69tDbvoYmDraAKUQyM.html

16-12-2020||World||US President Donald Trump asking about special prosecutor for Hunter Biden case||President Donald Trump is considering pushing to have a special counsel appointed to advance a federal tax investigation into the son of President-elect Joe Biden, setting up a potential showdown with incoming acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen.Trump — angry that out-going Attorney General William Barr didn’t publicly announce the ongoing, two-year investigation into Hunter Biden — has consulted on the matter with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and outside allies.That’s according to several Trump administration officials and Republicans close to the White House who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss private matters.Beyond appointing a special prosecutor to investigate the younger Biden, the sources said Trump is interested in having another special counsel appointed to look into his own baseless claims of election fraud. But if he’s expecting his newly named acting attorney general to go further than Barr on either matter, he could end up quickly disappointed.Trump announced on Monday that Barr will resign effective next week, revealing the plans about a week after Hunter Biden publicly disclosed that he was under investigation related to his finances. It is generally Justice Department policy not to disclose investigations that are in progress, though the subjects of those investigations can.Rosen, the deputy attorney general, will step into the Justice Department’s top job in an acting role. A longtime litigator, he has served as Barr’s top deputy since May 2019 but largely shies away from the spotlight. He said in a statement Tuesday he was “honored” to serve and “will continue to focus on the implementation of the Department’s key priorities.”Details of the special counsel were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Trump is still weighing his options, considering whether to pressure Rosen to make the special counsel appointment or, if needed, to replace the acting attorney general with someone more likely to carry out his wishes. He has even asked his team of lawyers, including personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, to look into whether the president has the power to appoint a special counsel himself.A key question will be whether Rosen can stand up to presidential pressure — and potentially withering attacks — in the waning weeks of the Trump administration. If not, Rosen could be cast aside in favor of others more willing to do Trump’s bidding.Believing that a special counsel probe could wound a Biden administration before it even begins, Trump aides have urged the president to push for one, which would make it so the investigation can’t be easily stopped by the incoming president. No firm decision has been made.Trump announced that Barr would be stepping down from his position on Dec. 23, amid lingering tension between the president and the attorney general over the Hunter Biden investigation. Trump was angry for days after learning that Barr knew of the Hunter Biden tax investigation before the election but did not disclose it.He also was unhappy that Barr said in a widely reported interview with the AP that the Justice Department had not uncovered widespread election fraud that would have affected the results of the election.For much of his tenure, Barr was perceived as one of the president’s most loyal Cabinet members, especially after he framed the results of Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation in a manner favorable to Trump even though the special counsel did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. It was Barr who first appointed a US attorney to review the case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn and then sought to dismiss the criminal charges against Flynn, who twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.As Barr exits, the biggest thing by far hanging over the Trump Justice Department is its investigation into Hunter Biden, which involves multiple US attorney offices and FBI field offices. Appointing a special counsel could prove to be complicated, requiring consolidating different investigatory angles and bringing in someone new to run the probe and get up to speed.Under federal regulations, a special counsel can be fired only by the attorney general and for specific reasons such as misconduct, dereliction of duty or conflict of interest -- reasons that must be spelled out in writing. Appointing a special counsel for the Hunter Biden probe would also signal a more prolonged and complicated investigation than the current inquiry, so far largely centered on his taxes. A subpoena seeking documents from the younger Biden asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma.Either way, the probe is complicating Joe Biden’s pick for attorney general, upon whose shoulders this probe would land. Any nominee for attorney general is likely to face a mountain of questions at a confirmation hearing about how they would oversee the probe.It could be that Rosen is left in the position for a few weeks after Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. If Trump doesn’t fire him, that is.Rosen has been the public face of some of the Justice Department’s biggest actions, including its antitrust case against Google and the criminal case against opioid maker Purdue Pharma. Before joining the Justice Department, he worked at the Department of Transportation as general counsel and then deputy secretary.At Rosen’s confirmation hearing in 2019, he suggested that he was willing to rebuff political pressure from the White House, if necessary. He told legislators that criminal investigations should “proceed on the facts and the law” and that prosecutions should be “free of improper political influences.”“If the appropriate answer is to say no to somebody, then I will say no,” he said at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-asking-about-special-prosecutor-for-hunter-biden-case/story-OIc2MZi95VzaSTfRnoIEVJ.html
16-12-2020||World||Covid in UK: Ethnic minorities less likely to take vaccine, shows report||People from ethnic minority backgrounds or with lower incomes are less likely to take the coronavirus vaccine being rolled out in Britain, research suggested Wednesday, raising concerns about whether the jab would reach the communities that have been hit disproportionately hard by the pandemic.A survey by Britain’s Royal Society for Public Health said that while three-quarters of those polled would take a Covid-19 vaccine if advised to do so by a doctor, that figure fell to 57% among Black people and those from Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds.The body also said the survey “revealed significantly more hesitancy among lower income groups” — with 70% of lowest earners likely to agree to the jab, compared to 84% of highest earners.Public health experts and doctors say the findings are concerning, but unsurprising. They align with consistently lower uptake rates of other vaccines, like the measles and flu jabs, among ethnic minority communities and in poorer neighborhoods, they say.That reluctance — a result of factors like public health messaging not reaching the communities and mistrust of authority based on past experiences — has been exacerbated by misinformation and anti-vaccination campaigns on social media.“We have known for years that different communities have different levels of satisfaction in the National Health Service,” said Christina Marriott, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health. “More recently we have seen anti-vaccination messages have been specifically targeted at different groups, including different ethnic or religious communities.”Britain on Dec. 8 became the first country in the world to roll out the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, which has an efficacy rate of around 95%. The government is first targeting people over 80 and nursing home workers. About 138,000 people have received the first of two required jabs to date.Studies in the UK and elsewhere have shown that Black people and ethnic minorities are more at risk of contracting and dying from Covid-19, as a result of genetic conditions such as diabetes as well as socio-economic circumstances such as living conditions and occupation. A report by Public Health England also said that structural racism and poor experiences of public healthcare made it less likely for some groups to seek care when needed.Officials have not said they would prioritize Black or ethnic minority communities during the coronavirus vaccine rollout. Dr. Salman Waqar, general secretary of the British Islamic Medical Association, said it has been left up to individual health trusts to decide whether or not to vaccinate Black or minority health workers first.“Effort should be put in to make sure these communities are vaccinated,” he said. “(Officials) have left it for providers to make the decision on the ground, but it doesn’t appear to show strong leadership from the authorities if they’ve left it open to interpretation.”Dr. Kiran Rahim, a pediatrician based in a poorer area of London with a high rate of vaccine refusal, said health officials need to do much more to engage and reach out to marginalized and minority communities.She said that in the case of the children’s nasal flu vaccine — which many Muslims refuse because it contains porcine gelatine — uptake significantly improved once authorities made an alternative option available.“Many of us have lobbied for many years for a vegetarian version to be available, we were constantly met with resistance,” she said. “When it comes down to public health, with a mass vaccination campaign going, you do have to engage with all parties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-in-uk-ethnic-minorities-less-likely-to-take-vaccine-shows-report/story-KAlujetjT9ITTy1dYL3HTM.html
16-12-2020||World||UK: Air pollution listed as cause of 9-year-old’s death||A British coroner ruled Wednesday that excessive air pollution from traffic fumes contributed to the death of a 9-year-old girl who died of a fatal asthma attack. The girl is believed to be the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as the cause of death on their death certificate.Ella Kissi-Debrah, who lived close to one of London’s busiest thoroughfares, died in February 2013 after making almost 30 hospital visits over the previous three years. Her mother has long fought to have the role of air pollution in her daughter’s death recognized.Coroner Philip Barlow said Wednesday after a two-week hearing that he concluded Ella “died of asthma, contributed to by exposure to excessive air pollution.”“Air pollution was a significant contributory factor to both the induction and exacerbations of her asthma,” he said, adding that in the three years before her death, the girl was exposed to levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter that exceeded World Health Organization guidelines.“The principal source of her exposure was traffic emissions,” Barlow said, adding there was a failure to reduce the pollutants to within the limits set by European Union and UK law.London Mayor Sadiq Khan said that the coroner’s conclusion was a “landmark moment.” The inquest highlighted the importance of implementing policies such as expanding a low emission zone to inner London, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-air-pollution-listed-as-cause-of-9-year-old-s-death/story-OFmElwqqUU701tCba2oCTK.html
16-12-2020||World||AstraZeneca, Sinovac vaccines could be used in Brazil by mid-Feb||Two coronavirus vaccines, from AstraZeneca and China’s Sinovac, may be ready for use in Brazil by mid-February, the country’s health minister said on Wednesday, although the timing of the national rollout will depend on regulatory approvals.The lack of a fixed date for vaccinations to start in Brazil has become a thorn in the side of President Jair Bolsonaro, as other nations begin immunizing their populations.Speaking on Wednesday, after a ceremony to discuss the national coronavirus vaccination plan, health minister Eduardo Pazuello said data from the vaccines, which are being tested in Brazil, could be analyzed by health regulator Anvisa in January.“Possibly in the middle of February onwards, we can have these vaccines received and registered to start the plan,” said Pazuello.Brazil’s federal government has a deal to buy the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and Sao Paulo state has partnered with Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac Biotech. Bolsonaro has repeatedly cast doubt on the Chinese vaccine, leading to questions about whether it will get a fair hearing at health regulator Anvisa.Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, widely tipped as a rival to Bolsonaro’s 2022 re-election campaign, has said his state will start inoculating residents with the Sinovac vaccine on Jan. 25, leading to tensions with the federal government.Although Brazil has a strong record on vaccinations and a public health system well set up for such campaigns, Bolsonaro has denied the gravity of the virus and said he will not take a Covid-19 shot, stoking vaccine skepticism in the country.At Wednesday’s event, however, Bolsonaro said his government would this week sign a 20 billion reais ($3.93 billion) measure to buy any vaccine that wins regulatory approval. He heaped praise on the head of regulator Anvisa, which critics accuse of becoming increasingly politicized around vaccines.Pazuello said Anvisa’s credibility should not be questioned, as it was doing technical work in the public service. He added that logistics would not be a problem, saying airlines and trucking firms had offered to distribute vaccines for free.More than 180,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Brazil, which has the world’s second-deadliest outbreak behind the United States. After a months on the decline, the virus has been raging again in recent days, with new cases and deaths rising sharply.The government laid out its vaccination plans in writing over the weekend, with an initial goal of vaccinating 51 million people, or about one-fourth of the population, in the first half of 2021. The Health Ministry said 108 million doses will be available for priority vaccination of vulnerable groups, including health workers, the elderly and indigenous groups.The plan says 70% of the population - or about 148 million of Brazil’s 212 million people - need to be immunized to stop the virus spreading. The current plan covers just about one-third of that goal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-sinovac-vaccines-could-be-used-in-brazil-by-mid-feb/story-AnBR3SZo3wi6t1UNjUCBcK.html

16-12-2020||World||US brands Vietnam, Switzerland as currency manipulators||The US Treasury Department has branded Vietnam and Switzerland as currency manipulators while putting China and nine other countries on a watch list in an annual report designed to halt countries from manipulating their currencies to gain unfair trade advantages.It marked the first time that the United States has labeled another country as a currency manipulator since August 2019 when it called out China at a time when the world’s two largest economies were locked in tense trade negotiations.“The Treasury Department has taken a strong step today to safeguard economic growth and opportunity for American workers and businesses” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. “Treasury will follow up on its findings with respect to Vietnam and Switzerland to work toward eliminating practices tat create unfair advantages for foreign countries.”The Trump administration removed its currency designation from China in January after the two nations had achieved trade agreements which the Trump administration hoped would lower China’s huge trade surplus with the United States.The Treasury report said that Vietnam and Switzerland were the only two countries that met all three criteria for being named a currency manipulator.Those criteria include the number and size of the interventions a country has made in foreign exchange markets to influence the value of its currency. A country intent on gaining trade advantages will sell its currency in an effort to depress its value against other currencies, such as the US dollar.A weaker currency makes a country’s exports cheaper and thus more competitive on foreign markets and makes imports more expensive.The Treasury report said that in addition to extensive currency interventions, Vietnam and Switzerland also met the other two criteria which are running large trade surpluses with the United States and also large surpluses in its current account with the world, the broadest measure of trade which includes not only goods and services but also investment flows.The designation of a currency manipulator will trigger special negotiations with Vietnam and Switzerland over the next year. If those negotiations don’t alter the two countries’ currency practices, the United States can move forward to impose economic sanctions on Vietnam and Switzerland including penalty tariffs.In addition to China, the other countries put on a monitoring list were Japan, South Korea, Germany, Italy, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and India. Taiwan, Thailand and India were put on the watch list this year while the other countries were already on the watch list issued with the last report in January.With regard to Switzerland, the country’s central bank has been selling Swiss francs to limit the currency’s rise and the currency has also benefited for its reputation as a safe haven for investors during times of economic stress. Independent analysts say that is mainly an attempt to keep consumer prices from falling - which can hurt the economy - rather than to boost exports to the US.But the Treasury report labeled Switzerland a currency manipulator contending that the interventions in currency markets were excessive given the large size of the Swiss trade surpluses.The United States has only named three countries as currency manipulators. In addition to branding China as a manipulator last year, the US imposed that label on China from 1992 to 1994. Treasury also imposed that label on Japan and Taiwan in the 1980s.A hallmark of President Donald Trump’s presidency has been pursuit of aggressive trade policies and a number of other countries in such areas as steel and aluminum. While the policies have not done much to lower America’s overall trade deficit, the deficit with China has shrunk. The gap between what the United States sells to China and what it buys in goods and services fell by 19% last year to $308 billion, the lowest level since 2013 but still the largest trade deficit with any single country.America’s overall deficit in goods and services fell less than 1% last year to $577 billion but was still higher than in any year of the Obama administration. The trade gap has gone back up this year, rising by more than 9% from January through March as the pandemic has crushed US exports of services such as tourism and education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-brands-vietnam-switzerland-as-currency-manipulators/story-UVftUBuZdWB55jCD889MnN.html

16-12-2020||World||Buttigieg may finally give the US its infrastructure day||Former mayor and one-time presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has been tapped to be President-elect Joe Biden’s transportation secretary. He’ll bring a much-needed dose of managerial competence to an oft-neglected area of government policymaking. By focusing on identifying and remedying sources of excess cost in our infrastructure system, and by helping speed the transition to electric vehicles, he can have a major impact even in an era of political deadlock.The biggest transportation issue on everyone’s mind is infrastructure. Not only are US roads and bridges perpetually falling apart, but big construction spending is needed as a stimulus to boost the country out of its post-pandemic doldrums. Buttigieg, during his primary presidential run, was one of a number of Democratic candidates to propose a construction spending bonanza.Unfortunately, this is how the US does infrastructure. We delay repairing it, arguing over how much to spend and who foots the bill, until there’s an economic crisis. Then, as in the 2009 stimulus bill, we splurge on road repair and patch things up for another decade. Depending on how much cooperation they get in Congress, Biden and Buttigieg might be able to pull off this trick again.But a bigger issue looms behind the scenes: how much it all costs. The reason America spends only reluctantly and fitfully on infrastructure goes beyond mere partisan bickering. The US is unusual among advanced nations in having ruinously high construction costs for both roads and public transit. By some measures, productivity in the industry is actually falling. There are many different theories explaining why the price for construction has risen so dramatically, including land-use policies that allow landowners to block construction, and inefficiency and corruption in the contracting process. In actuality, it’s probably a combination of factors, encouraged by decades of complacency. Because no one can identify a specific cause, it’s not the kind of thing that the president can wave his hands and fix, even with the help of Congress.That’s where Buttigieg comes in. He spent several years working as a McKinsey & Co. consultant. During that time, he consulted for various federal government agencies. Now, you may have a problem with McKinsey’s ethics, but you have to admit they know their stuff when it comes to cost-cutting. Buttigieg is therefore uniquely qualified to get to the bottom of US infrastructure costs.The key would be to assemble a panel of experts, tasked with identifying, quantifying and proposing solutions to the various cost problems in the US system over the next four years. This is a long-term effort, and probably wouldn’t pay off during Biden’s first term in office. But if successful, a McKinsey-like cost-cutting push would make it easier for both states and the federal government to spend on fixing roads and building new trains in the future, because they’d be getting much more bang for the buck. And that in turn would help the US go from a transit laughing stock back to a respectable advanced country.A second big thing Transportation Secretary Buttigieg can do, even without Congress, is to help speed the US toward its zero-carbon future. One important piece of the energy transition lies firmly within the purview of the Department of Transportation:  the shift to electric vehicles.EVs are finally becoming competitive with internal combustion engines in terms of both cost and range . That alone will increase adoption, but things will go much faster if the government acts to boost the number of charging stations. There’s a chicken-and-egg problem here — the more places there are available for charging, the easier it is to drive your electric car around, and the more electric cars are being driven around, the more profitable it is to run a charging station.So instead of waiting for the free market to build this network up slowly, the government needs to act to speed the process along. Also, the government can set standards to make sure all electric-vehicle companies use compatible chargers, just as gas pumps currently work with any make and model.Biden understands this, and pledged to build 500,000 new public charging outlets by 2030. That’s actually a non-trivial task, since it involves deciding where to build first, working with states and private companies, keeping abreast of the latest technology and building new electrical lines to the charging stations. With his experience consulting for the Energy Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the US Postal Service while at McKinsey, Buttigieg has the chops to tackle this complex task.So Buttigieg will have plenty of chances to leverage his consulting skills in the service of upgrading US infrastructure. Beyond just lobbing a big pot of money at the problem, bringing down infrastructure costs and transitioning to electric vehicles will require smarts and a hard-headed, problem-solving approach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/buttigieg-may-finally-give-the-us-its-infrastructure-day/story-YVMuN9poo06Xfd5OKWDscJ.html
16-12-2020||World||China indicts 10 Hong Kong residents over attempt to flee||Chinese prosecutors on Wednesday announced the indictment of 10 people from Hong Kong over an attempt to flee the city amid a crackdown on opposition political activity.The Yantian district prosecutor’s office in the city of Shenzhen just across the border from Hong Kong said on its microblog that 10 of the suspects were charged with illegally crossing the border while two were also charged with organizing the attempted journey.Two others are minors and a decision on how to handle their cases will be made at a later time, the office said. Relatives of the 12 say they have been prevented from hiring their own lawyers and that the accusations against them are politically motivated.The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently attempting to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong.They were picked up after entering mainland Chinese waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.While Hong Kong is part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland. Since the imposition of the national security law in June, a number of government critics have sought refuge abroad, many in Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that has no formal ties with China’s authoritarian Communist government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-indicts-10-hong-kong-residents-over-attempt-to-flee/story-aB5m2Vl9rnXXVydzIRiU8N.html

What kind of an alliance is this?”Turkey bought the Russian S-400 missiles in 2017, saying the US was unwilling to sell equivalent systems on acceptable terms. The first batteries were delivered last year, prompting bipartisan demands in the US Congress for restrictive measures long resisted by US President Donald Trump.Ankara may have stretched the rope too tight in October by testing the missiles in defiance of American warnings, and on Monday, the Trump-approved sanctions were announced.“The allegation that the S-400 systems constitute a threat to the F-35 fighter jet is just a pretext,” Erdogan said. “The real aim is to block the leaps we started in defense industry and make us once again dependent on them.”The Turkish leader made a point of noting that his country started to develop its own defense industry after the 1975-1978 US arms embargo over Cyprus significantly hampered arms acquisitions.“We’ll double efforts to make our defense industry an independent one in every sense,” he said, broadcasting a video showing tests of the Hisar missile-defense system developed by state-run contractors.The sanctions cut off Turkey’s top defense procurement agency from US financial institutions, military hardware and technology. New export licenses to transfer American goods or technology to the agency have been banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/erdogan-slams-us-over-russian-missile-purchase-sanctions/story-eqNqPm2fB4M3QHujJusppN.html
16-12-2020||World||China pays homage to Beethoven, who has a fan base in country||German composer Ludwig van Beethoven’s “Symphony No.5 in C Minor” was among the compositions chosen to be played at the prestigious National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA) in Beijing to mark China’s national day on October 1.Performed by the Beijing Symphony Orchestra, Beethoven’s work was chosen among Chinese compositions as well as “commissioned works on battling the Covid-19 epidemic,” official media reported.It’s not surprising that Beethoven’s work was chosen to be played at a national day function – he is possibly the best-loved western composer in China.Possibly not known outside, but the German composer is a huge musical icon in China, seen as an unlikely hero in the country because of his life’s struggles and music.It was Beethoven’s composition which was played when then secretary of state Henry Kissinger visited Beijing in 1973 even though the visit took place during the Cultural Revolution when western influences were all but banned in China.As it turns out, many musicians and institutes across China are celebrating the composer’s 250th birth anniversary, which falls on December 16, with concerts, both offline and online.“Over 100 years after Ludwig van Beethoven’s Symphony No.3 first hit the stage in China, the musical talent’s tour de force was played at the Beijing Zhongshan Park to mark the anniversary of his 250th birthday,” official news agency, Xinhua reported, adding that the performance lasted for 12 hours.“…there is no parallel to the depth and breadth of Beethoven’s integration into the culture, politics and private passions of China,” wrote Cai Jindong, associate professor in Stanford University’s Centre for East Asian Studies in his book – “Beethoven in China: How the Great Composer Became an Icon in the People’s Republic”. The book was co-authored by an expert on Chinese culture, and Cai’s wife, Sheila Melvin. Hardly surprising then that a Beijing-based art initiative, Bukaopu planned a celebration of Beethoven’s music on Wednesday evening called “Concert in the Clouds: A Tribute to Beethoven”.“A Mandarin poem rapped to a remixed R&B beat of Moonlight Sonata. A magician playing card tricks to the rhythm of Minuet in C Major. A Rubik’s Cube Guinness record holder playing the hardest level on the game Rhythm Master…to the electric guitar remix of the third movement of the Pathetique Sonata,” a China-focussed website, SupChina wrote in a report Monday.The SupChina report pointed out that Beethoven reemerged in China at the end of the Cultural Revolution.“Even during the 1989 (Tiananmen) protests, students blasted recordings of Ode to Joy in Tiananmen Square. Now, students in China study Beethoven’s story at school,” the article said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pays-homage-to-beethoven-its-most-beloved-composer/story-KSYPRKdeMqDzlE7PXXsdFK.html
16-12-2020||World||Biden arrival won’t guarantee better relations, say Iranian leaders||Iran’s supreme leader and the country’s president both warned America on Wednesday that the departure of President Donald Trump does not immediately mean better relations between the two nations.The remarks come as Iran approaches the first anniversary of the US drone strike that killed Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad, an attack that nearly plunged Washington and Tehran into an open war after months of tensions.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke in Tehran at the Imam Khomeini Hosseinieh, or congregation hall, where he attended a meeting with Soleimani’s family and top military leaders. They all sat some 5 meters (16 feet) away from the 81-year-old Khamenei, who wore a face mask due to the coronavirus pandemic that is still raging in Iran.“You saw that what Trump’s America and (former President Barack) Obama’s America did to you,” Khamenei said. “The hostilities are not just for Trump’s America, which ends when he leaves. Obama’s America also did bad things to you and the Iranian nation.”Earlier in the day, Rouhani, speaking during a Cabinet meeting, made a similar point to criticize Trump — at one point even saying the US president “has committed so many crimes, he was an assassin and a terrorist.”“Some people say, ‘You are excited for Mr. Biden’,” Rouhani said. “No, we are not excited Mr. Biden is taking office, but we are very happy Mr. Trump is gone.”“The upcoming American administration can choose what to do,” Rouhani said. “The path is open. It’s up to them if they are grateful or ungrateful. If they want the right path, it’s ready. If they want the wrong path, that one is ready for them as well.”Biden has suggested the US could rejoin Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, from which Trump unilaterally pulled America out of in 2018 and imposed harsher sanctions on Iran. That decision marked the start of increased tensions between the two countries as Iran abandoned uranium enrichment limits and the Mideast saw a series of escalating incidents and attacks.In response to Soleimani’s death, Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack that injured dozens of US troops in Iraq. That same night, it also mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian airliner taking off from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board.Hoping to pressure Europe, Iran’s parliament recently passed a bill calling on Tehran to increase its uranium enrichment to 20%, a short technical step from weapons-grade levels, and to throw out international inspectors. Rouhani’s government has opposed the bill, exposing a rift inside Iran’s civilian government that the supreme leader appeared to touch on in his speech Wednesday.“Resolve your disputes by negotiating with each other,” Khamenei said. “Are you not saying that we should negotiate with the world, is it not possible to negotiate and resolve disputes with the internal element?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-arrival-won-t-guarantee-better-relations-say-iranian-leaders/story-SgxV1vM0hU1GbxtDGkWYjL.html

She would walk along the road to and from school.Philip Barlow, inner south London coroner, said Kissi-Debrah’s death was caused by acute respiratory failure, severe asthma and air pollution exposure: “Ella died of asthma contributed to by exposure to excessive air pollution.” “There was a recognised failure to reduce the levels of nitrogen dioxide, which possibly contributed to her death. There was also a lack of information given to Ella’s mother that possibly contributed to her death,” he added.Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, mother of the deceased, mounted a legal challenge, arguing that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that there were failures by the state to take steps to protect the public from dangerous levels of air pollution, which amounted to a violation of Article 2 of the Human Rights Act, the right to life.The family’s lawyers told the court that air pollution was a public health emergency and there was a pressing need for it to be recorded as a cause of death to ensure public health programmes to tackle toxic air are prioritised.Stephen Holgate, an immunopharmacologist at the University of Southampton and Southampton general hospital, told the court that a biological cause of her disease getting worse in the winter months was the seasonal worsening of air pollution.He said it was the cumulative effects of the toxic air Ella was breathing in living within 30 metres of the South Circular road that caused her final acute asthma attack. In the three years before her death, she had multiple seizures and was admitted to hospital 27 times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-pollution-caused-london-girl-s-death-says-coroner-in-historic-ruling/story-KyUXSSjwdYJjVGwJHzJnDL.html

16-12-2020||World||‘Will certainly happen’: Iran’s Khamenei vows to avenge Soleimani’s death||Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei renewed his call to avenge the death of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, who was killed by US military in a drone strike at Baghdad’s international airport in January. Ahead of the death anniversary of Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMU), Khamenei said that Iran will take the revenge “on those who ordered it.”“Those who ordered the murder of General Soleimani, as well as those who carried this out, should be punished. This revenge will certainly happen at the right time,” said the 81-year-old religious leader, according to Khamenei’s website.Khamenei said millions of people attending the funeral of Soleimani and al-Muhandis “was the first slap” to the US, adding that the “worse one is overcoming the hegemony of arrogance and expelling the US from the region.” He claimed that the United States has failed to achieve its goals in Iran and Syria despite spending billions of dollars in the region.“Martyr Soleimani defeated the Front of Arrogance both during his life and with his martyrdom. The US President said they spent $7 billion in the region without achieving anything. The US failed to achieve its goals in Syria and Iraq,” he said.Also Read | Iran says nuclear scientist was killed using satellite-controlled gunAfter Soleimani’s death, US President Donald Trump had said that the US troops killed the Iranian commander because he was plotting “imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel”. In a televised briefing, Trump had stated that Soleimani made the death of innocent people his “sick passion”, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London. Soleimani’s killing triggered an escalation as Tehran retaliated by targeting US troops stationed in Iraq. According to the Pentagon, 64 American troops were injured in an Iranian missile strike on Iraqi military base in January 2020. The US president underplayed the traumatic brain injuries suffered by the security personnel by calling it ‘headaches’.“I heard they had headaches. No, I don’t consider them very serious injuries, relative to other injuries that I’ve seen,” Trump had said during the World Economic Forum (WEF) summit in Davos, drawing flak from the Veterans of Foreign War (VFW).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-certainly-happen-iran-s-khamenei-vows-to-avenge-soleimani-s-death/story-6Qpud6kha6O93gB905EXdL.html

The global call to investigate the origin of the virus, suspected to be in China’s Wuhan, has been echoed by scientists and medical experts as the scourage by coronavirus disease has claimed millions of lives and upended economies across the world. The coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, 2019, before spreading across China, and triggering a global pandemic.Also read | ‘Pure propaganda’: German scientist rebuts Chinese media on Covid originChina has rejected the claims for almost a year now on the reports of virus originating from its central city. Recently, a top German biochemist quoted by Chinese state media as saying that the coronavirus did not originate in Wuhan has called it “pure propaganda” and said there is no evidence to suggest that the virus did not come from the central Chinese city.China has denied that it deliberately hid information about the spreading virus in January or earlier.A year into the Coronavirus pandemic, China has effectively controlled the spread of Covid-19 within its borders, putting in place efficient lockdown and contract tracing measures and conducting mass testing for the virus for every small outbreak.At the same time, Beijing, in the face of global criticism, has been trying to change the virus-origin theory and shift the blame outside. Several theories are in circulation – the origin could be the Indian subcontinent including India and Bangladesh or Saudi Arabia, Italy, the US and the US military, or imported frozen packaged food.Also read | Coronavirus Outbreak: WHO advance team concludes China visit to probe Covid-19 origin In August this year, the agency’s chief and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had said the “international team” will deploy to Wuhan, the city where the pandemic is believed to have erupted late last year.

Kirsch was confirmed Tuesday on a 51-44 vote.Three Democrats — Arizona Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin — voted for him in what was otherwise a party-line vote. Four Republican senators and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris did not vote.President Donald Trump named Kirsch as Barrett’s replacement before she was confirmed to the high court in October, and the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced his nomination last week. Kirsch graduated from Indiana University and earned his law degree from Harvard.Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, who is expected to become the top Democrat on Judiciary in the next Congress, said Kirsch’s quick nomination and confirmation showed that Trump and Senate Republicans were intent on forcing through as many conservative judges as possible.“They have kept the nominations assembly line going,’‘ Durbin said.Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., said Kirsch “is a man of character, he’s a man of integrity, and he believes in the rule of law.”Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said Kirsch’s nomination is “further entrenching the lack of diversity that is characteristic of President Trump’s judicial nominees,” noting that the appeals court he will join is the only all-white federal appeals court in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thomas-kirsch-to-replace-barrett-on-federal-appeals-court/story-a5y8vIObxtOfuWeHfHGiJM.html
16-12-2020||World||Suspected Chinese hackers stole camera footage from African Union: Report||As diplomats gathered at the African Union’s headquarters earlier this year to prepare for its annual leaders’ summit, employees of the international organization made a disturbing discovery.Someone was stealing footage from their own security cameras.Acting on a tip from Japanese cyber researchers, the African Union’s (AU) technology staffers discovered that a group of suspected Chinese hackers had rigged a cluster of servers in the basement of an administrative annex to quietly siphon surveillance videos from across the AU’s sprawling campus in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital.The security breach was carried out by a Chinese hacking group nicknamed “Bronze President,” according to a five-page internal memo reviewed by Reuters. It said the affected cameras covered “AU offices, parking areas, corridors, and meeting rooms.”“We cannot estimate the quantity and value of the data which have been stolen,” the memo continued, adding that while AU technicians had managed to interrupt the flow of data, the hackers could easily regain the upper hand.“We are still weak to prevent another attack,” the memo said.The alert, drafted in late January and circulated to senior officials, provides a glimpse of how world powers are jockeying for influence and visibility at the continent’s paramount pan-African organization. Some American and European officials have voiced concern as Beijing has stepped in to meet the AU’s needs - part of an Africa-wide shift that has seen China become the continent’s top creditor. Chinese workers built the AU’s showpiece new conference center in 2012 and Chinese technicians still help maintain the organization’s digital infrastructure.The Chinese mission to the AU said in an email that “the AU side has not mentioned being hacked on any occasion” and that Africa and China are “good friends, partners and brothers.”“We never interfere in Africa’s internal affairs and wouldn’t do anything that harms the interests of the African side,” the email said.Repeated messages sent to AU spokesperson Ebba Kalondo asking about the January breach were marked as “read” but went unanswered.Longstanding doubts over Beijing’s role at the AU spilled into the open in 2018, when French newspaper Le Monde reported https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2018/01/26/a-addis-abeba-le-siege-de-l-union-africaine-espionne-par-les-chinois_5247521_3212.html that AU employees had found that the servers at the new conference center were sending copies of their contents to Shanghai every night and that the building itself had been honeycombed with listening devices.Both the AU and the Chinese government vehemently denied the report at the time, but a former AU official told Reuters the article in Le Monde was accurate and had put officials there on high alert over cyberespionage.The former official said the latest breach was discovered following a tip from Japan’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), which in a Jan. 17 email alerted AU officials to unusual traffic between the international organization’s network and a domain associated with Bronze President.Koichiro Komiyama, who directs the global coordination division of Japan’s CERT, confirmed to Reuters that he sent the warning after a fellow researcher discovered the malicious traffic while picking through the hacking group’s old infrastructure.The AU memo said that, within days of Komiyama’s email, the AU’s information technology team had traced the suspicious traffic to a set of servers in the basement of the organization’s Building C - part of an older complex across the road from the new conference center.The memo said the hackers were able to siphon off “a huge volume of traffic” from the servers by hiding it in the regular flow of data leaving the AU’s network during business hours, even pausing their data theft during lunch.Secureworks, an arm of Dell Technologies Inc which has been tracking Bronze President since 2018, confirmed that the malicious domain identified by Japan’s CERT was linked to the hackers.Secureworks researcher Mark Osborn said his company had seen strong evidence that Bronze President operated from China, adding that it had been detected in several espionage campaigns targeting China’s neighbors, including Mongolia and India.Any official protest over the spying is unlikely, according to the former AU official. He said China plays a critical role in keeping the organization running, including during an incident in June when part of the AU’s network was knocked out by a power failure and Chinese technicians swiftly repaired the damage.For that reason, the former official expects that the surveillance camera incident - like the listening devices reported in 2018 - would be swept under the rug.“Attacking the Chinese, for us, it’s a very bad idea,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspected-chinese-hackers-stole-camera-footage-from-african-union-report/story-QFKgXCbW8dUb9jKaWSrf4M.html

16-12-2020||World||Pakistan approves chemical castration of sex offenders||Pakistan has approved the chemical castration of rapists as part of sweeping new legislation sparked by outcry over the gang rape of a mother on a motorway.New laws approved by President Arif Alvi on Tuesday will see rape cases expedited through the courts and create the country’s first national sex offenders register.“The provision of the chemical castration of repeat as well as first-time sex offenders... was added in the Anti-Rape Ordinance 2020”, the president’s office confirmed Wednesday.Pakistan is a deeply conservative and patriarchal nation where victims of sexual abuse often are too afraid to speak out, or where criminal complaints are frequently not investigated seriously. In September, protests erupted after a mother was raped on the side of the road in front of her children when her car broke down near Lahore. Prime Minister Imran Khan responded by calling for the chemical castration of rapists, which involves using drugs to reduce a person’s libido. Khan had said the worst sex crimes should be punishable by public hangings but added this could impact trade with partners that oppose the death penalty, such as the European Union.Rights activists have warned the provision of chemical castration could affect Pakistan’s international human rights obligations.“Chemical castrations are cruel, inhuman and degrading and will leave the flawed criminal justice in place”, said Rimmel Mohydin, Pakistan campaigner at Amnesty International.Nighat Dad, a women’s rights activist, praised the content of the new legislation, but said it was unclear how chemical castration would be either a “deterrent or rehabilitative”.Under the new laws, special courts will be established to try cases of rape and sexual abuse against women and children, which must be completed within four months.They also establish anti-rape cells across the country for conducting initial investigations, and medical examinations within six hours of filing a police complaint -- while abolishing an invasive medical examination known as the two-finger virginity test for rape victims. The test involves a medical officer inserting two fingers into a rape victim’s vagina, to assess her sexual history.The laws come into effect immediately but must be ratified by parliament within three months.It would come down to the discretion of a trial judge to order chemical castration, the president’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-approves-chemical-castration-of-sex-offenders/story-Oku2vXiAPDNBpowgVoCARL.html
16-12-2020||World||Germany enters harder lockdown as Covid-19 deaths hit new high||Germany hit a new record level of coronavirus deaths as it entered a harder lockdown Wednesday, closing shops and schools to try to bring down stubbornly high new cases.The country recorded 179.8 deaths of new infections per 100,000 residents over the last seven days, a new high and significantly more than the 149 per 100,000 reported a week ago by the Robert Koch Institute, the country’s disease control center.It also blew past its previous daily total, with Germany’s 16 states reporting 952 people had died of the virus, the agency said. That was far greater than the previous daily record set Friday of 598 deaths, although included two days of figures from the hard-hit eastern state of Saxony, which did not report Tuesday. It brought the country’s overall pandemic death toll to 23,427.Faced with exponentially increasing cases in October, Germany implemented a “lockdown light” at the start of November, which closed bars and restaurants but left shops open. The measures succeeded in levelling off the numbers of new daily infections, but didn’t bring them down, prompting the new stricter restrictions.In addition to closing shops and moving children to remote learning for the few days before the Christmas holidays, private gatherings are being limited to two households with a maximum of five people, among other things.The measures are expected to be in place until at least Jan. 10 and enjoy wide support, with the latest polls showing more than 80% of Germans approve of the lockdown restrictions or think they should be stricter.Germany was widely praised for slowing the spread of its outbreak in the spring, but as people grew lax with distancing and mask rules over the summer the numbers of cases started to climb again.While daily new cases peaked at about 6,000 in March, they are now more than four times that level, with 27,728 new cases reported Wednesday by the Robert Koch Institute.The number of new infections per 100,000 residents over the last seven days hit a record high of 179.8, the agency reported.German officials have pressed the European Union’s regulatory agency hard to speed up its approval of a coronavirus vaccine, and the European Medicines Agency has scheduled a meeting on that for Monday. With vaccinations expected to start before year’s end, German officials have urged people to stay patient and respect the regulations over the holidays.Health Minister Jens Spahn said Germany was ready to start rolling out the vaccine and could begin vaccinations within two to four days of European approval.“By summer we’ll be able to return to normal, step by step,” he said on RTL television Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-enters-harder-lockdown-as-covid-19-deaths-hit-new-high/story-0RVRwa2UKPRq48rjYoaPTJ.html

The British Medical Association said allowing people to mix is a “recipe for catastrophe.” Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer asked the government to rethink the rules.The number of people testing positive for the virus rose by 30% in the last seven days across the UK and talks between ministers in London and the devolved administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to find a common approach to Christmas were due to continue on Wednesday.Ministers are unlikely to change the rules but are expected to set out stronger guidance, according to the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick used a series of TV and radio interviews on Wednesday morning to urge people to use common sense when making Christmas plans.He told BBC TV he had changed his mind about visiting his own parents, both in their eighties, and would wait for them to be vaccinated. “Easter can be the new Christmas for some people” Jenrick told Sky News.“We all need to use our own personal judgment thinking about our own families whether we have particularly elderly or clinically vulnerable relatives who might be round the Christmas table,” Jenrick said. “Thinking of some of the examples we can see internationally like Thanksgiving, for example, where lots of people coming together did have consequences after the event.”Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will meet with his counterparts in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast on Wednesday to try to agree a U.K.-wide approach after talks failed to reach a united position on Tuesday.Johnson has faced growing demands to rethink his approach over Christmas after the surge in cases, particularly in London and southeast England.Ministers are also set to review tier allocations across England by the end of Wednesday, with an announcement expected Thursday. London and surrounding parts of southeast England moved into the strictest tier 3 on Wednesday, earlier than planned, after a spike in infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-set-out-tougher-holiday-guidance-as-covid-19-cases-soar/story-ycXHAs1dDMNCjHtDP9tOqM.html

The judge had said that a failure to take into account the British government’s commitments on climate change was “legally fatal” to the plans.But a Supreme Court judge told a virtual session on Wednesday that the government had taken climate change commitments into account when designing its airport policy.“For these reasons, the Court unanimously concludes that the appeal should be allowed. The airports national policy statement is lawful,” Judge Philip Sales said.Since February, the aviation sector has been hit by its worst ever downturn, meaning Heathrow now has plenty of spare capacity, but the airport said another runway was still vital for the future.“Demand for aviation will recover from Covid-19, and the additional capacity at an expanded Heathrow will allow Britain as a sovereign nation to compete for trade and win against our rivals in France and Germany,” a Heathrow spokesman said in a statement.The airport is owned by Spain’s Ferrovial, the Qatar Investment Authority and China Investment Corp, among others.BREXITHeathrow is Britain’s biggest port by value. The airport has two runways, compared with Paris’s and Frankfurt’s four and Amsterdam’s six. Before the pandemic, it had no space to add new flights.Heathrow and its supporters argue that Britain’s departure from the European Union makes expansion critical to ensuring the country can increase trade with the rest of the world.The project has been hotly debated in Britain for almost half a century. The new runway was previously approved in 2009 before being scrapped the following year, and then approved again in 2018.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been a long-term opponent of it. As mayor of London, he vowed in 2015 that he would lie down in front of bulldozers if necessary to stop construction of the third runway.The latest decision represents a setback to wider hopes among climate campaigners of using Heathrow as a test case to develop similar legal challenges to heavily polluting transport, energy or other projects in other countries.Heathrow said that its expansion plan must now go through a planning process that will require it to prove expansion is compliant with Britain’s climate change obligations before construction can begin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-s-biggest-airport-heathrow-to-get-a-third-runway-rules-supreme-court/story-a6eqJUuhbU7sW3SRDGgxuO.html
16-12-2020||World||Nearly half of Singapore’s migrant workers infected with Covid-19||Singapore’s health ministry on Wednesday reported no new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from the local transmission, days after the government approved Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine. However, coronavirus infection among migrant workers has been a matter of concern as the latest data showed nearly half of them have been infected with Covid-19 in the past nine months. The data published by the health ministry revealed that more than 152,000 migrant workers, out of 320,000, who live in dormitories, have been infected. As of December 13, more than 54,000 dormitory dwelling migrant workers tested positive for Covid-19 via a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, while 98,289 migrant workers were found infected in serology tests. The normal PCR coronavirus tests detect whether a person currently has the virus and the serology tests find out whether a person has had it in the past.Also Read | Singapore approves Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine, expects first shots by year-endThe health ministry said in a statement that by August, all foreign workers living in dormitories have been tested for the virus at least once. The vast majority of the Covid-19 cases occurred in dormitories of migrant workers, where the coronavirus spread quickly due to their communal living arrangements. The ministry added that the health and social distancing measures turned out to be inadequate, given the highly infectious nature of the virus.“We acted swiftly and decisively to stabilise the situation in the dormitories. Working closely with dormitory operators, employers, the medical community, NGOs and other community groups, we contained the outbreak and cleared the dormitories of the virus,” the ministry stated.According to the latest data, there were 25 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions amongst migrant workers living in dormitories and two deaths due to the contagious disease. The ministry said that the morbidity and mortality rate “among our migrant workers has been very low”, despite the scale of the pandemic. It also added that almost all of them have since also been cleared to resume work safely. But the migrant labourers from South Asia still face restrictions on their movement which will only be gradually lifted next year, according to a BBC report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-half-of-singapore-s-migrant-workers-infected-with-covid-19/story-y8BwKsipwJ9suswPIRsU3J.html
16-12-2020||World||Taliban team in Pakistan as calls grow for Afghan cease-fire||A Taliban team, led by the co-founder of the insurgent movement, arrived Wednesday in Islamabad for talks with Pakistani government leaders amid growing calls for a reduction in violence in Afghanistan.Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and his delegation were summoned to Islamabad from Qatar, where they have been negotiating since September with Afghan government representatives, officials close to the talks said. The visit comes a day after US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad made a quick trip to Pakistan’s powerful military in the garrison city of Rawalpindi.The Pakistani military has wielded significant influence over the Taliban and has had links with some of the leaders — then part of the US-backed mujahedeen — dating back to the 1980s war and the former Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. The Taliban emerged in 1994 in response to runaway corruption and violence of mujahedeen warlords who took power from the former communist regime in 1992.Pakistan was key in getting the Taliban to the negotiation table with the United States in 2018. Those talks eventually led to the US-Taliban deal that was signed in February, providing for the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan.The deal also paved way for the start of talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government, which began in September in efforts to hammer out a roadmap for post-war Afghanistan. The talks, after some recent procedural progress, have been suspended till early January though there is speculation the resumption could be further delayed.Kabul has called for the talks to resume inside Afghanistan while the Taliban insist they continue in Doha, Qatar, where they maintain a political office.Meanwhile, Washington has been increasingly frustrated by a spike in violence in Afghanistan and calls for a cease-fire have been reaching crescendo in both Kabul and in Washington.Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem tweeted late Tuesday that “a high level delegation” led by Baradar “left for Islamabad at the official invitation” of Pakistan. The delegation was to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, as well as military officials.However, it is unclear if the Taliban visit to Pakistan would yield any progress toward even a temporary cease-fire in Afghanistan.President Donald Trump accelerated the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan earlier this month, with another 2,000 troops returning home by early January and leaving just 2,500 American soldiers behind.The final withdrawal hinges on Taliban fulfilling their commitment to cut off al-Qaida and other militant groups and ensure that Afghan territory is not used for attacks on the United States. The Islamic State group — a rival of the Taliban — is seen as America’s greatest security threat in Afghanistan.Khalilzad has called on both sides in the Qatar talks to press toward a political solution, but the stepped-up violence by the Taliban is undermining progress, according to officials familiar with the talks. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations.The Taliban have so far rejected that a cease-fire be on the agenda of the Qatar talks.In Afghanistan, the Taliban attacked military outposts in northern Baghlan and southern Uruzgan province late on Tuesday and early Wednesday. At least 19 Afghan security forces and 11 Taliban were killed in the fighting.In Kabul, roadside bomb struck a vehicle early on Wednesday, wounding two people, according to the Kabul police spokesman, Ferdaws Faramarz. On Tuesday, a lawyer was shot and killed in the latest target killings sweeping the country. Afghan police have arrested two suspects in connection with the shooting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-team-in-pakistan-as-calls-grow-for-afghan-cease-fire/story-IvZyqgGY6sks9HFmdLtAWI.html
16-12-2020||World||Biden’s challenge: Creating a Covid-19-free White House||Three blocks from the White House, office space for more than 500 Biden transition staffers sits mostly idle. The government is shipping out laptops so staffers can work from home. President-elect Joe Biden, surrounded by just a handful of aides in Delaware, is using Zoom to oversee his plans to assume power.But Biden soon will be entering a no-Zoom zone at the White House — just one sign of the challenges his new administration will face when it moves to Washington in the midst of a pandemic.After months of making a virtue of the cautious approach his campaign and transition team have taken toward Covid-19, Biden’s prudence will be tested by technology and tradition when he arrives on January 20.White House computers don’t allow the popular video conference software Zoom or rival systems like Google Meet and Slack. Government-issue cellphones only gained texting capabilities a few years ago. And many employees will need to be present at the White House to access classified information.Biden’s team has limited experience with staffing a physical office during the pandemic. His campaign went all-virtual in mid-March, clearing out its Philadelphia headquarters and sending staff back to their families in Washington, New York and beyond. His transition team plotted out his path to power entirely online.The closest Biden’s team has come to experimenting with in-person work was election night, when a small selection of masked and socially distanced aides in Wilmington, Delaware, monitored returns in hotel conference rooms, a far cry from running a White House 24/7.Even now, the most prominent use of the 100,000-plus square feet (9,290 square meters) of office space reserved for the transition is for Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to receive the highly classified President’s Daily Brief.Telework is possible for some White House staff, and improvements in both secure and unclassified videoconferencing have been made over the last two decades. But the lack of in-person coordination could pose an additional challenge to the new government facing a multitude of crises.Further complicating matters, the Biden team must devise health and safety protocols from scratch. The Trump administration was, at best, a cautionary tale in how not to run a workplace during a pandemic.Despite relying on an aggressive testing regimen that is not available in other workplaces, the West Wing under President Donald Trump has been the locus of at least two significant outbreaks of Covid-19 since Trump himself came down with the virus five weeks before Election Day.In addition to the first family, the dozens in Trump world who have tested positive include the White House chief of staff, the vice president’s chief of staff, the White House press secretary and the president’s campaign manager. Still more aides have had to isolate after potential exposure. The full scale of the infections is not publicly known.The problems stemmed in large part from the Trump White House flouting its own guidelines for Covid-19 safety, including holding large events, allowing frequent travel and above all not requiring face masks. iden team believes that some of the greatest risk can be mitigated simply by adhering to scientific advice: holding safer events, requiring face coverings and continuing regular testing.White House veterans say the task of making the West Wing a safe workspace is attainable but will require intense discipline, among both White House staff and the hundreds of government employees from other federal agencies who support it.Detailed planning is still underway, but some early considerations are to curtail the number of staffers who have unfettered access to the West Wing, encourage remote work where possible and even have staffers use secure teleconferencing between individual offices to minimize use of shared spaces.Biden’s team may get a blueprint of sorts for its use of Covid-19 vaccines from the Trump White House, which is beginning to roll out inoculations for some critical government staffers, including military aides to the president, Secret Service agents and Situation Room watch officers.Biden himself appears likely to receive at least a first dose of the vaccine before taking office, relying on the advice of the nation’s top U.S. infectious-disease expert. Dr. Anthony Fauci called for Biden and Harris to swiftly receive the vaccine.“For security reasons, I really feel strongly that we should get them vaccinated as soon as we possibly can,” Fauci said on ABC News on Tuesday. “You want him fully protected as he enters into the presidency in January.” Moving the Bidens into the White House — a stressful process even in normal times — will be more complicated this year.There will be a top-to-bottom cleaning of the West Wing in the hours after Trump vacates the premises and before Biden’s team moves in. Public health experts say it’s crucial that extra steps be taken to mitigate the spread of the disease during that changeover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-s-challenge-creating-a-covid-19-free-white-house/story-KuQE5gQdbBAcwUn6qQ5iwN.html
16-12-2020||World||Facebook attacks Apple’s iOS changes in full-page newspaper ads||Facebook Inc. attacked Apple Inc. in a series of full-page newspaper ads Wednesday, claiming the iPhone maker’s anticipated mobile software changes around data gathering and targeted advertising are bad for small businesses.The ads, slated to run in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, carry the headline “We’re standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere.” They home in on upcoming changes to Apple’s iOS 14 operating system that will curb the ability of companies like Facebook to gather data about mobile users and ply them with advertising.Facebook previously told investors that Apple’s changes, scheduled to go live early next year, will lead to significant headwinds because most of its advertisers are small businesses. Apple has pushed back, accusing Facebook in November of showing a “disregard for user privacy.”“While limiting how personalized ads can be used does impact larger companies like us, these changes will be devastating to small businesses,” Facebook claims. The social giant, citing its own data, says ads that disregard personalized targeting generate 60% fewer sales than ads that do target consumers.Read more: Apple Defends Delay of Privacy Feature, Slams FacebookThe newspaper ads are the latest in what has become a vicious and public battle between two of the world’s most valuable companies. Facebook has argued repeatedly that Apple’s App Store fees and the upcoming iOS changes hurt small businesses trying to recover from the pandemic. It’s used those attacks to paint itself as a champion for such users, many of which rely on Facebook’s advertising services to drive sales. (That reliance can also put small businesses in a bind.)Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has also criticized Apple’s expensive smartphones. After his company joined a chorus attacking Apple’s 30% fee for in-app purchases for certain services that moved online because of the pandemic, Apple said it wouldn’t take such a cut through the end of 2020. Last month, it extended that waiver through June 2021.While not applicable to Facebook apps, Apple will reduce its App Store revenue cut from 30% to 15% starting next year for developers that generate up to $1 million per year. The company said it’s implementing the change to support small businesses.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-attacks-apple-s-ios-changes-in-full-page-newspaper-ads/story-uKFstC8dCY2ymFtkfrbBgO.html
16-12-2020||World||Asian countries, Switzerland at risk in US Treasury’s currency report||The US Treasury could label several countries currency manipulators before President Donald Trump leaves office, analysts say, as the coronavirus pandemic skews trade flows and widens US deficits with trading partners.Currency experts say Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan and Switzerland all risk being found in violation of the three US criteria for currency manipulation in the Treasury Department’s long-delayed report on the foreign exchange practices of major trading partners. They expect the report within days.While President-elect Joe Biden is expected to be less confrontational with US allies on matters of trade, a new White House could find it politically difficult to immediately walk back designations of currency manipulation by the current administration.To be labeled a manipulator, countries must at least have a $20 billion-plus bilateral trade surplus with the United States, foreign currency intervention exceeding 2% of GDP and a global current account surplus exceeding 2% of GDP.Brad Setser, a former US Treasury economist and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, has replicated data used by Treasury to analyze these criteria, constructing a quarterly tracker that shows Vietnam, Switzerland and Thailand exceeded the department’s thresholds during the first and second quarters of 2020.Taiwan met all three thresholds in the second quarter, but barely missed on the foreign exchange intervention in the first quarter in the data compiled by Setser, who now serves on Biden’s transition team for trade issues.However, Treasury’s actual data may differ and it has some discretion in applying the label, and mitigating circumstances such as the coronavirus pandemic may factor into its decisions.Trade surpluses for Asian economies exporting personal protective equipment and other supplies needed to fight the pandemic have jumped, while capital has surged into safe haven currencies such as the Swiss franc, driving them higher.The Swiss National Bank has spent 90 billion francs ($101 billion) to tame the franc’s rise in the first half of 2020, putting it squarely in the Treasury’s focus.The Treasury has often treated Switzerland differently because it views Switzerland’s intervention as not trade-driven, but that could change this time, said Mark Sobel, another former Treasury and International Monetary Fund official.“If the Treasury is going to go after a few Asian countries and Switzerland trips all three criteria, how do you not go after them?” said Sobel, now with the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum think-tank.VIETNAM TARGETEDVietnam’s currency practices have been in the Trump administration’s crosshairs for months, as the US Trade Representative’s office investigates the undervaluation of the dong.Business groups are concerned the administration could make moves, such as punitive tariffs, on these soon. The Treasury already declared Vietnam’s currency undervalued by 4.7% in 2019 in a Commerce Department anti-subsidy case, which led to punitive duties on Vietnamese light vehicle tire imports.Taiwan, like Vietnam, has seen its trade surplus with the United States grow as companies moved supply chains from China to these countries in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Taiwan spent $3.9 billion buy US dollars in the first half of 2020, to tame a 5% rise in the Taiwan dollar against the greenback, exceeding its 2019 purchases. China, declared a manipulator in August 2019 at the height of US-China trade tensions, has been a fixture on Treasury’s monitoring list for years due to its massive trade surplus with the United States. Treasury removed the label in January as the two countries signed a “Phase 1” trade deal and China’s foreign exchange interventions and global current account surplus remain below the thresholds.Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at BBH in New York downplayed the report as “totally politicized” under Trump.“Any sort of move this current Treasury secretary makes can be easily reversed when the new Treasury secretary comes in,” Thin said.There is no automatic punishment with a currency manipulator label, though US law requires Washington to demand negotiations with designated countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asian-countries-switzerland-at-risk-in-us-treasury-s-currency-report/story-4HjNXvH23VTvedj4S77olM.html

Bezos’s wealth has reportedly grown almost 80 percent during the pandemic.Scott said she enlisted a team of advisors that helped identify 384 organizations across the US that support people suffering from the economic toll of the pandemic.Special attention was given to organizations working to combat hunger, poverty and racial inequity in communities, according to Scott.Targets for support included food banks, employment training services, legal defense funds, debt relief programs and civil rights advocacy groups.The groups that received donations “have dedicated their lives to helping others, working and volunteering and serving real people face-to-face at bedsides and tables, in prisons and courtrooms and classrooms, on streets and hospital wards and hotlines and frontlines of all types and sizes, day after day after day,” Scott said.Scott was left a multi-billionaire after her divorce last year from Bezos.She ranked 20th on a Forbes real-time list of the world’s richest people index on Tuesday, with a net worth of $56 billion -- after taking her latest donations into account.Bezos was at the top of that list with a net worth of $185 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-ex-wife-mackenzie-scott-gives-4-2-bn-to-help-the-vulnerable-amid-covid-crisis/story-4DJZbxuSj9GiEoZJSAGMPN.html

An interim report by the Royal Commission of Inquiry found children, some from as young as nine months old, suffered years of abuse, which included rape and electric shock treatment, by staff at psychiatric and state care facilities, clergy and foster guardians.The report estimated that up to 256,000 people were abused, accounting for almost 40% of the 655,000 people in care during the period, with most abuse occurring in the 1970s and 1980s. “The hurt and anguish that has been caused in New Zealand’s history is inexcusable,” said Minister for the Public Service Chris Hipkins, who described the report as a “difficult read”.“All children in the care of the state should be safe from harm, but as the testimony sets out all too often the opposite was true.”The report said most abuse survivors were aged between 5 and 17. Most were abused over a five to 10 year period.The abuse included physical assault and sexual abuse, with staff in some psychiatric institutions forcing male patients to rape female patients. It also included the improper use of medical procedures including electric shocks on genitals and legs, improper strip searches and vaginal examinations, and verbal abuse and racial slurs.“Sometimes I’d have shock treatment twice a day,” said Anne, who at 17 was placed in a psychiatric institution in 1979.“The records (said) I went blind, then they gave me shock treatment again that night,” she told the inquiry.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the Royal Commission in 2018 saying the country needed to confront “a dark chapter” in its history, and later expanded it to include churches and other faith-based institutions.The report said the likelihood of children and young people abused in faith-based or religious homes ranges from 21% to 42%.It found the number of people passing through care institutions was six times higher than previously estimated.“On any assessment this is a serious and long-standing social problem that needs to be addressed,” the report said, adding there was evidence that abuse continued today.MAORI DISADVANTAGEDThe Royal Commission will make recommendations to the government in its final report. It is one of longest and most complex commissions of inquiry undertaken in New Zealand.The interim report on Wednesday comes after private and public redress hearings where survivors bravely narrated harrowing accounts of physical and sexual abuse.One indigenous Maori survivor, Peter, told the inquiry he drove a car off a cliff in an attempt to suicide to escape the abuse.“I didn’t wanna live anymore. I went over a cliff and smashed head-on into a bank. Again, if anybody just stopped and looked at why, they would have figured something out, but they didn’t,” he said.Abuse survivors said a “culture of silence and secrecy” kept the abuse hidden to the outside world. The report said many survivors now suffer mental health issues, like post traumatic stress disorder and depression, and battle substance abuse.The Catholic Church in Aotearoa New Zealand said it would study the report to learn how to deal with complaints and prevent abuse.“We are deeply sorry for the harm caused to so many by the abuse they suffered, and we continue to express our profound sorrow,” said the Archbishop of Wellington Cardinal John Dew.The report acknowledged that Maori children probably suffered the most, as 81% of children abused in care are Māori, while 69% of the children in care are Māori.It said some faith-based institutions sought to “cleanse”, through sexual and physical abuse, the cultural identity from Maori people in care.Thousands of Maori people protested across New Zealand last year calling for an end to the practice of taking at-risk children away from families and placing them in state care. Critics of the practice have said the process is racially skewed against the Maori, and is a legacy of colonisation.Neighbouring Australia delivered a national apology in 2017, after a five-year inquiry into child sexual abuse revealed thousands of cases of sexual misconduct largely committed at religious and state-run institutions.Hipkins said the New Zealand government would make a decision on an apology once the Commission hands over its final report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-250-000-abused-in-new-zealand-s-state-and-faith-based-care-report/story-whgqOrmYV7xiySPJYFPp2N.html
16-12-2020||World||England keeps looser holiday Covid rules even as cases rise||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will go ahead with plans to ease coronavirus restrictions over Christmas despite mounting pressure to stop people mixing indoors over the holiday.As many as three households will still be able to gather together for five days between Dec. 23 and 27 in England, a person familiar with the matter said.But the government is expected to set out stronger guidance on how to keep elderly relatives safe. This could include asking people to self-isolate before joining with other households, according to the Daily Telegraph.Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will meet with his counterparts from the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on Wednesday to try to agree a common approach across the UK, after talks failed to reach a united position on Tuesday.Johnson has faced growing demands to rethink his approach over Christmas after a surge in Covid-19 infections in recent days, particularly in London and southeast England. The UK capital was placed in the highest tier of restrictions on Wednesday, with pubs and restaurants forced to close.‘Grave Risk’In a rare joint editorial Tuesday, the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal said the government’s relaxation of social distancing rules over the holiday period will increase infections and risk putting further strain on hospitals.Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, called on ministers to hold an emergency review of the plans. He told Johnson in a letter the government has “lost control of infections,” putting the economy and National Health Service at “grave risk” in the new year.“We all need to use our own personal judgment thinking about our own families whether we have particularly elderly or clinically vulnerable relatives who might be round the Christmas table, and also looking at the fact that the rates of the virus are rising in many parts of the country,” Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told Sky News.“Thinking of some of the examples we can see internationally like Thanksgiving, for example, where lots of people coming together did have consequences after the event,” he said.The British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said allowing people to mix at Christmas was a “recipe for catastrophe.”Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s chair of council, said: “We agree that the impact on the NHS of the almost inevitable third wave of the infection in the new year will be disastrous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-keeps-looser-holiday-covid-rules-even-as-cases-rise/story-mGNQ5MerXhYrG1OarWuGfM.html
16-12-2020||World||‘Lock down,’ says Italy adviser, as deaths head for wartime levels||An adviser to Italy’s health ministry has called for coronavirus restrictions to be drastically tightened to avoid a “national tragedy” after the national statistics bureau ISTAT said deaths this year would be the highest since World War Two.“We are in a war situation, people don’t realise it but the last time we had this many deaths, bombs were dropping on our cities during the war,” public health professor Walter Ricciardi told the television channel la7 on Tuesday evening.Ricciardi, the adviser to Health Minister Roberto Speranza, said the government, which is considering tightening restrictions over the Christmas and New Year holidays, should lock down the main cities completely.In an interview with Wednesday’s daily La Stampa, he said Rome had been “constantly late” in responding to the second, autumn wave of the virus.Italy reported 846 Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday, taking the official total to 65,857, the fifth highest in the world.As in many other countries, that total is widely considered to be an underestimate because many people who died of Covid-19 during the first wave were never tested for the virus.ISTAT head Gian Carlo Blangiardo said on Tuesday that the overall number of deaths in Italy this year would exceed 700,000, against 647,000 in 2019.“The last time something like this happened was in 1944 when we were at the height of the Second World War,” he told RAI state television.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Tuesday urged Italians to avoid “irresponsible” gatherings over the holidays and said the government might make some “small adjustments” to its current restrictions.But Ricciardi told La Stampa this was not enough:“The Netherlands has locked down with half our deaths, Germany has locked down with a third of them - I don’t understand this hesitation. If we don’t take adequate measures, we are heading for a national tragedy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lock-down-says-italy-adviser-as-deaths-head-for-wartime-levels/story-cTOGe41Rn9EFJRJQUan0UN.html
16-12-2020||World||Australia sues Facebook over user data, echoing US antitrust case||An Australian regulator sued Facebook Inc on Wednesday accusing it of collecting user data without permission, building on government efforts around the world to rein in the social network.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it was seeking an unspecified fine from Facebook for promoting a virtual private network as a way for people to protect their data, while secretly using the information to pick targets for commercial acquisitions.The lawsuit echoes a landmark US Federal Trade Commission action accusing the social media giant of inappropriately maintaining market dominance by using customer data to decide on takeover targets including messaging app Whatsapp and image-sharing app Instagram.“There is a link to what the FTC is saying, but they’re looking at a competition issue,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said at a televised news conference. “We’re looking at the consumer.” A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was “always clear about the information we collect and how it is used”. “We will review the recent filing by the ACCC and will continue to defend our position in response to this recent filing,” she added.Facebook shut down the VPN product in 2019.Earlier this month, Australia went ahead with plans to make Facebook and internet giant Google pay domestic media outlets for content that appeared on their websites, at Sims’s recommendation.The Australian privacy regulator has a separate lawsuit against Facebook accusing it of breaching user privacy with a personality test run by political marketing consultant Cambridge Analytica. Facebook is defending that action. The ACCC is also suing Google alleging it misled users about data collection.Unlike the US lawsuit, which may force Facebook to sell assets, the Australian lawsuit may force the company to change the way it discloses its activities to users, said Rob Nicholls, a University of New South Wales associate professor who specialises in competition law.“Rather than take the antitrust approach of ‘the only way to solve this is to break it up’, it’s more ‘we’re going to take the actions that we can under the existing law to change the conduct so that it is acceptable to Australian consumers and Australian businesses,” Nicholls said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-sues-facebook-over-user-data-echoing-us-antitrust-case/story-SIZ3rezmK50UDpYovKtWVL.html
16-12-2020||World||Quarter of world may not have access to Covid-19 vaccine until 2022: Study||Nearly a quarter of the world’s population may not have access to a Covid-19 vaccine until at least 2022, according to a study published in The BMJ on Wednesday which warns that vaccines will be as challenging to deliver as they were to develop.Another study in the same journal estimates that 3.7 billion adults worldwide are willing to have a Covid-19 vaccine, highlighting the importance of designing fair and equitable strategies to ensure that supply can meet demand, especially in low and middle income countries.These findings together suggest that the operational challenges of the global Covid-19 vaccination programme will be at least as difficult as the scientific challenges associated with their development.In the first study, researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US analysed pre-orders for Covid-19 vaccines ahead of their regulatory approval that had been publicly announced by countries around the world.“This study provides an overview of how high income countries have secured future supplies of Covid-19 vaccines, but that access for the rest of the world is uncertain,” the researchers said.“Governments and manufacturers might provide much needed assurances for equitable allocation of Covid-19 vaccines through greater transparency and accountability over these arrangements,” they said.The researchers noted that by November 15, 2020, several countries had reserved a total of 7.48 billion doses, or 3.76 billion courses from 13 manufacturers, out of 48 Covid-19 vaccine candidates in clinical trials.They said over half (51 per cent) of these doses will go to high income countries, which represent 14% of the world’s population, while low and middle income countries will potentially have the remainder, despite these comprising more than 85% of the world’s population.If all of these vaccine candidates were successfully scaled, the total projected manufacturing capacity would be 5.96 billion courses by the end of 2021, with prices ranging from $6 per course to as high as $74 per course.Up to 40% of the vaccine courses from these manufacturers might potentially remain for low- and middle-income countries, the researchers said.However, this will depend, in part, on how high-income countries share what they procure and whether the US and Russia participate in globally coordinated efforts, they said.The researchers noted that even if all of these vaccine manufacturers were to succeed in reaching their maximum production capacity, at least a fifth of the world’s population would not have access to vaccines until 2022.In the second study, researchers in China and the US estimated target populations for whom vaccines would be required, to help guide development of fair and equitable allocation strategies across the globe.They found that target population sizes for Covid-19 vaccination vary widely by geographical region, vaccine objectives, such as maintaining essential core services, reducing severe Covid-19, and stopping virus transmission, and the impact of vaccine hesitancy in reducing demand.The researchers point to evidence suggesting that around 68% of the global population (3.7 billion adults) is willing to receive a Covid-19 vaccine, and say their findings “provide an evidence base for global, regional, and national vaccine prioritisation and allocation.” “Variations in the size of the target populations within and between regions emphasise the tenuous balance between vaccine demand and supply, especially in low and middle income countries without sufficient capacity to meet domestic demand for Covid-19 vaccine” they said.Both studies are observational, and the researchers acknowledge the implications of uncertainty and incomplete information for their analyses.The findings illustrate the considerable scale and complexity of manufacturing, purchasing, distributing, and administering Covid-19 vaccines in a way that meets global needs, and does so equitably among nations and populations, the researchers said.Jason Schwartz at Yale School of Public Health noted in a linked editorial that many countries have already shown a commitment to equitable global access to Covid-19 vaccines by purchasing through the COVAX Facility -- an initiative that invests part of the payment in vaccines for poorer countries.However, he said vigilance is required “to ensure that such aspirations are realised in the months and years ahead.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quarter-of-world-may-not-have-access-to-covid-19-vaccine-until-2022-study/story-EMffTPGV3qQthmJeFgGZGK.html
16-12-2020||World||US Congress passes defence policy bill that calls out Chinese aggression against India||The US Congress has officially passed the USD 740 billion defence policy bill, which among other things include calling out Chinese aggression against India along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The US House of Representatives and the Senate on Tuesday passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which included key components of Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi’s resolution language urging the Chinese government to end its military aggression against India along the LAC.China and India have been locked in a military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh since May this year. Several rounds of talks between the two countries to resolve the standoff have not yielded any concrete outcome.The House and Senate versions of the bill were reconciled by a bipartisan Congressional conference committee earlier this month.The inclusion of this provision, which Krishnamoorthi led as an amendment when the bill passed the House, reflects the US government’s strong support for its allies and partners like India in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.Krishnamoorthi’s measure, which passed each chamber with overwhelming bipartisan support, will become law if President Donald Trump signs it.Trump has threatened to veto the bill as it lacks a repeal of legal protections for social media companies. However, the NDAA has been passed by Congress for the last 59 years.“Violent aggression is seldom the answer, and this is especially true for the Line of Actual Control, which is the disputed border region that separates the People’s Republic of China from India,” Krishnamoorthi said.“By including my resolution language in the NDAA and signing that legislation into law, the United States government will send a clear message that China’s military provocations of India will not be tolerated,” he said.“The United States is committed to standing with our allies and partners like India in resolving the border standoff using diplomatic means,’ Krishnamoorthi said.As approved by the conference report, the powerful NDAA says that it is the sense of the Congress on the aggression of China along the border with India and its growing territorial claims.The Senate agreed to include the provisions of the bill that was passed by the House in its version of the bill.The House bill contained provisions that would express the sense of Congress on cross-border violence between China and India and the growing territorial claims of Beijing.Expressing “significant concern” over the continued military aggression by China along the border with India, the NDAA says that China “should work with” India toward de-escalating the situation along the Line of Actual Control through existing diplomatic mechanisms and refrain from attempting to settle disputes through coercion or force.Attempts by China to advance baseless territorial claims, including those in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and with respect to Bhutan, are destabilising and inconsistent with international law, says the bill.China is also engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade.

Dash to ratify any agreement||The UK and the European Union will have only days to ratify any post-Brexit trade agreement -- if they manage to reach one this week.After their negotiating teams strike a deal, both sides will begin a race to approve the accord formally before the post-Brexit transition period expires at 11 pm London time on Dec. 31.In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised lawmakers a vote, and hasn’t ruled out holding one on Christmas Day. In Brussels, the process is more complex, involving the bloc’s 27 national governments as well as the European Parliament.There’s a remote chance the process could be delayed by a last-minute intervention by an EU leader like French President Emmanuel Macron, or by opposition in the European or British parliaments. If a deal isn’t approved in time, it could be applied provisionally, pending parliamentary approval -- or Britain could be left facing a spell outside the EU without a trade deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-vote-on-christmas-dash-to-ratify-any-agreement/story-Op2ffy2nhHkKARq3pzFhAM.html
16-12-2020||World||Imran Khan government pushes for early Senate polls to weaken Opposition||Amid political chaos in Pakistan, the federal government has decided to hold Senate elections in February instead of March 2021. The polls are expected to result in the loss of seats for Opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), which currently controls the Upper House.The decision was taken on Tuesday during a meeting of the federal Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, reported Dawn.In a 104-member Senate, elections will be held for 52 seats as many members of the Upper House will be retiring on March 11. The federal government invoked the idea of early elections in order to change the power structure in the Senate.Currently, the Senate is decisively controlled by the constituent parties of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM). Early elections will result in the loss of seats for PDM.The PDM had unanimously decided that its lawmakers will handover resignations to their party chiefs by December 31 and Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari termed that resignations of opposition lawmakers are an ‘atom bomb’ for the incumbent government.The move to resign en masse by PDM will stall the Senate election. The resignations may render the electoral college for Senate elections incomplete which in turn may make the Senate election constitutionally untenable.This, in turn, will ease a lot of the (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) PTI’s current problems such as the passage of legislation considered important by the government but stuck in the Senate.A source disclosed to Dawn that the proposal for the early Senate election was put forth by the Minister of Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhary. The government also invoked advisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on open voting for the polls.Generally, Senate elections are done through secret balloting, but PM Imran Khan desired to hold the election by open ballot or show of hands.The information minister said that the government mulled over getting the bill ratified through several means -- either through a constitutional amendment, executive order, or the election commission.After pondering over the matter, the government decided to move to the apex court regarding the matter, reported Dawn.Meanwhile, PDM has demanded PM Imran Khan-led government quit by January 31 or face intensified movements by opposition parties such as the long march to Islamabad.

16-12-2020||World||Biden names Buttigieg to cabinet in a first for an openly gay person||US President-elect Joe Biden has nominated Pete Buttigieg, the openly gay former mayor, as his transportation secretary. If confirmed, he will be the first LGBTQ person to hold a cabinet post in the country.Biden has also decided to name Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan, to head the department of energy, which is entrusted with the upkeep of the country’s nuclear arsenal. And Gina McCarthy, former head of the Environment Protection Agency under President Barack Obama, will be Biden’s domestic climate policy chief.Buttigieg and Granholm, who had not been officially announced yet, will have to be confirmed by the US Senate.Biden said in a statement he was appointing Buttigieg transportation secretary because “this position stands at the nexus of so many of the interlocking challenges and opportunities ahead of us. Jobs, infrastructure, equity, and climate all come together at the DOT, the site of some of our most ambitious plans to build back better”. “This is a moment of tremendous opportunity—to create jobs, meet the climate challenge, and enhance equity for all,” Buttigieg said in a tweet. “I’m honored that the President-elect has asked me to serve our nation as secretary of transportation.”Buttigieg’s selection is in line with Biden’s promise to name a cabinet that reflects the diversity of the country. He will be joining Neera Tanden, the first Indian American named cabinet secretary to head the budget department; Janet Yellen, the first woman treasury secretary; Lloyd Austin, the first African American nominated for defence secretary; Katherine Tai, the first Taiwanese American named US Trade Representative; and Xavier Becerra and Alejandro Mayorkas, the first Latinos to head the departments of health and homeland security respectively. And, of course, Kamala Harris, the first black, woman, Asian American and Indian American vice-president.“When confirmed, Pete will soon make history as the first Senate-confirmed, openly LGBTQ member of the cabinet -- a milestone worth celebrating,” said Alphonso David, president of Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ advocacy in the United States, in a tweet.The former mayor of South Bend in Indiana state, who is married to Chasten Buttigieg, shot into national prominence as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, going up against stalwarts Biden, a former vice-president then, and Senators Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. He became the first openly gay person to win a presidential primary/caucus, picking up Iowa.Buttigieg was among the first bunch of candidates who left the race and endorsed Biden after the former vice-president won the South Carolina primary, which put him on the path to the nomination and, eventually, the White House.Buttigieg is a former military intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan in 2014. He graduated from Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-names-buttigieg-to-cabinet-in-a-first-for-an-openly-gay-person/story-oDr4TPFIKROqUIivvVP09K.html
16-12-2020||World||Trump supporters accept Joe Biden’s victory ‘with reservations’||Robert Reed says he will always believe the 2020 election was stolen from President Donald Trump. The retired police officer-turned-construction worker believes fraud marred the vote, no matter how many courts rejected that claim. Still, a day after the Electoral College made Joe Biden’s win official, the ardent Trump supporter from the suburbs of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was ready to move on.“I think it’s pretty much over,” Reed said of Trump’s ongoing quest to overturn the results of the election. ”I trust the Electoral College.”For weeks, Trump has been on a mission to convince his loyal base that his victory was stolen and the contest rigged. With help from conservative media, polls show he’s had considerable success. But now that the Electoral College has formalized Biden’s win and Republican officials, including Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, are finally acknowledging him as president-elect, many Trump voters across the country seem to be doing the same.Interviews with voters, along with fresh surveys of Republicans, suggest their unfounded doubts about the integrity of the vote remain. But there is far less consensus on what should be done about it and whether to carry that resentment forward.For some, like Reed, the Electoral College vote was the clear end of a process. Others have vowed to continue to protest with demonstrations like the one that turned violent in Washington, D.C., over the weekend. And some said they hoped GOP leaders would press for more investigations to put the doubts Trump sowed to rest.They are people like Scott Adams, a retiree and Trump voter living in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, who said he accepts Biden’s victory — but “with reservations.”Adams said he’s heard too much discussion about irregularities in the vote count on Fox News and conservative talk radio to trust the election’s outcome and doesn’t feel he’ll ever knows the true margin of victory. (Biden won the Election College by a vote of 306 to 232.)But Adams doesn’t think the election was rigged enough to change the outcome, even if he believes it was “rigged enough that it should be questioned more.” He’d like to see more investigations.Republicans across the country — from local officials to governors to Attorney General William Barr — have said repeatedly there is no evidence mass voter fraud affected the outcome. Trump and his allies brought a flurry of lawsuits, but nearly all have been dismissed by judges. The Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-nominated justices, denied requests to hear a pair of cases aimed at invalidating the outcome of the election in key battleground states.Still, coming to terms with this pile of evidence has been difficult for many Trump voters. They expressed disbelief that Trump could have lost, given the huge crowds he drew to his rallies. Some said their suspicions were heightened by the mainstream media’s reluctance to air Trump’s baseless claims. And they repeatedly pointed to the slower-than-usual vote count as evidence something had gone awry.“Something’s not right here,” said Reed, who lives in East Lampeter Township.The explanation is well known — in many states, an influx of mail-in ballots, overwhelmingly cast by Democrats, were tallied later than ballots cast in person. Still, Reed said he thought the courts should have spent more time investigating.“I’ll always believe that it was stolen from him. I’ll really never be able to have peace of mind that it wasn’t,” he said.Others were less willing to go along.“I don’t trust that result. I think that the election was a fraud. I think the election was stolen. I don’t know how anybody could not think that. All you have to do is look at the results,” said Katherine Negrete, 55, a teacher living in Peoria, Arizona.Negrete is among those who holds out hope that Trump can win if the Supreme Court intervenes (there is no indication that will happen) or Congress chooses to accept an “alternative slate” of Trump electors from several states. Election experts have said that scheme has no legal pathway and Republican Senate leaders have discouraged it.Still, Negrete said, “hopefully Congress will do the right thing” and she expressed frustration with dwindling options.“I don’t know what we can do about that. If we don’t have the courts that stand up for us,” she said. “If we don’t have an attorney general that will stand up and say, ‘This was wrong and we need to investigate it.’ What are we supposed to do? Do we need to fight brother against brother? It’s crazy.”Biden has vowed to bring Americans together and work across the aisle. His success on both fronts may depend on how many Republicans hold on to their election grievances. A Quinnipiac University poll from earlier this month found that 38% of registered voters, including 77% of Republicans, said they believe there was widespread fraud in the presidential election.And a recent Fox News poll found 36% of voters, including 77% of Trump voters, believe the election was stolen from Trump. However, the same poll also found that about 8 in 10 voters overall, and about half of Trump voters, said they will at least give Biden a chance as president.Matt Vereline, 52, a member of the pro-Trump group “Long Island Loud Majority” is not in the mood for reconciliation.Vereline, who lives in Bohemia, New York, is convinced “there was a lot more voter fraud than we know about,” though he’s not sure whether it changed the outcome. But that won’t keep him from rallying around what he thinks was an injustice. After all, that’s what Democrats did to Trump, he says.“Did they not cry for four years about Russian collusion, which wasn’t proven? So now I’m going to to cry about voter fraud for four years,” he said. “They didn’t accept it. Why should I accept Biden? I know I can’t do nothing about it. I know a rally is not going to change the course of who gets elected president. It’s whatever will be will be. But if my friends want to get together and complain about it in a peaceful way and voice our opinions, I’m going.”Others believe Biden won fair and square. Steve Volkman, a Republican who works in construction in Mesa, Arizona, said he made peace with Trump’s loss weeks ago.“I voted for Trump, but people gotta get over it,” Volkman said, while leaning against his pickup truck. “For sure, he (Biden) won the majority vote — landslide. To me, it’s already over.”Catherine Templeton, a South Carolina Republican who served in former Gov. Nikki Haley’s administration, said that, despite the level of support for Trump in red states like her own, she felt sure voters would be willing to accept Biden as president.“Obviously, South Carolina supports President Trump, but I think you’ll see when Republicans don’t get their way, they move on,” said Templeton, who lives in Charleston. “It’s time to move on.”It remains to be seen, for now, how lingering concerns over the integrity of the vote will affect turnout in future elections. Both parties have been focused on Georgia, where a pair of runoff elections will determine which party controls the US Senate.Denise Adams, 50, said she has her doubts about “questionable activity” in the general election. But she turned out to vote early on Monday in Kennesaw, a suburb northwest of Atlanta.“I don’t want to lose our freedoms,” she said, repeating misleading GOP claims that the Democrats would usher in “socialism.” “We’re losing our rights and freedoms in our country.”“I’ve never had a problem before now trusting it, but now I feel like there may be something going on that I don’t trust,” echoed Melissa McJunkin, 40, who remains concerned about the integrity of her vote after hearing stories of voter fraud in the general election, but turned out anyway.“I think it’s important for what’s going to happen next,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-supporters-accept-joe-biden-s-victory-with-reservations/story-efVzjEoXNxpxN9sOpSR6ZJ.html
16-12-2020||World||Congressional ‘gangs’ show Biden what’s possible, and not||It was about more than providing virus aid.Day after day, night after night, the gang of a dozen or so senators met over pizza and Zoom calls, hammering out a framework for a $900 billion-plus COVID-19 virus aid and economic relief package. Their goal was not only to break a stubborn impasse on the pandemic aid, but to show that the old ways of doing business in Washington — in good faith, across party lines, with give-and-take — could still succeed.Their work interjected fresh momentum toward a year-end deal. The White House jumped in with a new proposal. Congressional leaders showed interest. The gridlock seemed to be breaking.But problems quickly flared. Details proved vexing. And by week’s end, the lawmakers involved in the bipartisan talks were admitting that the thorniest problem of all — whether companies, schools and others should be protected from virus-related lawsuits — was something they simply couldn’t solve, at least not yet.For President-elect Joe Biden, it’s a clear indication that there are willing partners in Congress for the kind of consensus building he campaigned on. Yet it’s also a cautionary tale just weeks before his inauguration, showing how difficult it will be to govern from the center at a time when members of Congress, and the country at large, find it hard to bridge the gulf between them.It also showed just how broken Congress, particularly the Senate, has become.“Everyone’s frustrated,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., in an interview. “There are senators on both sides that are very frustrated that essentially the Senate has stopped functioning.”Biden has a track record of cutting deals in Congress, both as a former senator and as vice president to Barack Obama, and the new White House will be closely watched for its expected overtures to the moderates.Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who is known to buck his party, and newly liberated Republicans freed of Trump and eager to deliver for constituents back home will have great sway in the new year.Because the House and Senate will both have slimmer majorities, that creates opportunities for individual lawmakers to gain power by crossing party lines to tip the vote tally. It also means Biden’s administration will likely be forced to rely on Republicans in the House, if the majority Democrats splinter, and in the Senate, regardless of party control after the Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia.The current COVID “gang” leaders, GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, all but extended an invitation to the Biden administration.“We felt the stakes were simply too high to allow partisan warfare to prevent us from delivering relief,” the two senators wrote in an op-ed announcing the bipartisan framework. “The process, too, can serve as a template for progress on other difficult but vital issues in our closely divided Senate.”Yet, as the last week’s negotiations unfolded, it became clear that party leaders still drive the decision making, the final signatories to any deal.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled it was “unlikely” any compromise on the liability issue would be acceptable to Republicans, who hold the majority in the Senate.Aligning with conservative Republicans, McConnell scoffed at “bailouts” for the states — even though some GOP senators would welcome the infusion of cash to pay police, firefighters, public health workers and others back home.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, backed by progressives, rejected the liability shield as unfair to workers who would have little recourse to sue their employers over working conditions during COVID.“It’s an unconscionable position — no relief for the American people unless corporations receive blanket immunity from lawsuits,” Schumer said.Washington cleared out for the weekend, hopes dimmed for a sweeping deal before Christmas.Gangs often emerge in Congress, particularly the Senate, when there’s a vacuum of leadership and lawmakers have pent-up energy to break through the standoffs and find a resolution.During moments of crisis, the gangs usually succeed in focusing attention, building suspense as lawmakers huddle secretly, to develop that most elusive of Washington achievements, a bipartisan compromise.But they don’t always deliver solutions.In 2005, the Gang of 14 bipartisan senators engineered an end to a standoff over Democratic efforts to block then-President George W. Bush’s judicial nominees when all sides agreed to lower the temperature.But the agreement fell apart by 2013 as tensions boiled over with the Republican blockade of Barack Obama’s nominees. Fed up, the Senate majority leader at the time, Democrat Harry Reid, invoked the so-called “nuclear option” — a rules change that reduced the threshold for confirming many judicial and executive branch nominations to a 51-vote majority.McConnell went further in 2017, deploying the “nuclear option” to allow Trump’s Supreme Court picks to be confirmed the same way — what many of today’s senators view as a breaking point for the Senate.Congressional gangs were robust in 2013 as lawmakers tried to strike compromises with Obama.The bipartisan Gang of Eight senators delivered a sweeping immigration overhaul, a hard-fought compromise that passed by a wide margin in the Senate — only to land with a thud in the House. It never became law.Collins and other women led a gang that helped Congress ease out of the 2013 federal shutdown. And Collins helmed another gang during the 2018 shutdown that famously employed a “talking stick” so participants could take turns sharing ideas to end the standoff.Former Senate aide Ryan Nickel sees gangs as the currency of the new Congress, as centrist Democrats and Republicans assert their desire to deliver achievements during in the Biden era.“2021 can be the year of the talking stick caucus,” said Nickel, now a Democratic strategist.Others though, see the gangs as a symptom of a greater problem.Rather than vigorously debate legislation on the Senate floor, leaders shield senators from taking tough votes — or votes on bills that would actually have wide bipartisan support.It’s become a procedural arms race, each side deploying the rules of the chamber to block action, resulting in the stalemates.Merkley is working with senators to envision a functioning Senate: What if the senators took votes on the COVID bill? On amendments to provide money to the states? On the liability protection for businesses and organizations? More unemployment benefits, money for hospitals and vaccines?“At least in voting, our citizens would know where we stood,” he said. “We wouldn’t need a gang right now. We would have had a gang of 100.”___EDITOR’S NOTE — AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro has covered Congress since 2010.

The vaccine will primarily be available to people over 65, those at risk of becoming infected as a result of their professional activities, or those with chronic diseases.At the end of last week, the Saudi Food and Drug Authority approved the registration and use of a vaccine against the new coronavirus produced by the American company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. The first batches of the vaccine have already been received by the kingdom.In recent months, Saudi Arabia has managed to significantly reduce the increase in the number of coronavirus cases, bringing them to just over 200 per day. Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 360,000 people have gone through Covid-19 in the kingdom, with nearly 351,000 recoveries and over 6,000 deaths.

These are shots of the Pfizer Inc-BioNTech SE vaccine candidate, which has been approved for emergency case use by several other countries as well.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe global tally of Covid-19 cases, meanwhile, is at more than 73 million with over 1.6 million lives lost due to the virus, as per worldometers. Nearly 52 million people, too, have defeated the disease, the tally shows.Here are the latest developments on the Covid-19 vaccine development front:1. Dr VK Paul, NITI Aayog member, on Tuesday said the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had recently granted nod for phase 1 and 2 trials of the vaccine candidate of Pune-based Gennova Pharmaceuticals Limited. The firm’s vaccine candidate, called HGCO19, is based on the same technology - mRNA - as that used by the Pfizer vaccine candidate.2. The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) on Tuesday said its preliminary analysis confirmed the safety and efficacy of Moderna’s vaccine candidate. A panel comprising outside experts is likely to approve the vaccine on Thursday, with FDA’s approval to follow soon. The agency’s announcement came a day after the vaccination drive of the Pfizer candidate started across the country.3. Oman joined the list of countries to allow the use of Pfizer’s vaccine candidate, its state-run agency reported on Tuesday. The vaccine, local media, has been approved for use on people above the age of 16. Oman joins neighbours Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in allowing the Pfizer candidate’s shot.4. In an unusual move, Indonesia plans to vaccinate its young people before senior citizens.

Ultimately, President Donald Trump’s EPA repealed the regulation before it got underway.As the White House climate czar, she would work across agencies to ensure a coordinated, approach to confronting climate change. McCarthy would work closely with former Secretary of State John Kerry, who Biden announced in November as special presidential climate envoy focusing on re-entry of the U.S. to the Paris climate accord and related diplomacy.The job doesn’t require Senate confirmation.A McCarthy spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.McCarthy’s appointment comes as Biden seeks to fulfill a campaign promise to make fighting climate change a top priority. Biden has proposed a sweeping $2 trillion climate plan that calls for an emissions-free electric grid in 15 years and net-zero emissions across the entire economy by 2050.McCarthy, 66, who has been president of the Natural Resources Defense Council since January, also took action to cap methane leaks from oil and gas wells and related equipment while head of the EPA. The limits McCarthy’s EPA imposed in 2016 were the first to explicitly regulate the potent greenhouse gas, going beyond existing mandates that focused on other, conventional air pollution at the sites.McCarthy’s previous roles have included serving as commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, where she was instrumental in developing the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multi-state effort to reduce emissions contributing to global warming, according to her NRDC biography.McCarthy, a Boston native, previously advised five Massachusetts governors, including now Senator Mitt Romney. She served as deputy secretary of the Massachusetts Office of Commonwealth Development, and undersecretary of policy for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs.“McCarthy knows the regulatory landscape better than anyone, but also has sharp political instincts to enable parts of their legislative agenda,” Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate aide, said before her apppointment became public. “It’s hard to find both.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-picks-former-epa-chief-mccarthy-as-climate-policy-czar-reports/story-uUy0Lev5bQARVCK3ESxokK.html

This includes all public places, such as the hallway and cafeteria and wearing a mask at all times when you are around other individuals.”According to CNN, the First Lady did not comment on why she removed her mask and if she had received special permission to do so.Diana Troese, Children’s National spokeswoman, citing the Washington, DC, health regulators, said, “Our number one priority at Children’s National Hospital is the safety of our patients, families and employees. Under DC Health regulations, wearing a mask is not required when a person is giving a speech for broadcast or an audience, provided no one is within six feet of the speaker.”“In the case of today’s visit which was broadcast to our 325 patients, while the First Lady did remove her mask while she read a story, she was more than 12 feet away from others in our large atrium. All other people in that space were wearing masks. The remainder of her visit, she wore a mask,” she added.

No statue or memorial should be desecrated and certainly not one like that of Gandhi who really fought for the values that America represents of peace, justice, and freedom.” “It is appalling that it has happened more than once and we believe the reputation of Mahatma Gandhi should be respected, especially here in America’s capital,” she said.A State Department spokesperson said on Tuesday that they were aware of recent protests in front of the Indian Embassy in Washington DC.“We take our responsibility to provide for the safety and security of foreign missions in the US very seriously and are discussing the recent incident with the Indian Embassy,” the spokesperson said.Hundreds of Sikhs from in and around Greater Washington DC area, Maryland and Virginia, along with many from other states like New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina, on Saturday undertook a car rally to the Indian embassy in downtown Washington DC, where they gathered to express solidarity with the protesting Indian farmers.However, the peaceful protest was soon hijacked by the separatist Sikhs who were carrying Khalistani flags with anti-India posters and banners.During the protest, many of the pro-Khalistan Sikh youths flashing kirpans jumped on the statue of Mahatma Gandhi and pasted a poster over it. The group raised anti-India and pro-Khalistan slogans. The Indian embassy condemned the “mischievous act” by hooligans masquerading as protesters.“The statue of Mahatma Gandhi at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Plaza in front of the embassy was defaced by Khalistani elements on 12 December 2020. The Embassy strongly condemns this mischievous act by hooligans masquerading as protesters against the universally respected icon of peace and justice,” it said in a statement.The embassy said it has lodged a strong protest with the US law enforcement agencies and also taken up the matter with the Department of State for an early investigation and action against the culprits under the applicable law. The statue of Mahatma Gandhi was unveiled by then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the presence of then US president Bill Clinton on September 16, 2000, after the US Congress passed a law in 1998.This is for the second time that Gandhi’s statue has been desecrated by miscreants this year.The first such incident was reported on the intervening night of June 2 and 3 when unknown miscreants vandalised his statue outside the Indian embassy in the US with graffiti and spray painting, prompting the mission to register a complaint with the local law enforcement agencies.Vandalism of the statue of the apostle of peace happened during the week of nationwide protests against the custodial killing of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.

Trump and his allies are still protesting the result, but with more than 50 post-election lawsuits rejected, they have no viable path to overturn it.Putin’s telegram came a day after hackers tied to the Russian authorities were suspected of involvement in one of the most audacious attacks on US government agencies in recent memory, as part of a global campaign involving malware inserted into updates by a software maker. Russia has denied involvement. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the allegations, saying, “Once again, I can reject these accusations and once again I want to remind you that it was President Putin who proposed that the American side agree and conclude agreements (with Russia) on cyber security.”Top Republican in Senate congratulates BidenMitch McConnell, the top Republican in the US Senate, has congratulated Biden and vice-president-elect Kamala Harris on their election win. McConnell, who is the Senate majority leader, is the first elected Republican official to acknowledge Biden’s win. “The electoral college has spoken...

16-12-2020||World||WHO to sift Chinese samples, data in hunt for coronavirus origins||A German scientist who is part of a small team of experts assembled by the World Health Organisation to investigate the origins of the coronavirus says they plan to sift through samples and medical data from China to help determine where the bug first jumped from animals to humans and which species it came from.The search for the source of the new coronavirus has sparked claims of cover-ups and fuelled political tensions, particularly between the US administration of President Donald Trump and Beijing. Most researchers think that the virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, originated in animals in China, probably bats, and the WHO has put together a 10-person team to examine the science.Mission member Fabian Leendertz, a biologist at Germany’s Robert Koch Institute who specialised in emerging diseases, said that the goal is to gather data to be better prepared for possible future outbreaks.“It’s really not about finding a guilty country,” Leendertz said. “It’s about trying to understand what happened and then see if based on those data, we can try to reduce the risk in the future.” In an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press, Leendertz said the team has already begun discussions with scientists in China and expects to travel to the country next month. They will likely start in Wuhan, where the outbreak was first reported, though a precise itinerary hasn’t yet been set.Leendertz, who was part of a previous mission to track down the origins of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa, said that while he “would love that to be an Indiana Jones mission” with scientists conducting groundbreaking field work, “it’s more (...) a team effort with Chinese colleagues to help identify the necessary next steps and how to continue,” he said.One of the difficulties is that those who contract Covid-19 can display a wide range of symptoms similar to flu or other diseases, or even no symptoms at all. This makes tracking the chain of infection much harder than with Ebola, which has clear and dramatic symptoms that people remember.Leendertz said scientists would be looking to see whether stored medical samples from before the first known case provide evidence that the virus was circulating earlier than previously thought.“Then to see where that track leads us, if it’s another city or if it stays in Wuhan or where that goes,” he said.Another line of inquiry will be to examine the famous market in Wuhan that was pinpointed early on as a possible location for the leap from animal to human.“It may also be that it was just the first mega spreading event or one of the first,” he said.Tracking down the animal in which the virus emerged will be key, and for this the group will need to take samples of further bat species and other animals that might harbor the microbe.Leendertz said the team has not been informed of any restrictions on their work in China beyond the two-week quarantine all travellers currently face. In total, the mission is expected to last four to five weeks, he said.“There will be a report from that mission, but I’m pretty sure that (it) will not give the full answer,” he said, adding that further research will likely be necessary.Leendertz expressed confidence in China’s “excellent researchers” and said data collected by the country’s extensive disease surveillance system would likely prove valuable.“Also X-rays from the hospitals — we now know quite well what COVID-19 patients look like. ... So that could also be a hint,” he said.“The big scope is to try to find out what happened,” said Leendertz. “How the virus jumped from which animal to perhaps an intermediate host and then to humans. To reconstruct the scenario.” “The more you know about why these spillover events happen, the better you can also check if there are countermeasures you can take to prevent such transmissions in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-to-sift-chinese-samples-data-in-hunt-for-coronavirus-origins/story-SzEoDdX6XrmU6m8ZDFT9pL.html
16-12-2020||World||New figures show British Indians hardest hit by Covid-19 pandemic||Covid-19 has affected the 1.5 million-strong Indian community the most among non-whites in the UK due to a combination of factors: new figures on Tuesday show their mental health was particularly affected, and in England alone, 1,105 from the community have died.Official studies have highlighted the disproportionately adverse impact on Indian and other non-white communities, mainly due to a range of pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and heart ailments; and socio-economic factors such as residential overcrowding and employment in lower-end public facing occupations.A new dimension was added with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) stating that the mental well-being of those in the Indian ethnic group may have been particularly affected by the pandemic as they reported both greater difficulty with sleep over worry between 2019 and the initial period of lockdown (April 2020).The community also had higher scores than other groups on a measure of self-reported mental health difficulties. Loneliness is among the reasons mentioned in the ONS research.Besides, according to latest figures from NHS England, patients categorised as ‘Indian’ in official records topped the list of non-white people who died from the virus: 1,105, accounting for 3 per cent of deaths by ethnicity. The Indian group was followed ‘Pakistani’, with 1,000 deaths.The community’s death figure, however, is expected to be higher, since the NHS England figure relates to only deaths in hospitals and care-homes, excluding those in homes and other settings.On the mental health research, Glenn Everett of ONS said: “What today’s research shows us is how the impact on different ethnic groups varies and how people’s circumstances before the pandemic could affect their experience during the first national lockdown”.“Financial resilience was lower among Black African or Other Black households before the pandemic, for example, which would explain why these groups found it harder to manage financially during lockdown. Perhaps unsurprisingly, mental health deteriorated across most ethnic groups during lockdown but was most marked in the Indian group.”Several Indian-origin doctors, nurses and pharmacists have succumbed to the virus during the year, besides others working in public-facing professions. Funeral agencies catering to the community have been busy during the year.The ONS said that at the start of the UK-wide lockdown earlier in the year, across all ethnic groups, people reported an increased or persistent loss of sleep over worry.After adjusting for age, over one-third (36%) of those from the Indian ethnic group reported this, compared with less than a quarter (23%) of White British respondents and 18% of those in the Other White ethnic groups. When comparing across the groups, respondents from the Indian ethnic group reported a greater average increase than those from the White British ethnic group (0.8).“Taken together with the findings on loss of sleep over worry for the Indian ethnic group, this suggests that their mental well-being may have been particularly challenged by the pandemic, the ONS added.Those of White Irish ethnicity (28%), it said, were more likely to report either continuing to feel lonely often or to experience an increase in feelings of loneliness between 2019 and April 2020 than people from White British (18%) ethnicity. Nearly a quarter of those from the Indian ethnic group (24%) also reported this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-figures-show-british-indians-hardest-hit-by-covid-19-pandemic/story-ME5JAZ1E2CB0guvhWLGEzH.html
