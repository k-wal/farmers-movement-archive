While the potential leveraging of CRISPR to increase human capabilities on the future battlefield remains only a hypothetical possibility at the present, there are indications that Chinese military researchers are starting to explore its potential,” wrote the scholars, Elsa Kania, an expert on Chinese defence technology at the Center for a New American Security, and Wilson VornDick, a consultant on China matters and former Navy officer.“Chinese military scientists and strategists have consistently emphasized that biotechnology could become a ‘new strategic commanding heights of the future Revolution in Military Affairs,’“ the scholars wrote, quoting a 2015 article in a military newspaper.One prominent Chinese general, they noted, said in 2017 that “modern biotechnology and its integration with information, nano(technology), and the cognitive, etc. domains will have revolutionary influences upon weapons and equipment, the combat spaces, the forms of warfare, and military theories.”In a phone interview, VornDick said that he is less concerned about the battlefield advantage such research might provide than he is about the consequences of tampering with human genes.“When we start playing around with genetic organisms, there could be unforeseen consequences,” he said.Representatives of the Chinese government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-official-says-china-conducted-human-tests-to-develop-super-soldiers/story-xPMv7HPyjAUZYGDmybA0uO.html
05-12-2020||World||Hundreds take to streets in Kathmandu supporting return of constitutional monarchy||A pro-monarch march was held in the capital Kathmandu on Saturday where hundreds took to the streets with national flags to extend their support to a constitutional monarchy.Hundreds of monarch supporters took to the streets in a pre-organised and well-advertised rally on December 5 demanding the reinstatement of constitutional monarchy and declare Nepal a Hindu state.Participants of Saturday’s massive rally chanted slogans in favour of the Hindu monarchy and demanded the reinstatement of constitutional monarchy in the Himalayan Nation which they claimed was for the sake of country’s national unity and well-being of the people.“Today, participants are here without being driven by any impulsive feelings, as the movement led by youths has already set off. We can dream of our beautiful Nepal and this nation would obviously get back its monarch status of a Hindu-state. Until and unless we achieve our aim we would fight for it,” Amir KC, one of the participants in the march who claimed to be leading over 250 youths from Lalitpur to the venue told ANI.Saturday’s demonstration comes as a series of similar protests were held in the past month for a constitutional monarchy.On November 10, a group with banner “Nationalist Civic Society” staged a demonstration in Jamal of Kathmandu, demanding restoration of constitutional monarchy and announce Nepal a Hindu state.Two days later, a group named Nepal Scholar Council held a demonstration in Biratnagar with the same demands.Again on November 19, another group under the banner “Independent Nationalist Citizens Far-West” demonstrated in Dhangadhi followed by a protest in Pokhara on November 25 under the banner “Western Nepali Citizens” and “Nepal Nationalist Group” in Janakpur of Nepal.The trend of staging demonstrations in other parts of the country also continued to rise as a similar protest was held in Hetauda on 29 November under the banner “Restoration of Constitution Movement” and another protest on 30 November in Kathmandu itself.Saturday’s demonstration was held under banner of Rashtriya Nagarik Andolan Samiti 2077 (National Civic Movement Committee 2020). Similar kind of protest was planned by Rastriya Prajatantra Party in Jhapa hometown of incumbent Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in support of the monarch and monarchy.Observers in Kathmandu claim movement to reinstate the monarch has arisen due to failed attempts of current political parties to cater to public interest.“When democratic forces don’t live up to expectations-- both ruling and opposition parties-- then it’s inevitable that some alternative force will try to take its place. That is how I see the revival of this protest,” Biswas Baral, current affairs commentator in Kathmandu told ANI.“Many people are unhappy with the working of the current government. It has been seen as a failure in controlling COVID-19, in controlling corruption and in implementing federalism. So, there is general disillusionment amongst people so this (protest) could be an expression of that,” Baral said.Protestors on Saturday displayed placards bearing a photo of Prithivi Narayan Shah, the founding father of modern Nepal along with national flags while they chanted slogans against the Federal Democratic Republican System that Nepal adopted in 2008 after the abolition of 240-year-old monarchy.Nepal has transitioned into a federal democratic republic after the promulgation of a new constitution in 2015. First General Election of 2017 held after promulgation charter gave a clear mandate to an alliance of the then CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) incumbent NCP which is now in power.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli who since then has clung onto power with responsibilities to implement the constitution, strengthen federalism and good governance is now seen to be failing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-take-to-streets-in-kathmandu-supporting-return-of-constitutional-monarchy/story-td0dQQUUsg42oNNDgAhauL.html
05-12-2020||World||Is Georgia a swing state? Groups spend millions to find out||The Georgia US Senate runoffs don’t take place until Jan. 5. But there are already some clear winners.At the state’s most influential television station, Atlanta’s WSB, an ad that cost candidates $8,000 in July now goes for about $18,000. In the smaller market of Savannah, ad rates have soared nearly twentyfold.With control of the Senate, and the scope of President-elect Joe Biden’s agenda in the balance, the millions in political spending verges on something close to an unlimited budget.The contest will test the limits of how far money can go in a political climate in which both sides are entrenched and few voters seem open to changing their minds. And President Donald Trump has complicated the contest by claiming baselessly that the November election in Georgia was beset by fraud.Also at stake: whether Georgia, long a Republican stronghold, may be on the road to swing-state status, particularly after Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1992 to carry the state.Partisans on both sides are spending big to find out.That puts Georgia’s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, in devilish competitions that kicked off after neither won more than 50% of the vote on Election Day. Perdue is seeking reelection against Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff, while Loeffler, who was appointed to her seat, is looking to complete the term of the retired Sen. Johnny Isakson, running against Democrat Raphael Warnock.If Republicans win one race, they will maintain a narrow majority, and the chamber will serve as a bulwark against Democratic ambitions. But if Democrats carry both, the balance will be 50-50 —with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris delivering tie-breaking votes. That will enable Biden to enact a more ambitious agenda, assuming he can keep fellow Democrats on board.“Everyone is aware of the stakes of these two seats,” said Bradley Beychok, the president of American Bridge, a major Democratic outside group that has pledged to spend millions reaching out to rural voters. “There’s a narrative that Democrats have an uphill battle, but we just won Georgia and we’re ready to go fight.”As both parties shovel resources into the state, some speculate that the cost of the abbreviated contest could approach $500 million. Already, $329 million in advertising has been spent or reserved in the state since Election Day, according to data from the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG.Campaign finance disclosures made public Thursday suggest Republican outside groups have a fundraising advantage. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which has formed a joint big-dollar fundraising operation with the two candidates that is led by longtime Republican operative Karl Rove, reported raising $75.5 million since Oct. 15. Its counterpart, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, raised $31.6 million during the same period.Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, reported raising $71 million since Election Day, compared with $10.2 million raised by Senate Majority PAC, its Democratic rival.The candidates won’t have to make the finances public until Dec. 24.“Money isn’t everything, but fundraising is an early leading indicator of enthusiasm,” Steven Law, president of Senate Leadership Fund, said during an appearance on Fox News on Thursday. “Republican voters in Georgia understand that everything is at stake. The Trump legacy, the future of freedom, the future of socialism, and right now they seem very energized to vote.”Much of the money raised by the group came from Republican megadonors, including $15 million from Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO of the private equity firm Blackstone; $10 million from Kenneth Griffin, the CEO of the hedge fund Citadel; and $5 million from Steve Wynn, the former head of Wynn Resorts who stepped down after he was accused of sexual misconduct, allegations he denies.Major Democratic committees focused on the Senate may have posted lackluster fundraising totals on Thursday, but party strategists say donors are instead routing cash to groups that are already established in the state.Many of those groups are holding their strategy, tactics and bottom line close after record-setting hauls for Senate candidates in the fall ended in disappointment for candidates like Jaime Harrison of South Carolina, MJ Hegar of Texas and Steve Bullock of Montana. In some of those cases, the widely publicized fundraising success contributed to perceptions that they were funded by out-of-state interests.While Biden’s campaign ran operations in Georgia until the Nov. 3 election, Senate Democrats’ campaign arm is in charge now. Their efforts include paid door-to-door canvassing — a difference from the fall when the Biden campaign discouraged Democrats from in-person canvassing.Among the most high-profile movers on the left is the Fair Fight organization, which voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams organized after her loss in the 2018 Georgia governor’s race. Abrams’ group on Thursday reported raising $34.5 million between Oct. 15 and Nov. 23. That’s not the same eye-popping numbers of some of the major party PACs, but it’s targeted on voter turnout. As an example, Fair Fight texted 2 million voters within days of the runoffs being set with information about how to secure absentee ballots for the second round. That’s about 80% of the total number of votes that Biden received in Georgia.“People are very inspired by the Stacey Abrams magic,” said Michael Smith, a Los Angeles donor who has given to several groups raising money for the Georgia Democrats. “Everyone in LA is raising money for Georgia. It’s a moral issue.”Another group, called Really American PAC, has raised over $593,000 and hopes to put up 50 billboards in rural counties that urge Trump supporters to sit out the election, echoing a sentiment shared by some of the president’s most dejected supporters.The group says twelve billboards have gone up so far, which state: “Perdue/Loeffler Didn’t Deliver For Trump, DON’T Deliver For Them.” And at first blush, they look like an ad from a right-leaning group.In reality, however, Really American PAC was created by a progressive activist from Chicago named Justin Horwitz, who says he has a “shared interest” with the president’s supporters in “defeating Washington insiders Perdue, Loeffler & McConnell, who happen to be trying to destroy Trump.”That gets to the center of a preoccupation for Republicans.Trump, who will hold a rally in the state Saturday, has refused to concede the election and has repeatedly attacked Georgia’s Republican governor and secretary of state while falsely saying Biden’s win there was the product of voter fraud.That forces Loeffler and Perdue into a delicate dance of needing to both fire up Trump’s core supporters who may distrust the outcome of the election, while not alienating suburban moderates, as well as anti-Trump Republicans, who swung for Biden.Both candidates are scheduled to attend Trump’s rally.“I think it’s fraught with risk. If I’m Loeffler or Perdue, I wouldn’t want him to come,” said Dan Eberhart, a GOP donor who has previously given more than $190,000 to Trump’s election efforts. “With the undisciplined nature of Donald Trump, there could be one, two or three sentences that completely derail and change the direction of the campaign.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-georgia-a-swing-state-groups-spend-millions-to-find-out/story-1ts3nC4DtSAONptXfvVLwK.html
05-12-2020||World||A bleak outlook for millions facing cutoff of US jobless aid||Tina Morton recently faced a choice: Pay bills — or buy a birthday gift for a child? Derrisa Green is falling further behind on rent. Sylvia Soliz has had her electricity cut off.Unemployment has forced aching decisions on millions of Americans and their families in the face of a rampaging viral pandemic that has closed shops and restaurants, paralyzed travel and left millions jobless for months. Now, their predicaments stand to grow bleaker yet if Congress fails to extend two unemployment programs that are set to expire the day after Christmas.If no agreement is reached in negotiations taking place on Capitol Hill, more than 9 million people will lose federal jobless aid that averages about $320 a week and that typically serves as their only source of income.Green, 39, and her husband are among them. An end to their unemployment benefits would force them to keep missing rent payments on their home in Dyer, Indiana, near Chicago. The couple have eight children. Green’s husband is a self-employed truck driver whose business disappeared when the pandemic erupted in the spring. Only in October did he start to pick up occasional work.He now receives about $235 a week in unemployment aid. Even so, “all of our bills are late,” Green said. They’ve received several shutoff notices from utilities before managing to pay just before service was to be cut off.“That’s really scary,” Green said, “because what are we going to do when we lose the unemployment money?”The end of jobless aid is approaching at an especially perilous time. Job growth slowed sharply in November, and the resurgence of viral cases appears to be out of control across the country.Even with the prospect of an effective vaccine being widely distributed in coming months, economists say the picture will worsen before it improves. Many foresee a net loss of jobs in December for the first time since April.On Friday, President-elect Joe Biden called on Congress to quickly approve a bipartisan $908 billion package that would establish a $300-a-week jobless benefit as well as send aid to states and localities, help schools and universities, revive subsidies for businesses and support transit systems and airlines. Details are still being worked out, but the outlines of a final bill could emerge soon.More than 20 million people are now receiving unemployment benefits. More than half are beneficiaries of two programs that were part of rescue aid legislation Congress enacted in March. One program made self-employed and contract workers eligible for jobless aid for the first time and provided 39 weeks of support. The other program supplied 13 weeks of extended benefits to the 26 weeks that most states provide.About 9.1 million who are receiving aid from those programs will be cut off Dec. 26, according to a report from the Century Foundation. An additional 4.4 million are expected to exhaust all 39 weeks by year’s end. If Congress agrees to provide more weeks of aid and to revive both programs, those beneficiaries could keep receiving aid next year.That would be a life-saver for Sylvia Soliz who lives in Corpus Christi, Texas. Soliz, 36, who still owes part of her rent for November and December, has received an eviction notice. She’s also just had her electricity cut off.Back in March, Soliz was laid off from her job as a nurse’s assistant at a senior living facility. She’s now receiving $414 in jobless aid every two weeks. With four children, it doesn’t go very far.“The day I get it, it’s already gone because my kids need so many things,” Soliz said. “Of course, I have to pay a portion to whatever bill I have, so that way I can stretch it out. But every time another check comes in, it’s another bill.”Soliz is applying for a new job, and she checks in with her old employer. So far, no luck. She also worries about contracting COVID-19. Soliz is hopeful that Congress will agree to provide more aid, but she feels “they are basically gambling with us.”A cutoff of jobless benefits now, with so many millions of Americans still receiving the aid, would be unusually early compared with previous recessions. In the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the government extended unemployment benefits to 99 weeks, and the additional aid lasted through 2013. When that program ended, about 1.3 million people lost benefits — a small fraction of the number who would lose jobless aid this time.Other government protections will also expire at the end of this year, including a federal moratorium on evictions for renters. A suspension of payments on federal student loans will expire at the end of January.“I am very afraid of people facing homelessness — that’s our top concern,” said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation. “It’s a terrible unforced policy error to make. It will slow the recovery that we’re having by cutting off these benefits so early.”About one in six renters in the United States are behind on their rent, according to a survey from the Census Bureau. And 12% of adults say their families didn’t have enough to eat at some point in the past week, the survey found. That’s up from just 3.7% in 2019, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.A wrenching set of choices has confronted Keli Paaske, who lives in the Kansas City area. Since being furloughed in the spring from her sales job at a company that makes fire doors, Paaske, 56, has cut back her grocery budget. She thought she’d be called back once the virus waned. But when her boss phoned in August, it was with a different message: Her job had been eliminated.Paaske had hesitated to spend $360 needed to euthanize her 15-year old dog, who had a brain tumor, before going through with it. Without unemployment aid, Paaske isn’t sure how she would manage. She may seek financial help from her parents, who are in their 80s, something she has resisted doing. If she doesn’t find a job by March, she said, she’ll stop leasing her car.Across the country, a cutoff of jobless aid would disproportionately affect Black Americans, according to data from the Century Foundation. About 18% of unemployment aid recipients are Black, the Foundation said, though Black Americans make up just 12% of the workforce. More than 57% of recipients are white. Nearly 13% are Latino. (There is no demographic data on about one-fifth of recipients.)Tina Morton used to clean houses near where she lives in Winchester, Kentucky. But there’s been little work since the pandemic struck. Like many other single mothers, she has struggled with the need to find another job while simultaneously caring for children — a son and two nephews she has custody of — who are attending school online at home.“Single parents cannot go out here and ... just find any job,” said Morton, 39. “We’ve got our kids here that are stuck at home.”Last week, Morton had to choose between paying a phone bill and buying one of her nephews a birthday present. (She got him a present). If her jobless aid ends, she expects to face painful decisions.She’s particularly worried about her two nephews.“That’s what hurts me the most,” she said. “My job is to give them more — give them better than where they came from.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-bleak-outlook-for-millions-facing-cutoff-of-us-jobless-aid/story-36coPNyDjebtq6uUb0f33M.html

Power outages are possible.The nor’easter could dump as much as a foot (30 centimeters) of snow on suburban Boston.National Weather Service Meteorologist Michael Clair of the Gray, Maine, office said the storm is beginning as rain and is expected to turn to snow Saturday afternoon. In some areas snowfall of up to 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) per hour is possible.“This is the first big one,” Clair said of the beginning of the winter season. “There has been some snow up in the mountains, but this is the first one across where most people live.”While localized totals of more than 18 inches are possible in the higher terrain, Clair says that in general, the region is expected to get hit hardest just inland from the coast, where forecasts call for about a foot of snow.Areas south of New England, including the New York region, are expected to see heavy rain and strong winds.In Canada, the storm is expected to affect southern Quebec and New Brunswick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/northeastern-us-braces-for-wet-windy-snowy-storm/story-VPRtJbkcwhmooC56prVFUM.html
05-12-2020||World||China, US need to proceed together with ‘good will’, says Chinese envoy||China and the United States need to proceed together with “good will” to improve relations, the Chinese ambassador to Washington said on Saturday, as ties remained fraught between the world’s two biggest economic powers. Sino-US relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades over issues from trade and security to human rights and Covid-19. On Friday, a Chinese state media editorial said ties are being shifted to “a dangerous path”.“In order to put the relations on the right track, to have real improvement of the relations, both sides have to proceed with good will and good faith,” Ambassador Cui Tiankai told the Annual Conference of the Institute for China-America Studies via video link. “I don’t think that China should just do something to please anybody here,” he said, according to a transcript posted on his embassy’s website. Tensions between the two countries dramatically escalated in July when China closed the US consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu in retaliation for Beijing’s ouster from its consulate in Houston, Texas.Also Read | US suspends exchange programs with China, calling them ‘propaganda’Earlier in the year, Washington cut the number of Chinese nationals allowed to work at the US offices of major Chinese state media. Beijing then expelled US journalists in the China bureaus of New York Times, Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post.POSITIVE GESTURES When asked by President of the National Committee on United States-China Relations Steve Orlins if China is prepared to reopen the Chengdu consulate among other positive gestures before President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January, Cui did not rule out the possibility. “I have to say we did not initiate the closing of consulates. We were not the first one to ask foreign journalists to leave the country. We did all these things in response to actions taken by the United States. So if the US government is ready to reverse the course, we are ready to look at it,” Cui said. But, Orlins said, Beijing had unilaterally taken measures against US interests, including the blocking of the three newspapers’ websites, as well as Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter, and that Washington had not responded to those actions. “There were provocations. If you look at what happened in the past year or so,” Cui replied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-need-to-proceed-together-with-good-will-says-chinese-envoy/story-3A5SFIbFxrtbkxGOF7601N.html

The police fired back volleys of tear gas.Thousands of people had began marching peacefully in Paris when the clashes erupted between police and pockets of protesters, most dressed in black and their faces covered. Some used hammers to break up paving stones. The protesters were denouncing police brutality and President Emmanuel Macron’s security policy plans which the demonstrators say would restrict civil liberties.They waved banners that read “France, land of police rights” and “Withdrawal of the security law”.Paris police said that some 500 “casseurs” - which translates as hoodlums or rioters - had infiltrated the protest, according to BFM TV. Twenty-two arrests had been made, the force added.France has been hit by a wave of street protests after the government introduced a security bill in parliament that set out to increase its surveillance tools and restrict rights on circulating images of police officers in the media and online.The bill was part of Macron’s drive to get tougher on law and order ahead of elections in 2022. His government also said the police needed to be better protected from online hate.But the draft legislation provoked a public backlash.The beating of a Black man, music producer Michel Zecler, by several police officers in late November intensified anger. That incident came to light after closed circuit television and mobile phone footage circulated online. In a U-turn earlier this week, Macron’s ruling party said it would rewrite the article that curbs rights to circulate images of police officers. But many opponents say that is not enough.“We’re heading towards an increasingly significant limitation of freedoms. There is no justification,” said Paris resident Karine ShebaboAnother protester, Xavier Molenat, said: “France has this habit of curbing freedoms while preaching their importance to others.” As darkness fell, live television images showed one group of anarchists ransacking the branch office of a bank, throwing piles of paperwork onto a fire burning on the pavement outside.There were peaceful protests in Marseille, Lyon, Rennes and other big cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-erupts-during-paris-protest-against-police-brutality/story-x3YAIDPUne549wFJuwG1FM.html

05-12-2020||World||Gregory Meeks, new head of US congressional body on foreign policy, is a Gandhi acolyte||Gregory Meeks, who Thursday became the first African-American to head the foreign relations committee of the US House of Representatives, has been a longtime believer in Mahatma Gandhi going back by decades, and he reconnected with its past October 2.As a freshman member of the House in 1998, Meeks had co-sponsored a legislation that allowed the Indian embassy to install a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in a small park across the road.Meeks was chief guest at a Gandhi Jayanti event at the site of the statue last October 2.“Paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi with Congressman @RepGtegoryMeeks, Senior Member of @HouseForeign. Fondly recalled the role of Congressman John Lewis, Congressman Meeks, & @TheBlackCaucus in the establishment of Gandhi Memorial in Washington DC,” Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Indian ambassador to the US, had tweeted at the time.US civil rights leader Martin Luther King was inspired by Gandhi and travelled to India in 1959 on a visit that he had described as pilgrimage. Congressman Lewis, who passed away earlier this year, was a close associate of King and tried for years to enact a King-Gandhi Knowledge Initiative Bill, which was passed by the House on Thursday. It is co-sponsored by Ami Bera, an Indian-American lawmaker.On Thursday, Meeks was elected to head the next House foreign affairs committee, beating Representative Julian Castro.“The committee under the next Congress will preside over an historic shift in US foreign policy, and there is no shortage of work ahead of us,” Meeks said in a statement after his election.He added, “This will not be a return to normal, but a leap towards a new way of doing business. We will broaden our scope and outreach to parts of the world we’ve historically overlooked. We will return as partners to our European allies, but we will also need to build new multilateral relationships in the Western Hemisphere and Africa. We can only address the systemic challenges posed by Moscow and Beijing with the help of like-minded friends.”Meeks succeeds Eliot Engel, an ardent supporter of strong ties with India, who founded the India Caucus in the House. The longtime congressman from New York lost the 2020 primaries to fellow Democrat Jamaal Bowman, who starts his first term in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gregory-meeks-new-head-of-us-congressional-body-on-foreign-policy-is-a-gandhi-acolyte/story-PsTL9n4ZvotIZhM8E6h7iM.html
05-12-2020||World||Farmers’ protest in India: UK refuses to take stand on 36 MPs seeking intervention||The UK government on Saturday refused to be drawn into the farmers’ protest in India, hours after 36 British MPs asked foreign secretary Dominic Raab in a letter to raise the issue with the Indian government.A foreign office spokesperson said, “The police handling of protests are a matter for the government of India.”The 36 MPs from various parties - including some of Indian origin and others representing many constituents with links in Punjab - sought an urgent meeting with Raab and an update on representations the foreign office may have made on the issue, including during the recent visit to London of foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla.UK foreign office officials said on condition of anonymity that Raab’s office had not yet received the letter, which has been coordinated by Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi and circulated on social media. Signatories to the letter include MPs from Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, including former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Virendra Sharma, Seema Malhotra, Valerie Vaz, Nadia Whittome, Peter Bottomley, John McDonnell, Martin Docherty-Hughes and Alison Thewliss.The letter says, “This is an issue of particular concern to Sikhs in the UK and those linked to Punjab, although it also heavily impacts other Indian states. Many British Sikhs and Punjabis have taken this matter up with their MPs, as they are directly affected, with family members and ancestral land in Punjab.”Stating that several MPs had recently written to the Indian high commission about the impact of India’s three farm laws, the letter alleges that they fail “to protect farmers from exploitation and to ensure fair prices for their produce”.British MPs have also been commenting on the farmers agitation on social media in recent days.Preet Kaur Gill, Labour MP from Birmingham Edgbaston and chair of the All Party Parliamentary Party for British Sikhs, reacted to images of protests from New Delhi, saying, “This is no way to treat citizens who are peacefully protesting over the controversial farmers’ bills in India.”“Shocking scenes from Delhi. Farmers are peacefully protesting over controversial bills that will impact their livelihoods. Water cannons and tear gas, are being used to silence them,” she tweeted.Dhesi posted images from the protests and said, “It takes a special kind of people to feed those ordered to beat and suppress them. I stand with farmers of #Punjab and other parts of #India, including our family and friends, who are peacefully protesting against the encroaching privatisation of #FarmersBill2020.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farmers-protest-in-india-uk-refuses-to-take-stand-on-36-mps-seeking-intervention/story-FJyuJKDfgxAlYgyACkb8xL.html

Its committee on human rights of parliaments examined 552 cases against MPs in 42 countries; compared to 533 in 2019.The figures, it said, reveal an uptick in acts of intimidation and violence, with women MPs suffering more. Of the 552 cases, 43 were reported from Venezuela, and 83 from 13 countries were new this year. Opposition MPs accounted for 85% of the cases.The most common human rights violations, the IPU said, were undue suspension and loss of parliamentary mandate; lack of fair trial and other unfair proceedings; threats, acts of intimidation; and violation of freedom of expression.The figures reveal that women MPs are significantly more exposed to torture, ill treatment and acts of violence, with 34% of women parliamentarians considered by the IPU affected compared with 18% of male colleagues. In 2020, the IPU examined 98 cases concerning women parliamentarians, up from 85 in 2019. This represented 18% of all cases before the committee and almost three times higher than the figure from six years ago (34 women in 2014).Lobbying from the IPU and the global parliamentary community contributed to the release of some parliamentarians from detention; for example, four MPs were freed in Ivory Coast.For the fifth year in a row, the IPU said the Americas account for the greatest proportion of human rights violations against parliamentarians: 32% (178 cases out of 552) - driven by a large caseload from Venezuela.“The coronavirus pandemic has provided an opportunity for some governments to act against opposition MPs using lockdown laws to detain or otherwise infringe upon the rights of opposition parliamentarians, notably in Venezuela, Uganda and Zimbabwe,” IPU said. Founded over 130 years ago, the IPU describes itself as the first multilateral political organisation in the world, encouraging cooperation and dialogue between all nations. Its membership comprises 179 national parliaments and 13 regional parliamentary bodies.The IPU convenes twice a year over 1,500 parliamentary delegates and partners in a world assembly, bringing a parliamentary dimension to global governance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-lawmakers-faced-human-rights-violations-in-2020-ipu/story-rIGtjDyAsEuAVCph2uN68L.html
05-12-2020||World||German court upholds ban on Covid-19 demonstration||Germany’s highest court upheld on Saturday a ban on a demonstration in the northern city of Bremen planned by opponents of lockdown measures aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Lower courts had already denied permission for the protest, planned for Saturday afternoon, at which 20,000 demonstrators were due to convene in the city centre of Bremen.Last month, German police unleashed water cannon and pepper spray in an effort to scatter thousands of protesters in Berlin angry about coronavirus restrictions.Although most Germans accept the latest “lockdown light” to curb the spread of the coronavirus in a second wave, critics say the amendment endangers citizens’ civil rights.The head of Germany’s public health agency said on Thursday that the country’s success in dealing with the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in March and April had led many people to doubt the virus’s severity or even its existence.Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute for Infectious Diseases (RKI), said this meant many were now failing to take social distancing and quarantine rules seriously enough, leading to the high level of cases Germany is now seeing.While daily infection numbers are no longer rising as sharply as previously, case numbers have stagnated at a high level, and Germany reported its highest single-day death toll since the start of the pandemic on Wednesday.On Saturday, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 23,318 to 1,153,556, RKI data showed, while the reported death toll rose by 483 to 18,517.Chancellor Angel Merkel and state leaders agreed on Wednesday to extend restrictive measures, which include keeping restaurants and hotels shut and limiting private gatherings to five people from two households, until Jan. 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-court-upholds-ban-on-covid-19-demonstration/story-PwNoUhOVHA5GeHUkOKegcI.html

05-12-2020||World||Germany can keep spending to contend With Covid-19 pandemic, says Angela Merkel||Germany will be able to continue to spend “large sums” next year to contend with the economic fallout from the pandemic, Chancellor Angela Merkel said as the country’s parliament prepares to vote on the federal budget next week.“We were able to deploy large sums in 2020 and we will be able to do so in 2021 because we have managed our finances well in the past years,” Merkel said. She cited Germany’s ability to avoid building up new borrowing and touted its position as the least-indebted country in the Group of Seven.Merkel defended the debt-funded stimulus measures her government undertook this year, saying that the cost of not acting would have been far higher because companies would have gone bust and millions of jobs would be lost.“Of course we cannot maintain this level of support forever and it’s also clear that we will have to work off this exceptional debt from 2023,” Merkel said in her weekly podcast. “We already see enormous budgetary challenges for the coming years.”Merkel suggested those challenges will have to be shouldered by Germany’s different levels of government, saying federal, state and municipal authorities “have to work together constructively to master the pandemic and its consequences as well as we can.”The chancellor said she hopes that one or more vaccinations will be available soon, but she damped expectations for a quick end to the coronavirus. “This will not be a question of just a few months, let’s be very realistic,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-can-keep-spending-to-contend-with-covid-19-pandemic-says-angela-merkel/story-BbmqfAmFUSxXUzMF98Gv5L.html

We couldn’t bathe and suffered very much.”“Bhasan Char has building to live in and other facilities, we will find comfort and peace there. That’s why I am going there on my own will,” she added.While echoing similar sentiments, the Rohingya refugees have emphasised that their decision to shift is not due to any pressure from the government authorities.They said that the pictures and videos of Bhasan Char have made them feel that the place will ensure the safety, The Daily Star reported.The refugees further said that there was a lot of discord among people and “ little to no scope for work or proper education” in the Cox’s Bazar refugee camps.“There was unrest in the camps and too many fights used to take place,” said Khatun.Earlier, Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen had said in a statement that the government will not be forcing the Rohingyas to shift to Bhasan Char.“We are not taking Rohingyas to Bhasan Char forcibly. We’re taking those who are willing to go. They are going to Bhasan Char voluntarily,” he said.Nearly one million Rohingyas, who fled from their native Myanmar in 2018 to escape atrocities from the armed forces, are living in refugee camps across the world, mostly in Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rohingya-refugees-relocating-to-bhasan-char-voluntarily-hoping-for-peace-comfort-and-nice-housing/story-FYEWO5g9YfKNdzYIAKnyRP.html
05-12-2020||World||Romanian election expected to usher in ‘European’ generation||Romanians will vote Sunday in a legislative election expected to restore some measure of stability in a country with one of the European Union’s highest emigration rates, and bring to power a generation that came of age in a time of national turmoil and strongly identifies as European Union(EU).Cabinet shakeups and no-confidence votes have given Romania five prime ministers in as many years. According to most pre-election polls, the weekend vote is likely to favor reform-oriented politicians united in their resolve to keep Romania in step with the EU mainstream and away from the camp of other post-communist nations, such as Hungary and Poland, with their populist, euroskeptic leaders.The center-right National Liberal Party, known by its Romanian acronym PNL, appears set to become the top vote-getter. But the mainstay party of Romania’s EU-aligned, austerity-prone social conservatives is expected to fall far short of a parliamentary majority.Its main rival, the left-leaning, Populist Social Democratic Party, or PSD in Romanian, won the last election in 2016 and ran through three prime ministers before PNL first took the reins of a minority government a year ago. The PSD-led government had drawn heavy criticism from the EU for its interference with the judiciary and a cascade of corruption scandals involving some of its most prominent members.The Social Democrats’ chaotic tenure triggered two years of massive street protests that gave voice to a new generation of relatively young, foreign-educated and proudly European politicians who point to widespread graft and fraud in Romanian government ministries and state institutions. Some of them now are running for seats in parliament.“There are many state institutions under political control which function really badly, and the problems there need to be exposed,” said Valeriu Nicolae, a human rights activist who is running as an independent candidate. “MPs never tackled these issues because everyone has an interest in these state institutions. They either have relatives working there, friends or party members, and it’s not nice to expose your friends.”Nicolae is an initiator of the RESPECT anti-racism campaign in football, launched at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, one of the most visible campaigns of this sort in the world, and says that in the past he was “treated horribly (for) being Roma” in Romania.He said he decided to run after witnessing what he considered to be a weak effort to prevent “a man accused of horrible things and a very dubious person” winning a district mayor’s election in the capital, Bucharest. In one week, Nicolae collected 13,000 qualifying signatures, 3,500 more than he needed to get on Sunday’s ballot.“I am convinced that (change) is possible,” he said. “I am not bound by an interest to protect my political career. My life quality will suffer if I get into parliament.”A more organized new force is USR-PLUS, a mix of pro-EU technocrats, and social-justice, and anti-corruption activists that coalesced last year into a progressive political alliance. Polls predict the alliance, whose members hold divergent views on many cultural issues, will get around 20% of Sunday’s vote for both chambers of parliament.That’s the same share forecast for the PSD, which has dominated Romanian politics since the fall of communism in 1989.The alliance has targeted young and disillusioned voters, including with pledges to depoliticize and fully reform Romania’s civil service and eradicate corruption. It has also promised to eliminate income tax for minimum-wage workers and create well-paying jobs to lure back young, highly educated Romanians who have been leaving in droves since the country joined the EU in 2007.“It’s good to see a new generation of leaders who understand the needs of our society and are professionally and personally fit to meet them,” said Dacian Ciolos, who represents Romania in the European Parliament and is one of the progressive alliance’s top leaders. “It puts pressure on us, as a new political entity, because we have to meet higher expectations.”The alliance has pledged not to be part of a parliamentary majority that would include the PSD, which has accused prominent USR-PLUS members of being part of a dark anti-Romanian conspiracy linked to Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, a favorite bogeyman of Central European populists. At the same time, USR-PLUS has indicated it has no intention of playing second fiddle to the PNL in a future coalition government.Some analysts predict the USR-PLUS alliance will try to assert itself in a future governing coalition by demanding a reconfiguration of the government and the prime minister’s job for Ciolos, 51. He served a stint at the helm of Romania’s first, short-lived technocratic government several years ago.It would be a bitter pill for the PNL, but one it might be forced to swallow if it wants to preserve its image as a party driven by a genuine desire to rid Romania of a corruptive welfare state model, which it blames on PSD’s decades-long dominance. Most analysts think the conservative PNL and the progressive alliance will find a compromise.“It’s in their best interest to govern together despite their (ideological and economic) differences which are incomprehensible to most of their supporters,” political analyst Andrei Taranu said.Romania was plagued by widespread poverty before the coronavirus pandemic, with over 25% of the population of 19 million living on less than $5.50 a day. The pandemic has exacerbated structural problems, including the near collapse of the public health care system.To date, the EU’s seventh-most populous country has confirmed over a half-million virus cases and more than 12,000 deaths. As a result of the pandemic and virus containment measures, Romania’s fiscal deficit is expected to widen this year to around 9% of gross domestic product, compared with 4.3% in 2019.Nicolae, who himself grew up in poverty, has dedicated his life to helping vulnerable children escape a life of misery and drug-abuse, and giving them access to education.“Although I say all the time ‘I’m a gypsy I’m a gypsy,’ people no longer register me like that” he said. ”That I, a Romanian Roma, ran as an independent and I managed to gather the necessary signatures, is a very good signal. And if I win, it would be a great signal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/romanian-election-expected-to-usher-in-european-generation/story-bxNLCebtORLtlGwfM4m3lM.html
05-12-2020||World||Covid-19: No UK quarantine for business activity from today||There will be no mandatory 14-day Covid-19 quarantine from Saturday for individuals arriving in England for business activity that delivers significant benefit to the British economy, the UK government said, announcing a list of exemptions.From 4am on Saturday, individuals undertaking specific business activity that would deliver a significant benefit to the economy - including activity that creates or preserves more than 50 UK jobs - will no longer need to self-isolate when travelling or returning from non-exempt countries.Scheduled international flights are currently suspended, but a limited number of flights are operating between the UK and India under a bilateral agreement. Such flights are subject to eligibility criteria and details may change at short notice, the foreign office said.Individuals will only be exempt from quarantine requirements when undertaking the specific business activity and will only be able to meet with others as required by that specific activity, the announcement said.Exemptions will also come into force at the same time for domestic and international performing arts professionals, TV production staff, journalists, and recently signed elite sportspersons, to ensure that industries that require high-talent individuals who rely on international connections can continue to complete their work.Health officials at Public Health England do not anticipate that the exemptions will raise the risk of domestic transmission, due to the protocols being put in place around these exemptions, but add that all exemptions will remain under review.From December 15, the quarantine period for all others arriving in England will be reduced to five days if a test taken five days after arrival proves negative. The relaxation has been welcomed by the struggling tourism and airline sectors as being “long overdue”.Passengers arriving into England from countries not on the government’s travel corridor list will have the option to take the test after five days of self-isolation, with a negative result releasing them from the need to isolate.Under the plan called “test to release”, officials said passengers arriving into England by plane, ferry or train should book their test before they travel; must complete a passenger locator form; and will still need to self-isolate for five days before taking the test.The test will need to booked at the traveller’s expense from an approved list of providers. Those choosing not to take a test when arriving from a non-exempt country must continue to follow the current self-isolation requirements of 14 days.The plan has been put in place based on advice from a consortium of expert representatives from the aviation, maritime, international rail, tourism and hospitality industries to boost international travel for all modes, whilst safeguarding public health in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-no-uk-quarantine-for-business-activity-from-today/story-rOF6Frqj6504dgR4RhwtaP.html
05-12-2020||World||Russia starts preparing for lower budget revenues as global oil demand declines||The finance ministry of the world’s biggest energy exporter has started preparing for the possibility of lower budget revenues in case global oil demand declines sooner than expected.“The peak of consumption may have already passed,” Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev said in an interview in Moscow. “The risk is rising in the longer term” that hydrocarbon revenues could come in below the current outlook, he said.The comments are a rare admission from a senior Russian official that the best days may be over for the energy revenues that drive the economy. President Vladimir Putin said in October that growing demand from Asia will support Russian energy exports in the coming decades and the Economy Ministry forecast in March that oil consumption will peak around 2045.The Finance Ministry is currently weighing scenarios for different levels of demand, said Kolychev, one of the architects of a mechanism that funnels proceeds from energy taxes into a rainy-day fund. Putin has promised for years to reduce Russia’s dependence on energy, but the sector still makes up a third of budget revenues.A drop in mobility due to the coronavirus has coincided with increased efforts to combat climate change this year to completely alter the outlook for fossil fuel demand. BP Plc became the first major oil giant to admit in September that oil consumption may never return to levels seen before the pandemic. Since then China and the US, the world’s two biggest economies, have stepped up commitments to transition to clean energy.Russia, which generates less than 1% of power from renewables, has so far been slow to adapt to the transition and is still investing in new oil exploration projects in the Arctic. Analysts at Moscow’s Skolkovo Energy Center warned in May that economic growth may be limited to less than 0.8% a year for the next two decades if the country doesn’t adapt.“Russia’s economy is clearly not ready for a hydrocarbon shift,” said Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa-Bank in Moscow. “The government and business don’t have a clear understanding of what direction Russia should go if it moves away from oil.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-starts-preparing-for-lower-budget-revenues-as-global-oil-demand-declines/story-HUpNeZh2zVzTn2nKc4plBK.html
05-12-2020||World||Biden clinches electoral college win as California certifies||Joe Biden now officially has more than the 270 Electoral College votes he needs to claim the presidency after California certified its election results on Friday evening.Secretary of State Alex Padilla approved the results of Biden’s victory, according to his office, which Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom will use to prepare the Certificate of Ascertainment appointing the state’s 55 electors for Biden.The electors will meet in their states on Dec. 14 to cast their votes, which Congress will tally in a joint session on Jan. 6.Even as Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris proceed with the transition to a new administration, President Donald Trump continues to make unsubstantiated allegations of massive voter fraud, on Twitter and in a lengthly video released this week. But his already slim chances of reversing the election outcome have narrowed even more as courts in several several states have rejected legal challenges brought by his campaign and supporters.Courts in Nevada and Minnesota handed him two more losses on Friday, dismissing lawsuits seeking to decertify Biden’s victories in those states.A state court judge in Nevada threw out a lawsuit brought by six Republican voters who requested a court order nullifying Biden’s win or declaring Trump the winner, saying they utterly failed to meet the burden of producing “credible and relevant evidence” of massive voter fraud.Hours earlier, the Minnesota Supreme Court dismissed a Republican-led suit that aimed to decertify the Biden win there, ruling the case had been filed too late to challenge mail-in-voting rules that were made public long before the Nov. 3 election.Biden’s lead in the popular vote is now more than 7 million votes.States that voted for Biden that have yet to certify their presidential election results are New Jersey, which plans to do so Monday, Colorado, which plans to certify early next week after an automatic recount in a judicial race, and Hawaii, which is waiting for the resolution of two pending lawsuits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-clinches-electoral-college-win-as-california-certifies/story-FLrijJTgrNmBHwCXAfmUqN.html

05-12-2020||World||The cost of failure: What’s at stake if Brexit talks collapse||Negotiations between the UK and European Union over a post-Brexit trade deal are heading into a crisis weekend as both sides try to salvage an accord. With a deal hanging in the balance, here’s a summary of what’s at stake if the talks fail.If no agreement is reached, it would be a hammer blow for businesses and consumers on both sides. Decades of free movement of goods, services, people and capital would come to an abrupt end when Britain leaves the EU’s single market and customs union on Dec. 31.Companies would face tariffs, quotas and potential chaos as they move goods across the border; finance firms in the City of London would lose their passport to offer services across the EU; and consumers would see their rights to live and stay on the other side of the English Channel curtailed. Even taking a pet dog to the continent would become more difficult.The Economic HitWithout a trade deal, the U.K. economy would suffer a near-term shock of around 1.5% of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics. The Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain’s independent spending watchdog, forecasts a 2% GDP decline.TariffsInstead of frictionless trade with a market of more than 400 million consumers, British firms would revert to trading with the EU under rules established by the World Trade Organization in 1995. That means imports and exports to the EU would be subject to WTO-negotiated tariffs -- essentially a tax on goods.The EU’s average tariff rate is 3%, but some products would attract much higher levies: British automakers would face a 10% tariff on all auto exports to the EU, while farmers exporting dairy products would see a 35.4% charge.The car industry alone would face a 55 billion-pound hit due to a collapse in demand and local production due to tariffs, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.Tariffs could also lead to increased prices for companies and consumers. For supermarkets, the cost would be 3.1 billion pounds ($4 billion) a year, according to the British Retail Consortium. Some 85% of foods imported from the EU would attract tariffs of 5% or more.About 43% of the UK’s exports, valued at about 300 billion pounds, go to the EU each year, and the bloc is the source of 51% of its imports.City of LondonFinance firms will lose their passport to offer services across the EU, whether there’s a trade deal or not, forcing them to shift staff and beef-up their operations in the bloc. Their access to customers would depend on the EU judging U.K. rules to be equivalent to its own in 40 areas. Failure to reach a trade accord would set back that process. Even if permission is granted, the EU would still be able to withdraw it with little notice.CustomsBusinesses exporting to the EU will have to file customs declarations with or without a trade deal. To move goods from Dover to Calais -- the UK’s busiest crossing point with the EU -- trucks will need a government-issued permit indicating they have the correct paperwork and won’t be held up by French officials.Delays at the border would threaten to throw manufacturers relying on parts arriving just-in-time into chaos, including companies in car-making and aerospace, while fresh food produce might rot in queuing trucks.Animal products will need to move through designated border inspection posts accompanied by export health certificates issued by a veterinary professional.While goods moving out of the UK will face checks from the year-end, Britain is deferring full import controls on those arriving from the EU until July 2021. However, companies will still need to keep records of their transactions and file the customs declarations in July.StandardsCompanies may have to comply with two separate regimes for product standards and regulations, needing approvals from UK and EU bodies to have the right to sell in both markets. For example, some goods will need to bear a new UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) mark from Jan. 1, instead of the EU’s CE mark, in order to be sold in Britain.ServicesThe services sector -- which make up 80% of Britain’s economy -- would face new restrictions. British architects and consultants would be among professionals who would lose their automatic right to offer their services across Europe. Firms may need to establish an office in the EU to continue trading, and may have to seek local approval for their professional qualifications.PassportsEven with a trade deal, British visitors to the EU will need more than six months left on their passport in order to travel. Those staying in the EU for longer than 90 days may require a visa.Motorists may need an international driving permit. Traveling with pets to the EU will become more difficult, too. Animal owners will face a four-month process involving blood tests, vaccinations and health certificates.ImmigrationThe free movement of people between Britain and the EU will end. The U.K. is planning to use a so-called points-based immigration system, where overseas workers must prove they meet certain criteria before being allowed to come to Britain for a job. The criteria include speaking English, having an existing employment offer and earning more than 20,480 pounds a year.Wine and CigarettesBritish travelers to the EU will be able to benefit from duty-free shopping in ports and airports. However, it will no longer be possible to return with unlimited quantities of products such as alcohol and tobacco from the bloc without paying the appropriate taxes. Instead, shoppers will have more limited, tax-free allowances -- 200 cigarettes, 18 liters of wine, and four liters of spirits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-cost-of-failure-what-s-at-stake-if-brexit-talks-collapse/story-l35YWfkCIrGLYgJTeZd6DN.html

A no-deal exit is the nightmare scenario for businesses and investors, who say it would snarl borders, spook financial markets and sow chaos through supply chains that stretch across Europe and beyond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pm-johnson-to-speak-to-eu-chief-as-brexit-talks-stall/story-Bv0HkNQNPPmXfzx5DUmBwI.html

Even taking a pet dog to the continent would become more difficult.The economic hitWithout a trade deal, the UK economy would suffer a near-term shock of around 1.5% of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics. The Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain’s independent spending watchdog, forecasts a 2% GDP decline.TariffsInstead of frictionless trade with a market of more than 400 million consumers, British firms would revert to trading with the EU under rules established by the World Trade Organization in 1995. That means imports and exports to the EU would be subject to WTO-negotiated tariffs -- essentially a tax on goods.The EU’s average tariff rate is 3%, but some products would attract much higher levies: British automakers would face a 10% tariff on all auto exports to the EU, while farmers exporting dairy products would see a 35.4% charge.The car industry alone would face a 55 billion-pound hit due to a collapse in demand and local production due to tariffs, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.Tariffs could also lead to increased prices for companies and consumers. For supermarkets, the cost would be 3.1 billion pounds ($4 billion) a year, according to the British Retail Consortium. Some 85% of foods imported from the EU would attract tariffs of 5% or more.About 43% of the UK’s exports, valued at about 300 billion pounds, go to the EU each year, and the bloc is the source of 51% of its imports.City of LondonFinance firms will lose their passport to offer services across the EU, whether there’s a trade deal or not, forcing them to shift staff and beef-up their operations in the bloc. Their access to customers would depend on the EU judging UK rules to be equivalent to its own in 40 areas. Failure to reach a trade accord would set back that process. Even if permission is granted, the EU would still be able to withdraw it with little notice.CustomsBusinesses exporting to the EU will have to file customs declarations with or without a trade deal. To move goods from Dover to Calais -- the UK’s busiest crossing point with the EU -- trucks will need a government-issued permit indicating they have the correct paperwork and won’t be held up by French officials.Delays at the border would threaten to throw manufacturers relying on parts arriving just-in-time into chaos, including companies in car-making and aerospace, while fresh food produce might rot in queuing trucks.Animal products will need to move through designated border inspection posts accompanied by export health certificates issued by a veterinary professional.While goods moving out of the UK will face checks from the year-end, Britain is deferring full import controls on those arriving from the EU until July 2021. However, companies will still need to keep records of their transactions and file the customs declarations in July.StandardsCompanies may have to comply with two separate regimes for product standards and regulations, needing approvals from UK and EU bodies to have the right to sell in both markets. For example, some goods will need to bear a new UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) mark from Jan. 1, instead of the EU’s CE mark, in order to be sold in Britain.ServicesThe services sector -- which make up 80% of Britain’s economy -- would face new restrictions. British architects and consultants would be among professionals who would lose their automatic right to offer their services across Europe. Firms may need to establish an office in the EU to continue trading, and may have to seek local approval for their professional qualifications.PassportsEven with a trade deal, British visitors to the EU will need more than six months left on their passport in order to travel. Those staying in the EU for longer than 90 days may require a visa.Motorists may need an international driving permit. Traveling with pets to the EU will become more difficult, too. Animal owners will face a four-month process involving blood tests, vaccinations and health certificates.ImmigrationThe free movement of people between Britain and the EU will end. The UK is planning to use a so-called points-based immigration system, where overseas workers must prove they meet certain criteria before being allowed to come to Britain for a job. The criteria include speaking English, having an existing employment offer and earning more than 20,480 pounds a year.Wine and cigarettesBritish travelers to the EU will be able to benefit from duty-free shopping in ports and airports. However, it will no longer be possible to return with unlimited quantities of products such as alcohol and tobacco from the bloc without paying the appropriate taxes. Instead, shoppers will have more limited, tax-free allowances -- 200 cigarettes, 18 liters of wine, and four liters of spirits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-cost-of-failure-what-is-at-stake-if-brexit-talks-collapse/story-tPTvIrSzsKDfXZacPMvFuJ.html
05-12-2020||World||Now that Covid-19 vaccines are coming, what about poor countries?||It’s now just a matter of weeks before shoulders are bared, syringes primed and vaccines injected. If last year was the one that gave Covid-19 its name and 2020 was defined by masks, gowns and swabs, 2021 will be the year of the vial.This being a pandemic (from the Greek word for “all people”), that welcome development presents all the usual problems of global differences in wealth, power and equity. Rich countries have already placed their orders. Poor countries can only hope not to be left out. What should be done?The question doesn’t just tap into the debate between nationalists and multilateralists that polarizes many Western countries. It’s also a timeless ethical conundrum. In a famous dialogue by Plato, an Athenian macho named Callicles argues that justice is merely the law of nature — meaning, of the strong. In our pandemic context: Why wouldn’t politicians in rich countries buy up the vaccines and give herd immunity to their own electorates first?Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageSocrates, in that conversation, counters that justice demands cooperation and a view that encompasses strong and weak alike. Translated for today: The world is better off sharing vaccines because survival shouldn’t depend on where you live.But this purely moral case isn’t the only one to be made for cooperation. It turns out that multilateral sharing of vaccines would also save many additional lives.A lab at Northeastern University in Boston has modeled two counterfactual scenarios of what would have happened if a vaccine had been available in March 2020. In one, the first two billion doses are snapped up by rich countries, while only the remaining billion are allocated among all others. In the second, all three billion are distributed from the start to all countries in proportion to their populations.In the first or “uncooperative” case, the vaccine would have averted 33% of global deaths through Sep. 1. In the second or “cooperative” scenario, it would have prevented 61%. That’s a lot of lives saved — even in countries that would have had the vaccine in either scenario.The situation is therefore a bit like the famous Prisoner’s Dilemma in game theory. If all countries cooperate, the world can achieve an optimal outcome and defeat the pandemic soon and decisively. If they don’t cooperate, Covid will drag on and there’ll be many more deaths. The dilemma is that each individual country also has an incentive to “cheat,” relying on others to do the sharing while snatching all the doses it can. But this leaves the others even worse off than if no one cooperated.In game theory, the various outcomes can be tweaked by changing the mathematical parameters. And this — at least in my interpretation — is what the Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consultancy, is now trying to do with a new report commissioned by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The nonprofit is a lead sponsor of the ACT-Accelerator, a collaborative effort between governments, companies, scientists, and philanthropists, to get tests, treatments and of course vaccines to developing countries.The idea is that rich donor countries pitch into a pot that funds distribution in poorer nations. But donor nations have so far ponied up only $5.1 billion. An additional $28.2 billion is needed to deliver the shots and other tools as they become available. How can we get all prisoners in this dilemma to cooperate?By showing them that any money paid in will earn them a huge return with no downside, Eurasia Group’s report implies. The group has analyzed the geopolitical and economic costs to rich countries if the pandemic were to rage on in poor ones. These include the obvious — the impact on the Japanese economy of the Summer Olympics being cancelled, say — and the oblique, such as the effects on international demand for German exports or U.S. fracking gas.Overall, Eurasia Group found that the economic benefit of controlling the pandemic everywhere would be $153 billion next year for the ten top donor nations, or $466 billion over the next five years. That’s more than ten times the amount ACT-Accelerator asks for. Moreover, if you compare the ACT-A pot to the gargantuan domestic stimulus programs rich countries have passed, it starts looking almost trivial.Rich countries have a lot of big decisions to make in the coming weeks — whether and how fast to approve which vaccine, how to allocate scarce shots in the domestic population, how to fight disinformation by anti-vaxx conspiracy theorists, and so forth. These fights may get nasty, as I predicted in July.But the decision about whether to include poor countries in our common human struggle against a pandemic shouldn’t be so hard. If there’s any good argument for not fully and immediately funding the ACT-Accelerator, I have yet to see it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-that-covid-19-vaccines-are-coming-what-about-poor-countries/story-hTa4U93IGiuvhTNJRAvinJ.html
05-12-2020||World||Tesla ordered to pay Chinese Model S buyer for concealing damage||Tesla Inc. was ordered by a Beijing court to compensate the buyer of a used Model S car after concluding the electric automaker concealed structural damage on a vehicle it sold on its official website.The court ruled that Tesla should pay more than 1.1 million yuan ($168,420) to compensate the buyer, after it was discovered that part of the vehicle had been cut and welded back together, according to online media outlet Sina on Friday.Tesla confirmed the decision in a statement to Bloomberg News, and said it would appeal the ruling to a higher court.The Tianjin-based buyer purchased a used Model S for 379,700 yuan last year which the automaker guaranteed had no “significant” damage, according to the report. He then sued the automaker after the vehicle had multiple breakdown issues and subsequently discovering that part of the body had been cut and welded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-ordered-to-pay-chinese-model-s-buyer-for-concealing-damage/story-vKiAszT30cDuEJ1FptEgOJ.html
05-12-2020||World||South Africa expects first virus vaccine delivery by mid-2021||South Africa will probably take its first delivery of coronavirus vaccines by the middle of next year after agreeing on an initial payment, according to the Health Ministry.The government will pay about 327 million rand ($22 million) to take delivery of the vaccines under the Covax initiative that will cover about 10% of the population, the ministry said in a statement. The total cost of the vaccines could amount to more than 2 billion rand. The World Health Organization-backed Covax initiative aspires to give lower-income countries the same access to vaccines as wealthier nations.“Our understanding from the production estimates we have been provided with at this stage is that we should expect to receive the first batch of stock in quarter two of 2021,” the ministry said.South Africa is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases in some districts just as millions of people prepare to travel to their home towns and holiday destinations during the festive season. President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday reintroduced restrictions aimed at containing the spread of the virus in Nelson Mandela Bay, the nation’s sixth-largest city, with a population of 1.3 million people.The government is also considering buying vaccines from other potential producers, including Johnson & Johnson, Novavax Inc., AstraZeneca Plc and the Pfizer Inc. and BioNtech partnership. It needs to ensure it has funds and resources for the distribution, storage and administration of the vaccines, the ministry said.“While the Covax facility is our favored vehicle for accessing vaccines, we will always explore all options to ensure that the process of rolling out vaccines is safe and cost-effective,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-expects-first-virus-vaccine-delivery-by-mid-2021/story-FPjlnBbWvKX0cteprb3EDO.html
05-12-2020||World||Trump campaign files election lawsuit in Georgia, suffers more legal defeats||Donald Trump’s campaign said it filed a lawsuit in Georgia state court on Friday seeking to invalidate the presidential election results there, the latest in a series of legal challenges aimed at reversing his loss that have so far gone nowhere.The Trump campaign said in a statement its new lawsuit would include sworn statements from Georgia residents alleging fraud.Georgia’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, like Trump, and other state officials have said repeatedly they have found no evidence of widespread fraud in the November 3 election won by Democrat Joe Biden.Trump’s team and various individuals backing him have suffered a string of legal defeats around the country, including in cases filed in Nevada and Wisconsin that sought court orders to reverse those states’ election results.President-elect Biden won the election with 306 Electoral College votes - against the 270 required - to Trump’s 232. A district judge in Nevada on Friday dismissed a case brought by would-be Republican presidential electors and said they must pay defendants’ legal costs after failing “to meet their burden to provide credible and relevant evidence to substantiate” any of the lawsuit’s claims.The Wisconsin Supreme Court in a 4-3 decision declined to act on a case that sought to have the court nullify the presidential election in the state and pave the way for the state legislature to choose Wisconsin’s 10 presidential electors.“Such a move would appear to be unprecedented in American history,” Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote in his concurring opinion of four justices issued on Friday.Trump’s campaign has spent nearly $9 million on its unsuccessful bid to overturn the results of the election, including nearly $2.3 million to lawyers and consultants.The campaign and the Republican National Committee have raised at least $207.5 million since Election Day, much of it from solicitations asking for donations to an “Official Election Defense Fund”.The fine print made clear most of the money would go to other priorities through Trump’s new political action committee, which could fuel his future political endeavors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-files-election-lawsuit-in-georgia-suffers-more-legal-defeats/story-L8sTV9HY5S7Lmo4UeQY4qO.html

People with certain underlying health conditions, pregnant women and those who have had a respiratory illness for the past two weeks are barred from vaccination.Russia has developed two Covid-19 vaccines, Sputnik V which is backed by the Russian Direct Investment Fund and another developed by Siberia’s Vector Institute, with final trials for the both yet to be completed.Scientists have raised concerns about the speed at which Russia has worked, giving the regulatory go-ahead for its vaccines and launching mass vaccinations before full trials to test its safety and efficacy had been completed.The Sputnik V vaccine is administered in two injections, with the second dose is expected to be given 21 days after the first.Moscow closed down all public places including parks and cafes, with exception for delivery, in late March, with police patrolling the streets looking for whose violating the rules. Restrictions were eased from mid-June, however.Russia as a whole reported 28,782 new infections on Saturday, its highest daily tally, pushing the national total to 2,431,731, the fourth-highest in the world.In October, certain restrictions such as remote learning for some secondary school children and a 30% limit on the number of workers allowed in offices were introduced again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moscow-starts-mass-covid-19-vaccination-with-its-sputnik-v-shot/story-pvK6GIqq8yUo6AkcDnWoqK.html
05-12-2020||World||For North Korean spies, Vienna provides key gateway to Europe||The bestselling author of espionage novels, John le Carré, often places his spies in Vienna. So does Kim Jong Un.The Austrian capital has long been a smuggling hub for the heavily sanctioned North Korean regime and a gateway to Europe for the small number of spooks it has based on the continent. But the city could grow in importance to Pyongyang if US President-elect Joe Biden convinces Kim to consider rolling back his weapons program: As home to the United Nations’ top nuclear watchdog, Vienna would potentially play a monitoring role.Interviews with a senior western intelligence official with knowledge of North Korea’s espionage network paint a vivid picture of its activities in Europe, including the presence of as many as 10 Ministry of State Security agents. At least one agent operates regularly out of Vienna, according to the official.Besides basic information-gathering, the agents’ primary mission is keeping the regime’s own embassies and diplomats under surveillance.They also oversee illegal procurement operations, carry out investigations into missing people and retrieve cadres who have been summoned home.Austria is central to those activities, according to the intelligence official, who asked not to be identified. While the Kim family’s travel and studies in Switzerland have long been the subject of discussion, less known are their ties to its German-speaking neighbour.At times desperate and clumsy, North Korea’s operations in Austria and elsewhere in Europe have grown more imperative for Kim as his country struggles under sanctions. North Korea’s economy is headed this year for its biggest contraction in more than two decades, according to Fitch Solutions, due in part to Kim’s decision to close borders during the coronavirus pandemic. On top of that, natural disasters including floods wiped out farmland.North Korea’s trade with China, by far its largest economic partner, shrank 73% through September and is on course to plunge 80% for the year, the Korea International Trade Association said in late November. Kim issued a rare warning for the economy in August, telling party leaders the country “faced unexpected and inevitable challenges,”For years Austria has been a source of items that can’t be legally imported by the regime, including Glock pistols and a cable car that Kim rode on with South Korean President Moon Jae-in during a 2018 visit to a North Korean ski resort.A spokesperson for the Austrian Interior Ministry said the agency couldn’t comment on specific cases or operations for legal reasons. The ministry, which oversees the domestic intelligence agency, investigates any crimes that are detrimental to Austria, the spokesperson said. A spokeswoman for Chancellor Sebastian Kurz directed a request for comment to the ministry.Two people who picked up the phone in separate calls to the North Korean embassy in Vienna were unable to comment, and an email to the embassy went unanswered.The country’s annual intelligence report acknowledged that “intelligence actors operate both in Austria and against Austrian interests” due to local business networks plus easy access to the European Union and multinational organizations. Such ties are one reason Vienna has so often featured in Le Carré espionage novels, such as “A Perfect Spy.”Its role could deepen if Biden has more success than current President Donald Trump in getting Kim to agree to reduce his nuclear arsenal, a likely pre-condition to a face-to-face meeting. The locally based International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) would almost certainly play a part in ensuring North Korea abides by any pledge to disclose or shut weapons related facilities.Close and frequent contact would be needed to carry out the detailed work of placing a freeze on North Korea’s nuclear system. This requires closing labs, reactors and fissile materials production sites, as well as installing monitoring equipment in one of the world’s most secretive and paranoid states. As well as potentially allowing IAEA teams into North Korea, it would mean more North Korean officials traveling regularly to Vienna.“Once a political agreement has been reached among the countries concerned, the agency is ready to return promptly to the DPRK,” the IAEA said in a September report, using North Korea’s formal name.European cities with North Korean missions such as Geneva and Stockholm have often hosted meetings between representatives of the US and North Korea, who have never had official relations. In March, Kim named Choe Kang Il -- one of his top experts on US affairs -- to succeed his uncle, Kim Kwang Sop, as ambassador to Vienna.Other high-ranking officials, including members of the secretive personal secretariat, which has direct links to the Kim family, have traveled through Austria, where they shopped and worked on illegal procurement, according to the intelligence official. In one instance, agents were able to search a rented apartment because the North Koreans had failed to put it under diplomatic cover.According to the UN, North Korea uses its embassies and overseas missions for “illicit activities for generating illegal revenues” that include trade in luxury goods forbidden under sanctions and procuring banned equipment essential for its nuclear program. North Korea has generated billions of dollars a year dealing drugs, selling weapons, counterfeiting currencies and exploiting guest workers, says the International Network for the Human Rights of North Korean Overseas Labour.For poorly paid North Korean diplomats in Europe, smuggling is not only a service to the regime. It can be a means of sustenance.Tae Yong-ho -- a former North Korean deputy ambassador to the UK, who defected to South Korea in 2016 -- said in a phone interview the regime’s envoys are “required to earn money” and face harsh criticism if they fail to meet quotas. “The pressure is tremendous,” said Tae, who was elected to a South Korean parliamentary seat in April.Austria is home to about 100 North Korean nationals and has historically housed one of the regime’s largest embassies in Europe. Agents and some bomb material connected to the downing of Korean Air Flight 858 in 1987 passed through its doors.Kwon Yong Rok, described by the North Korea Leadership Watch website in 2009 as the one-time central executive for the country’s Vienna-based financial management, was named in a 2012 UN Security Council report for being part of a scheme to export illicit goods including Mercedes Benz E-class E350 series cars.Kwon has not publicly commented, and it’s unclear where he is now. North Korea provides few public details of top officials, especially those who may be involved in questionable activities overseas and could be at risk of US sanctions. A search of North Korea’s official media for the past 20 years shows no mention of Kwon.Another member of Kim’s inner circle, whom the intelligence official declined to name, recently traveled through Austria’s capital and may still be in Europe.The regime’s last financial institution in Europe, Golden Star Bank, was based in Vienna before it was ordered to shut more than a decade ago. Its network of contacts and clients remained, however, making Vienna a continued focal point for money flows linked to attempts to get around sanctions.The blocked sale of two luxury yachts in Italy in 2009, which investigators suspected were destined for Kim’s family during Kim Jong Il’s rule, shed light on how North Korea tries to procure sanctioned goods via Austria, the person familiar with the operation said. Several embassy staff in Vienna each acquired 50,000 euros ($70,000 at the time), wired through multiple offshore entities based in places such as the Cayman and Virgin Islands.The diplomats transferred the money to an Austrian businessman, who forwarded it to companies that purchased the boats. UN Security Council reports published in 2012 and 2016 found the businessman had been involved in an array of other orders for items ranging from Mercedes cars to pianos.In more recent years, security services have intercepted rented crates at Austrian ports filled with medicine, wine, liquor and other luxury items that were traced back to embassy staff, said the person familiar with the activities. In 2010, a MSS officer appeared in Vienna looking for equipment typically needed in the aftermath of an earthquake and on another occasion second-hand ski lifts and gondolas were purchased for a resort in Masikryong via a Chinese shell company, they said.The North Koreans tasked with such missions often live in fear, dreading that one misstep that could prompt a return to their home country and its political prisons. Kim, and his father before him, has used arbitrary detention as punishment for officials he deems to have stepped out of line. In some cases he has had them killed, including his own uncle, whose execution he ordered.Defectors from North Korea have spoken frequently about how the constant pressure breeds paranoia, infighting and mistrust.The intelligence official recalled an incident involving a group of North Korean diplomats who were eating at a restaurant in Austria.When one diplomat stood up suddenly and rushed toward the rear of the building, another member of the party jumped to his feet and chased him clumsily through the restaurant.But it turned out the man was not trying to make a run for it -- he just needed the toilet in a hurry. Both men later sheepishly returned and sat down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-north-korean-spies-vienna-provides-key-gateway-to-europe/story-DtZPOSw0L951Eb84qyIuUM.html
05-12-2020||World||WHO warns virus crisis not over as vaccine rollout approaches||The World Health Organization has warned that vaccines will be no magic bullet for the coronavirus crisis as nations gear up for a massive rollout to tackle surging infections.The word of caution comes as the United States clocked a record number of Covid-19 cases for a second day in a row, with the country preparing for what US President-elect Joe Biden has called a “dark winter”.America’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday recommended “universal face mask use” indoors and Biden said he would scale down his January inauguration ceremony to mitigate the virus risk.It comes as countries prepare for the approval and rollout of several vaccines that have proven effective in trials.The WHO however warned against vaccine complacency on Friday and what it said was an erroneous belief that the Covid-19 crisis is over with jabs on the horizon.“Vaccines do not equal zero Covid,” said WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan, adding that not everyone will be able to receive it early next year.“Vaccination will add a major, major, powerful tool to the tool kit that we have. But by themselves, they will not do the job.”WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said progress on vaccines signaled “light at the end of the tunnel.”But he cautioned against the “growing perception that the pandemic is over” with the virus still spreading fast, putting enormous pressure on hospitals and health care workers. - Massive logistical effort -The WHO says 51 candidate vaccines are currently being tested on humans, with 13 reaching final-stage mass testing.Britain on Wednesday became the first Western country to approve an inoculation, from Pfizer-BioNTech, for general use, piling pressure on other countries to swiftly follow suit.The United States is expected to give a green light later this month.Belgium, France and Spain have said jabs will begin in January for the most vulnerable.With the imminent arrival of vaccines that need storage at ultra-low temperatures, US companies are preparing for a massive logistical effort to aid their distribution. Firms specializing in insulating containers are on a war footing after Pfizer and BioNTech said their vaccine needs to be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit (-70 Celsius).Meat processing giant Smithfield said it was ready to put the cold rooms at its abattoirs at the disposal of rollout operations.And US logistics giant UPS is producing 1,100 pounds (500 kilograms) of dry ice an hour in its depots and has developed portable freezers capable of storing the vaccines at temperatures down to -112 Fahrenheit.- ‘Follow the science’ -Standing in the way of success are growing signs of vaccine skepticism, with misinformation and mistrust coloring public acceptance of inoculation.Several high-profile figures have pledged to receive the vaccine in public in an effort to build confidence, including Biden, Tedros and former US presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. The United States recorded 225,000 new infections on Friday -- the second daily record in a row for the world’s worst-hit nation.Biden said the surging number of cases meant he would scale back his inauguration ceremony set for January.“We’re going to follow the science and the recommendations of the experts,” Biden told reporters.“So it’s highly unlikely there’ll be a million people on the mall.”- Christmas spike expected -More than 65 million people have contracted Covid-19 globally with the death toll from the disease topping 1.5 million.British medical chiefs said the arrival of a vaccine should see deaths reduce “significantly” by early next year but warned social mixing over Christmas could cause another spike before then.“By spring the effects of vaccination will begin to be felt in reducing Covid admissions, attendances and deaths significantly but there are many weeks before we get to that stage,” they said.Italy is seeing a dramatic resurgence of infections after it largely tamped down an earlier outbreak by enforcing a strict lockdown, while Latin America and the Caribbean has seen an 18 percent spike in cases in a week.Other countries are unveiling holiday restrictions, with Switzerland banning Christmas carolling in the streets and Madrid canceling most New Year events in the city centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-virus-crisis-not-over-as-vaccine-rollout-approaches/story-zEgvrv3i0AFzIVN5BdBIAP.html
05-12-2020||World||Swedish vaccine skepticism is latest obstacle to herd immunity||Swedish health authorities acknowledged they need to convert vaccine doubters -- currently just over a quarter of the population -- if they’re to reach enough people to achieve herd immunity.“I can understand that the acceptance level is fairly low at this point,” Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist, said in an interview. “It is still a very theoretical question, as we know very little about the vaccines that are in the pipeline, and the general population knows even less.”Only 46% of Swedes say they want to be vaccinated, while 26% say they don’t, according to a recent Novus poll. Herd immunity comes when enough people in a community have developed immunity through being either infected or vaccinated. For Covid-19, the percentage is estimated to range from 55% to 82%.“This will be a very important communication effort, to communicate wisely about vaccines and their effects, to the population,” Tegnell said.Sweden famously avoided a lockdown, allowing the virus to spread more rapidly than elsewhere. Though herd immunity through exposure was never a declared strategy, Swedish authorities had hoped enough people would develop antibodies to protect against new outbreaks.The second wave Tegnell once thought Sweden could avoid, however, has now hit the country with a vengeance.Sweden expects to get enough Covid-19 vaccines to immunize about a fifth of the population in the first quarter, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said on Friday. But authorities are bracing for at least another year with the virus.The country’s national vaccine coordinator, Richard Bergstrom, said he’s urging skeptics to “keep an open mind.”“I hope there’s confidence in the regulatory process,” he said. “And to those who hesitate, I would like to say: Wait and see.”Click here for complete coverage of the coronavirus pandemicTegnell said he’s hoping more Swedes will accept the vaccine with time. A key strength in Sweden’s favor, he says, is its national health-care system, which has the infrastructure needed to get the vaccine to as broad a segment of the population as possible.“We have a system that involves many people in health care, whereas in many other countries it is only doctors that administer vaccinations,” he said.Swine FluMany Swedes still remember the country’s efforts a decade ago to fight the H1N1 virus. Following the outbreak of swine flu in 2009, Sweden saw a sudden jump in narcolepsy cases, which was later found to be a side effect of its mass vaccination program. The sleep disorder was particularly widespread among children and adolescents.The side effects were “extremely unfortunate,” said Tegnell, who was one of the people in charge of the inoculation plan at the time.Though participation in Sweden’s voluntary child immunization programs remains almost universal, the swine flue episode appears to have dented confidence in new vaccines.“I think it’s fairly natural that a lot of people have questions,” Tegnell said. “We need to keep on working and give good information.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedish-vaccine-skepticism-is-latest-obstacle-to-herd-immunity/story-XqSq2U2r4DImskUlsbBagI.html

This wave of infections is different from the first two, which were driven by large-scale transmission, said KDCA official Lim Sook-young.“The recent outbreaks are small, multiple and is spread in people’s everyday lives,” Lim told a news briefing. “Please keep in mind that the current wave is not limited to a specific group or place but may be around our homes, family and acquaintances.” Click here for complete coverage of the Coronavirus pandemicSeoul accounted for 235 of the new infections. More than half of South Korea’s 52 million people live in the capital and surrounding areas.Among Seoul’s small but widespread clusters, confirmed cases linked to a dance class rose by nine to 249 in less than two weeks, while 21 people tested positive in a cluster related to a wine bar.Seoul launched unprecedented curfews on Saturday, shuttering most establishments and shops at 9 p.m. (1200 GMT) for two weeks and cutting back public transportation operations by 30% in the evenings.Tighter restrictions would be a blow to Asia’s fourth-largest economy, which reported a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 4.2% in October, the highest since July.The number of people seriously or severely ill with Covid-19 rose by five to 121, using more of the nation’s swindling sickbeds, KDCA reported.The health authorities said on Friday there were just 59 sickbeds immediately available for serious or severe cases and that the beds might run out in less than two weeks.South Korea has reported 36,915 coronavirus infections and 540 deaths, the KDCA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-urges-vigilance-as-covid-19-clusters-emerge-in-third-wave/story-noHDi7o5gq5K05Nri8D2YP.html
05-12-2020||World||US decision to withdraw troops from Somalia ‘will have a huge toll on counterterrorism efforts’||President Donald Trump’s decision to pull US troops out of Somalia in the waning days of his presidency triggered dismay on Saturday from some Somalis, who appealed to the incoming US president to reverse the decision.“The US decision to pull troops out of Somalia at this critical stage in the successful fight against al-Shabaab and their global terrorist network is extremely regrettable,” Senator Ayub Ismail Yusuf told Reuters in a statement, referring to the al Qaida-linked al Shabaab insurgency.“US troops have made a huge contribution and had great impact on the training and operational effectiveness of Somali soldiers,” said Yusuf, a member of Somalia’s Senate Foreign Affairs Committee.He tagged US President-elect Joe Biden in a tweet criticising the decision.The Somali government could not immediately be reached for comment early on Saturday to Friday’s decision to withdraw almost all the roughly 700 US troops by January 15.Somalia’s fragile internationally backed government is due to hold parliamentary elections this month and national elections in early February, a precursor to the planned drawdown of the 17,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force.US troops have been in Somalia, mostly supporting Somali special forces known as Danab in operations against al Shabaab, whose attacks in nations like Kenya and Uganda have killed hundreds of civilians, including Americans.Supporting Somali forcesDanab punches above its weight because regular forces are often poorly trained and equipped, frequently desert their posts or become enmeshed in power struggles between the national and regional governments.If the withdrawal is permanent, “it will have a huge toll on counterterrorism efforts,” said Colonel Ahmed Abdullahi Sheikh, who served for three years until 2019 as the Danab commander.He fought alongside US forces, he said, and during his command two Americans and more than a hundred of his own men had died. Both US and Somali forces opposed the withdrawal, he said.The US program to expand Danab to 3,000 men was supposed to continue until 2027, Sheikh said, but its future is unclear.Airstrikes will likely continue from bases in Kenya and Djibouti, which could also provide a launchpad for cross-border operations. Rights group Amnesty International says the airstrikes have killed at least 16 civilians in the past three years.The US withdrawal comes at a turbulent time in the region. Ethiopia, which is a major troop contributor to the peacekeeping forces and has thousands more troops in Somalia bilaterally, is distracted by an internal conflict that broke out last month. It has disarmed hundreds of its peacekeepers already.Somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991, but the entry of the peacekeeping force in 2008 helped incubate fledgling government structures that allowed for gradual reforms of the military, such as a biometric system to pay soldiers and the formation of Danab.But many problems with the Somali military remain, including corruption and political interference. Perhaps a withdrawal will force Somalia to confront them, said Sheikh. Or perhaps it will make them worse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-decision-to-withdraw-troops-from-somalia-will-have-a-huge-toll-on-counterterrorism-efforts/story-7f41W5PRpEH0KOBPM6Lk5K.html

While no direct contact has taken place with the incoming administration, diplomats say Democratic President-elect Joe Biden is open to a return, although congressional issues may slow that down.“The US withdrawal was tough, but it enabled it (UNESCO) to go back to basics,” said a European diplomat. “That meant trying to depoliticize it, especially with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, which took precedence over everything.”UNESCO - the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization - is best known for designating and protecting archaeological and heritage sites, from the Galapagos Islands to the tombs of Timbuktu.Most of its activities are uncontroversial, but when it came to, say, resolutions about how religious sites should be run in Jerusalem, every word was studied for accusations of bias.According to diplomats, those tensions have calmed with resolutions now passing more easily after direct mediation between UNESCO and the two parties, even though Israel also pulled out of the organization.“UNESCO made very good improvements in terms of appeasing some of the political tensions and polarizations. It’s better managed and better managed financially,” Henok Teferra Shawl, Ethiopia’s envoy to the body, told Reuters.He added that its director-general, Audrey Azoulay, was last week endorsed by a majority of the 58 Executive Board member states ahead of next year’s election, opening the door to her re-election - in stark contrast to a bitter campaign in 2017.The body has had to fill a gaping financial hole. The United States left with $542 million in arrears. By 2017, UNESCO’s budget of about $300 million was half of its 2012 budget, meaning it was forced to freeze hiring, cut programs and fill gaps with voluntary contributions.UNESCO says the budget from member states is now $534.6 million, with a further $189 million coming from extra voluntary budgetary contributions.A U.S. return, done through a letter informing the body, would also mean that Washington would repay its arrears at some stage.Biden has a history with the organization. He went to UNESCO when he was vice president and his wife, Jill, has been involved in past teaching programs.But things may prove complicated given a U.S. law that forbids the United States from funding U.N. bodies that have admitted Palestine as a full member, although a waiver can be sought.“Biden has said that he wants to renew with multilateralism, so UNESCO should be one of those which benefits from that, but the Palestinian issue may complicate the speed of that return,” said a U.S. official who asked not to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/revamped-less-political-unesco-sets-sights-on-tricky-us-return/story-971yXzVSgTzK4FVwFOtxgO.html
05-12-2020||World||Biden weighs pick for agriculture chief from diverse slate||One leading candidate for agriculture secretary hails from Cleveland, has the backing of progressives and has worked for years to boost food stamp programmes. Another is a former senator from farm-state North Dakota who has championed production agriculture and boasts of a voting record squarely in the middle.Three other possible selections have similarly varied backgrounds — one helped write and implement federal regulations for organic foods, another is California’s agriculture secretary and represented wine grape growers, and a third has spent his career ensuring protections for farm workers.President-elect Joe Biden’s choices for secretary of agriculture are as diverse as the department of 100,000 employees that she or he would represent — and is especially critical this year as USDA provides extra aid for the hungry and oversees food production amid the pandemic.For Biden, the emerging choice between Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and several other potential candidates seems like another test of his vision for the Democratic Party — a contest between urban and rural and liberals and moderates, with the pick potentially placing an added emphasis on anti-hunger programs, farm subsidies or worker protections.Besides Fudge and Heitkamp, other candidates mentioned for the post — and who have been pushed by some advocacy groups — are Kathleen Merrigan, deputy agriculture secretary under President Barack Obama and one of the architects of federal organic rules; Karen Ross, California’s agriculture secretary, former USDA chief of staff and a former longtime president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers; and Arturo Rodriguez, the former president of the United Farm Workers.Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who served as Obama’s agriculture secretary for eight years, is also being considered.“This isn’t like the secretary of defense where you’re a hawk or a dove,” says Eric Kessler, a Democrat who has long worked around agriculture policy and has been holding private calls with other influencers to speak with some of the possible candidates.“The Department of Agriculture is a massive enterprise that is led by a manager who is dependent on a diverse team of people.” And as Biden has said he wants his Cabinet to reflect the country’s diversity, Kessler says the decisions on USDA and other agencies will “be driven by lots of factors, not just the individual’s specific resume.” The agriculture post has been closely watched as all but two agriculture secretaries in the last 120 years have been white men. If chosen, Fudge would be the first Black woman to lead a department that has for years reckoned with a history of discriminating against both Black people and women.Read more| Joe Biden officially secures enough electors to become presidentUnder Obama, the department paid out more than a billion dollars in a settlement with Black farmers and a smaller amount to female farmers, along with Hispanics and Native Americans who had repeatedly been denied farm loans over many decades.Fudge enjoys the strong backing of South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat who gave Biden a key nod of support in the primaries. Biden has said he wants a diverse Cabinet, and some Black leaders have said he needs to do more to achieve that.Clyburn has aggressively pushed Fudge for the post, saying Biden should pick someone who “understands the other side of agriculture ... It’s one thing to grow food, but another to dispense it, and nobody would be better at that than Marcia Fudge.″ As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, Fudge has fiercely advocated for food stamps and other federal programs that help urban areas stem hunger and grow food.Beyond Clyburn, she has the backing of progressive groups who hope she could turn the department’s focus. In a joint letter to Biden, several of those groups said Fudge “has long been an ally to farmers, food-chain workers, consumers and rural communities.’‘ Some unions have also backed her as she has pushed for worker protections in meatpacking plants during the pandemic.Heitkamp is a favorite of farm groups that have worked closely with her and of Democrats who want to improve their outreach to rural areas. But she has also been a strong supporter of food aid programs, having represented swaths of rural poverty until her reelection defeat in 2018. And her family relied on food stamps intermittently when she was growing up as one of seven children from a town of 90 people in the state.Farm programmes — billions of dollars in subsidies for commodity crops and grants for rural infrastructure, among other benefits — and food aid for the poor have long been welded together in Washington. Lawmakers of both parties who support one piece have traditionally supported the other, creating a compact that has held firm amid growing partisanship.Though they have different backgrounds, Fudge and Heitkamp have helped craft and voted for several multibillion-dollar farm bills that supported both sectors.“Agriculture is one place that in a post-Trump world the secretary will play a very important role in bringing different perspectives and parties together,” said Matt Paul, a longtime aide to Vilsack who worked at USDA with him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-weighs-pick-for-agriculture-chief-from-diverse-slate/story-bSVcnI1Vtecw0JbDYMeyWO.html

Many British Sikhs and Punjabis have taken this matter up with their MPs, as they (are) directly affected with family members and ancestral land in the Punjab”.Stating that several MPs had recently written to the Indian high commission about the impact of India’s three farm laws, the letter alleges that they fail “to protect farmers from exploitation and to ensure fair prices for their produce”.British MPs have also been commenting on the farmers’ agitation on the social media in recent days. Also Read: ‘Canada has scarce interest in the well-being of Indian farmers’, opposes MSP at WTO: BJPPreet Kaur Gill, Labour MP from Birmingham Edgbaston and chair of the All Party Parliamentary Party for British Sikhs, reacted to images of protests from Delhi: “This is no way to treat citizens who are peacefully protesting over the controversial Farmers Bill in India”.Also Read: ‘Last day of discussion’: Farmers ahead of talks with Centre on farm laws“Shocking scenes from Delhi. Farmers are peacefully protesting over controversial bills that will impact their livelihoods. Water cannons, and tear gas, are being used to silence them”, she added on Twitter.Dhesi posted images from the protests and said: “It takes a special kind of people to feed those ordered to beat and suppress them. I stand with farmers of the #Punjab and other parts of #India, including our family and friends, who are peacefully protesting against the encroaching privatization of #FarmersBill2020”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/36-british-mps-back-farmers-protest-want-uk-to-raise-issue-with-india/story-tyXApoXTtKJyIkXEcDdUVP.html

However, he said there would be no mandatory lockdowns.Mexico reported 12,127 new coronavirus infections on Friday, a record number for a single day rise, barring one day in October the government has said was due to a statistical blip. It was also the first time Mexico had recorded more than 10,000 new cases three days in a row.The president said his proposals to control the virus were especially important for residents of the metropolitan area of Mexico City, a vast sprawl with a population of over 20 million where the festive shopping season has already caused alarm.On Thursday, crowds converged on Best Buy stores to look for bargains ahead of the company’s planned departure from the country, forcing stores to temporarily close.Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday asked businesses to stop employees working from offices and resume work-from-home schemes. Local government would cut operations to a minimum but restaurants in the city could stay open, she said.Mexico has recorded just over 1.15 million Covid-19 cases and almost 110,000 deaths, the fourth-highest death toll worldwide. Officials acknowledge the true extent of the pandemic is likely significantly higher due to limited testing, while the World Health Organization warned the country was in “bad shape”. Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell this week said the outbreak would likely get worse until January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-presents-mexicans-urged-to-embrace-muted-christmas-to-stop-pandemic/story-NnnKt8gQKv4mdlnDDP9rVL.html

Air and ground units were focused on protecting the canyon communities of Silverado, Santiago, Williams and Modjesca, he added.Two firefighters taken to hospital with injuries on Thursday were released and were “doing okay,” the fire officials said on Twitter.The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning of gusty winds until 10 p.m. on Saturday for the inland part of the county.Utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co said it stood ready to cut power in some northern and central parts of the state form early on Monday as dry conditions and expected high winds heighten damage risks.As many as 25,000 people had been forced to flee the blaze but by Friday morning officials had lifted some evacuation orders, including those for the Lake Forest community.On Twitter, the Orange County Fire Authority said the blaze started as a structure fire in Silverado Canyon on Bond Road that “fully engulfed a home.” Strong winds then drove the flames into nearby vegetation, officials said. Residents said the flames erupted when a home generator exploded.Since the start of the year, wildfires have scorched more than 6,500 sq miles (17,000 sq km) of California land, the state’s forestry department says.The land area burned each year in the western United States has grown eight times larger in less than four decades, US Forest Service researchers said last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/firefighters-move-in-on-southern-california-blaze-as-wind-gusts-seen/story-Lu7oG7nr3mPVnw9pnK4UzM.html
05-12-2020||World||Chinese scientists make world’s first light-based quantum computer||Chinese scientists claim to have created the world’s first light-based quantum computer which can solve problems far faster than a classical supercomputer, an advance hailed by experts as a “major achievement” that provides a fundamentally different approach to designing such powerful machines, the official media reported on Saturday. Jiuzhang, the quantum computer, can reliably demonstrate “quantum computational advantage”, a milestone in computing, state-run China Daily quoted a study published in the journal Science.Quantum computers excel at running simulations that are impossible for conventional computers, leading to breakthroughs in materials science, artificial intelligence and medicine.Jiuzhang takes its name from an ancient Chinese mathematical text. It can perform an extremely esoteric calculation, called Gaussian boson sampling, in 200 seconds. The same task would take the world’s fastest classical supercomputer Fugaku around 600 million years, the report said.It is the second such milestone after Google declared its 53-qubit quantum computer had achieved such a breakthrough last year.Jiuzhang used a new method of manipulating 76 photons to do calculations instead of Google’s, which uses superconductive materials, the report said.Experts hailed China’s quantum computer as a “state-of-the-art experiment” and a “major achievement” in quantum computing, as it proves the feasibility of photonic quantum computation, thus providing a fundamentally different approach to designing such powerful machines, it said.China has been investing heavily in mastering the quantum technology in recent years.In 2017, China had launched quantum communication satellite boosting hack proof and ultra-high security features, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) said.The Quantum Experiments at Space Scale (QUESS) satellite is the first-ever space-ground test platform for quantum communication, Wang Jianyu, executive deputy chief engineer of the project had told the official media earlier.Chinese officials claimed that the quantum satellite was expected to provide a full proof hack-free communications which make foreign powers to monitor or intercept China’s communication systems.Later in the year, China has launched a 2,000-km “hack proof” quantum communication line between capital Beijing and its commercial headquarters Shanghai which cannot be wiretapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-scientists-make-world-s-first-light-based-quantum-computer/story-Rtf1Jy61up9v348iCrTrVN.html
05-12-2020||World||Japan awaits spacecraft return with asteroid soil samples||Japan’s space agency said its final checks confirmed the Hayabusa2 spacecraft is on track to return to Earth a capsule containing samples from a distant asteroid that could provide clues to the origin of the solar system and life on our planet.The spacecraft is making its final approach on its planned trajectory and is scheduled to separate the capsule Saturday afternoon from 220,000 kilometers (136,700 miles) away in a challenge requiring precision control. The capsule is programed to land in a remote, sparsely populated area of Woomera, Australia, on Sunday.Hayabusa2 left the asteroid Ryugu, about 300 million kilometers (180 million miles) away, a year ago and was flying smoothly as planned, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said.“We trained ourselves and now we are fully prepared. So I’m just praying that equipment that hasn’t been used yet will work well and that there will be good weather in Australia,” Yuichi Tsuda, Hayabusa2 project manager at JAXA, said Friday. “We are so excited.”Many Hayabusa2 fans gathered to observe the moment of the capsule separation at public viewing events across the country, including one at the Tokyo Dome stadium.In the early hours of Sunday, the capsule, protected by a heat shield, will briefly turn into a fireball as it reenters the atmosphere 120 kilometers (75 miles) above Earth. At about 10 kilometers (6 miles) above ground, a parachute will open to slow its fall and beacon signals will be transmitted to indicate its location.JAXA staff have set up satellite dishes at several locations in the target area to receive the signals, while also preparing a marine radar, drones and helicopters to assist in the search and retrieval of the pan-shaped capsule, 40 centimeters (15 inches) in diameter.Scientists say they believe the samples, especially ones taken from under the asteroid’s surface, contain valuable data unaffected by space radiation and other environmental factors. They are particularly interested in analyzing organic materials in the samples.JAXA hopes to find clues to how the materials are distributed in the solar system and are related to life on Earth.For Hayabusa2, it’s not the end of the mission it started in 2014. After dropping the capsule, it will return to space and head to another distant small asteroid called 1998KY26 on a journey slated to take 10 years one way.So far, its mission has been fully successful. It touched down twice on Ryugu despite its extremely rocky surface, and successfully collected data and samples during the 1½ years it spent near Ryugu after arriving there in June 2018.In its first touchdown in February 2019, it collected surface dust samples. In a more challenging mission in July that year, it collected underground samples from the asteroid for the first time in space history after landing in a crater that it created earlier by blasting the asteroid’s surface.Asteroids, which orbit the sun but are much smaller than planets, are among the oldest objects in the solar system and therefore may help explain how Earth evolved.Ryugu in Japanese means “Dragon Palace,” the name of a sea-bottom castle in a Japanese folk tale.___Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-awaits-spacecraft-return-with-asteroid-soil-samples/story-LsaSPZbEFLn0wvuQeOVvXI.html
05-12-2020||World||‘Canada has scarce interest in the well-being of Indian farmers’, opposes MSP at WTO: BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) on Saturday slammed Canada’s stand on farmers’ protests in India as “nothing but hypocrisy”, saying it is a strident critic of minimum support price and other agricultural policies at the World Trade Organization(WTO), and often questions India’s domestic agricultural measures, including food and livelihood security.“It (Canada) also opposes import restrictions to protect India’s farmers. The questions posed by Canada to India regarding India’s agri policies in WTO are evidence of the fact that Canada has scarce interest in the genuine well-being of Indian farmers and agriculture producers,” BJP’s foreign affairs department in-charge Vijay Chauthaiwale tweeted.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had recently backed the agitating farmers in India, saying his country will always be there to defend the rights of peaceful protests. He had expressed concern over the situation.Reacting strongly, India on Friday summoned Canadian High Commissioner Nadir Patel and told him that the comments made by Trudeau and others in his cabinet on the protests were an “unacceptable interference” in the country’s internal affairs and these actions, if continued, will have a “seriously damaging” impact on bilateral ties. In a series of tweets tagging Trudeau and Patel, Chauthaiwale said, “Canada’s criticism of India on farmer’s issues is nothing but hypocrisy. Canada is strident critic of MSP and other agriculture policies at the WTO, and often questions India’s domestic agriculture measures including food and livelihood security.”  Noting that Canada is a member of the Cairns Group of agri exporters, he said the body’s objective in WTO negotiations is to seek increased market access in countries like India. It also seeks reduction in the agri subsidies provided to domestic producers, even if such subsidies are subsistence-level, he said. “It also opposes import restrictions to protect India’s farmers. The questions posed by Canada to India regarding India’s agri policies in WTO are evidence of the fact that Canada has scarce interest in the genuine well-being of Indian farmers and agriculture producers,” the BJP leader said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given topmost priority to enhance farmers’ income by increasing minimum support price, giving better access to technology and providing adequate insurance cover for agri products against natural calamities, he said, adding that “Unfortunately, Canada has refused to acknowledge it”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-has-scarce-interest-in-the-well-being-of-indian-farmers-opposes-msp-at-wto-bjp/story-R4ZcJAJRyEIgJW3zXqyQFL.html

The Supreme Court in June blocked Trump’s 2017 bid to end DACA. His administration, however, continued its policy of not accepting new applications for the program.Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he plans to revitalize DACA.Garaufis directed the Department of Homeland Security to post a public notice “displayed prominently” on its websites by Monday announcing that it is accepting new DACA applications. The judge also ordered that the notice make clear that employment authorization under DACA would last for two years rather than one.Read more| Presidential pardons: Here’s the list of key allies, family members Trump could pardonThe Supreme Court decided that the administration’s attempt to end DACA was “arbitrary and capricious” and violated federal law. Following the ruling, acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf in July issued a memo that continued to block new applications to the program while he subjected it to a “full reconsideration.” The memo also limited employment authorization to one year and curtailed recipients’ ability to travel outside the United States.Garaufis found in November that Wolf had been unlawfully appointed to his post, meaning he did not have the authority to issue the July DACA memorandum.DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump’s administration had argued that Obama exceeded his constitutional powers when he created DACA by executive action, bypassing Congress. Obama created DACA after Congress failed to pass bipartisan legislation to overhaul U.S. immigration policy. DACA recipients often are called “Dreamers” based on the name of legislation considered but never passed in Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/setback-for-donald-trump-us-government-ordered-to-reinstate-protections-for-dreamers/story-DO3duBipEpM6B66pcwJpjM.html
05-12-2020||World||What’s in a name?: ‘Adolf Hitler’ wins vote in Namibia||While many Namibians have names originating from the ex-colonial power Germany, a newly-elected municipal councillor has overnight romped to prominence not because of his victory but because he is called Adolf Hitler.Adolf Hitler Uunona, 54, a politician of the ruling SWAPO party was last week elected local government councillor for Ompundja constituency in northern Namibia, with 85 percent of the ballots cast. Sounding a tad annoyed, Uunona told AFP on Thursday he was perplexed that people were intrigued by his being named after one of the world’s most notorious dictators. He refused to discuss the reasons he was named Adolf Hitler.“I am not going to entertain the conversation, there is no reason we should be sitting here, having an entire conversation about my name,” he retorted.“You really want us to have an entire conversation about my name? How will that make Namibia a better country, how will it contribute to the development of our country?” Uunona asked when contacted by an AFP journalist. Germany colonised Namibia -- then South West Africa -- from 1884 to 1915. After World War I, the League of Nations mandated South Africa to administer the territory as a protectorate which ruled for 75 years. German occupiers in Namibia killed tens of thousands of indigenous Herero and Nama people in massacres from 1904 to 1908, which historians have called the first genocide of the 20th century.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-s-in-a-name-adolf-hitler-wins-vote-in-namibia/story-j4gXchWR5lWPWKDjqgrG6O.html
05-12-2020||World||Student, scientist, baker: Meet Gitanjali Rao, Time’s first-ever ‘Kid of the Year’||Selected from more than 5,000 nominees as Time’s first-ever ‘Kid of the Year’, 15-year-old Gitanjali Rao was chosen for her “astonishing work” and using technology to tackle issues from contaminated drinking water to opioid addiction and cyberbullying.Time said Rao, a sophomore at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado’s Denver, stood out for creating a global community of young innovators and inspiring them to pursue their goals. Rao told The Associated Press in a Zoom interview from her home that the prize is “nothing that I could have ever imagined. And I’m so grateful and just so excited that we’re really taking a look at the upcoming generation and our generation since the future is in our hands.” Humbled, honored, and excited! Special thanks to all my mentors, teachers, family, and friends who believed in me and supported me. Congrats to all the finalists and many of them are my friends @jordanjustright from @TheSTEAM_Squad @MightyRebekah @ElijahLee07. They inspire me! https://t.co/wr8EPhauw9Here is what you should know about the Indian American:1. Rao developed a portable device to detect lead in water when she was 12 years old. She told actor, activist and Time contributing editor Angelina Jolie in a Zoom interview that the drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, inspired her work to develop a way to detect contaminants and send those results to a mobile phone.2. “I was like 10 when I told my parents that I wanted to research carbon nanotube sensor technology at the Denver Water quality research lab, and my mom was like, “A what?” Rao told Jolie. She said that work “is going to be in our generation’s hands pretty soon. So if no one else is gonna do it, I’m gonna do it.” The sensor technology involves molecules of carbon atoms that can detect chemical changes, including chemicals in water.3. She has created Epione, a device that diagnoses prescription opioid addiction at an early stage.4. She’s also devised an app called Kindly that uses artificial intelligence to help prevent cyberbullying. It allows teens to type in a word or phrase to find out if the words they are using are bullying and lets them decide to edit what they are sending or to proceed.5. Rao has partnered with rural schools; museums; science, technology, engineering and mathematics organisations; and other institutions to run innovation workshops for thousands of other students.6. She was featured in the web series Marvel’s Hero Project as Genius Gitanjali for her valuable contributions to society. “I think that being a scientist is like being a superhero, because superheroes save people, and want to do what is best for their society – scientists do the same exact thing,” she had earlier told Google.7. The high school student has been featured in the Forbes 30 under 30 list and spoken at several TED events.8. She has also won the EPA Presidential Award, George Stephenson Innovation Award 2020, Kumon 2019 Student Inspirational Award, TCS Ignite Innovation Top Health Pillar Award among others.9. She is also an author. Her A Young Innovative Guide to STEM was published by Simon and Schuster in March this year. She has also written Baby Brother Wonders on the curiosity of her younger brother.10. Rao is also a baker. “Actually, I spend more time doing 15-year-old things during quarantine. I bake an ungodly amount. It’s not good, but it’s baking. And, like, it’s science too,” she said when asked by Jolie if she does things that kids her age do.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/student-scientist-baker-meet-gitanjali-rao-time-s-first-ever-kid-of-the-year/story-bKVzskvtwJblCohz7cmvkJ.html
05-12-2020||World||US urges countries to make law over access to Tibet||Slamming China for its alleged repressive regime in Tibet, a top American diplomat has urged other countries to pass their own versions of a US law that calls for denying access to the US for Chinese officials known to be involved in restricting visits to the remote Himalayan region. Robert A Destro, Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, on Friday said that together with partners around the world, the US has and will continue to call on China to provide unhindered access to foreigners travelling in Tibetan areas, including for diplomats  and  journalists, just as other countries give Chinese diplomats, journalists and citizens access to their respective countries. “The US adopted the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act to press for greater access and transparency. Today, I call on our like minded friends  and partners  to pass their own versions of the Act,” he said in his remarks at a virtual event: “Religious Freedom in Tibet: The Appointment of Buddhist Leaders and the Succession of the Dalai Lama.” The Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in December 2018 calls for denying access to the US for Chinese officials known to be involved in restricting visits to Tibet. The Dalai Lama, Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader has been demanding meaningful autonomy for Tibetans. The 85-year-old Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 following a crackdown on an uprising by the local population in Tibet. India granted him political asylum and the Tibetan government-in-exile is based on Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh since then. China views the 14th Dalai Lama as a “separatist” working to split Tibet from China. Destro said it is no accident that the Chinese Communist Party claims the right to direct the  selection of the next Dalai Lama, and through that process to remake or in its words to “Sinicize” Tibetan Buddhism in its own Communist image.Read more| China ‘planned’ Galwan Valley clash, US commission says in report to Congress “Nor is it a surprise that the  Chinese Communist Party  is ramping up its efforts to eliminate Tibetan language and culture.  It’s doing precisely the same thing with our  Uyghur and Kazakh Muslim brothers and sisters in Xinjiang, and in its efforts to replace the teachings of Jesus and the Prophets with the state-inspired drivel of a ‘patriotic’ church,” he alleged. “This is what information warfare looks like.  In all it says and does, the Chinese Communist Party aims to control not only the information landscape, but the very thoughts of all whose perspectives and approaches to life in community differ from  those of  the Communist Party,” he alleged. “Consider the case of the Panchen Lama.  It’s no accident that he was abducted when he was six years old.  What better way to Sinicize Tibetan Buddhism by installing their own pliable and fake replacement who would promote the Communist Party and weaken Tibetan Buddhist individuality,  while  Sinicizing the real Panchen Lama from youth, relegating his traditional roots to what Leon Trotsky derisively called, quote “the dustbin of history”?” he said. Unfortunately, Tibetan Buddhists are not alone, the American diplomat said. “The Communist Party  feels so threatened by faith in something other than the Party that its leaders are bent on controlling all aspects of religion, from the selection of Catholic bishops and the training of monks, to the content of scripture and the succession of Buddhist spiritual leaders,” he said.  “Driven by a need to control anyone or anything that exists independent of the Party, Communist Party officials use force, intimidation, censorship, and coercion  to shape both the medium and the message,” he alleged.   He alleged that the Communist Party  forces  Chinese citizens into “re-education” and slave labour camps, threatens the families of regime critics, censors  the brave scientists who sought to warn the world about  Covid-19, and corrupt the short-sighted  around the world  with their bribes.  And  the  Communist Party have the audacity to complain that  we  are interfering in their internal affairs.” The United States, he said, is committed to helping Tibetans safeguard their way of life – not  just in Tibet but  also  in India, Nepal, Bhutan and everywhere that it flourishes.  “Within a day of announcing my appointment, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized the US for interfering in China’s internal affairs, as if Tibetan Buddhism belongs  to China.  It  doesn’t.  Tibetan Buddhism belongs to Tibetans and to its adherents everywhere.  If our commitment to human rights means anything, it is our collective duty to bring attention to this unfolding tragedy – for  Tibetans’ sake and for our own,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-urges-countries-to-make-law-over-access-to-tibet/story-VJcTyh23KZRUSMQWls1iOM.html

Bush. “Holding otherwise might spark a wave of unwarranted litigation against the federal government.”Read more| Revival of US navy formation focused on Indian Ocean, partnership with India: US OfficialOpponents of the wall, including a bipartisan group of constitutional scholars and former government officials, claim Trump’s funding shift is an abuse of executive power that usurps Congress’s authority to control federal spending. Lawmakers refused to give Trump more than $1.37 billion of the $5.7 billion he sought for the border wall, leading to a standoff that shut down the government for 35 days in early 2019.U.S. District Judge James Dennis, appointed by President Bill Clinton, dissented, writing that the region’s economic loss of military spending earmarked for nearby Fort Bliss -- the second-largest domestic US Army base -- and damage to El Paso’s reputation as a safe place for tourists and investors provided sufficient grounds for local officials to sue.Dennis also chided his colleagues for letting Trump make an end run around Congress’s “power of the purse” and for setting the bar too high in defining conditions under which communities wronged by federal actions can legally sue.The majority acknowledged it reached the opposite decision than did the San Francisco appellate court, which blocked the Pentagon from shifting a different pot of military funds to border wall construction. The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear the administration’s appeal in that related case, and the Texas border wall opponents are expected to also appeal to the high court.The case is El Paso County, Texas, et al v Donald Trump et al, 19-51144, US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New Orleans).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-wins-court-ruling-allowing-money-to-be-shifted-for-wall/story-HiYRyRs6ofe9DAUrdD7paM.html
05-12-2020||World||WHO hopes to have 500 million vaccine doses via COVAX scheme in first-quarter 2021||The World Health Organization hopes to have half a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines available for distribution by the global COVAX initiative in the first quarter of 2021, its chief scientist said on Friday.To date 189 countries have joined the COVAX programme, which is backed by the WHO and seeks to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines. The United States is not among them, having secured bilateral deals. The initial COVAX plan is to vaccinate the 20% of populations at highest risk, including health workers and people aged over 65. “The goal is to get at least 2 billion doses by end of 2021 which will be enough to vaccinate 20% of the populations of countries that are part of COVAX,” chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a Geneva news conference.This would be enough to “bring to an end the acute phase of the pandemic” by reducing mortality and the impact on health systems, she said.“Our goal, our hope is that in the first quarter of 2021 that we would have about half a billion of doses available to be distributed across the countries, in a fair manner,” Swaminathan said.“So countries can start expecting doses toward the end of the first quarter of 2021. A few countries may start earlier, it’s likely, possible, that we may have some learnings by going early into a few countries,” she said without elaborating.“But then the majority, the bulk of the tranches would probably start moving out in the second quarter of 2021.”COVAX is co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-hopes-to-have-500-million-vaccine-doses-via-covax-scheme-in-first-quarter-2021/story-nq4JjeBtq4evDvNB1PKLYL.html
05-12-2020||World||Joe Biden plans scaled-back inauguration to avoid spreading coronavirus in crowds||Setting a sharp contrast with President Donald Trump, whose administration began with a fight over the size of his inaugural crowds, President-elect Joe Biden said on Friday he plans a scaled-back event for safety’s sake during the pandemic.The Democratic former vice president said he does expect to be sworn in on Jan. 20 on the platform already being constructed on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, but wanted to avoid the crowds that typically gather on the National Mall and along Pennsylvania Avenue to view the ceremony and parade.“My guess is there probably will not be a gigantic inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. But my guess is you’ll see a lot of virtual activity in states all across America, engaging even more people than before,” Biden said in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, where he is preparing his new administration.Trump’s administration memorably began in January 2017 with then-spokesman Sean Spicer berating the news media for publishing photos that showed far smaller crowds than had gathered for President Barack Obama’s historic swearing in as the nation’s first Black president eight years earlier.Biden said his staff is working with the same team that produced August’s largely online Democratic National Convention to plan a swearing-in that did not raise the risks of accelerating the spread of Covid-19, which has surged to a fresh record high in the United States.“People want to celebrate,” said Biden. “People want to be able to say we’ve passed the baton. We’re moving on. Democracy has functioned.”The ceremony typically begins with the outgoing president and the president-elect riding together from the White House to the Capitol. After the new president is sworn in, he rides back along Pennsylvania Avenue to assume his new duties while the former president departs, typically by helicopter.Trump, who has refused to concede the election, has not said if he will attend the ceremony. Instead, according to a source familiar with the internal White House discussion, he is considering launching his bid to run again in 2024 that day.The pandemic has killed more than 273,000 people in the United States and cases and hospitalizations are surging as the winter months approach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-plans-scaled-back-inauguration-to-avoid-spreading-coronavirus-in-crowds/story-dL5I1bz28kL5e1I4XT0gKJ.html
05-12-2020||World||US firms gear up for distribution of Covid vaccines||With the imminent arrival of coronavirus vaccines that will need to be stored at ultra-low temperatures, US companies are gearing up for a massive logistical effort to aid their distribution.Automaker Ford has ordered its own freezers while meat processing giant Smithfield said it is ready to put the cold room at its abattoirs at the disposal of vaccine roll-out operations.Companies specializing in insulating containers have been on a war footing for weeks after Pfizer and BioNTech said the vaccine they had jointly developed needs to be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit (-70 Celsius).US logistics giant UPS is already producing 1100 lbs (500 kilos) of dry ice an hour in its depots and has developed portable freezers capable of storing the vaccines at temperatures of between -4 to -112 Fahrenheit.But companies not directly linked to the manufacture, storage or transport of vaccines are also stepping up.“We have assessed our ultra-low freezer capabilities and capacity and are ready and willing to assist health agencies if storage capacity becomes constrained,” said meat giant Smithfield’s chief administrative director, Keira Lombardo.The meatpacker, which suffered a large number of cases of Covid-19 in some of its US slaughterhouses, said it now stands ready to help authorities distribute the vaccine, particularly to workers in the agricultural and food-supply sector, Lombardo said.For its part, Ford has ordered a dozen ultra-cold freezers in anticipation of the arrival of vaccines, to offer them to employees who want them when they are available.When the virus began to spread in the spring in the United States, the company had to temporarily close its factories. The group has since resumed its activities but with strict health precautions.“The health and safety of our workforce is our top priority,” a spokesman told AFP. General Motors has not gone as far as procuring freezers but said it was in contact with US government agencies and health officials to “coordinate as needed when the distribution plans are made available.”Meanwhile, US refrigerator manufacturer So-Low reported a “tremendous surge” in orders for its freezers that can maintain temperatures as low as -120 Fahrenheit.The company, which supplies industry and research centers, was deluged with orders beginning in late September, sales manager Danny Hensler told AFP.It has also seen a jump in demand for its freezers that get down to -22 Fahrenheit, suitable for storing the vaccine made by Moderna.“We now have a backlog of orders to produce,” Hensler said. “Our employees are working overtime five days a week and we added Saturday to the production schedule.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-firms-gear-up-for-distribution-of-covid-vaccines/story-B51JWhaKfVDTTZKBlSN9jM.html

The document also showed that she had been buried.The certificate was used by her children to claim two life insurance policy payouts worth $1.5 million (approximately 23 crore Pakistani Rupees), the official said.Kharbay, after being declared dead, travelled at least 10 times abroad from the Karachi International Airport, apparently under assumed identities with none of the airlines being able to detect the fraud.“She visited some five countries, but every time she returned home,” the official said.The FIA human trafficking cell has now registered criminal cases against the woman, her son and daughter and some local government officials, including a doctor.“The American authorities alerted us about this woman and we started investigation into this large-scale fraud,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-woman-gets-1-5-mn-life-insurance-claims-on-false-death-certificate/story-pBBkRCwIf7Bkl417pXeK4J.html
05-12-2020||World||Joe Biden officially secures enough electors to become president||California certified its presidential election Friday and appointed 55 electors pledged to vote for Democrat Joe Biden, officially handing him the Electoral College majority needed to win the White House.Secretary of State Alex Padilla’s formal approval of Biden’s win in the state brought his tally of pledged electors so far to 279, according to a tally by The Associated Press. That’s just over the 270 threshold for victory.These steps in the election are often ignored formalities. But the hidden mechanics of electing a U.S. president have drawn new scrutiny this year as President Donald Trump continues to deny Biden’s victory and pursues increasingly specious legal strategies aimed at overturning the results before they are finalized.Although it’s been apparent for weeks that Biden won the presidential election, his accrual of more than 270 electors is the first step toward the White House, said Edward B. Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University.“It is a legal milestone and the first milestone that has that status,” Foley said. “Everything prior to that was premised on what we call projections.”The electors named Friday will meet Dec. 14, along with counterparts in each state, to formally vote for the next president. Most states have laws binding their electors to the winner of the popular vote in their state, measures that were upheld by a Supreme Court decision this year. There have been no suggestions that any of Biden’s pledged electors would contemplate not voting for him.Results of the Electoral College vote are due to be received, and typically approved, by Congress on Jan. 6. Although lawmakers can object to accepting the electors’ votes, it would be almost impossible for Biden to be blocked at that point.The Democratic-controlled House and Republican-controlled Senate would both vote separately to resolve any disputes. One already has arisen from Pennsylvania, where 75 Republican lawmakers signed a statement on Friday urging Congress to block the state’s electoral votes from being cast for Biden. But the state’s Republican U.S. senator, Pat Toomey, said soon afterward that he would not be objecting to Pennsylvania’s slate of electors, underscoring the difficulty in trying to change the election results through Congress.“As a practical matter, we know that Joe Biden is going to be inaugurated on Jan. 20,” Foley said.That was clear in the days after the election, when the count of mail ballots gradually made clear that Biden had won victories in enough states to win the Electoral College. It became even more apparent in late November, when every swing state won by Biden certified him as the winner of its elections and appointed his electors to the Electoral College. Trump has fruitlessly tried to stop those states from certifying Biden as the winner and appointing electors for the former vice president.He made no effort in deeply Democratic California, the most populous state in the nation and the trove of its largest number of electoral votes. Three more states won by Biden — Colorado, Hawaii and New Jersey — have not yet certified their results. When they do, Biden will have 306 Electoral College votes to Trump’s 232.Trump and his allies have brought at least 50 legal cases trying to overturn the results in the swing states Biden won — mainly Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. More than 30 have been rejected or dropped, according to an AP tally.Trump and his allies have also raised the far-fetched notion that Republican state legislatures in those states could appoint a rival set of electors pledged to Trump.But state Republican leaders have rejected that approach, and it would likely be futile in any case. According to federal law, both chambers of Congress would need to vote to accept a competing slate of electors. If they don’t, the electors appointed by the states’ governors — all pledged to Biden in these cases — must be used.The last remaining move to block the election would be the quixotic effort to vote down the electors in Congress.This tactic has been tried — a handful of congressional Democrats in 2000, 2004 and 2016 objected to officially making both George W. Bush and Trump president. But the numbers were not enough to block the two men from taking office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-officially-secures-enough-electors-to-become-president/story-FZ66HK7q8tv4NRMrbXhXyJ.html

I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power just like I don’t think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide,” Biden told reporters at a news conference in Wilmington, Delaware. Biden was responding to a question if Covid-19 vaccine be made mandatory. Biden, who is due to take office on January 20, said he will make sure that the vaccine is both free and available and that any follow up on the vaccine is free and available that relates to any health complications from it. “I will do everything in my power as the president of the United States to encourage people to do the right thing, and when they do it, demonstrate that it matters. That’s why I said in my inaugural speech I’m going to ask people to commit for 100 days to wear a mask, not because I’m asking it for any reason to punish-this is not a political issue,” he said. “It has become one. But if people do it for 100 days in the middle of what will be still a raging crisis and the vaccine is able to be distributed, they are going to see deaths drop off the edge,” he said. “They are going to see hundreds of thousands of people not getting sick; and my hope is they will be then inclined to say okay, it’s worth the patriotic duty to go ahead and protect other people,” Biden said. On Friday the US recorded 2,861 new deaths. It has seen more than 14 million confirmed cases in total and more than 275,000 deaths. Biden said he is willing to get inoculated in public to assuage any concerns about its efficacy and safety. “I think that my taking the vaccine and people seeing me take that vaccine is going to give some confidence,” Biden said, responding to a question adding that what bothers him the most is the wild assertions the Trump administration is making about how this is going to go away. “It was diminishing confidence across the board and the American people overall, but particularly in this administration with the African American and Latino community, what I heard from my friends in the community who are not but blocks from here as we stand, is that, “We’re not going to be the guinea pigs. We’re not going to be the guinea pigs.” Well, the fact of the matter is that they won’t be,” he said. “You’re going to see tens of millions of Americans taking the vaccine and you’re going to see the president of the United States and three of the four living former presidents doing it publicly as well. It’s going to take some effort to rebuild confidence in science because it’s been so diminished in this administration thus far,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-will-not-be-mandatory-joe-biden/story-b4SpbSAYDElfBriDDiAJOL.html
05-12-2020||World||World can start dreaming of pandemic’s end: UN health chief||The UN health chief declared Friday that positive results from coronavirus vaccine trials mean the world “can begin to dream about the end of the pandemic,” but he said rich and powerful nations must not trample the poor and marginalized “in the stampede for vaccines.”In an address to the U.N. General Assembly’s first high-level session on the pandemic, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned that while the virus can be stopped, “the path ahead remains treacherous.”The pandemic has shown humanity at “its best and worst,” he said, pointing to “inspiring acts of compassion and self-sacrifice, breathtaking feats of science and innovation, and heartwarming demonstrations of solidarity, but also disturbing signs of self-interest, blame-shifting and divisions.”Referring to the current upsurge in infections and deaths, Tedros said without naming any countries that “where science is drowned out by conspiracy theories, where solidarity is undermined by division, where sacrifice is substituted with self interest, the virus thrives, the virus spreads.”He warned in a virtual address to the high-level meeting that a vaccine “will not address the vulnerabilities that lie at its root” -- poverty, hunger, inequality and climate change, which he said must be tackled once the pandemic ends.“We cannot and we must not go back to the same exploitative patterns of production and consumption, the same disregard for the planet that sustains all life, the same cycle of panic and meddling and the same divisive politics that fueled this pandemic,” he said.On vaccines, Tedros said, “the light at the end of the tunnel is growing steadily brighter,” but vaccines “must be shared equally as global public goods, not as private commodities that widen inequalities and become yet another reason some people are left behind.”He said WHO’s ACT-Accelerator program to quickly develop and distribute vaccines fairly “is in danger of becoming no more than a noble gesture” without major new funding.He said $4.3 billion is needed immediately to lay the groundwork for mass procurement and delivery of vaccines and a further $23.9 billion is required for 2021. That total, Tedros said, is less than one-half of 1 percent of the $11 trillion in stimulus packages announced so far by the Group of 20, the world’s richest countries.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made a similar appeal for funding for the ACT-Accelerator at Thursday’s opening of the two-day General Assembly session. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Friday that Guterres is frustrated and would have liked see “a much much higher rate of investment by those countries who can.”Despite years of warnings, Tedros said, many countries were unprepared for the pandemic and assumed their health systems would protect their people. Many countries that have done best dealing with the crisis had experience responding to the outbreaks of SARS, MERS, HINI and other infectious diseases, he said.WHO has been sharply criticized for not taking a stronger and more vocal role in handling the pandemic.Tedros told the meeting that “clearly, the global system for preparedness needs attention.”He said a WHO commission established in September is reviewing international health regulations. WHO is also working with several countries on developing a pilot program in which countries agree to regular and transparent reviews of their health preparedness, he said.The pandemic also showed the need for a global system to share samples of viruses and other pathogens that cause disease to facilitate development of “medical counter-measures as global public goods” he said, welcoming Switzerland’s offer to use a high-security laboratory to manage a new biobank.Tedros also backed European Union chief Charles Michel’s proposal for an international treaty under which WHO would monitor the risks of emerging infectious diseases in animals for transmission to humans, ensure alerts of health risks, improve access to health care, and address financing needs. He said this would provide “the political underpinning” for strengthening the global health sector.The world spends $7.5 trillion on health every year, almost 10% of global GDP, Tedros said, but most of that money is spent in rich countries on treating disease rather than on “promoting and protecting health.”“We need a radical rethink on the way we view and value health,” he said.“If the world is to avoid another crisis on this scale,” Tedros said, “investments in basic public health functions, especially primary health care, are essential, and all roads should lead to universal health coverage with a strong foundation of primary health care.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-can-start-dreaming-of-pandemic-s-end-un-health-chief/story-dZ6Da6VFNAIN30uxcLmKZP.html
05-12-2020||World||US imposes visa restrictions on more Chinese citizens||The State Department said Friday that it would deny visas to Chinese citizens linked to overseas influence operations involving violence and other means of intimidation.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the restrictions would apply to Chinese Communist Party officials or anyone else taking part in such propaganda or influence campaigns affiliated with the United Front Work Department.The United Front has been involved in efforts to put pressure on people outside China’s borders who raise concerns about human rights abuses in the Uighur region, Tibet and elsewhere. Its “coercive tactics” have included publicly releasing personal details about critics and their family members online as a means of intimidation, Pompeo said in announcing the new restrictions.The measure is intended to show that “those responsible for actions that contravene the rules-based international order are not welcome in the United States,” he said.The restrictions are the latest punitive measure taken against China’s leadership and economy in response to sharpening disputes over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, trade, technology, Taiwan and a host of other issues.Chinese citizens would be denied a visa to enter the United States if they have taken part in United Front efforts using violence, threats or other means of pressure against overseas Chinese communities, academics or civil society groups in the U.S. or elsewhere to advance the “CCP’s authoritarian narratives and policy preferences,” the State Department said in a separate statement on the measure.It wasn’t immediately clear how many people would potentially be covered by the new restrictions.The move comes the same week that the U.S. announced plans to place new time limits on visas for members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families, cutting the time that the travel documents are valid from 10 years to one month.China responded to those restrictions by accusing the U.S. government of “an escalation of political suppression.” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Thursday that the travel restrictions were “totally inconsistent with the U.S.’s own interests” and would damage America’s global image.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-visa-restrictions-on-more-chinese-citizens/story-b4YKopIkx1VchECLY4PGfK.html
05-12-2020||World||Joe Biden to ask Americans to wear masks for 100 days||President-elect Joe Biden has said he will ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his presidency to help fight the continuing spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.He has also said he had asked Dr Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist who was often at odds with President Donald Trump, to stay on as a chief medical adviser. Both Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris spoke to CNN in a joint interview on a wide range of issues ahead of the inauguration day on January 20.“The first day I’m inaugurated ...I’m going to ask the public for 100 days to mask. Just 100 days to mask, not forever,” Biden said. Masks will be mandated, however, in federal buildings and on public transport.He expressed hope that vaccinations and masking would drive down Covid numbers considerably. Asked if he had spoken to Fauci and whether he will ask him to stay, Biden said, “Yes and yes. I asked him to stay on in the exact same role as he’s had for the past several presidents, and I asked him to be a chief medical adviser for me as well and be part of the Covid team.”Biden will join his predecessors Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama to take Covid-19 vaccination publicly to reassure Americans who are sceptical. “It’s important to communicate to the American people it’s safe, safe to do this.”Harris, meanwhile, has announced an all-female White House team: Tina Flournoy as chief of staff; Rohini Kosoglu, a longtime associate of Sri Lankan descent, as domestic policy advisor; and Nancy McEldowney, a career diplomat, as national security advisor.There are reports Biden will name Indian American Vivek Murthy to serve as Surgeon General, reappointing him to a position he held in President Barack Obama’s second term. This time, Murthy, who co-chairs Biden’s Covid-19 advisory board, will have a broader mandate. Murthy was in running for secretary of health and human services, but Biden is reportedly looking at Michelle Lujan Grisham, New Mexico’s Hispanic governor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-ask-americans-to-wear-masks-for-100-days/story-FNS0VT2ZDuDX1RaU7xKlQL.html
05-12-2020||World||Trump campaign spent over $2 million on election lawyers||US President Donald Trump’s campaign paid nearly $9 million in its so-far unsuccessful bid to overturn the results of the presidential election, including nearly $2.3 million to lawyers and consultants who helped bring a series of longshot court cases.Jenna Ellis, 36, the attorney who has been one of the most prominent faces of the Trump legal and public relations blitz, was paid $30,000 in November, according to a report the campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission late Thursday.In October, Ellis, a senior legal adviser to the campaign, was paid $138,258, according to a previous filing.Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney who has spearheaded the campaign’s post-election legal efforts, does not appear in the disclosures.Giuliani and Ellis have barnstormed a series of legislative meetings over the past couple of weeks to promote unsubstantiated claims that fraud was rampant in the November election and to urge state lawmakers to step in and declare Trump the winner.Giuliani and Ellis did not respond to requests for comment.Spokesmen for Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to questions.The FEC filing, which covers the period from October 15 through November 23, classified about $8.8 million in expenses as “recount” related.Legal consulting was the campaign’s second-biggest recount expense, according to the disclosure report. The first was $3 million to pay the cost of a partial recount in Wisconsin that ended up increasing Biden’s lead by 87 votes. The third largest recount expense was nearly $2.2 million for text message advertising as the campaign bombarded his supporters with requests for money.The legal effort has been a powerful fund raising tool. Trump’s campaign reported that it had raised more than $207 million since the election.Trump’s attorneys have mounted a series of lawsuits in battleground states, hoping to persuade state and federal judges to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the November election. Despite the president’s repeated, and unsubstantiated, claims that the election was “rigged,” the court cases have focused on more narrow claims of mail-in voting irregularities.Judges have largely rejected those claims. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit last week ruled against Trump in a case in which he was seeking to overturn the results of Pennsylvania’s election, saying “Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.”A law firm that has done extensive personal work for Trump, Kasowitz Benson Torres, the highest paid member of the recount team, received $600,000 in November, according to the FEC filing. Kasowitz is not listed as counsel of record on any post-election lawsuits that the campaign has brought.Marc Kasowitz did not return requests for comment.Another firm, Marks & Sokolov, of Philadelphia, received $161,841. The company is best known for its work in Russia and Ukraine. The firm, for example, represents Ihor Kolomoisky, a Ukrainian billionaire.“The Trump campaign has engaged our firm to provide legal advice,” Bruce Marks told Reuters, “I’m not going to discuss anything that’s not public about the work we’ve done for the campaign.” Marks said he first met Trump in 1994, when Marks was a state senator, and Trump came to a fund raising event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-spent-over-2-million-on-election-lawyers/story-LNtcPetKDEtToQjJqsCdYI.html
05-12-2020||World||US House votes to decriminalize marijuana at federal level||The US House of Representatives voted on Friday to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level, but the legislation is not expected to advance further as long as the Senate remains in Republican hands.It was the first time either chamber of Congress has voted to end the federal ban on marijuana since the drug was listed as a “controlled substance” in 1970. Fifteen US states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational use of marijuana, and over 30 states allow some form of the drug for medicinal purposes. US cannabis sales hit record levels over the Thanksgiving weekend. But the federal ban on the drug persists, which creates conflicts with state laws and limits cannabis companies’ access to banking services and funding.The Democratic-majority House voted 228-164, largely along party lines, to lift the federal prohibition. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, is an opponent of the change, meaning a decriminalization proposal is unlikely to see Senate action unless Democrats manage to win both Georgia Senate seats and with them Senate control in a January 5 run off election. The bill the House passed would allow states to regulate marijuana, Representative Earl Blumenauer, a Democrat and co-chairman of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, said in debate.“This legislation does not legalize cannabis across the country. It stops the federal government from interfering with what states have decided to do,” he said.Republican representative Debbie Lesko said she found it incredible that Democrats were talking about “legalizing marijuana” instead of focusing on passing more relief from the coronavirus pandemic. “Sometimes I think that the world is turned upside down,” she said.In fact, the House in May passed a mammoth coronavirus aid bill, but it did not advance in the Republican-run Senate. Negotiations are underway on a smaller compromise bill.The cannabis bill would expunge federal marijuana convictions and impose a 5% tax on cannabis products. The revenue raised would help reinvest in communities most adversely impacted by enforcement of the law, Blumenauer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-votes-to-decriminalize-marijuana-at-federal-level/story-jJh4otiYFjkyTkiYeeCAQP.html
05-12-2020||World||Carbon emissions close to record price ahead of EU Summit||The price of European Union carbon emissions hit 30 euros a metric ton for the second time this week as traders prepare for stricter measures from the bloc to address climate change.Breaching the 30-euro mark is seen as a key trigger that could usher in a new era for the pollution market, as Europe looks to speed up its decarbonization plans and reach net zero by 2050. Next week the EU leaders will gather for a summit to potentially agree an emissions plan that could push carbon through a 14 year high.Carbon has hit this price range twice before this year, in July and September, before falling back down. Each time the surge has been driven by market expectations about the EU’s climate plans.EU leaders are expected to clash over whether to cut emissions by at least 55% by 2030, up from a current goal of 40%. A decision next week could push carbon prices beyond the record high of 31 euros a ton set in April 2006.“The belief in the market is that the political ambition or regulatory ambition is going to be raised,” said Marcus Ferdinand, head of European carbon and power analytics at ICIS. “The market is really in high expectation mode for a combined effort to hammer out a 2030 agreement.”Breaking that record is imminent, especially as the supply of permits is set to be unusually low this winter after the European Commission decided to delay the start of 2021 auctions until at least late January, according to Tom Lord, head of trading and risk management at Redshaw Advisors Ltd.“We think it is coming,” he said. “With this auction shutdown we feel that we could quite easily get over 31 euros in the coming weeks with no auction supply.”Ferdinand, the ICIS analyst, said he expects prices to continue higher and end next year at 32.50 euros a ton then go to as much as 50 euros by 2023.The persistent upward shift of carbon prices is helping drive out coal from Europe’s power grid. Even some of the newest and most efficient plants bid in a recent German auction to get paid to close down as operators see the rising carbon price cutting into potential profits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/carbon-emissions-close-to-record-price-ahead-of-eu-summit/story-jpznXrRTwTHprAXHBRwRPK.html
05-12-2020||World||UK, EU trade talks at ‘difficult’ point as deadline approaches||UK and EU trade talks are at a “difficult” point, the British government said on Friday, as UK officials poured cold water on hopes of an imminent breakthrough — and France said it could veto any agreement it didn’t like.As the intense talks approached crunch point, UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said Britain was “committed to reaching an agreement.”“But, of course, time is short and we are in a difficult phase. There’s no denying that,” he told the BBC. “There are a number of tricky issues that still have to be resolved.”EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, his British counterpart David Frost and their teams remained locked in talks in a London conference center after a week of late-night sessions fuelled by deliveries of sandwiches and pizza.Philip Rycroft, former chief civil servant in the UK’s Brexit department, said negotiations were “now very close to the endgame.”“This can’t go on for much longer,” he told Sky News.UK officials sought to dampen hopes of an imminent deal, briefing media outlets that the EU had set back negotiations by making last-minute demands, an allegation the bloc denies.The UK left the EU early this year, but remains part of the 27-nation bloc’s economic embrace during an 11-month transition as the two sides try to negotiate a new free-trade deal to take effect January 1. Any deal must be approved by lawmakers in Britain and the EU before year’s end.Talks have dragged on as one deadline after another has slipped by. First, the goal was a deal by October, then by mid-November. On Sunday, Britain said the negotiations were in their final week.European Council President Charles Michel noted that it wasn’t the first time that deadlines had slipped.“We will see what will happen in the next days,” he said in Brussels. “But the end of December is the end of December and we know that after the 31st of December we have the 1st of January, and we know that we need to have clarity as soon as possible.”A trade deal will allow goods to move between Britain and the EU without tariffs or quotas after the end of this year, though there would still be new costs and red tape for businesses on both sides of the English Channel.If there is no deal, New Year’s Day will bring huge disruption, with the overnight imposition of tariffs and other barriers to UK-EU trade. That will hurt both sides, but the burden will fall most heavily on Britain, which does almost half its trade with the EU.Months of tense negotiations have produced agreement on a swath of issues, but serious differences remain over the “level playing field” — the standards the UK must meet to export into the bloc — and how future disputes are resolved. That’s key for the EU, which fears Britain will slash social and environmental standards and pump state money into UK industries, becoming a low-regulation economic rival on the bloc’s doorstep.But the UK government, which sees Brexit as all about “taking back control” from Brussels, is resisting curbs on its freedom to set future economic policies.Another sticking point is fish, a small part of the economy with an outsized symbolic importance for Europe’s maritime nations. EU countries want their boats to be able to keep fishing in British waters, while the UK insists it must control access and quotas.Fishing is especially important to France, which is seen by many on the UK side as the EU nation most resistant to compromise.“If there was to be an agreement and it was not good, we would oppose it,” Clement Beaune, France’s junior minister in charge of European Affairs, told Europe 1 radio. “France like all its (EU) partners has a veto right.”If there is no weekend breakthrough, next week will bring more complications. On Monday Britain’s House of Commons will vote on a bill that gives Britain the power to breach parts of the legally binding withdrawal agreement it struck with the EU last year.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government acknowledges that the Internal Market Bill breaches international law, and the legislation has been condemned by the EU, US President-elect Joe Biden and scores of British lawmakers, including many from Johnson’s own Conservative Party.The House of Lords, Parliament’s upper chamber, removed the law-breaking clauses from the legislation last month, but Johnson’s government says it will ask lawmakers to reinsert them.That would further sour the talks, demolishing any good will that remains between the two sides.German government spokesman Steffen Seibert stressed that EU nations wanted a deal, “but not at any cost.”“And of course we must also prepare for all scenarios, including for the possibility that there won’t be an agreement,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-trade-talks-at-difficult-point-as-deadline-approaches/story-XzbpOOBbfokwhgZV083k4K.html
05-12-2020||World||Pak issues special permit to Saudi Crown Prince, two others to hunt rare houbara bustards: Report||Pakistan has issued special permits to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and two other members of the royal family to hunt the internationally protected houbara bustards during the hunting season 2020-21, according to a media report on Friday.Sources said the two other hunters are governors and one of them is a defaulter as he has not paid the hunting fees for last year.The hunters had been allocated certain hunting areas in two provinces — Balochistan and Punjab, the Dawn newspaper reported. Also Watch | ‘Pakistan can’t make its own roads’: Rajnath Singh mocks China dependenceThey said that though the foreign ministry was expected to maintain the protocol and official hierarchy, the name of the most powerful person and “real” ruler of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman has been mentioned at the bottom of the list of hunters sent to the Saudi Embassy in Islamabad.The houbara bustard is a resident of the colder Central Asian region. It migrates southwards every year to spend its winters in a relatively warmer environment in Pakistan.Arab hunters are specially invited by the Pakistan government to hunt them.Owing to its dwindling population, the houbara is not only protected under various international nature conservation treaties but is also protected under local wildlife protection laws. Pakistanis are not allowed to hunt it.The sources told the newspaper that earlier Prime Minister Imran Khan, when he was in the Opposition, used to criticise the then federal government for issuing houbara hunting permits and had not allowed houbara hunting in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where his Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf ruled, but now has issued the permits to hunters from Saudi Arabia.The sources said that the hunting permits issued by the foreign ministry’s deputy chief of protocol (P&I) on October 16 were delivered to the Saudi Embassy to be sent to the hunters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-issues-special-permit-to-saudi-crown-prince-two-others-to-hunt-rare-houbara-bustards-report/story-ZkNCyvxae4zC4rfWLhdGjP.html
05-12-2020||World||China has eradicated absolute poverty: President Xi Jinping||Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared victory in the country’s drive to eliminate extreme poverty, a major goal for the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) as it approaches its centenary in 2021.Xi announced the verdict at a meeting of the seven-member CPC politburo standing committee, the highest decision-making body in China, on Thursday, official news agency Xinhua reported on Friday.“China has removed all poor counties from the poverty list, and eradicated absolute poverty and regional poverty,” Xi was quoted as saying.The announcement is a propaganda victory for the Communist Party - and a personal one for President Xi - capping an eight-year anti-poverty drive, and coming in a year in which China’s economy has been battered by the Covid-19 pandemic.It is part of China’s efforts to, what the CPC calls, a “moderately prosperous” society - possibly the most critical component on which its political legitimacy among the 1.4 billion people in China depends. “We have achieved in a timely manner the poverty alleviation goal of the new era,” Xi said at the meeting. “Through eight years of sustained work, China has lifted all rural poor populations under the current standard out of poverty and nearly 100 million poor people have shaken off poverty.”The anti-poverty drive has to be sustained, the meeting discussed, according to the Xinhua report.“At present, the country still faces acute problems caused by unbalanced and inadequate development as well as onerous tasks of consolidating and expanding poverty alleviation achievements,” said the meeting.The meeting called for efforts to keep the existing supportive policies, financial support and assistance basically stable.Chinese government statistics say the country has lifted some 850 million out of poverty, contributing over 70% to global poverty reduction, in the last few decades.The country’s rural poor population was slashed from 98.99 million at the end of 2012 to 5.51 million at the end of 2019, with the poverty ratio in rural regions dropping from 10.2% to 0.6%, according to government statistics.Chinese government’s own flattering statistics on poverty alleviation have been questioned.The debate over the number of poor in China was reignited last May when Premier Li Keqiang said the monthly income of some 600 million Chinese was 1000 yuan (Rs 10,000).“It’s barely enough to cover monthly rent in a mid-sized Chinese city,” Li said at his annual press conference at the closing of China’s legislature, the National People’s Congress (NPC) in Beijing.“Extreme poverty is officially gone and millions of villagers have been moved off mountaintops, but many more continue to live with significant privation. The uneducated and elderly will struggle to move up further, and there’s plenty of penury in urban areas and among migrants, often excluded from official discourse that has focused on rural poverty. Inequality is rising, too,” a Bloomberg report said in late November after China’s last nine counties were removed from the poverty list last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-has-eradicated-absolute-poverty-president-xi-jinping/story-Tss8ZE4vRzbrgtl2Hi2lCM.html
