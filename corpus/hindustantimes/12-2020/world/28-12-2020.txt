All the subsidized conservative press would be rubbing its hands,” he said, adding that most of the traditional print and broadcast media in the country were against him.On social media, skepticism had greeted the president’s announcement that he was serious about ending the conferences.Before he admitted it was a joke, many of Mexico’s main newspapers did not carry a story on the front of their websites about what would have been a major change in policy.Since taking office two years ago, Lopez Obrador has used the conferences, which begin at 7 a.m. and can last over two hours, to set the political agenda and take critics to task.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-president-plays-joke-on-media-bluffs-over-ending-press-conferences/story-BsVLK5ewqSKXLo4FAh5xoI.html
28-12-2020||World||Millions of Americans may not receive financial aid for 2020’s final week. Here’s why||US President Donald Trump on Sunday reluctantly signed a massive $2.3 trillion Covid-19 relief and government funding bill, averting the possibility of a weeks-long government shutdown at the last minute. The latest Covid-19 stimulus package has ensured that an estimated 12 million people under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation programs will now receive payments for another 11 weeks. Additionally, US nationals receiving jobless payments will get a $300 weekly boost from the federal government through mid-March. However, the delay in signing the bill means millions of Americans getting financial aid in two key pandemic unemployment programs may not receive a payment for the final week of the year. According to a CNN report, the payments could also be delayed for several weeks since state agencies have to reprogram their computers. Also, the states won’t be able to provide financial assistance for the weeks that started before programs were authorised through the Covid-19 relief bill.Also Read | Donald Trump ends days of drama, signs pandemic relief bill into lawIn a statement released by the White House, Trump said that he was signing the bill to restore unemployment benefits, stop evictions, provide rental assistance, and add substantially more money for vaccine distribution.“As President of the United States it is my responsibility to protect the people of our country from the economic devastation and hardship that was caused by the China Virus,” the statement read.The outgoing US president said that he signed the bill only after securing a commitment from the lawmakers to consider legislation to increase payments to individuals from $600 to $2,000. Trump also claimed that Congress has promised to review Section 230 and either terminate or substantially reform it.Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is considered extremely vital for social media networks since the firm cannot be held accountable for the millions of content posted by users. Trump added that the House and the Senate have agreed to focus strongly on the “very substantial voter fraud” in the recently concluded presidential elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-of-americans-may-not-receive-financial-aid-for-2020-s-final-week-here-s-why/story-h6WEy1drl94dFrjhINHcYJ.html
28-12-2020||World||Donald Trump ends days of drama, signs pandemic relief bill into law||US President Donald Trump finally relented on Sunday, signing into law a bill that will provide $900 billion in Covid-19 relief for American families and business, and $1.4 trillion to keep the federal government funded until September.Trump reversed his position as inexplicably as he had announced his objections to the bill’s terms earlier last week.The spending legislation had been negotiated by his administration and passed with wide majorities in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and Republican-led Senate.Trump conveyed his decision in a statement on Sunday evening, a day after jobless benefits for an estimated 14 million Americans expired because of delay to the bill being taken up by the US president. The stimulus package will include $600 in direct payment to every qualifying American, assistance for small businesses, and funds for the states for the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines.“I am signing this bill to restore unemployment benefits, stop evictions, provide rental assistance, add money for PPP (Paycheck Protection Programme — assistance to companies to keep employees on their rolls), return our airline workers back to work, add substantially more money for vaccine distribution, and much more,” Trump said in the statement.The outgoing president went on to list concessions he had claimed to obtain for signing the bill. He said, for instance, the House will vote to increase direct payments from $600 to $2,000 as he had been demanding. The House is expected to pass a measure to that effect on Monday, but the Senate is unlikely to clear it.Trump also said he will be sending a “redlined” version of the bill for the removal of wasteful expenditure. But there was no enthusiasm for it among lawmakers. He further claimed that congress will “review” a law that protects social media platforms from liability for their content, and also, there will be “focus” on voter fraud. Neither of these claims is expected to be met.The US president won no real concessions by delaying his nod to a bill that was negotiated and crafted by officials of his own administration, led by treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, and was passed with overwhelming support by both chambers of congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-ends-days-of-drama-signs-pandemic-relief-bill-into-law/story-g6v0IftQOqppt0vtXYSpyK.html
28-12-2020||World||Bangladesh sends second group of Rohingya refugees to isolated island||Officials in Bangladesh sent a second group of Rohingya refugees to an isolated island in the Bay of Bengal on Monday despite calls by human rights groups for a halt to the process.More than 30 buses carrying about 1,500 refugees left their camps in Cox’s Bazar district on the way to the island, a government official involved with the process said.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the refugees will stay overnight in a temporary shelter in the southeastern city of Chattogram and are expected to reach Bhasan Char island on naval vessels on Tuesday at noon.The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that more than 1,500 Rohingya refugees left Cox’s Bazar voluntarily under government management.Authorities say the refugees were selected for relocation based on their willingness, and that no pressure was applied on them. But several human rights and activist groups say some refugees have been forced to go to the island, located 21 miles (34 kilometers) from the mainland.The island surfaced only 20 years ago and was not previously inhabited. It was regularly submerged by monsoon rains but now has flood protection embankments, houses, hospitals and mosques built at a cost of more than $112 million by the Bangladesh navy.The island’s facilities are designed to accommodate 100,000 people, just a fraction of the million Rohingya Muslims who fled waves of violent persecution in their native Myanmar and are currently living in crowded, squalid refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar district.Authorities sent a first group of 1,642 Rohingya to the island on Dec. 4 despite calls for a halt by human rights groups.International aid agencies and the UN have opposed the relocation since it was first proposed in 2015, expressing fear that a big storm could overwhelm the island and endanger thousands of lives.The United Nations also voiced concern that refugees be allowed to make a “free and informed decision” about whether to relocate. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have urged the government to cancel the plan.An influential Cabinet minister and general secretary of the governing party, Obaidul Quader, said Monday that the international community is opposing the relocation illogically.Quader said in a news conference that the Rohingya are being moved to the island because their repatriation to Myanmar has been delayed.He said refugees who were earlier taken to Bhashan Char have expressed satisfaction. “But some international organizations and media are saying the Rohingya were forcibly shifted, which is not true,” Quader said.About 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled from Buddhist-majority Myanmar to Bangladesh after August 2017, when Myanmar’s military began a harsh crackdown on the minority group following an attack by insurgents. Security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and burning thousands of homes.Bangladesh has attempted to start sending refugees back to Myanmar under a bilateral agreement, but no one was willing to go.The Rohingya are not recognized as citizens in Myanmar, rendering them stateless, and face other state-sanctioned discrimination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-sends-second-group-of-rohingya-refugees-to-isolated-island/story-HxiRs6BADBEf3wpeVe6yvJ.html

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases highlighted the politicisation of Covid-19 measures, such as wearing face masks and following social distancing norms.“Unfortunately, this year, I think it’s no secret to anyone following what’s going on that there is a considerable degree of divisiveness in this country,” Fauci told BBC Radio 4 in a programme aired on Monday.During the initial days of the coronavirus outbreak, US President Donald Trump was reluctant to wear a mask and held events where attendees were seen flouting social distancing measures. In April, Trump called people protesting against their governors’ social distancing measures as “great people”. Fauci had then stated that the virus has nothing to do with the economics, adding that it is important to get it under control before the gradual reopening of businesses.“What we see is somewhat of a politicisation, where...things like the wearing of masks become a political statement, where...keeping away from crowds becomes a political statement, that has made it very problematic as we’ve dealt with this unprecedented and historic outbreak,” he said.Also Read | Dr Anthony Fauci says worst of Covid-19 pandemic still to comeThe 80-year-old immunologist pointed out that the disparity among states over the measures has also been a major weakness in the Covid-19 response. He said that pandemic doesn’t know the difference between state borders and a degree of consistency is required in the government’s response.“There have been a lot of factors that have led to the fact that unfortunately for us, the United States has been the hardest-hit country in the world, but I believe that disparity among how states do things has been a major weakness in our response,” he added.According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre tally, the United States has reported over 19 million Covid-19 cases and more than 333,000 related deaths so far. While the US has rolled out two vaccines to provide immunity against the infection, the current projections by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE) suggest that around 193,000 people could lose their lives over the next two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/considerable-degree-of-divisiveness-slowed-down-us-covid-19-response-anthony-fauci/story-JuGmxcmTKFH2qvSATlgjVP.html
28-12-2020||World||Russia to test new Covid-19 antibody drug from new year||Russia will begin trials of an antibody treatment for Covid-19 patients next year, the head of the Moscow institute that developed the country’s first vaccine against the new disease, Sputnik V, said on Monday.Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Institute, was cited by the RIA news agency as saying that he hoped trials for the new antibody-based drug would begin in the autumn of 2021.“I hope clinical trials will begin in autumn,” he said. “We need to develop this drug using several technologies at the same time, which is something that is being done right now.”Russia has been asking Covid-19 patients to donate blood plasma, which is rich in antibodies, for research.Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump was treated with an experimental antibody cocktail for Covid-19 produced by drugmaker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.Antibodies are proteins made by the body’s immune system that latch on to and neutralize an invading virus. Regeneron’s cocktail contains an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from Covid-19.Gamaleya’s Gintsburg said on Sunday that the new Russian drug would be made up of “monoclonal antibodies”, genetically engineered versions of the antibodies that are found in the blood plasma of those who have been sick with Covid-19, the TASS news agency reported.Russia last week stopped taking in new volunteers for its main human trial of Sputnik V, with developers saying it was unethical to administer a placebo to participants now that the shot was increasingly available to the public.Russia began inoculating small numbers of people in high-risk groups soon after it granted regulatory approval to the vaccine in August. It launched its large-scale, final-stage trial in Moscow the following month.The rollout ramped up this month and more than 200,000 Russians have now received the shot.Since the start of the pandemic, Russia has recorded more than 3 million infections and 55,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-to-test-new-covid-19-antibody-drug-from-new-year/story-Uuw47SYtH1LeKdMc58u5GK.html
28-12-2020||World||British hospitals scramble for space as virus cases soar||British hospitals are cancelling non-urgent procedures and scrambling to find space for Covid-19 patients as coronavirus cases continue to surge despite tough new restrictions imposed to curb a fast-spreading new variant of the virus.Dr. Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said Monday that the rising number of hospitalized patients was “extremely worrying.”“With the numbers approaching the peaks from April, systems will again be stretched to the limit,” he said.British authorities are blaming a new variant of the coronavirus for soaring infection rates in London and southeast England. They say the new version is more easily transmitted than the original, but stress there is no evidence it makes people sicker.In response, authorities have put a swath of England that’s home to 24 million people under restrictions that require non-essential shops to close, bar indoor socializing and allow restaurants and pubs only to operate for takeout.Even so, hospital admissions for Covid-19 in southeast England are approaching or exceeding the levels seen at the first peak of the outbreak. Government figures show 21,286 people were hospitalized with the coronavirus across the UK on Dec. 22, the last day for which data is available. That is only slightly below the high of 21,683 Covid-19 patients who were recorded in UK hospitals on April 12.Dr. Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, described her experience working in a hospital on Christmas Day as “wall-to-wall Covid.”“The chances are that we will cope, but we cope at a cost,” Henderson told the BBC. “The cost is not doing what we had hoped, which is being able to keep non-Covid activities going.”Britain has already recorded more than 70,000 deaths among people with the coronavirus, one of the highest tolls in Europe.Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said more parts of England might have to be put into the toughest tier of restrictions if case numbers do not fall. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also have implemented strong lockdown measures.Still, there is rising confidence help could soon be on the way, with expectation mounting that UK regulators may authorize a second coronavirus vaccine this week.British media reports say the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency is likely to give the green light to a vaccine made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.The regulator authorized a jab made by US pharmaceutical company Pfizer and German firm BioNTech on Dec. 2, making Britain the first country to gain access to a rigorously tested vaccine. More than 600,000 people in the UK have received the first of the two shots needed of the vaccine.If the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is authorized this week, members of the public could start receiving it from Jan. 4. Britain has ordered 100 million doses, compared to 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot.The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is considered a potential game-changer in global immunization efforts because it is less expensive than the Pfizer shot and does not need to be stored at freezer temperatures, making it easier to distribute.But it had less clear-cut results from clinical trials than its main rivals. Partial results suggest that the shot is about 70% effective for preventing illness from coronavirus infection, compared to the 95% efficacy reported for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.But the trials produced two different results based on the dosing regimen used. Researchers said the vaccine protected against disease in 62% of those given two full doses and in 90% of those given a half dose followed by a full dose. However, the second group included only 2,741 people — too few to be conclusive.AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot told the Sunday Times newspaper that he was confident the vaccine would work against the new strain and would prove as effective as its rivals.“We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody else,” Soriot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-hospitals-scramble-for-space-as-virus-cases-soar/story-5OGsl4GPmhekofpCvdBuDK.html
28-12-2020||World||EU nations unanimously back post-Brexit trade deal with UK||European Union (EU) nations have unanimously approve the post-Brexit trade deal with the United Kingdom, a prerequisite for the agreement to come into operation on New Year’s Day.Germany, which holds the EU presidency, said the decision came during a meeting of EU ambassadors to assess the Christmas Eve agreement.“Green light,” said Germany’s spokesman Sebastian Fischer. “Ambassadors have unanimously approved the provisional application of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement as of January 1, 2021.”The approval had been expected ever since the deal was announced and all EU leaders warmly welcomed it. It still needs approval from the EU’s legislature, which is expected to come in February. The UK’s House of Commons is expected to approve it on Wednesday.Four days after sealing a free trade agreement with the European Union, the British government warned businesses to get ready for disruptions and “bumpy moments” when the new rules take effect on Thursday night.Businesses were scrambling Monday to digest the details and implications of the 1,240-page deal sealed by the EU and the UK on Christmas Eve.The UK left the EU almost a year ago, but remained within the bloc’s economic embrace during a transition period that ends at midnight Brussels time -- 11 p.m. in London -- on Dec. 31.The agreement, hammered out after nine months of tense negotiations, will ensure Britain and the 27-nation bloc can continue to trade in goods without tariffs or quotas. That should help protect the 660 billion pounds ($894 billion) in annual trade between the two sides, and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on it.But the end to Britain’s membership in the EU’s vast single market and customs union will still bring inconvenience and new expenses for both individuals and businesses — from the need for tourists to have travel insurance to the millions of new customs declarations that firms will have to fill out.“Businesses will need to make sure that they’re ready for new customs procedures and we as individuals will need to make sure that our passports are up to date because they need to have at least six months before expiry on them in order to be able to travel abroad,” said Michael Gove, the British Cabinet minister in charge of Brexit preparations.“I’m sure there will be bumpy moments but we are there in order to try to do everything we can to smooth the path,” he told the BBC.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative government argues that any short-term disruption from Brexit will be worth it, because the UK will now be free to set its own rules and strike new trade deals around the world.Yet an ominous preview of what could happen if UK-EU trade faces heavy restrictions came this month when France briefly closed its border with Britain because of a highly transmissible new variant of the coronavirus sweeping through London and southern England. Thousands of trucks were stuck in traffic jams or parked at a disused airfield near the English Channel port of Dover for days and supermarkets warned that some goods, including fresh produce would soon run short.Even after France relented and agreed to let in truckers who tested negative for the virus, the backlog of 15,000 drivers who now needed tests took days to clear.Both the British and European parliaments still need to vote on the Brexit trade deal. Britain’s Parliament is set to deliver its verdict on Dec. 30, but the EU legislature will not make a decision until after Jan. 1. Ambassadors from the 27 EU nations will meet Monday to determine how they can provisionally approve the deal by the end of the year.David McAllister, an EU lawmaker from Germany, said the European Parliament vote would take place in February. He signalled it was likely to be approved, calling it a “comprehensive, fair agreement” that protected the bloc’s single market.Lawmakers in Britain are also highly likely to approve the deal.Hardline pro-Brexit legislators in Johnson’s Conservative Party are poring over the agreement to see whether it meets their goal of a decisive break from the bloc. The main opposition Labour Party says the deal will hurt Britain’s economy but it will back it anyway because it is better than a chaotic no-deal split on Jan. 1.Despite the deal, uncertainty hangs over huge chunks of the relationship between Britain and the EU. The agreement covers trade in goods, but leaves the UK’s huge financial services sector in limbo, still uncertain how easily it can do business with the bloc after Jan. 1. The British territory of Gibraltar, which sees thousands of workers cross over daily from Spain, is also in limbo since it was not included in the deal.And Brexit deal has angered one of the sectors the government stressed it would protect: fishing. The economically minor but hugely symbolic issue of fishing rights was a sticking point in negotiations, with maritime EU nations seeking to retain access to UK waters, and Britain insisting it must control its seas.Under the deal, the EU will give up a quarter of the quota it catches in UK waters, far less than the 80% that Britain initially demanded. The system will be phased in over 5 1/2 years, after which the quotas will be reassessed.“I am angry, disappointed and betrayed,” said Andrew Locker, chairman of Britain’s National Federation of Fishermen’s Organizations. “Boris Johnson promised us the rights to all the fish that swim in our exclusive economic zone and we have got a fraction of that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-nations-unanimously-back-post-brexit-trade-deal-with-uk/story-75rQljSseQMP06sPwCVohN.html
28-12-2020||World||Pope formally strips Vatican secretariat of state of assets||Pope Francis has formally stripped the Vatican secretariat of state of its financial assets and real estate holdings following its bungled management of hundreds of millions of euros in donations and investments that are now the subject of a corruption investigation.Francis signed a new law over the weekend ordering the secretariat of state to complete the transfer of all its holdings to another Vatican office by Feb. 4. The law also calls for all donations to the pope — the Peter’s Pence collections from the faithful as well as other donations that had been managed by the secretariat of state — to be held and managed by the Vatican’s treasury office as separate funds that are accounted for in the Holy See’s consolidated budget.The changes are a response to a spiraling Vatican criminal investigation into years-long allegations of mismanagement of donations and investments by the Vatican’s secretariat of state which has resulted in losses of tens of millions of euros at a time of financial crisis for the Holy See.Francis had already ordered the transfers in August and followed up in November by appointing a commission to put the changes into effect. The new law makes the changes permanent and sets a firm date for their execution.Francis said he was making the changes to improve the administration, control and vigilance over the Holy See’s assets and ensure a more “transparent and efficient management.”Francis moved against his own secretariat of state amid an 18-month investigation by Vatican prosecutors into the office’s 350-million-euro investment into a luxury residential building in London’s Chelsea neighborhood and other speculative funds.Prosecutors have accused several officials in the department of abusing their authority for their involvement in the deal, as well several Italian middlemen of allegedly fleecing the Vatican of tens of millions of euros in fees.The scandal has exposed the incompetence of the Vatican’s monsignors in managing money, since they signed away voting shares in the deal and agreed to pay exorbitant fees to Italians who were known in business circles for their shady dealings.Francis’ decision has been an embarrassing blow to the secretariat of state’s standing as the most powerful Holy See office, reducing it to essentially any other department that must propose a budget and have it approved and monitored by others.The outcome is essentially what was sought years ago by Cardinal George Pell, Francis’ first economy minister who clashed with the secretariat of state over his financial reforms and efforts to wrest control of the department’s off-the-books funds.Pell had to abandon those reform efforts in 2017 to face trial for sexual abuse in his native Australia, but he was acquitted and recently told The Associated Press he felt vindicated that the wrongdoing he tried to uncover was being exposed.The Holy See is facing a major cash crunch as its main source of revenue, ticket sales from the Vatican Museums, evaporated this year due to coronavirus closures. The Holy See last year narrowed its budget deficit from 75 million euros to 11 million euros.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-formally-strips-vatican-secretariat-of-state-of-assets/story-BIxEHnOKgbJOO5l6qv8HuK.html
28-12-2020||World||WHO launches Covid-19 app to counter pandemic misinformation||The World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a mobile application to provide users with the latest updates on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Called the WHO Covid-19 app, it seeks to provide “trusted info from both the experts at the WHO and regional partners, with regular updates and notifications as scientific findings progress.”WHO had launched a similar app at the beginning of the year to provide real-time updates on the coronavirus disease, which was spreading at a rapid speed around the world. The app works with devices running on iOS 9.0 and up and on Android 4.4 devices. Most phones released from 2011 onwards fall under either two categories. The app was developed by a diverse team of volunteers and WHO staff pooled together from different countries. What does the app do?WHO has said that through this app users can learn about the symptoms of coronavirus disease and how to protect themselves and their community from the virus. Users can also register for real-time notifications from their localities to get regular updates from WHO and its partners. The app also serves an altruistic purpose, it lets users learn about the different ways they can help out during the pandemic. The global health body is said to be working with local stakeholders in making the app more geographically viable. So that when users register with their locations, real-time notifications can be sent to their phones in a timely manner. Where is this app available?The app is currently only available in Nigeria, where it debuted as a limited release feature. WHO is working on making it widely available to all English-speaking countries in the future. Why is this app being released?WHO’s battle against misinformation started right about when the pandemic did. The rampant and unchecked spread of misinformation has hampered WHO’s efforts to fight this pandemic. Hence with the launch of this app the agency wants to make sure that only verified and scientifically accurate information gets out. By involving local stakeholders, WHO hopes to make the app relevant to small communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-launches-covid-19-app-to-counter-pandemic-misinformation/story-hCWecP5rt2gsNZWvVEWj0M.html
28-12-2020||World||How Covid-19 has affected countries around the world||It has now been a year since the origin and spread of the coronavirus pandemic around the world. The deadly virus, which was first detected in China’s Wuhan, has affected almost every country in the world, infecting and killing millions everywhere. At the end of 2020, people have pinned their hopes on vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as they look forward to returning to normalcy.Here is how several countries saw the pandemic ravage :1. United States: America has been the worst-affected country by Covid-19 and its tally will soon touch the grim mark of 20 million cases. The country has been hit by a multitude of waves of the virus. By mid-December five in every 100 Americans have been infected by the virus, as reported by AP.2. India: While the second-worst hit country has been showing a declining trend in reporting active cases of the coronavirus disease, it didn’t have a great start. India responded to the disease by declaring an early abrupt strictest nationwide lockdown of 21 days, followed by a series of lockdowns. India’s attempt to control the spread of the virus came at the cost of its economy, and the tragic migrant labour crisis due to the unplanned nature of the restrictions.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-193. Brazil: This nation with Covid-19 cases of more than 7 million saw the virus being introduced by the national leader as a ‘little flu’, as reported AP. President Jair Bolsonaro scoffed at the virus and instead encouraged the people to flout all Covid-safety protocols while refusing to take the responsibility of the rising toll, according to AP.4. Italy: The eighth-worst affected nation showed the world how dangerous the virus is as the healthcare system of the developed country started collapsing. According to AP, it became the epicentre of Covid-19 in February 2020, lessons from the first wave also didn’t help to cause many more deaths in September despite plans and protocols in place.5. Spain: The ninth-worst hit country saw numerous healthcare workers succumbing to the deadly virus. While public healthcare officials boast about the system even with 929 deaths in a single day, it was the overworked staff that managed to slow down the virus spread, as per AP.6. Germany: This European country enjoyed a relaxed summer due to ease of many restrictions, which was the result of early measures to control the spread. But as relaxations set in, the numbers started to rise, with the country’s chancellor warning people that it would be a difficult winter as the country went back in a lockdown, reported AP.7. Iran: Iran too has been a sceptic about the coronavirus but the situation of the country has been worsening till date with the virus infecting and killing the top officials. The virus has become the greatest threat for the country after turmoil and war that followed its 1979 Islamic Revolution, reported AP.8. South Africa: The virus hit the poor hardest in the country with unemployment rising up to 42%, AP reported. But the secret weapon of the country were the veteran health officials with the experience of longstanding battles with HIV/AIDS and TB, who were looked upon for another crisis, reported AP.Also Read | Lasting immunity against Covid-19 found after mild or asymptomatic infection: Study9. Japan: This country saw the virus hit its shores in February when the luxury cruise ship Diamond Princess became the hotspot with an explosion of infections, reported AP. Japan credits the use of masks and border control measures for the disease mitigation and hopes to host the Olympic games next year.10. China: China, where the virus was first reported, is almost back to normal.

28-12-2020||World||Saudi women’s rights activist sentenced to nearly 6 years||One of Saudi Arabia’s most prominent women’s rights activists was sentenced on Monday to nearly six years in prison under a vague and broadly-worded law aimed at combating terrorism, according to state-linked media.Loujain al-Hathloul’s case, and her imprisonment for the past two and a half years, have drawn criticism from rights groups, members of the US Congress and European Union lawmakers.Al-Hathloul was among a handful of Saudi women who openly called for the right to drive before it was granted in 2018 and for the removal of male guardianship laws that had long stifled women’s freedom of movement and ability to travel abroad.State-linked Saudi news outlet Sabq reported that al-Hathloul was found guilty by the kingdom’s anti-terrorism court on charges including agitating for change, pursuing a foreign agenda, using the internet to harm public order and and cooperating with individuals and entities that have committed crimes according to anti-terror laws. She has 30 days to appeal the verdict.A rights group called “Prisoners of Conscience” that focuses on Saudi political detainees said that al-Hathloul could be released as early as the end of March 2021 based on time served. She has been imprisoned since May 2018 and 34 months of her sentencing will be suspended.The judge ordered her to serve five years and eight months in prison for violating anti-terrorism laws, according to Sabq, which said its reporter was allowed inside the courtroom during Monday’s session.Sabq reported that the judge said the defendant had confessed to committing the crimes and that her confessions were made voluntarily and without coercion. The judge said the verdict was issued in the presence of the prosecutor, the defendant, a representative from the government’s Human Rights Commission and a handful of select local media representatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-women-s-rights-activist-sentenced-to-nearly-6-years/story-LBzsZlk0lCkm1Wr6khEunJ.html
28-12-2020||World||Azerbaijan reports attack on its troops in Nagorno-Karabakh||Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry said Monday its army units have been attacked by “an illegal Armenian armed group” in Nagorno-Karabakh, killing one Azerbaijani serviceman and wounding another.The ministry said the attack took place in the south of Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday afternoon and was thwarted, leaving all six attackers dead.The Nagorno-Karabakh military dismissed the statement as “misinformation” and a “propaganda provocation,” saying that the territory’s army was “strictly observing” the cease-fire. Earlier on Monday the Armenian Defence Ministry also denied media reports of fighting in the south of Nagorno-Karabakh.Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands.Heavy fighting erupted in late September in the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, killing more than 5,600 people on both sides. A Russian-brokered peace deal that saw Azerbaijan reclaim much of the separatist region along with surrounding areas ended six weeks of fierce fighting on November 10.On December 12, Armenia and Azerbaijan reported new clashes in the south of Nagorno-Karabakh, accusing each other of breaching the cease-fire. Russian peacekeepers deployed to monitor the peace deal also reported a violation at the time, but didn’t assign blame.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/azerbaijan-reports-attack-on-its-troops-in-nagorno-karabakh/story-NiHMyiDUhfDD3ehU9H544J.html

Two other crew members have been rescued.According to a statement by the Russian Investigative Committee, the vessel with 19 crew members on board capsized and sank on Monday morning. A criminal probe into the incident has been launched and a search operation is underway.Several vessels and an aircraft have been deployed to look for the missing crew members, Russian news agencies reported.Russia’s Emergency Ministry initially suggested that an accumulation of the ice on the trawler could have caused it to sink, but later said the vessel was more likely to have heeled over while pulling up the fishing nets, “scooped up water and sank.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-fishing-trawler-sinks-in-barents-sea-17-missing/story-pQ3qhEgXvBHsMbAXRfC6fK.html
28-12-2020||World||UK warns of ‘bumpy’ post-Brexit transition despite deal||First came the Brexit trade deal. Now comes the red tape and the institutional nitty gritty.Four days after sealing a free trade agreement with the European Union, the British government warned businesses to get ready for disruptions and “bumpy moments” when the new rules take effect on Thursday night.Businesses were scrambling Monday to digest the details and implications of the 1,240-page deal sealed by the EU and the UK on Christmas Eve.EU ambassadors, meanwhile, gave their unanimous approval Monday to the Brexit trade deal with the U.K. Germany, which holds the EU presidency, said the decision came during a meeting to assess the Christmas Eve agreement.“Green light,” said Germany’s spokesman Sebastian Fischer.The approval had been expected ever since all EU leaders warmly welcomed it. It still needs approval from the EU’s legislature, which is expected to come in February. The UK’s House of Commons is expected to approve it on Wednesday.The UK left the EU almost a year ago, but remained within the bloc’s economic embrace during a transition period that ends at midnight Brussels time -- 11 p.m. in London -- on Dec. 31.The agreement, hammered out after nine months of tense negotiations, will ensure Britain and the 27-nation bloc can continue to trade in goods without tariffs or quotas. That should help protect the 660 billion pounds ($894 billion) in annual trade between the two sides, and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on it.But the end to Britain’s membership in the EU’s vast single market and customs union will still bring inconvenience and new expenses for both individuals and businesses — from the need for tourists to have travel insurance to the millions of new customs declarations that firms will have to fill out.“Businesses will need to make sure that they’re ready for new customs procedures and we as individuals will need to make sure that our passports are up to date because they need to have at least six months before expiry on them in order to be able to travel abroad,” said Michael Gove, the British Cabinet minister in charge of Brexit preparations.“I’m sure there will be bumpy moments but we are there in order to try to do everything we can to smooth the path,” he told the BBC.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative government argues that any short-term disruption from Brexit will be worth it, because the UK will now be free to set its own rules and strike new trade deals around the world.Yet an ominous preview of what could happen if UK-EU trade faces heavy restrictions came this month when France briefly closed its border with Britain because of a highly transmissible new variant of the coronavirus sweeping through London and southern England. Thousands of trucks were stuck in traffic jams or parked at a disused airfield near the English Channel port of Dover for days and supermarkets warned that some goods, including fresh produce would soon run short.Even after France relented and agreed to let in truckers who tested negative for the virus, the backlog of 15,000 drivers who now needed tests took days to clear.Hardline pro-Brexit legislators in Johnson’s Conservative Party are poring over the agreement to see whether it meets their goal of a decisive break from the bloc. The main opposition Labour Party says the deal will hurt Britain’s economy but it will back it anyway because it is better than a chaotic no-deal split on Jan. 1.Despite the deal, uncertainty hangs over huge chunks of the relationship between Britain and the EU. The agreement covers trade in goods, but leaves the UK’s huge financial services sector in limbo, still uncertain how easily it can do business with the bloc after Jan. 1. The British territory of Gibraltar, which sees thousands of workers cross over daily from Spain, is also in limbo since it was not included in the deal.And Brexit deal has angered one of the sectors the government stressed it would protect: fishing. The economically minor but hugely symbolic issue of fishing rights was a sticking point in negotiations, with maritime EU nations seeking to retain access to UK waters, and Britain insisting it must control its seas.Under the deal, the EU will give up a quarter of the quota it catches in UK waters, far less than the 80% that Britain initially demanded. The system will be phased in over 5 1/2 years, after which the quotas will be reassessed.“I am angry, disappointed and betrayed,” said Andrew Locker, chairman of Britain’s National Federation of Fishermen’s Organizations. “Boris Johnson promised us the rights to all the fish that swim in our exclusive economic zone and we have got a fraction of that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-warns-of-bumpy-post-brexit-transition-despite-deal/story-HNEV1O60QdksLY2ufG9sLM.html
28-12-2020||World||US fliers less familiar with Boeing 737 MAX crashes two years on, but wary when reminded: Poll||With the passage of time, Americans are less familiar with two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes, but if they are made aware of those disasters, more than half say they would probably avoid the aircraft, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. The poll results, released on Dec. 28, a day before the 737 MAX resumes commercial flights in the United States, found that 39% of adults were familiar with the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes in October 2018 and March 2019 versus about half in a previous poll.Of those respondents, 73% correctly identified Boeing as the maker of the aircraft involved in the crashes, down from 82% who said the same in the poll that ran in May 2019.However, when respondents were told about the aircraft’s safety issues 57% said they were not likely to fly in a Boeing 737 MAX, while 37% say they would be likely to fly in it once it has been in the air for six months or more. “We continue to work closely with global regulators and our customers to support the safe return of the fleet to service around the world,” a Boeing spokesman said in response to the poll. The US Federal Aviation Administration lifted a 20-month safety ban on Nov. 18 after approving design changes by Boeing to address systems that played a role in both crashes, which killed a total of 346 people. All airlines must complete the mandated safety changes and new pilot training before taking passengers.American Airlines is set to relaunch passenger flights on Tuesday between Miami and New York and plans to gradually reintroduce its 737 MAX fleet.The airline said it would re-book customers who do not feel comfortable about the aircraft.“No one has to go on the MAX if they don’t want to, but if you want to, it’s there,” American’s Chief Operating Officer David Seymour said at a 737 MAX media event on Dec. 2.Pandemic TravelBoeing’s 737 MAX is making its comeback at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has thrust the industry into its worst crisis, with airlines parking hundreds of jets as demand hovers around 30% of levels in 2019.When the 737 MAX was grounded, U.S. airlines had to cancel flights because they lacked the aircraft to meet demand, adding to Boeing’s financial liability.Now airlines are deferring jet deliveries and do not expect a robust rebound until Covid-19 vaccines are widely available.The poll suggests that airline travel will recover pre-pandemic rates once the health crisis subsides and that travelers still consider ticket prices the most important factor when choosing a flight, followed by airlines’ measures to protect them from the spread of the coronavirus. When buying a plane ticket, 41% said ticket price was most important and 24% said Covid-19 safety measures such as whether airlines are blocking middle seats.Only 3% said the aircraft model was most important.When asked how they planned to travel “when the coronavirus pandemic ends,” 10% said they would travel for personal reasons at least once a month by plane and 34% said they would travel at least once a year, similar to their reported travel habits before the pandemic.The poll showed similar trends for work travel, a driver of airline revenues - 7% said they would fly at least once a month, while 17% said they expected to travel at least a few times per year. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points. Of the other U.S. carriers that owned the 737 MAX before its grounding, United Airlines plans to fly the jet again in February and Southwest Airlines - the world’s largest 737 MAX operator - in the second quarter of 2021.Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, Brazil’s largest airline, became the first carrier to restart 737 MAX flights this month, followed by Grupo Aeromexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fliers-less-familiar-with-boeing-737-max-crashes-two-years-on-but-wary-when-reminded-poll/story-D1b0KxI3YUmMIMEMnphy1O.html
28-12-2020||World||China sentences lawyer who reported on outbreak to 4 years||A Chinese court on Monday sentenced a former lawyer who reported on the early stage of the coronavirus outbreak to four years in prison on charges of “picking fights and provoking trouble,” one of her lawyers said.The Pudong New Area People’s Court in the financial hub of Shanghai gave the sentence to Zhang Zhan following accusations she spread false information, gave interviews to foreign media, disrupted public order and “maliciously manipulated” the outbreak.Lawyer Zhang Keke confirmed the sentence but said it was “inconvenient” to provide details — usually an indication that the court has issued a partial gag order. He said the court did not ask Zhang whether she would appeal, nor did she indicate whether she would.Zhang, 37, traveled to Wuhan in February and posted on various social media platforms about the outbreak that is believed to have emerged in the central Chinese city late last year.She was arrested in May amid tough nationwide measures aimed at curbing the outbreak and heavy censorship to deflect criticism of the government’s initial response. Zhang reportedly went on a prolonged hunger strike while in detention, prompting authorities to forcibly feed her, and is said to be in poor health.China has been accused of covering up the initial outbreak and delaying the release of crucial information, allowing the virus to spread and contributing to the pandemic that has sickened more than 80 million people worldwide and killed almost 1.8 million. Beijing vigorously denies the accusations, saying it took swift action that bought time for the rest of the world to prepare.China’s ruling Communist Party tightly controls the media and seeks to block dissemination of information it hasn’t approved for release. In the early days of the outbreak, authorities reprimanded several Wuhan doctors for “rumor-mongering” after they alerted friends on social media. The best known of the doctors, Li Wenliang, later succumbed to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sentences-lawyer-who-reported-on-outbreak-to-4-years/story-ZslGQ65DveaTWqdLS9MuaP.html
28-12-2020||World||Each year 1,000 Pakistani girls forcibly converted to Islam||Neha loved the hymns that filled her church with music. But she lost the chance to sing them last year when, at the age of 14, she was forcibly converted from Christianity to Islam and married to a 45-year-old man with children twice her age.She tells her story in a voice so low it occasionally fades away. She all but disappears as she wraps a blue scarf tightly around her face and head. Neha’s husband is in jail now facing charges of rape for the underage marriage, but she is in hiding, afraid after security guards confiscated a pistol from his brother in court.“He brought the gun to shoot me,” said Neha, whose last name The Associated Press is not using for her safety.Neha is one of nearly 1,000 girls from religious minorities who are forced to convert to Islam in Pakistan each year, largely to pave the way for marriages that are under the legal age and non-consensual. Human rights activists say the practice has accelerated during lockdowns against the coronavirus, when girls are out of school and more visible, bride traffickers are more active on the Internet and families are more in debt.The US State Department this month declared Pakistan “a country of particular concern” for violations of religious freedoms — a designation the Pakistani government rejects. The declaration was based in part on an appraisal by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom that underage girls in the minority Hindu, Christian, and Sikh communities were “kidnapped for forced conversion to Islam… forcibly married and subjected to rape.”While most of the converted girls are impoverished Hindus from southern Sindh province, two new cases involving Christians, including Neha’s, have roiled the country in recent months.The girls generally are kidnapped by complicit acquaintances and relatives or men looking for brides. Sometimes they are taken by powerful landlords as payment for outstanding debts by their farmhand parents, and police often look the other way. Once converted, the girls are quickly married off, often to older men or to their abductors, according to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.Forced conversions thrive unchecked on a money-making web that involves Islamic clerics who solemnize the marriages, magistrates who legalize the unions and corrupt local police who aid the culprits by refusing to investigate or sabotaging investigations, say child protection activists.One activist, Jibran Nasir, called the network a “mafia” that preys on non-Muslim girls because they are the most vulnerable and the easiest targets “for older men with pedophilia urges.”The goal is to secure virginal brides rather than to seek new converts to Islam. Minorities make up just 3.6 percent of Pakistan’s 220 million people and often are the target of discrimination. Those who report forced conversions, for example, can be targeted with charges of blasphemy.In the feudal Kashmore region of southern Sindh province, 13-year-old Sonia Kumari was kidnapped, and a day later police told her parents she had converted from Hinduism to Islam. Her mother pleaded for her return in a video widely viewed on the internet: “For the sake of God, the Quran, whatever you believe, please return my daughter, she was forcibly taken from our home.”But a Hindu activist, who didn’t want to be identified for fear of repercussions from powerful landlords, said she received a letter that the family was forced to write. The letter claimed the 13-year-old had willingly converted and wed a 36-year-old who was already married with two children.The parents have given up.Arzoo Raja was 13 when she disappeared from her home in central Karachi. The Christian girl’s parents reported her missing and pleaded with police to find her. Two days later, officers reported back that she had been converted to Islam and was married to their 40-year-old Muslim neighbor.In Sindh province, the age of consent for marriage is 18 years old. Arzoo’s marriage certificate said she was 19.The cleric who performed Arzoo’s marriage, Qasi Ahmed Mufti Jaan Raheemi, was later implicated in at least three other underage marriages. Despite facing an outstanding arrest warrant for solemnizing Arzoo’s marriage, he continued his practice in his ramshackle office above a wholesale rice market in downtown Karachi.When an Associated Press reporter arrived at his office, Raheemi fled down a side stair, according to a fellow cleric, Mullah Kaifat Ullah, one of a half-dozen clerics who also performs marriages in the complex. He said another cleric is already in jail for marrying children.While Ullah said he only marries girls 18 and above, he argued that “under Islamic law a girl’s wedding at the age of 14 or 15 is fine.”Arzoo’s mother, Rita Raja, said police ignored the family’s appeals until one day she was videotaped outside the court sobbing and pleading for her daughter to be returned. The video went viral, creating a social media storm in Pakistan and prompting the authorities to step in.“For 10 days, the parents were languishing between the police station and government authorities and different political parties,” Nasir, the activist, said. “They were not being given any time… until it went viral. That is the real unfortunate thing over here.”Authorities have stepped in and arrested Arzoo’s husband, but her mother said her daughter still refuses to come home. Raja said she is afraid of her husband’s family.The girl who loved hymns, Neha, said she was tricked into the marriage by a favorite aunt, who told Neha to accompany her to the hospital to see her sick son. Her aunt, Sandas Baloch, had converted to Islam years before and lived with her husband in the same apartment building as Neha’s family.“All Mama asked when we left was ’when will you be back?’” remembered Neha.Instead of going to the hospital, she was taken to the home of her aunt’s in-laws and told she would marry her aunt’s 45-year-old brother-in-law.“I told her I can’t, I am too young and I don’t want to. He is old,” Neha said. “She slapped me and locked me up in a room.”Neha told of being taken before two men, one who was to be her husband and the other who recorded her marriage. They said she was 19. She said she was too frightened to speak because her aunt threatened to harm her two-year-old brother if she refused to marry.She learned of her conversion only when she was told to sign the marriage certificate with her new name — Fatima.For a week she was locked in one room. Her new husband came to her on the first night. Tears stained her blue scarf as she remembered it:“I screamed and cried all night. I have images in my mind I can’t scratch out,” said Neha. “I hate him.”His elder daughter brought her food each day, and Neha begged for help to escape. Although the woman was frightened of her father, she relented a week after the marriage, bringing the underage bride a burqa — the all-covering garment worn by some Muslim women — and 500 rupees (about $3). Neha fled.But when she arrived home, Neha found her family had turned against her.“I went home and I cried to my Mama about my aunt, what she said and the threats. But she didn’t want me anymore,” said Neha.Her parents feared what her new husband might do to them, Neha said. Further, the prospects of marriage for a girl in conservative Pakistan who has been raped or married before are slim, and human rights activists say they often are seen as a burden.Neha’s family, including her aunt, all refused to talk to the AP. Her husband’s lawyer, Mohammad Saleem, insisted that she married and converted voluntarily.Neha found protection at a Christian church in Karachi, living on the compound with the pastor’s family, who say the girl still wakes screaming in the night. She hopes to go back to school one day but is still distraught.“At the beginning my nightmares were every night, but now it is just sometimes when I remember and inside I am shaking,” she said. “Before I wanted to be a lawyer, but now I don’t know what I will do. Even my mama doesn’t want me now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/each-year-1-000-pakistani-girls-forcibly-converted-to-islam/story-9UOtssyEHJEGvnh7mxVjAM.html

28-12-2020||World||South Africa may ban alcohol as virus cases breach 1 million||South Africa may reinstate a ban on liquor sales as part of efforts to control a surge in Covid-19 infections, which have now surpassed 1 million, according to a person familiar with the discussions.The country had three record-breaking days of infections through Dec. 25, when it registered 14,796 new cases. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize a day earlier called for stricter measures to curb the spread, which has already battered the economy. South Africa recorded a cumulative 1,004,413 confirmed cases and 26,735 deaths on Sunday.Some countries, including the UK, have imposed travel restrictions on flights coming from Africa’s most industrialized economy after a new, more aggressive strain of the virus was identified in the eastern part of the country. The mutation, known as 501.V2, has increasingly dominated samples from the past two months and is rapidly spreading.Restrictions on alcohol sales have been implemented to various degrees since one of the world’s most stringent lockdowns was imposed in March, in part to lower hospital admissions from vehicle accidents and alcohol-related violence. Still, the government lost tax revenue as a result of the initial ban on any sales and liquor traders and bars fired workers.The ban could start on Tuesday and last through Jan. 10, said the person, who requested anonymity because the information is not public and a final decision hasn’t been made.“Government continuously monitors all dimensions of the Covid-19 pandemic and as and when decisions are taken they are communicated publicly,” Tyrone Seale, acting spokesman for President Cyril Ramaphosa, said by text message in a response to questions.The government’s National Coronavirus Command Council is expected to discuss a potential ban on alcohol, said Lucky Ntimane, convener of the Liquor Traders Formations, which represents liquor outlets.“We do not think that a total ban on alcohol sales will be a solution either in the short or long term,” the industry group said in a statement.The coalition of liquor traders proposed curfew measures and alcohol restrictions, if any, that still allow off-premises sales to allow for home consumption. A complete shutdown of liquor sales would mean “an end to the tavern market and the 250,000 direct jobs linked to the sector,” it said.Liquor companies that operate in South Africa include Anheuser-Busch InBev SA, Diageo Plc and Distell Group Holdings Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-may-ban-alcohol-as-virus-cases-breach-1-million/story-71JU5a3qPTYTfB28Jf1f8N.html

He called Trump “angry” and “crazy.”The Iran backed Hezbollah is a sworn enemy of Israel, with which it has had a series of confrontations, including a full-scale war in 2006.Nasrallah repeated vows that Iran and its allies will avenge the US killing of the commander of the elite Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Qassim Soleimani, in a drone attack a year ago in Iraq.“That revenge is coming no matter how long it takes,” he told Al-Mayadeen TV, sitting with a picture of Soleimani to his left.Nasrallah also vowed to avenge Israel’s killing of a Hezbollah fighter in Syria earlier this year.Addressing the incoming US administration of President Joe Biden, Nasrallah said Iran would not negotiate with the US on behalf of its allies or discuss conflicts in the region. He said Tehran would talk with Washington only about the Iranian nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hezbollah-says-it-has-doubled-its-arsenal-of-guided-missiles/story-bFRiWQtB4J5gfN6PTvDaTP.html

AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Pascal Soriot and UK health officials had previously said they hoped for approval by the end of the year.The go-ahead would come about three weeks after the UK became the first western country to begin vaccinations, using a shot from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE that’s been administered to more than 600,000 Britons. Still, virus cases have surged in Britain amid concern about a new strain of the coronavirus that officials have said is more contagious.That prompted the government to reverse plans to ease restrictions over Christmas and tighten lockdowns across large parts of the country. Those measures could be eased at the end of February as the imminent approval of the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot permits the vaccination of as many as 15 million of the country’s most vulnerable people, the Mail on Sunday reported. The country’s health service would no longer be at risk of being overwhelmed by virus cases once that threshold is met, the newspaper said.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will need time to carry out a review of the vaccine data, the Department of Health and Social Care said by email. Representatives for the MHRA and AstraZeneca declined to comment.The AstraZeneca vaccine could facilitate a rapid ramp-up of vaccinations because it’s easier to transport and store than the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, requiring only refrigerator temperatures rather than deep freezing. It’s also less expensive to produce, so many developing countries -- along with the US and the European Union (EU) -- have also signed deals for doses. The vaccine could be rolled out across Britain from Jan. 4, the Sunday Telegraph reported.Trial questionsUK approval would provide vindication for the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot, which has been slowed by questions about discrepancies in the trial results. Overall, these studies showed that the vaccine was less effective than shots from Pfizer and another developer, Moderna Inc. But a subset of the trial that showed better results resulted from a dosing mistake.The UK has more riding on the domestically developed shot than the US and some other countries because it won’t be able to get any of the Moderna vaccine until well into next year.Soriot told the Sunday Times that new data will show the AstraZeneca vaccine is comparable to the 95% effectiveness rate reported by the rival developers.“We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody else,” he told the newspaper. “I can’t tell you more because we will publish at some point.”Soriot had previously said the vaccine was on track for large-scale vaccinations by the end of the year. England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, had said he expected the MHRA to act by early next year or perhaps sooner.Vaccination sitesThe final cut of data was submitted to regulators last Monday and the National Health Service has enlisted more than 10,000 medics and volunteers to administer the shot, the Telegraph reported. Mass vaccination centres at sports stadiums and conference venues are expected to begin in the second week of January, according to the paper.Government officials will hold a meeting on the pandemic Monday after scientists warned that school closures may be necessary to slow the spread of the new Covid-19 variant, the newspaper said.The country has been one of the hardest hit in Europe with more than 70,000 deaths, the most in the region after Italy. Much of the UK has been moved into the harshest Tier 4 restrictions, which prohibit household mixing and forced the closing of pubs, restaurants, and many businesses, after the discovery earlier this month of the more contagious strain.The rate at which the virus is increasing, known as the R number, is estimated at 1.1 to 1.3 as of December 24, according to the latest government data. A reading above 1.0 indicates the spread of the virus is accelerating. The UK reported 34,693 more cases and 210 deaths on December 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-poised-to-clear-astrazeneca-covid-19-shot-as-need-for-vaccines-grow/story-ndo1ylKJQwFZqqQ2PWYdNL.html
28-12-2020||World||Donald Trump defies Chinese warning, signs off on law on next Dalai Lama||US President Donald Trump has signed off on the legislation that reaffirms the right of Tibetans to choose a successor to the Dalai Lama, a move described by the Tibetan government-in-exile as a “powerful message of hope and justice” to Tibetans living in Tibet.The United States Congress had passed the Tibet Policy and Support Act last week, provoking howls of protest from the Chinese foreign ministry that calls the legislation as an attempt to meddle in China’s affairs.“We urge the U.S. side to stop meddling in China’s internal affairs and refrain from signing into law these negative clauses and acts, lest it further harms our further cooperation and bilateral relations,” Foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said last week after the legislation was approved by the US Congress.As news of the new law emerged on Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing had firmly rejected the US legislation and “Tibet-related issues are domestic affairs”.The legislation, which calls for the establishment of a US consulate in Tibet’s main city of Lhasa, also asserts the absolute right of Tibetans to choose a successor to the 14th Dalai Lama and the preservation of Tibet’s environment.The US law that aims to build an international coalition to ensure that China does not interfere with the selection of the next Dalai comes against the backdrop of Beijing appointing its own Panchen Lama after arresting a boy Gedhun Choekyi Nyima in May 1995 who was identified by the Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the second-most senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism’s largest school. Human rights groups had called the Panchen Lama as the world’s youngest political prisoner. He was just six when he disappeared.President Xi Jinping’s China, which regards the exiled Dalai Lama as a dangerous “splittist”, or separatist, claims that Beijing’s approval is a must for choosing the successor to Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.Tibetans have rejected this claim.“This legislation sends a powerful message of hope and justice to the Tibetans inside Tibet and bolsters US support for the protection of Tibetan people’s religious freedom, human rights, environmental rights and exile Tibetan democracy like never before,” said Lobsang Sangay, president of Central Tibetan Administration in Himachal Pradesh’s Dharamshala said in a statement.China’s deep interest in projecting its successor to the Dalai Lama and other spiritual leaders is driven by its objective to divide the world of Tibetan Buddhism, where religious leaders of all the four major schools have sought refuge sometime or other in India. The American legislation, in coordination with other countries, will try to build pressure on China to wait for the 14th Dalai Lama, who turned 85 this April, to identify his reincarnation, rather than come up with its nominee to split Tibetans.India had settled the Dalai Lama in April 1959 and the thousands of Tibetans who followed him in the Himalayan town of Dharamshala where he has been living in exile after escaping from Tibet when it was invaded by the Chinese. There are over 80,000 Tibetans living in exile in India; 150,000 more around the world particularly in the US and Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-donald-trump-to-china-s-xi-a-pinprick-over-us-law-on-next-dalai-lama/story-DrUVbLJgy6mpb8VPgOOwsM.html

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the bill would cost USD51 million over five years.In 2009, late Congressman John Lewis led a congressional delegation visit to India to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Dr King’s pilgrimage to India.Inspired by his visit, Congressman Lewis created the Gandhi-King Exchange Act to seek to apply the philosophies of Gandhi and Dr King Jr to conflict resolution efforts and current policy challenges.The Act, among other things authorises the State Department, in cooperation with the Indian government, to establish an annual educational forum for scholars from both countries that focuses on the legacies of Gandhi and Dr King Jr.It also authorises to develop a professional development training initiative on conflict resolution based on the principles of nonviolence; and establish a foundation to address social, environmental, and health priorities in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-signs-into-law-gandhi-king-scholarly-exchange-initiative/story-NAu0i1mxOrpok5F7erQcTL.html
28-12-2020||World||Authorities identify Nashville bomber, motive remains unknown||With federal officials having identified the man believed to be behind Nashville’s Christmas Day bombing, authorities now turn to the monumental task of piecing together the motive behind the explosion that severely damaged dozens of downtown buildings and injured three people.While officials on Sunday named Anthony Quinn Warner, 63, as the man behind the mysterious explosion in which he was killed, the motive has remained elusive.“These answers won’t come quickly and will still require a lot of our team’s efforts,” FBI Special Agent Doug Korneski said at a Sunday news conference. “Though we may be able to answer some these questions as our investigation continues, none of those answers will be enough by those affected by this event.”In just a few days, hundreds of tips and leads have been submitted to law enforcement agencies. Yet thus far, officials have not provided information on what possibly drove Warner to set off the explosion.David Rausch, the director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, told reporters on Sunday that Warner had not been on the radar before Christmas.Furthermore, officials have not provided insight into why Warner selected the particular location for the bombing, which damaged an AT&T building and continued to wreak havoc on cellphone service and police and hospital communications in several Southern states as the company worked to restore service.Forensic analysts were reviewing evidence collected from the blast site to try to identify the components of the explosives as well as information from the US Bomb Data Centre for intelligence and investigative leads, according to a law enforcement official who said investigators were examining Warner’s digital footprint and financial history, as well as a recent deed transfer of a suburban Nashville home they searched.The official, who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, said federal agents were examining a number of potential leads and pursuing several theories, including the possibility that the AT&T building was targeted.Korneski said Sunday that officials were looking at any and all motives and were interviewing acquaintances of Warner’s to try to determine what may have motivated him.The bombing took place on a holiday morning well before downtown streets were bustling with activity and was accompanied by a recorded announcement warning anyone nearby that a bomb would soon detonate. Then, for reasons that may never be known, the audio switched to a recording of Petula Clark’s 1964 hit “Downtown” shortly before the blast.Warner, who public records show had experience with electronics and alarms and who had also worked as a computer consultant for a Nashville realtor, had been regarded as a person of interest in the bombing since at least Saturday, when federal and local investigators converged on the home linked to him.Federal agents could be seen looking around the property, searching the home and the backyard. A Google Maps image captured in May 2019 had shown a recreational vehicle similar to the one that exploded parked in the backyard, but it was not at the property on Saturday, according to an Associated Press reporter at the scene.On Sunday morning, police formally named Warner as being under investigation.Officials said their identification of Warner relied on several key pieces of evidence, including DNA found at the explosion site. Investigators had previously revealed that human remains had been found in the vicinity.In addition, investigators from the Tennessee Highway Patrol recovered parts from the RV among the wreckage from the blast, and were able to link the vehicle identification number to an RV that was registered to Warner, officials said.“We’re still following leads, but right now there is no indication that any other persons were involved,” Korneski said. “We’ve reviewed hours of security video surrounding the recreation vehicle. We saw no other people involved.”Police were responding to a report of shots fired Friday when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Suddenly the warning stopped, and “Downtown” started playing.The RV exploded shortly afterward, sending black smoke and flames billowing from the heart of downtown Nashville’s tourist scene, an area packed with honky-tonks, restaurants and shops.Buildings shook and windows shattered streets away from the explosion near a building owned by AT&T that lies one block from the company’s office tower, a landmark in downtown.But on Sunday, just blocks from where the bombing took place, tourists had already begun to fill the sidewalks on Lower Broadway, a central entertainment district. Some took selfies while others tried to get as close as possible to the explosion site, blocked by police barricades.Earlier Sunday, the officers who responded provided harrowing details, at times getting choked up reliving the moments that led up to the blast.“This is going to tie us together forever, for the rest of my life,” Metro Nashville police Officer James Wells, who suffered some hearing loss due to the explosion, told reporters at a news conference. “Christmas will never be the same.”Officer Brenna Hosey said she and her colleagues knocked on six or seven doors in nearby apartments to warn people to evacuate. She particularly remembered a startled mother of four children.“I don’t have kids but I have cousins and nieces, people who I love who are small,” Hosey said, adding she had to plead with the family to leave the building as quickly as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/authorities-identify-nashville-bomber-motive-remains-unknown/story-FAKzdUPSOQZHCb95Bmox3K.html

But that idea has now been axed over fears the celebrations could turn into a super-spreader event.“We’ve abandoned our plans in terms of any foreshore viewing of the fireworks from the Sydney CBD, so that won’t be allowed,” the state leader of New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, Gladys Berejiklian, said.Permits will also be required to enter some parts of the city as celebrations will be limited to controlled, socially-distanced events and small gatherings at people’s homes.“We do recommend very strongly that people watch the fireworks on TV or go to a local venue outdoors which is not on the foreshore and doesn’t have that cramped crowding,” Berejiklian said.The decision to tighten restrictions comes as a cluster of cases on the city’s northern beaches grew to 126 and a lockdown for several suburbs was extended until January 9.Before the cluster, which emerged earlier this month, life had been returning to relative normality around the country as the number of daily virus cases slowed to a trickle.Australia has recorded over 28,300 cases and 909 deaths linked to the virus in a population of about 25 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-bans-new-year-crowds-as-coronavirus-cluster-grows-in-australia/story-GZTPing0LH2SXqBYjmJEiM.html

Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), that has infected over 80 million people worldwide and killed 1.76 million, has changed the way of life across nations.Along with masks and social distancing, another new normal that is likely to emerge is the vaccine passport application, according to a CNN report. As the name suggests, the mobile app, with proof that the user has been tested negative for coronavirus, will be their passport to concert venues, stadiums, movie theaters, offices, or even countries. The World Health Organization (WHO), however, has said that these passports may not be helpful in reducing transmission as there was always a possibility of second infection.  Here is all you need to know about vaccine passports:- Individuals will be expected to upload details of their Covid-19 tests and vaccinations on the applications being developed by some companies and technology groups, and produce these digital credentials on being asked.- An example of this is the CommonPass app, created by the Common Trust Network, which allows users to upload medical data such as a Covid-19 test result or proof of vaccination. A pass is generated in the form of a QR code which can be presented to authorities. Common Trust Network is an initiative by The Commons Project and the World Economic Forum. These organisations have partnered with airlines such as Cathay Pacific, JetBlue, Lufthansa, Swiss Airlines, United Airlines and Virgin Atlantic for the same.- IBM has also developed an app called Digital Health Pass. This app allows companies to scan for their requirements of entry, such as coronavirus tests and temperature checks.- The WHO reacted to some countries’ suggestion that vaccine passports be used to allow individuals entry to their workplaces or other countries and said that there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.- “At this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an “immunity passport” or “risk-free certificate,” the WHO said, adding that the use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-may-need-vaccine-passport-for-travel-next-year-all-you-need-to-know-about-it/story-STrkJrxlEfu0FhCZFqPDGI.html

She thinks she will die in prison,” Ren said before the trial.“It’s an extreme method of protesting against this society and this environment.”China’s communist authorities have a history of putting dissidents on trial in opaque courts between Christmas and New Year to minimise Western scrutiny.The trial comes just weeks before an international team of World Health Organization experts is expected to arrive in China to investigate the origins of Covid-19.Another lawyer said Zhang’s health was in decline and she suffered from headaches, dizziness and stomach pain.“Restrained 24 hours a day, she needs assistance going to the bathroom,” Zhang Keke, who visited her on Christmas Day, wrote in a note circulated on social media.“She feels psychologically exhausted, like every day is a torment.”Zhang was critical of the early response in Wuhan, writing in a February essay that the government “didn’t give people enough information, then simply locked down the city”.“This is a great violation of human rights,” she wrote.The court said she had spread “false remarks” online, according to Zhang Keke.Rights groups have also drawn attention to her case.Authorities “want to use her case as an example to scare off other dissidents from raising questions about the pandemic situation in Wuhan earlier this year”, said Leo Lan, research and advocacy consultant at the Chinese Human Rights Defenders NGO.Zhang is the first to face trial of a group of four citizen journalists detained by authorities earlier this year after reporting from Wuhan.Previous attempts by AFP to contact the other three -- Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua -- were unsuccessful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-jails-citizen-journalist-for-four-years-over-wuhan-virus-reports-lawyer-says/story-5CssaWvSKz7LDlV7oYa2aO.html

And come January, there will be no time to waste. That’s why my team and I are hard at work preparing to take action on day one,” Biden tweeted.Hours after Biden’s tweet, President Trump officially signed the trillion dollar coronavirus relief and government spending bill, The Hill reported.On Saturday, Biden had accused Donald Trump of “abdicating responsibility” and had pressed the outgoing President to immediately sign the Covid-19 relief bill that was pending.“It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don’t know if they’ll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump’s refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority,” Biden said in a statement.Members of both parties had urged Trump to sign the USD 2.3 trillion packages, The Hill reported. Earlier, the bill was passed with bipartisan support in US Congress.Earlier today, top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said the United States is headed for the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic in the upcoming weeks as Americans will see the effects of the holiday season.“The reason I’m concerned and my colleagues in public health are concerned also is that we very well might see a post-seasonal, in the sense of Christmas, New Year’s, surge,” CNN quoted Fauci as saying. “We are really at a very critical point.... So I share the concern of President-elect Biden that as we get into the next few weeks, it might actually get worse,” Fauci added.President-elect Biden last week had said that “darkest days” against coronavirus “are ahead of us, not behind us.”The Covid-19 case total in the United States surpassed 19 million-mark on Sunday (local time), according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University, which tracks and compiles data from various sources including local authorities and media outlets.As of 6:35 IST on Monday, Johns Hopkins University had registered 19,107,675 positive tests for the coronavirus disease in the United States.

28-12-2020||World||Sydney told to watch its famous New Year’s Eve fireworks from home||Sydney, one of the world’s first major cities to welcome each New Year with a public countdown featuring a fireworks display over its well-known Opera House, has banned large gatherings that night amid an outbreak of the coronavirus.A mid-December resurgence of COVID-19 in the city’s northern beach suburbs has grown to 125 cases after five new infections were recorded on Monday. About a quarter of million of people there must stay in strict lockdown until Jan. 9That has led to further restrictions of the already toned-down plans for the New Year’s Eve. New South Wales (NSW) Premier Gladys Berejiklian banned most people from coming to Sydney’s downtown that night and limited outdoor gatherings to 50 people.“We don’t want to create any super-spreading events on New Year’s Eve, which then ruins it for everybody across the state moving forward,” Berejiklian said at a news conference, adding that watching the fireworks from home was the ‘safest’ way to do so.“On New Year’s Eve we don’t want any crowds on the foreshore around Sydney whatsoever,” she said.Only residents with permits for hospitality venues downtown will be allowed there on New Year’s Eve. Households across Sydney are only allowed to host 10 people until further notice.NSW Police have issued 15 notices for breaking public health orders since Christmas Eve in Sydney, including to 11 people at a house party at North Bondi on Saturday.“When most of New South Wales, indeed most of Australia, is doing the right thing, I would say to those people half contemplating doing anything stupid in the next few days, forget it,” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said.Australia as a whole, has avoided the worst of the pandemic due to swift border closures, lockdowns, widespread testing and social distancing. It has recorded just over 28,300 infections, the overwhelming majority in Victoria state, and 908 deaths. (Reporting by Lidia Kelly.

28-12-2020||World||2020 weather disasters ‘boosted’ by climate change, says report||The ten costliest weather disasters worldwide this year saw insured damages worth $150 billion, topping the figure for 2019 and reflecting a long-term impact of global warming, according to a report Monday.The same disasters claimed at least 3,500 lives and displaced more than 13.5 million people. From Australia’s out-of-control wildfires in January to a record number of Atlantic hurricanes through November, the true cost of the year’s climate-enhanced calamities was in fact far higher because most losses were uninsured.Not surprisingly, the burden fell disproportionately on poor nations, according to the annual tally from global NGO Christian Aid, entitled “Count the cost of 2020: a year of climate breakdown”.Only four percent of economic losses from climate-impacted extreme events in low-income countries were insured, compared with 60 percent in high-income economies, the report said, citing a study last month in The Lancet.“Whether floods in Asia, locusts in Africa, or storms in Europe and the Americas, climate change has continued to rage in 2020,” said Christian Aid’s climate policy lead, Kat Kramer.Extreme weather disasters, of course, have plagued humanity long before manmade global warming began to mess with the planet’s climate system.But more than a century of temperature and precipitation data, along with decades of satellite data on hurricanes and sea level rise, have left no doubt that Earth’s warming surface temperature is amplifying their impact.Massive tropical storms -- variously known as hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones -- are now more likely, for example, to be stronger, last longer, carry more water and wander beyond their historical range. 2020’s record-breaking 30 named Atlantic hurricanes -- with at least 400 fatalities and $41 billion in damages -- suggest the world could see more such storms as well. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) had to use Greek symbols after running out of letters in the Latin alphabet.- Extremes, not averages -Intense summer flooding in China and India, where the monsoon season brought abnormal amounts of rainfall for the second year running, are also consistent with projections on how climate will impact precipitation.Five of the most costly extreme weather events in 2020 were related to Asia’s unusually rainy monsoon. “The 2020 flood was one of the worst in the history of Bangladesh, more than a quarter of the country was under water,” said Shahjahan Mondal, director of the Institute of Flood and Water Management at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. Wildfires that scorched record areas in California, Australia and even Russia’s Siberian hinterland, much of it within the Arctic Circle, are also consistent with a warmer world, and a predicted to get worse as temperatures climb.The planet’s average surface temperature has gone up at least 1.1 degrees Celsius on average compared to the late 19th-century, with much of that warming occurring in the last half-century. The 2015 Paris Agreement enjoins the world’s nations to collectively cap global warming at “well below” 2C, and even 1.5C if feasible. A landmark report in 2018 from the UN’s IPCC climate science advisory panel showed that 1.5C is a safer threshold, but the likelihood of staying below it have grown vanishingly small, according to many experts.“Ultimately, the impacts of climate change will be felt via the extremes, and not average changes,” noted Sarah Perkins-Kilpatrick, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales’ Climate Change Research Centre. If the growing frequency and intensity of natural weather disasters is consistent with modelling projections, the new field of attribution science is now able to put a number on how much more likely such an event is due to global warming. The unprecedented wildfires that destroyed 20 percent of Australia’s forests and killed tens of millions of wild animals in late 2019 and early 2020, for example, were made at least 30 percent more likely, according to research led by Friederike Otto at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute.In Europe, meanwhile, the chance of deadly heatwaves occurring has risen nearly 100 fold compared to a century ago, according to recent research.“Heatwaves and floods which used to be ‘once in a century’ events are becoming more regular occurrences,” noted WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.mh/spm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2020-weather-disasters-boosted-by-climate-change-says-report/story-A6TAHz3cRlH8TSpCuUGSPP.html
28-12-2020||World||British tourists, forced into quarantine, sneak out of Swiss ski resort||Hundreds of British tourists forced into quarantine in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier fled in the night rather than seeing their holidays go downhill, the local municipality said Sunday.Around 200 of the 420 or so affected British tourists in the luxury Alpine ski station quit under the cover of darkness, the SonntagsZeitung newspaper reported.Switzerland’s ski resorts were set to boom with snow-seeking British tourists -- but a flight ban due to the new Covid-19 variant raging in England put those plans on ice.The drastic ruling by the Swiss government also included a 10-day retroactive quarantine for anyone who arrived from Britain since December 14, following the discovery of a new variant of the coronavirus which experts fear spreads more quickly.Some of the British tourists affected in Verbier left immediately, while others stuck it out for a bit before quitting.“Many of them stayed in quarantine for a day before they set off unnoticed under the cover of darkness,” Jean-Marc Sandoz, spokesman for the wider Bagnes municipality, told SZ.He called the whole situation “the worst week our community has ever experienced”.British tourists normally make up 21 percent of the Verbier clientele, and most start pouring in just after Christmas.Voted Switzerland’s best ski resort for the past two years, Verbier markets itself as offering “adrenaline-packed thrills, simple pleasures and a chic lifestyle”. The Verbier Tourist Office has been holding daily crisis cell meetings to try to deal with the ever-changing coronavirus picture.- Breakfast untouched -“It was when they saw the meal trays remained untouched that the hoteliers noticed that the customers had gone,” Sandoz told ATS news agency.He said that according to a Saturday survey of the ski resort’s hotels, fewer than 10 people would still be in quarantine.The rest would either have left or their quarantine time would have expired.“We can’t blame them. In most cases, quarantine was untenable. Imagine four people staying in a hotel room of 20 square metres,” Sandoz said.He said the tourists left feeling “a little angry with Switzerland” and with the sense of having been “trapped”.Flights between Switzerland and the two countries were halted on Monday, but the first outbound flights from Zurich to Britain resumed on Thursday.Two cases of the new British coronavirus variant have been detected in Switzerland and one in neighbouring Liechtenstein, the Swiss health ministry said Sunday.Two cases of the new South African variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, have also been detected, the ministry said.rjm/spm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-tourists-forced-into-quarantine-sneak-out-of-swiss-ski-resort/story-2F3anKkB228eFV5kI7ny7M.html
28-12-2020||World||Britain to restrict promotion of unhealthy food from April 2022||Britain will ban “buy one get one free” promotions for food high in fat, sugar or salt and free refills of sugary soft drinks in restaurants from April 2022, the government said on Monday, its latest step in its plan to tackle obesity and improve public health. The government says obesity is one of Britain’s biggest long-term public health problems with almost two-thirds of adults in England overweight and one in three children leaving primary school overweight or obese.The measures will also restrict where in a store promotions on such products can be advertised, and unhealthy promotions will not be allowed at checkouts, shop entrances or at the ends of aisles.“We are restricting promotions and introducing a range of measures to make sure the healthy choice is the easy choice. Creating an environment which helps everyone eat healthier foods more regularly is crucial to improving the health of the nation,” public health minister Jo Churchill said. Britain first proposed restricting “buy one get one free” deals on junk food in July, and also announced measures such as banning TV and online adverts for junk food before 9.00 p.m.Last month the government went further and proposed a total ban on online advertising of unhealthy food. Being overweight has been shown to increase the risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19 - a fact highlighted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson who has publicly talked about his own need to lose weight since being hospitalised with the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-restrict-promotion-of-unhealthy-food-from-april-2022/story-s6QkTZ3cDpq8MtpMmGr6AL.html
28-12-2020||World||Donald Trump signs massive measure funding government, Covid relief||President Donald Trump signed a $900 billion pandemic relief package Sunday, ending days of drama over his refusal to accept the bipartisan deal that will deliver long-sought cash to businesses and individuals and avert a federal government shutdown.The massive bill includes $1.4 trillion to fund government agencies through September and contains other end-of-session priorities such as money for cash-starved transit systems and an increase in food stamp benefits.Trump announced the signing in a statement Sunday night that spoke of his frustrations with the Covid-19 relief for including only $600 checks to most Americans instead of the $2,000 that his fellow Republicans rejected. He also complained about what he considered unnecessary spending by the government at large. But Trump’s eleventh-hour objections created turmoil because lawmakers had thought he was supportive of the bill, which had been negotiated for months with White House input.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“I will sign the Omnibus and Covid package with a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed,” Trump said in the statement.While the president insisted he would send Congress “a redlined version” with items to be removed under the rescission process, those are merely suggestions to Congress. The bill, as signed, would not necessarily be changed.Lawmakers now have breathing room to continue debating whether the relief checks should be as large as the president has demanded. The Democratic-led House supports the larger checks and is set to vote on the issue Monday, but it’s expected to be ignored by the Republican-held Senate where spending faces opposition.Republicans and Democrats swiftly welcomed Trump’s decision to sign the bill into law.“The compromise bill is not perfect, but it will do an enormous amount of good for struggling Kentuckians and Americans across the country who need help now,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “I thank the President for signing this relief into law.”Democrats are promising more aid to come once President-elect Joe Biden takes office, but Republicans are signaling a wait-and-see approach.In the face of growing economic hardship, spreading disease and a looming shutdown, lawmakers on Sunday had urged Trump to sign the legislation immediately, then have Congress follow up with additional aid. Aside from unemployment benefits and relief payments to families, money for vaccine distribution, businesses, cash-starved public transit systems and more is on the line. Protections against evictions also hung in the balance.“What the president is doing right now is unbelievably cruel,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. “So many people are hurting. ... It is really insane and this president has got to finally ... do the right thing for the American people and stop worrying about his ego.”Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayRepublican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said he understood that Trump “wants to be remembered for advocating for big checks, but the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire.”Toomey added: “So I think the best thing to do, as I said, sign this and then make the case for subsequent legislation.”The same point was echoed by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who’s criticized Trump’s pandemic response and his efforts to undo the election results. “I just gave up guessing what he might do next,” he said.Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said too much is at stake for Trump to “play this old switcheroo game.”“I don’t get the point,” he said. “I don’t understand what’s being done, why, unless it’s just to create chaos and show power and be upset because you lost the election.”Washington had been reeling since Trump turned on the deal. Fingers pointed at administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as lawmakers tried to understand whether they were misled about Trump’s position.“Now to be put in a lurch, after the president’s own person negotiated something that the president doesn’t want, it’s just — it’s surprising,” Kinzinger said.Kinzinger spoke on CNN’s “State of the Union,” and Hogan and Sanders on ABC’s “This Week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-signs-massive-measure-funding-government-covid-relief/story-uD02AZ1Y86rLSX0kXzvPyO.html
28-12-2020||World||Nashville blast suspect died in explosion, say police||The 63-year-old suspect in the bombing that rocked Nashville on Christmas Day morning was killed in the blast that destroyed his motor home and damaged more than 40 businesses, authorities said on Sunday.FBI forensic experts matched DNA samples recovered from the scene to that of Anthony Q. Warner, whose home in nearby Antioch was searched on Saturday by federal agents. “We’ve come to the conclusion that an individual named Anthony Warner is the bomber and he was present when the bomb went off and that he perished in the bombing,” Donald Cochran, US Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, told a news conference. Officials said it was too early in the investigation to discuss the suspect’s motives. Also Read: FBI at home of possible person of interest in Nashville bomb explosionWarner’s motor home, parked on a downtown street of Tennessee’s largest city, exploded at dawn on Friday moments after police responding to reports of gunfire noticed it and heard music and an automated message emanating from the vehicle warning of a bomb. The explosion in the heart of America’s country music capital injured three people and damaged businesses including an AT&T switching center, disrupting mobile, internet and TV services across central Tennessee and parts of four other states. As investigators followed up on hundreds of tips from members of the public, they searched Warner’s home on Saturday and visited a Nashville real estate agency where he had worked on computers. The owner of Fridrich & Clark Realty, Steve Fridrich, told the Tennessean newspaper that for four or five years Warner had come into the office roughly once a month to provide computer consulting services, until this month when Warner told the company in an email that he would no longer be working for them. He gave no reason, according to Fridrich. “He seemed very personable to us – this is quite out of character I think,” Fridrich told the newspaper. Also Read: Explosion in Nashville believed to be ‘intentional’, say policeNashville Mayor John Cooper said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” program on Sunday that local officials felt there had to be some connection between the bombing and the AT&T Inc building. Damage to the switching center was so extensive that AT&T teams had to drill access holes into the wreckage to connect generators to critical equipment, as well as pump three feet of water from the basement. The company said in a statement on Sunday that it made “significant progress” overnight and had restored power to four floors of the building.At a news conference on Sunday, five Nashville police officers who were on the scene early on Friday recalled the dramatic moments ahead of the explosion, as they scrambled to evacuate homes and buildings and called for a bomb squad, which was en route when the motor home blew up.“I was thrown forward, knocked to the ground,” officer Brenna Hosey told reporters about the moment of the explosion. “But I was able to catch myself, I was fine.” The officers have been hailed as heroes by city leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nashville-blast-suspect-died-in-explosion-police-say/story-WD43JzeVWz1kkNoq7dk6KK.html
28-12-2020||World||Shot will be effective against Covid-19 variant: AstraZeneca||The head of drugmaker AstraZeneca, which is developing a coronavirus vaccine widely expected to be approved by UK authorities this week, said Sunday that researchers believe the shot will be effective against a new variant of the virus driving a rapid surge in infections in Britain.AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot also told the Sunday Times that researchers developing its vaccine have figured out a “winning formula” making the jab as effective as rival candidates.Some have raised concern that the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being developed with Oxford University, may not be as good as the one made by Pfizer already being distributed in the UK and other countries. Partial results suggest that the AstraZeneca shot is about 70% effective for preventing illness from coronavirus infection, compared to the 95% efficacy reported by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.“We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody else,” Soriot said. “I can’t tell you more because we will publish at some point.”Britain’s government says its medicines regulator is reviewing the final data from AstraZeneca’s phase three clinical trials. The Times and others have reported that the green light could come by Thursday, and the vaccines can start to be rolled out for the UK public in the first week of January.Asked about the vaccine’s efficacy against the new variant of coronavirus spreading in the UK, Soriot said: “So far, we think the vaccine should remain effective. But we can’t be sure, so we’re going to test that.”British authorities have blamed the new virus variant for soaring infection rates across the country. They said the variant is much more transmittable, but stress there is no evidence it makes people more ill.Prime Minister Boris Johnson sounded an urgent alarm about the variant days before Christmas, saying the new version of the virus was spreading rapidly and that plans to travel and gather must be canceled for millions to curb the spread of the virus.Authorities have since put increasing areas of the country — affecting about 24 million people, or 43% of the population — in the strictest level of restrictions. Nonessential shops have closed, restaurants and pubs can only operate for takeout and no indoor socializing is allowed.Many countries swiftly barred travel from the UK, but cases of the new variant have since also been reported in a dozen locations around the world.Public health officials said on Dec. 24 that more than 600,000 people had received the first of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine.Britain recorded another 30,501 positive Covid-19 cases and a further 316 deaths on Sunday, bringing the country’s total death toll to 70,752. Many hospitals are under pressure, including the largest hospital in Wales, which issued an urgent appeal on Saturday for health care staff or medical students to help care for coronavirus patients in intensive care.The health board that runs University Hospital of Wales said Sunday that the situation has improved, but its critical care unit remains extremely busy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shot-will-be-effective-against-covid-19-variant-astrazeneca/story-P9tgpvzTbnMBwZekmSLNJP.html
28-12-2020||World||US government heads toward chaotic end to 2020 as Trump fights Congress||The US government headed toward a chaotic last few days of the year as President Donald Trump’s refusal to approve a $2.3 trillion financial package caused millions of jobless Americans to lose benefits and threatened to shut down federal agencies due to lack of funding.Trump, who leaves office on Jan. 20 after losing November’s election, came under pressure on Sunday from lawmakers on both sides to stop blocking the pandemic aid and government funding bill which was approved by Congress last week.The Republican president has demanded that Congress change the bill to increase the size of stimulus checks for struggling Americans to $2,000 from $600.Many economists agree that the financial aid in the bill should be higher to get the economy moving again but say that immediate support for Americans hit by coronavirus lockdowns is still urgently needed.Unemployment benefits being paid out to about 14 million people through pandemic programs lapsed on Saturday, but could be restarted until mid-March if Trump signs the bill.Adding to the uncertainty, the package includes $1.4 trillion in spending to fund government agencies. If Trump does not sign the legislation, then a partial government shutdown will begin on Tuesday that would put millions of government workers’ incomes at risk, unless Congress steps in with a stop-gap measure the president accepts.Republican Senator Pat Toomey told “Fox News Sunday” that Trump should approve the bill now, then push for more unemployment money later.“I understand the president would like to send bigger checks to everybody. I think what he ought to do is sign this bill and then make the case. Congress can pass another bill,” Toomey said.“You don’t get everything you want, even if you are the president of the United States,” he said. After months of wrangling, Republicans and Democrats agreed to the package last weekend, with the support of the White House. Trump stunned Republicans and Democrats alike when he later said he was unhappy with the massive bill, which provides $892 billion in coronavirus financial relief, despite offering no objections to the terms of the deal before Congress voted it through on Monday. Trump spent the Christmas holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. On Sunday morning, he seemed in no rush to try to resolve the standoff with Congress as he spent several hours at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. He has also complained that the bill gives too much money to special interests, cultural projects and foreign aid.A bipartisan group of lawmakers who were involved in crafting the relief bill urged Trump to sign it immediately. But, they added, if he is determined to veto it, he should do so quickly to “allow those in favor to act before it is too late.”“This act will show your support for the American people who are in need of emergency lifelines like food, shelter, unemployment benefits and small business relief during these challenging times,” they said in a statement.Senator Bernie Sanders said of the delay: “What the president is doing right now is unbelievably cruel.” “We are dealing with an unprecedented moment in American history. So many people are hurting,” he told ABC News’ “This Week” show. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, urged Trump to “finally do the right thing for the American people and stop worrying about his ego.” Benefit paymentsAmericans are living through a bitter holiday season amid a pandemic that has killed nearly 330,000 people in the United States, with a daily death toll now repeatedly well over 3,000 people, the highest since the pandemic began.The relief package also extends a moratorium on evictions that expires on Dec. 31, refreshes support for small business payrolls, provides funding to help schools re-open and aid for the transport industry and vaccine distribution.Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, said Trump’s refusal to sign the economic stimulus bill was difficult to fathom.“I don’t get the point,” Kinzinger told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Unless it’s just to create chaos, and show power, and be upset because you lost the election.”The US Congress, which normally is adjourned the last week of December, is preparing to return to work.The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives plans to vote on Monday on legislation providing one-time $2,000 checks to people, but Republican lawmakers are already concerned about the cost of the larger package.Without enactment of the broad relief and funding bill, the US government runs out of money at midnight Dec. 28. If the battle with Trump is not resolved by then, Congress must either pass a stopgap funding bill or federal agencies will not have money to fully operate beginning Tuesday. That scenario could be avoided if both the House and Senate pass a funding bill that is separate from the pandemic legislation and the president signs it by midnight Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-heads-toward-chaotic-end-to-2020-as-trump-fights-congress/story-PL0y2d9DLJ1XTVKU6R6g3N.html
28-12-2020||World||Despite hi-tech advances, many Europeans wary of taking Covid shot||Europe rolled out a huge Covid-19 vaccination drive on Sunday to try to rein in the coronavirus pandemic but many Europeans are sceptical about the speed at which the vaccines have been tested and approved and reluctant to have the shot.The European Union has secured contracts with a range of drugmakers including Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, for a total of more than two billion doses and has set a goal for all adults to be inoculated next year.But surveys have pointed to high levels of hesitancy towards inoculation in countries from France to Poland, with many used to vaccines taking decades to develop, not just months.“I don’t think there’s a vaccine in history that has been tested so quickly,” Ireneusz Sikorski, 41, said as he stepped out of a church in central Warsaw with his two children.“I am not saying vaccination shouldn’t be taking place. But I am not going to test an unverified vaccine on my children, or on myself.”Surveys in Poland, where distrust in public institutions runs deep, have shown fewer than 40% of people planning to get vaccinated, for now. On Sunday, only half the medical staff in a Warsaw hospital where the country’s first shot was administered had signed up.In Spain, one of Europe’s hardest-hit countries, German, a 28-year-old singer and music composer originally from Tenerife, also plans to wait for now.“No one close to me has had it (Covid-19). I’m obviously not saying it doesn’t exist because lots of people have died of it, but for now I wouldn’t have it (the vaccine).”A Christian Orthodox bishop in Bulgaria, where 45% of people have said they would not get a shot and 40% plan to wait to see if any negative side effects appear, compared Covid-19 to polio.“Myself, I am vaccinated against everything I can be,” Bishop Tihon told reporters after getting his shot, standing alongside the health minister in Sofia.He spoke about anxiety over polio before vaccination became available in the 1950s and 1960s.“We were all trembling in fear of catching polio. And then we were overjoyed,” he said. “Now, we have to convince people. It’s a pity.”GREAT LEAP FORWARDThe widespread hesitancy does not appear to take into account the scientific developments in recent decades. The traditional method of creating vaccines – introducing a weakened or dead virus, or a piece of one, to stimulate the body’s immune system – takes over a decade on average, according to a 2013 study. One pandemic flu vaccine took over eight years while a hepatitis B vaccine was nearly 18 years in the making.Moderna’s vaccine, based on the so-called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology, went from gene sequencing to the first human injection in 63 days.“We’ll look back on the advances made in 2020 and say: ‘That was a moment when science really did make a leap forward’,” said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, which is backed by the Wellcome Trust.The Pfizer/BioNTech shot has been linked with a few cases of severe allergic reactions as it has been rolled out in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has not turned up any serious long-term side effects in clinical trials. Independent pollster Alpha Research said its recent survey suggested that fewer than one in five Bulgarians from the first groups to be offered the vaccine - frontline medics, pharmacists, teachers and nursing home staff - planned to volunteer to get a shot.An IPSOS survey of 15 countries published on Nov. 5 showed then that 54% of French would have a Covid vaccine if one were available. The figure was 64% in Italy and Spain, 79% in Britain and 87% in China.A later IFOP poll - which did not have comparative data for other countries - showed that only 41% people in France would take the shot.In Sweden, where public trust in authorities runs high like elsewhere across the Nordics, more than two people in three want to be immunised. Still, some say no. “If someone gave me 10 million euro, I wouldn’t take it,” Lisa Renberg, 32, said on Wednesday.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki urged Poles on Sunday to sign up for vaccination, saying the herd immunity effect depended on them.Critics have said Warsaw’s nationalist leaders have been too accepting of anti-vaccination attitudes in the past in an effort to garner conservative support.

28-12-2020||World||US Army sergeant charged in Illinois bowling alley shooting that killed 3||A US Army special forces sergeant based in Florida has been charged in an apparently random shooting at an Illinois bowling alley that left three people dead and three wounded, authorities said Sunday.Winnebago County State’s Attorney J. Hanley said Duke Webb, 37, has been charged with three counts of murder and three counts of first-degree attempted murder in the shooting at Don Carter Lanes, in Rockford, on Saturday evening. While no bowling is currently allowed due to state-imposed coronavirus restrictions, a bar linked to the business was legally open.Webb was taken into custody shortly after the shooting at around 7 p.m., Rockford Police Chief Dan O’Shea said at a news conference Sunday morning.“I am very confident the officers that were on the scene in the building were able to stop further violence,” O’Shea said.He said the three who died were all men, aged 73, 65 and 69, but did not provide names.Additionally, he said, a 14-year-old boy was shot in the face and airlifted to a hospital in Madison in stable condition, and a 16-year-old girl who was shot in the shoulder was treated at a hospital and released. A 62-year-old man underwent surgery overnight after suffering multiple gunshot wounds and is in critical condition, the chief said.The suspect has no known ties to the victims, O’Shea said.“We believe this was a completely random act, and there is no prior meeting or any kind of relationship between the suspect and any of the victims in this case,” O’Shea said. He did not provide information on what led up to the shooting.The US Army said Webb is a Special Forces Assistant Operations and Intelligence Sergeant assigned to 3rd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne), located at Camp Bull Simons, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. He joined the Army in 2008 and was on leave Saturday.“We are shocked and saddened to learn about this tragic event and our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and wounded,” Col. John W. Sannes, commander of 7th Special Forces Group, said in a statement.The bowling alley was closed at the time of the shooting, in accordance with restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, O’Shea said. But a bar upstairs was open. The chief said the upstairs venue has double doors that open to the outside, ensuring the bar is in compliance with Illinois’ Covid-19 mitigation guidance.Up to 25 people were at Don Carter Lanes when the shooting happened, but most of them escaped or hid, O’Shea said. He declined to say whether the shootings happened in the bar or elsewhere in the building, saying those details would come out in court. The teens who were wounded were picking up food at the carryout section of the bowling alley, he said.He said the suspect tried to conceal his weapons before his arrest, and that he was apprehended without officers firing a shot.“Most of the incident was captured on surveillance video from inside the business,” O’Shea said, adding that investigators are studying captured images.O’Shea said investigators are in touch with the Army. He didn’t explain why the Florida man was in Illinois. The Army said it will provide full assistance in the police investigation.The Rockford Register Star reported that 2020 has been the deadliest year on record for homicides in the city of about 170,000 residents about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of Chicago. Thirty-five people have been killed in the city this year, breaking the previous record of 31 in 1996.“As we come to the end of this most difficult year and we look ahead at this New Year upon us, we know that this type of violence needs to stop,” Mayor Tom McNamara said. “... And today, with the eyes of the country upon us, we need to show as Rockfordians how we respond to an incident such as this, as one Rockford, supporting one another.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-army-sergeant-charged-in-illinois-bowling-alley-shooting-that-killed-3/story-SOzUdo8rz1uQQIyeV3DPSK.html
28-12-2020||World||Chinese official holds talks on Nepal crisis||A senior official of the Chinese Communist Party on Sunday met Nepal’s President Bidya Devi Bhandari as part of efforts to resolve a rift between factions of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP). Guo Yezhou, vice minister in the international department of the CPC, is the most senior foreign official to visit Nepal since Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli last Sunday dissolved parliament and called for early parliamentary election.Oli’s shock move triggered deep political unrest and street protests in Nepal and left the NCP on the verge of a split. Guo, who personally knows all senior NCP leaders, is expected to meet Oli, former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali, leaders of the party faction led by Prachanda, and Janata Samajwadi Party leader Baburam Bhattarai. His visit follows unsuccessful efforts by Chinese envoy Hou Yanqi to resolve the impasse. Guo will assess the situation and encourage NCP leaders to seek “some kind of common ground for party unity”, The Kathmandu Post reported citing political leaders. China’s efforts are in marked contrast to the position taken by India on Oli’s decision to dissolve parliament and call snap elections. New Delhi has said this is an internal matter that should be handled in keeping with Nepal’s democratic processes. China has poured millions of dollars into Nepal as aid, and infrastructure investment as part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative.

28-12-2020||World||As end approaches, Trump gets doses of flattery, finality||President Donald Trump’s administration is ending how it began, with over-the-top declarations of praise for the chief executive.But now the flattery is mixed with a sense of finality as key people in the president’s orbit are beginning to turn the page and acknowledge his defeat. Trump himself keeps to the Oval Office, still fighting the Election Day results and offering scant acknowledgement of the death and suffering Americans are bearing in the darkest hours of the Covid-19 pandemic.In a week when the Electoral College made official President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, Trump remained out of sight, staying late in the Oval Office and working the phones and television remote in his private dining area just steps from the Resolute Desk.While he made not one public appearance, some of those who have been his most influential allies and loyal defenders gave up the fight, letting the president down as gently as possible.Attorney General William Barr offered his resignation last Monday after weeks of tension with Trump brought about an early exit from his post. Long seen as one of Trump’s most supportive Cabinet members, Barr in recent weeks and months had drawn Trump’s wrath for not supporting the president’s baseless claims of election fraud or for not publicly pursuing an investigation into Biden’s son Hunter.But when Barr stepped aside, he did so with flowery language reminiscent of the compliments that were tossed as verbal bouquets at Trump during early Cabinet meetings.“Your record is all the more historic because you accomplished it in the face of relentless, implacable resistance,” Barr wrote in his resignation letter. Trump promptly tweeted it out, adding his own words of praise for the attorney general.In the six weeks since his defeat by Biden, Trump has been increasingly disengaged from his job. The virus has killed more than 300,000 Americans and is now claiming more than 3,000 lives a day, but the president has offered barely a word about the deaths or the development of the vaccine that could bring an end to the pandemic.At the same time, he has relentlessly tweeted conspiracy theories and false claims about the election, incorrectly insisting it was stolen from him while taking steps to undermine the Biden administration before it begins. Most Republicans went along, refusing to push Trump to stop or work with the president-elect.Many in the GOP took their cues from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who refused to stand up to Trump, instead making the calculation that an outraged Republican base — and an angry president — could help produce victories in a pair of January runoff races in Georgia that will dictate control of the Senate. But this past week, even McConnell, R-Ky., bent to reality, declaring that the Electoral College “had spoken” and that Biden was the victor.McConnell’s acknowledgement that Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris had won came only after a long public recap of Trump’s accomplishments on the Senate floor. McConnell spoke about Trump for nine minutes, declaring that “many of us hoped that the presidential election would yield a different result.” He discussed Biden for one minute.Some more of Trump’s fiercest allies also appeared to give credence, albeit briefly, to the electoral result. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a cable television appearance that Trump was in strong position for a possible 2024 campaign — a roundabout acknowledgement that he won’t be president come next year.Others close to Trump also marked the looming end. His daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump began tweeted photos of moments throughout the term. His son Eric Trump and his family posed for photos just outside the Oval Office. West Wing staffers put up photos on Instagram of White House Christmas parties, and most of those pictured weren’t wearing masks.Vice President Mike Pence continued his role as Trump’s biggest hype man, even as the cheerleading came with a whiff of nostalgia. Pence in a ceremony Friday marked the first anniversary of the US Space Force, which he framed as a major part of Trump’s legacy.But with Trump largely in hiding, it fell to Pence to make a public show of meeting with those distributing the vaccine. And on Friday, he was the one who rolled up his sleeves and took a public shot in the arm as part of a campaign to convince Americans the vaccine is safe.Trump has been happy to bask in praise throughout his presidency. His Cabinet meetings at times resembled “Dear Leader” sessions in authoritarian nations where officials gush compliments for the man in charge.The tone was set at the president’s first Cabinet meeting, in June 2017, when the only subject for debate appeared to whether Trump was a great president or the greatest. With the media invited to watch, Trump extolled the achievements of his young administration, asserting that he had accomplished more than any president in his first six months — with “few exceptions,” like President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Pence that day declared his job was “the greatest privilege of my life.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he was “thrilled,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry gave his “hats off” to Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross offered thanks “for the opportunity” to work for the president.Perhaps the strongest words came from chief of staff Reince Priebus: “On behalf of the entire senior staff around you, Mr. President, we thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you’ve given us to serve your agenda.”On Wednesday, Trump convened his 25th and perhaps final Cabinet meeting. Much had changed.Several top officials were not there, including Barr, whose resignation was pending; acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who had tested positive for Covid-19; and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was quarantining because he had been exposed to someone with the virus.Whether there was effusive praise of Trump remains unknown.The president did not let the media in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-end-approaches-trump-gets-doses-of-flattery-finality/story-xNjv5MsglKIDULKtuH0BwN.html
